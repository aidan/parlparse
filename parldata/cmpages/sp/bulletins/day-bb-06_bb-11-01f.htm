<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#fend">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5067</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Homeless International Appeal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the important work of Homeless International, which gives support to partner organisations throughout Africa and Asia that are working with slum communities to reduce poverty and improve living conditions; welcomes Homeless International&rsquo;s &quot;Scotland for Sanitation&quot; appeal, which aims to raise funds to assist slum dwellers in India and Malawi with training and the planning and construction of sanitation blocks; congratulates Perthshire Housing Association on its recent fund-raising activities which saw &pound;3,000 raised for the appeal, and congratulates all groups and organisations throughout Scotland that have contributed towards the appeal.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5066<> </strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Scottish Arctic Convoy Medal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the heroism of the men and women of the arctic convoys during the Second World War, from 1941 to 1945, in maintaining convoys of merchant and Navy ships delivering vital supplies to their Russian allies following the German invasion; notes that, despite the loss of almost 3,000 sailors and merchant seamen, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government is still to give them the proper recognition they deserve by commissioning a wartime medal in honour of their sacrifice and determination; notes the anger of many arctic convoy veterans, such as Keith Dyble of Penicuik, who feel that the awarding of a small arctic badge in place of a medal is an insult to the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defending freedom and democracy in this country, and believes that the Scottish government should commission an official medal and posthumously award such a medal to the surviving relatives of the many who perished in those icy seas.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5065</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Denmark</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the country of Denmark, with a population of five million, on hosting the World Gymnastic Championships in Aarhus from 13 to 21 October 2006; notes that the games were a great success and a tremendous springboard for Denmark&rsquo;s potential bid to host any future Olympic Games, and looks forward to the day when Scotland is able to show the same level of sporting ambition as the independent nation of Denmark.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5064</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Make School Make Sense</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that children with autistic spectrum disorder have the potential to learn, achieve and make a positive contribution to school life; is concerned that many children with autism find it difficult to access an appropriate education; welcomes the National Autistic Society Scotland&rsquo;s &quot;make school make sense&quot; campaign to improve educational provision for children with autism; supports the campaign&rsquo;s demands that every child with autism should have local access to a diverse range of mainstream and specialist educational provision, that all teachers should expect to teach a child with autism and must receive appropriate training to best support their needs, and that all schools should be autism-friendly schools which promote and provide a positive environment for children with autism now and in the future, and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement these demands, so that all children with autism have access to the education to which they are entitled.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5063</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Executive Budget Review</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to publish the Howat review of the Executive&rsquo;s budget before the conclusion of Stage 1 of this year&rsquo;s budget process.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5062</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5059</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Designation of Lead Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Justice 1 Committee be designated as the lead committee in consideration of the Rights of Relatives to Damages (Mesothelioma) (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5058</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Scottish Commissioner for Human Rights (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Scottish Commissioner for Human Rights Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when the meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5057</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>The Cost of Repairs Following Police Drugs Operations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the active efforts of the police, such as Operation Triplicate, to target and arrest drug dealers but suggests that it is unjust in such operations that the council tenants in the local area should have to meet the approximately &pound;400 per door replacement cost which, in a recent case, fell on Inverclyde Council&rsquo;s housing revenue account and that, instead, the whole body of council tax payers should meet the cost through the Strathclyde Joint Police Board.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5056</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Czech Republic Bans Youth Movement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its great concern at the decision of the Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic to ban the Communist Youth Union (KSM), the youth wing of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), on Monday 16 October 2006; notes that this decision was made despite a large international and domestic campaign against the prohibition of the KSM undertaken by trade unionists and student organisations among other groups and including a petition signed by thousands of Czech citizens; is further concerned that this took place only a few days before the Czech senate elections; believes that this act is in contravention of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights which guarantees freedom of speech and association; further believes that the Czech Interior Ministry&rsquo;s claim that the KSM&rsquo;s policies calling for a socialist transformation of society are incompatible with the country&rsquo;s constitution is invalid and considers that the constitution is in fact superceded by international human rights legislation, and calls on the government of the Czech Republic to overturn this undemocratic ban immediately.</p>
<p>Supported by: Colin Fox<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5055</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>The Financial Powers of the Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the need for an open, inclusive and objective debate about the financial powers that it requires to have in order to maximise accountability, efficient government, economic growth, public services, infrastructure development and good social outcomes in Scotland and further encourages the business community, the trade unions, the public sector, the voluntary sector, academia and wider civic Scotland to participate in this debate, the objective of which must be to make Scotland a more prosperous country, able to deliver social justice to its people.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5054</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Dave Petrie be appointed as the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party substitute on the Health Committee.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5053</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Michael Matheson be appointed to replace Mr Stewart Maxwell on the Justice 2 Committee.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5052</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Mr Stewart Maxwell be appointed to replace Michael Matheson on the Enterprise and Culture Committee.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5051</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Social Work Inspections (Scotland) Regulations 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5050</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Right of Tenure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the fact that, despite recent legislation on housing, there still remain a number of houses within the private-rented sector from which the tenants can be served, without warning, with an eviction notice by the owner despite the fact that, for example, they were born in the house 70 years ago and have stayed there all their lives under the assumption that, as long as they paid their rent, they would have the peace of mind and security of the right of tenure.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5049</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Support Cuban Women Against Blockade</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with very great concern the economic, financial and commercial blockade on Cuba being intensified by the Bush plan; acknowledges that this continuing blockade has fostered solidarity among Cuban women within the family, the community and the social environment; further notes the international solidarity from friends and women&rsquo;s organisations in the United States of America and other countries which reject the US administration&rsquo;s hostility, and recognises the indomitable spirit of the Federation of Cuban Women in dealing with the shortages.</p>
<p>Supported by: Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-5045*#*</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Community Health</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the great importance of community health projects in tackling the health problems that our nation faces; believes that community, independent and voluntary sector organisations addressing health inequalities play a crucial role in meeting the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s targets on health improvement; in particular, congratulates the Edinburgh Community Food Initiative on 10 years of working to remove barriers to a healthy diet by consistently developing innovative and effective programmes such as the Snack Attack project; notes that the future of this project, like many others, depends on its ability to continue to identify, secure and manage a wide variety of short-term funding sources; notes with concern the sense of fragility across the sector due to the uncertainty inherent in the funding system, and considers that the Executive should show much greater support to community health projects and act to reduce the financial insecurity that they are forced to face.</p>
