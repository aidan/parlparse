          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1341</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Major Events and Festivals in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament recognises Scotland's excellent track record of creating and hosting world-class events and festivals; recognises the great benefits that events and festivals can bring throughout Scotland, such as boosting our economy, promoting the international profile of Scotland as a place to visit and in which to live, work and invest and encouraging Scots, particularly young people, to participate in sport and culture; welcomes the success achieved by EventScotland in its first year of operation in realising the potential of Scotland as a world-class destination for events, and congratulates the many organisers of festivals throughout Scotland in their success in getting communities involved in these festivals and attracting visitors to Scotland.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1340</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Skills and Continued Learning</strong>-That the Parliament supports Scottish Executive initiatives, such as the Scottish Union Learning Fund, the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework and the Determined to Succeed programme, to ensure the provision of effective skills and learning opportunities that will allow more people to play a full and productive role in the workplace and in the community; recognises the vital contribution that skills and learning make in helping to stimulate sustainable economic growth and to close the opportunity gap, and congratulates all those involved in the Modern Apprenticeship programme, which has exceeded its target of having 30,000 apprentices in training two years ahead of schedule.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1339</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Firefighters' Dispute</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the breakdown of the national June 2003 agreement reached by fire service employers and the Fire Brigades Union, which brought the 2002-03 national dispute to an end; hopes that both parties remain within the parameters of the June 2003 agreement in order for the agreement to be progressed and completed; hopes that the fire service employers recognise the efforts of firefighters and emergency fire control operators in the modernisation process and consequently pay firefighters and emergency fire control operators their promised pay increases, and hopes that, by the Fire Brigades Union's reconvened annual conference in Southport in June, agreement can be reached between the fire service employers and the Fire Brigades Union that allows this long-running dispute to be drawn to a satisfactory conclusion, sees the process of true improvements in the fire service continuing and ensures that firefighters and emergency fire control operators are rewarded to a level that fully recognises the many skills they have acquired.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1338</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Quagmire in Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament notes the assassination of Izzedine Salim, head of the United States-appointed Governing Council of Iraq; believes that US, British and coalition troops are fighting an unwinnable war in Iraq, and further believes that, with reports indicating a further commitment of British troops including Scottish regiments, an opportunity must be given for it to debate the current international situation in relation to Iraq and reports of human rights abuses committed by coalition troops.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1337</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Closure of Royal Mail Sorting Office in Broxburn</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the decision by Royal Mail to close its Broxburn sorting office; believes that this decision is driven by pressures of privatisation and will inevitably lead to a poorer mail delivery service for people in the Broxburn area; notes the strike action taken by staff in Broxburn, and applauds their efforts to persuade Royal Mail to maintain a local sorting office in that area.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1336</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Eurovision Song Contest</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned to note the successive failures of the British Eurovision song contest entry in recent years; believes that voting across Europe is related to the views of European people on Her Majesty's Government's role in the war on Iraq and on other issues, and further believes that a UK entry is unlikely to succeed as long as Her Majesty's Government continues with current foreign policy, that a Scottish entry is less likely to be tainted and that Scotland should be entitled to a separate Eurovision song contest entry.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1335#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Recognition of British Sign Language</strong>-That the Parliament notes that British Sign Language (BSL) is used by around 2 million people within the United Kingdom; notes that it has not, to date, been recognised as a minority language by the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to Her Majesty's Government and European Union in support of the recognition of BSL.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1334</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the draft Health Professions (Operating Department Practitioners and Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2004 be approved.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-1327.1</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Sustainable Management of Scotland's Marine Environment</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1327) in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports continued involvement by the Scottish Executive in the development of a European marine strategy and in OSPAR; notes that the regulation and management of Scotland's coast and seas is fragmented with no coherent regulatory or planning framework and that, despite Scotland's unique variety of marine wildlife, there is no legal basis for designating and managing areas for nationally important marine habitats and species; believes that there is a need for legislation to deliver integrated management of all aspects of Scotland's marine environment; welcomes the consultation on the establishment of a national coastline park and marine national park, and, in recognising the importance of improving the co-ordination of activity to support, and develop a mechanism for, the future good governance and sustainable management of Scotland's marine environment, calls for control of all matters impacting on the marine environment that are currently reserved, including the Crown Estate Commission's ownership of the seabed, to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1327.2</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Sustainable Management of Scotland's Marine Environment</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1327) in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;; endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;, but believes that the consolidation of marine legislation is only desirable if it can be achieved while protecting economic and social stakeholders, particularly in the fishing, aquaculture, energy and tourism sectors.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1327.3</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Sustainable Management of Scotland's Marine Environment</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1327) in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;in its recent&quot; to end and insert &quot;starting with its recent consultation paper; notes the need for encouragement and support to community initiatives seeking sustainable local management of marine resources; supports the Executive's objectives of improving the co-ordination of activity to support, and develop a strategy for, the future good governance and sustainable management of Scotland's marine environment, and calls on the Executive to, as a first step, establish a marine national park by the end of 2006.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1326.1</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Health Issues</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1326) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;the current&quot; to end and insert &quot;demand for healthcare can never be fully met; recognises that prevention of illness and promotion of good health is crucial, and that this cannot be delivered by the NHS, but requires action by all those public bodies whose decisions shape our lifestyle, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that all public bodies have a health-promoting agenda, so that the people of Scotland can live healthy lives in a healthy environment.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1326.2</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Health Issues</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1326) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;the current&quot; to end and insert &quot;the productivity and efficiency of NHSScotland is declining, and therefore calls on Audit Scotland to undertake a full root-and-branch inquiry into why the performance of NHSScotland has not improved given the substantial increase in funding.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1326.3</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Health Issues</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1326) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;, despite a&quot; to end and insert &quot;Scotland's health and quality of health services are not improving in relation to the wealth available in the fourth biggest economy in the world; further notes that the NHS has insufficient core capacity and insufficient core staffing of establishments that have increased agency, overtime and locum costs; is concerned that NHS boards have substantial deficits and plan unacceptable reductions in service provision and jobs; believes that resources that should be directly spent on patient care are diverted to ever-increasing profits for private consortia, private health providers of all kinds and pharmaceutical companies; notes that the Scottish Executive and NHS boards have repeatedly failed to strategically plan effectively; believes that all forms of privatisation in the NHS such as PFI/PPP and contracting from private providers should be stopped; further believes that the pharmaceutical companies should be brought into public ownership or, in the meantime, at the very least, the Executive should urgently introduce a drug-pricing regime that will control and deflate drug company profits, and believes that capacity and staffing establishments need to be systematically enlarged.&quot;</P>
          <P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1326.4</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Health Issues</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1326) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;commends staff across the NHS for the quality improvements achieved over the last five years, the new forms of activity such as nurse-led clinics and the progress being made towards a six-month maximum wait for in-patient treatment by the end of 2005; notes that progress has been made at the same time as the working hours of medical and other staff have been brought into line with accepted norms; commends recent initiatives to tackle long out-patient waiting times, and supports further reform of NHSScotland through the development of community health partnerships and managed clinical networks, an increasing emphasis on involving patients and learning from their experiences and a sustained drive on health improvement and the prevention of ill-health in partnership with other agencies.&quot;</P>
