            notes the need to combat HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination

            further notes that there are now over 42 million people living with

            concerns of local communities about the proliferation of wind farm 
            planning applications; believes that the Scottish Executive must ensure

            remote and rural communities from community and crofting-owned renewable 
            energy developments are realised, and therefore calls on the Executive 
            to support Highlands and Islands Enterprise in their efforts to develop 
            a Highlands and Islands community energy company to support communities 
            in developing their own wind turbines and other renewable energy projects.</P>

            scale trials and the GM dialogue have been fully evaluated, and notes

            recognises that it has the potential to deliver a better deal for 
            Scottish agriculture and for rural Scotland as a whole than the current 
            arrangements; believes that the range of agri-environmental measures

            be of benefit to all those involved in Scottish agriculture as well 
            as all those who live and work in rural Scotland, but urges the Scottish 
            Executive to ensure that decisions about the various flexibilities

            offers to achieve good agricultural and environmental conditions and 
            support rural development; notes the objectives of the Scottish Executive's 
            document <em>Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</em>, but recognises
