          <p><strong>*S1M-3144</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Glasgow Housing 
            Association and European Commission Rules</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            expresses its concern that the transfer of Glasgow council housing 
            to the Glasgow Housing Association may breach European Commission 
            rules on state aid; notes the inadequate answers given so far on this 
            matter by the Scottish Executive, and calls for an early ministerial 
            statement on the issue.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3143#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: Promoting Scotland's 
            Industrial Heritage</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that 
            our industrial heritage is of interest to many people from other countries 
            as well as Scots, and believes that the Scottish Executive should 
            look at ways to market ex-industrial areas throughout Scotland such 
            as Coatbridge and give consideration to exploring the idea of state-run 
            hotels, along the line of Spanish paradors, where listed buildings 
            could be restored to provide accommodation for tourists thus allowing 
            itineraries to include non-traditional tourist facilities such as 
            Summerlee Heritage Park in Coatbridge which is home to the only working 
            trams in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3142</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Conservative 
            Support for Creationist Schools</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes with astonishment the remarks made by Mr Murdo Fraser MSP, the 
            Deputy Education Spokesperson for the Tory Party in Scotland, on BBC 
            Scotland Television on 17 May 2002, in which he expressed support 
            for groups promoting &quot;creationist&quot; views on science running 
            state schools in Scotland; notes that members of such groups totally 
            reject evolution and have nothing to do with the great religious faiths 
            in Scotland and the wider world; further notes that creationists have 
            taken control of a state-funded secondary school in Gateshead, where 
            they are undermining the teaching of science; rejects the foolish 
            position of the Tory Party in Scotland, which seems now to be not 
            only against devolution but also evolution, and asserts that misguided 
            creationist groups should not be placed in charge of children&#146;s 
            education in Scotland. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3141</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Larkhall to Milngavie 
            Rail Line</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the comments of 
            South Lanarkshire councillor David McLachlan, vice-convener of Strathclyde 
            Passenger Transport (SPT), in relation to the Larkhall to Milngavie 
            rail line that &quot;all we need is the Parliament to give us the 
            power to head up the project&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to make a decision over whether the British Railways (No.3) Order 
            Confirmation Act 1994 can be transferred to SPT or whether a new Bill 
            needs to be introduced into the Parliament to allow for this link, 
            which is vital to the future economic prosperity of Larkhall, Stonehouse 
            and Leshmahagow, to be progressed.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3138</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Congratulations to 
            Linlithgow Rose</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">congratulates 
            Linlithgow Rose junior football club on winning the Scottish Junior 
            Cup for the first time since *1965*; acknowledges the hard work of 
            the players, the backroom staff and the committee in building this 
            success, and congratulates the club&#146;s supporters on helping to 
            make Sunday a celebration of junior football. </a></p>
