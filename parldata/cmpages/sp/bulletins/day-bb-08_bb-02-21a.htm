<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-1386</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>The Future of Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Government to establish a review of the structure and operations of Scottish Water with a remit to consider whether the current model delivers best value for taxpayers and customers, to consider alternative models, including mutualisation, and to report back to the Parliament on the conclusions of the review in such time as to allow any changes to the structure of Scottish Water to be in place prior to commencement of the next spending review period in 2011. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-1386.1</strong> <strong>Des McNulty: The Future of Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1386) in the name of Derek Brownlee, leave out from &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the retention of Scottish Water under public ownership and in that context calls on the Scottish Government to keep under review the structure and operations of Scottish Water, the regulatory arrangements for the water industry to ensure that the interests of domestic and business customers are properly protected and alternative public sector models, including mutualisation, and to report back to the Parliament in due course.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-1386.2</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur: The Future of Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1386) in the name of Derek Brownlee, after &quot;mutualisation&quot; insert &quot;but excluding privatisation&quot;. </p>

  </blockquote>
</DIR></DIR><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Prisons Policy&mdash;
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-1385</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Prisons Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the importance of a criminal justice system in which the public has confidence and which upholds the fundamental right of the public to a secure and safe society; notes with concern the current pressure on prison capacity; believes that the courts must be supported in sentencing disposals and, where that includes custody, believes that it is the obligation of the government to ensure that adequate custodial provision exists; views with concern deficiencies in the prison regime to address drug addiction, and deplores the Scottish Government&rsquo;s hostility to deploying the private sector in new prison provision. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-1385.2</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Prisons Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1385) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from first &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;that, while the offending rate has been falling, the number of people in prison currently stands at record levels and that Scotland has one of the highest imprisonment rates in the world; welcomes the McLeish Commission into Penal Policy and recognises that, in the case of serious and dangerous individuals, custody is the only appropriate punishment, and notes that the Scottish Government is committed to three new prisons and has increased investment in the prisons estate to an average of &pound;120 million a year.&quot; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</p>
      <p><strong>S3M-1385.2.1</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Prisons Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-1385.2) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, insert at end &quot;recognises the need to reduce the number of low-level receptions into custody for short-term sentences by focusing on tough community sentences that pay back into the community for the harm caused; further notes the need to improve treatment for those with mental health problems and drug and alcohol addictions, thus addressing the underlying causes of offending, and calls on the Scottish Government to build on schemes which provide offenders with education and skills training for work, not crime.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></DIR><strong>S3M-1385.1</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Prisons Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1385) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the crucial role of the prison system in the criminal justice system and its role in dealing with a range of offenders; believes that only robust community sentences will provide a real alternative to custody for the Scottish courts and that this requires real investment in community sentences and community disposals<font color="#0000ff">;</font> believes that short-term sentences are appropriate for certain types of offenders; further believes that urgent measures should be taken to provide real and appropriate alternatives to prison models for women offenders to reduce the female prison population; calls on the Scottish Government to report to the Parliament on the progress of the planned new prisons which could alleviate overcrowding in the prison estate, and further believes that sentencing policy should be clear<font color="#0000ff">,</font> transparent and understood by the general public and should be driven by an underlying policy to protect the public from harm.&quot; </DIR></DIR>
