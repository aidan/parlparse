  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2635.3</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Scudamore Report into Foot and Mouth Disease</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2635) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;to minimise&quot; to end and insert &quot;such as the role that local abattoirs might play and the unique circumstances of Scotland&rsquo;s islands; notes however the continuing difficulties experienced by the pig industry, and calls on the Scottish Government to take urgent action to support the Scottish pig industry and to consider further action to minimise the potential future disruption to the Scottish livestock industry.&quot; </p>
