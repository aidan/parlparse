          <P><strong>*S2M-994#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Report on Responses to Prostitution</strong>-That the Parliament notes and welcomes the report <em>A Critical Examination of Responses to Prostitution in Four Countries</em>, commissioned by Glasgow Routes Out Social Inclusion Partnership; welcomes the contribution it makes to the debate on strategies to tackle prostitution; recognises that the report provides evidence that legalisation or regulation of prostitution does not create any safer an environment for women involved in prostitution and that the Swedish approach, where there are legal penalties for those men who create the demand for prostitutes, offers a realistic alternative; welcomes the report's evidence that highlights the importance both of protecting women and of challenging those men who use prostitutes; confirms that prostitution is a form of abuse and that all strategies must understand the importance of recognising and tackling this abuse, and believes that the Scottish Executive Working Group on Prostitution should take proper account of this report's findings in its deliberations.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-993</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Bill - Business Motion</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that, during the Stage 3 proceedings of the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Bill, debate on each part of&nbsp;those proceedings shall be brought to a conclusion by the time-limits indicated (each time-limit being calculated from when Stage 3 begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when the meeting of the Parliament is suspended or otherwise not in progress)</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-992</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>NHS Fife and NHS Tayside &quot;Keep Yer Shirt On&quot; Project</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates NHS Fife and NHS Tayside on their successful skin cancer awareness project &quot;Keep Yer Shirt On&quot;, designed to raise the awareness in children of the need to protect skin from ultraviolet (UV) light and, in particular, welcomes their partnership with the relevant councils to encourage pre-school establishments to adopt sun awareness policies which include the prevention of future cases of skin cancer through the continued education of young people on the risks of exposure to UV light.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-991</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>A New Order for Ferguson Shipbuilders of Port Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the management and workforce of Ferguson Shipbuilders, Port Glasgow, for winning the contract to build a vessel for the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency; believes that ministers and the officials of the agency, by placing this important order with the Port Glasgow shipyard, have shown a commendable confidence in the men and women who are employed at the yard, who rightly have an excellent reputation for the building of first-class, specialist ships, and looks forward to the yard securing other such orders in the years to come.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-990</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Ofgem Scottish Office</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes Ofgem's recent announcement that the Ofgem office in Scotland is central to its efforts to protect the interests of Scottish gas and electricity consumers and calls on Ofgem to work with the Scottish Executive to ensure that Scotland's targets for renewable energy, energy efficiency and fuel poverty can be met at the earliest opportunity and at the lowest cost to consumers.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-988</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Higher Education in the Borders</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the very high standard of education provided in the Scottish Borders and the high percentage of school leavers that enter into further and higher education; welcomes the applications for major investment in the further education sector for the redevelopment of Borders College, which will provide state-of-the-art facilities in Galashiels, Hawick and wider access in all other parts of the Borders; congratulates the college and other partners, including Heriot-Watt University, on their partnership working; expresses serious concern, however, that Heriot-Watt University may wish to withdraw textile design courses from the Netherdale Campus and relocate these to Edinburgh, and expresses further concern that such a move would be wholly detrimental to the partnership working that has developed and damaging to the creation of a centre of excellence in education in Netherdale for both further and higher education, founded on 130 years of provision of training and education in textiles.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-982*#*</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Twentieth Anniversary of the Miners' Strike</strong>-That the Parliament recalls the historic events of the 1984-85 miners' strike which began 20 years ago this month; believes that, looking back, it was not only the most bitter political division in post-war Britain but also a turning point in politics, and believes that the defeat of the National Union of Mineworkers, after a brave and heroic struggle, ushered in two decades of unremitting attack on the rights of working people, their trade unions, their employment rights and their communities and had far-reaching political consequences across the world.</P>
