            Parliament pledges its support for International Nurses’ Day, which 
            is celebrated around the world every 12 May on the anniversary of 
            Florence Nightingale’s birth; notes that the theme for 2001, Nurses, 
            Always There for You: United Against Violence, highlights the fact 
            that violence is overtaking infectious diseases as a major public 
            health problem, with more than 2 million people dying as a result 
            of injuries sustained due to violence; recognises that nurses are 
            themselves threatened with violence in the workplace and are three 
            times more likely to experience violence than other professionals, 
            and congratulates the International Council of Nurses on its new partnership 
            with the World Health Organisation, the International Labour Organisation 
            and Public Services International which is rolling out a broad-based 
            anti-violence campaign, the priority of which is the elimination of 
            violence from the health sector workplace.</font></p>

            led by Clydebank MP Tony Worthington on behalf of asbestos disease 
            sufferers affected by the collapse of Chester Street Insurance Holdings

            paid; notes that asbestos-related disease has led to more than 1,800 
            deaths in Scotland since 1997, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            can assist in preventing further distress to sufferers and their families

            newspapers play a crucial role in their communities and can act as 
            a focal point of community life; acknowledges that they provide valuable 
            services such as scrutiny of local elected representatives and the 
            championing of local causes; further acknowledges that they are a 
            window on our communities and give us a unique opportunity to present

            Project 2000 which taught the basics of British Sign Language (BSL)

            <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Cuts Affecting the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders 
            and the Black Watch</strong>—That the Parliament notes with dismay the 
            proposed cuts to the Scottish Regiments, in particular the effect 
            such cuts would have on the Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders, with 
            its historic links to Stirling, and the Black Watch, famously based 
            in Perthshire, regiments which have a proud history of defending British 
            interests in many conflicts in the 19th and 20th centuries; believes 
            that plans for further mergers and cuts would seriously undermine 
            the future of these historic frontline regiments which include regular 
            troops, territorial army and cadet forces, and calls upon Her Majesty's 
            Government to reject this unnecessary course of action.</font></p>

            50% of local authorities in Scotland no longer provide school swimming 
            lessons; acknowledges that this coincides with the report from the 
            Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents which records an increase 
            in the number of children in Scotland who die as a result of drowning; 
            recognises that the withdrawal of local authority provided school 
            swimming lessons has a greater impact on children from less well off 
            backgrounds, and calls on the Scottish Executive to encourage local 
            authorities to ensure that every pupil has access to at least one 
            publicly funded course of swimming lessons prior to leaving primary 
            school.</font></p>

            the continued success of AG Barr plc as an independent Scottish company; 
            notes that Scotland is unique as the only nation to produce a local 
            soft drink which outsells a certain well-known brand of cola; recognises 
            the example that the company sets to other Scottish companies in terms

            Parliament pledges its support to National Cot Death Awareness Week 
            from 8-14 May 2001; notes that changes in the way that babies are 
            positioned for sleep has helped reduce cot deaths in Scotland by 60%; 
            is concerned by the link between cigarette smoke and cot death, with 
            an estimated seven-fold increase in risk for infants of women who 
            smoke during pregnancy; further notes the Cot Death Trust’s warning 
            that the 100% increase in 15-year-old girls smoking in the past 10 
            years could result in an alarming rise in the number of cot deaths, 
            and therefore welcomes the Scottish Cot Death Trust's research at 
            the Queen Mother's Hospital Glasgow to determine whether innovative 
            motivational counselling offered to pregnant women will be more successful 
            than traditional advice in helping these women give up smoking.</font></p>

            made it clear that people with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) are 
            entitled to state benefits, the format of questions on the claim forms 
            and the nature of the tests for disability are not appropriate to 
            the symptoms and consequences of this disease; further notes that 
            many of those with ME have difficulty in obtaining benefits to which 
            they are entitled, and believes that the Scottish Executive, through 
            its representatives on the UK Working Group on ME established in 1999, 
            should emphasise these difficulties in order that no-one who is disabled 
            through ME is excluded from accessing appropriate benefits.</font></p>

            2.4% of these people have access to beta interferon compared with

            benefit would be some £7 million, representing a minute fraction of 
            the NHS budget; queries the cost of beta interferon in Scotland as 
            compared to elsewhere; notes the inadequate provision of physiotherapy 
            for those affected by MS; further notes the lack of provision of specialist

            the appropriate consultant meet the patient’s GP to inform them and 
            discuss the case, as many GPs may only occasionally see a case of 
            MS and may therefore be uninformed about the disease and treatments; 
            considers that money expended on the above will not only benefit the

            <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Close Paterson's Dump, Glasgow</strong>—That the

            and Mount Vernon, Glasgow, to protect the public and the environment 
            in the light of the four enforcement notices served on Paterson’s 
            by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for failing to 
            provide relief for outraged local residents from the appalling smells 
            and for being unable to guarantee that the groundwater, which is close 
            to the River Clyde, was not being affected by the dump, which is licensed 
            to take arsenic, cyanide, asbestos and a total of 27 poisonous chemicals; 
            recalls that in November 1999, following a Public Health Department 
            investigation of the dump, Dr Harry Burns, Director of Public Health 
            for Greater Glasgow stated &quot;smells are, at times, literally breathtaking&quot;, 
            believes that, despite other attempts over the years, the continued 
            suffering of local people can only be alleviated by a total closure 
            of the dump, which is licensed to take up to 500,000 tonnes of waste 
            every year including sewage which is hauled through urban areas on 
            around 4,000 lorries; is deeply concerned that Paterson’s is the only 
            high level toxic dump still existing within a city boundary in Scotland 
            and that, after enduring the dump for 44 years, local people deserve 
            relief; is determined that the East End of Glasgow should not remain 
            a dumping ground for materials which many other areas will not accept; 
            does not approve of the continuing profits being made by the dump’s 
            owners while local tenants and council tax payers are subjected to 
            misery and restrictions on the enjoyment of their homes and therefore 
            calls upon SEPA to remove Paterson’s licence and enforce closure of 
            the dump immediately and thereby uphold their claim to be protectors 
            of the public and the environment.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Proposed Health Professions Council</strong>—That the 
            Parliament notes that Her Majesty's Government intends to regulate 
            12 health professions as if they were a single profession, including 
            chiropodists/podiatrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, 
            radiographers, dieticians, speech and language therapists, medical 
            laboratory scientific officers, prosthetists and orthotists, orthoptists, 
            arts therapists, clinical scientists and paramedics; further notes 
            that this approach does not take account of the lack of similarity 
            in the qualifications for, and clinical practice of, these professions; 
            believes that there should be parity of treatment for all health professions 
            with self regulation for chiropodists and podiatrists as well as doctors, 
            nurses, midwives, dentists and others; notes that, at the time the

            by Her Majesty’s Government that the Health and Social Care Bill would 
            &quot;provide stronger self-regulation&quot; but that the Department 
            of Health consultation paper gives no details of how uni-profession 
            input will be secured, and suggests that most matters can be dealt 
            with on a multi-professional basis; believes that commitments made 
            at the time the Health and Social Care Bill’s passage through Westminster 
            should be respected; further believes that the proposals ignore devolution 
            and disenfranchise Scotland, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland, 
            by not recognising that each country should have effective national 
            representation from each of the professions to be regulated, and urges 
            the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government 
            to work more closely with the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists, 
            and other professions concerned, and bring forward new proposals that

            decline in the facilities available, almost 40% of schools do not 
            have a football pitch and there is real concern also about community 
            facilities which are closing down because of a lack of resources to 
            maintain them; considers that this situation means that the already

            go into irreversible decline, and therefore calls upon the Scottish

            public inquiry into the collapse of the insurance firm Chester Street

            its warm congratulations to the management and workforce of Ferguson’s 
            shipyard in Port Glasgow for winning against intense competition the

            in the world, and believes that this order shows very clearly that 
            this is an excellent shipyard.</font></p>
