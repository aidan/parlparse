          <p><strong>*S2M-70#</strong> <strong> Pauline McNeill: Maternity Services 
            in Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses support for 
            the unique child and maternal healthcare link at Yorkhill NHS Trust, 
            Glasgow; notes that the Queen Mother's Hospital at Yorkhill currently 
            caters for 3,400 births each year and is expected to take on extra 
            births from other NHS boards; further notes that the Royal Hospital 
            for Sick Children is a national centre of excellence in many fields 
            of paediatric care; is concerned that the review of maternity services, 
            announced by Greater Glasgow NHS Board on 20 May, 2003, may threaten 
            the long-term future of both the Queen Mother&#146;s Hospital and 
            the Royal Hospital for Sick Children; notes the vigorous campaign 
            involving parents, the local community and elected representatives 
            only four years ago against the proposed removal of Yorkhill NHS Trust 
            from its existing site in the west of Glasgow, and believes that the 
            Greater Glasgow NHS Board should consider responses to its previous 
            consultation on the future of Yorkhill NHS Trust and the implications 
            of breaking up the paediatric-maternity care link alongside any new 
            consultation to be organised on the future of maternity services in 
            Glasgow.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-69#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Fair Credit Schemes</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the recently published in-depth report into 
            personal debt in the UK, <em>In Too Deep</em>, produced by the citizens 
            advice bureau (CAB) service in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern 
            Ireland; acknowledges the Scottish context of the report; notes with 
            concern the report's findings that more people in Scotland blamed 
            low incomes than elsewhere in the UK and more people coped with their 
            debt problem by taking out further borrowing than elsewhere in the 
            UK; further notes that personal debt is nearly always connected to 
            other problems in people&#146;s lives such as loss of job or ill-health; 
            notes that the number of debt cases brought to citizens advice bureaux 
            in Scotland is at an all-time high with nearly 60,000 new debt enquiries 
            last year; recognises the link between CAB clients and MSPs&#146; 
            constituents and therefore supports the invaluable work of Scotland&#146;s 
            CAB service as a vital provider of free, independent, impartial and 
            comprehensive advice and as the leading voice on the issue of personal 
            debt in Scotland today; welcomes the commitments in <em>A Partnership 
            for a Better Scotland</em> to support the extension of the money advice 
            service, building on the work of the CAB and other bodies to assist 
            those burdened by multiple debt, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should increase access to affordable credit for people on very low 
            incomes and, as a matter of urgency, take action on the commitment 
            from <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland </em>to work with the 
            Department of Trade and Industry to introduce fairer credit schemes 
            and protection from exorbitant interest rates.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-68</strong> <strong>John Swinburne: Airdrieonians FC</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises that it is time that the great Lanarkshire 
            football club of Airdrieonians FC, which was formed in 1878, has its 
            title returned to its rightful place in the community to supersede 
            the temporary title, Airdrie United; further recognises that had the 
            proud Airdrieonians not been forced into liquidation last season, 
            Falkirk FC would have been relegated and would only now be returning 
            to the First Division, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to intercede on behalf of the Airdrie community and demand the return 
            of the proud title &quot;Airdrieonians FC&quot; from the administrators, 
            KPMG.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-67#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Scottish Premier 
            League's Treatment of Falkirk Football Club</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament condemns the decision of the Scottish Premier League (SPL) 
            to reject the application from Falkirk Football Club, as champions 
            of the Scottish Football League's First Division, to join the SPL, 
            despite the fact that the SPL stadium criteria would be met both by 
            the club's new stadium, under construction at Westfield, and by the 
            Excelsior Stadium at Airdrie, of which Falkirk Football Club would 
            have guaranteed use for all SPL home fixtures for the 2003-04 season, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should make it a condition 
            of any future public funding of SPL members that the criteria for 
            admission to the SPL do not infringe any principles of natural justice 
            and that any application for admission is assessed in an open and 
            accountable manner.</p>

            in tying food and assistance for AIDS victims to the acceptance of 
            genetically modified organisms; vigorously opposes the US case at
