          <p><strong>*S1M-3032#</strong> <strong> Irene Oldfather: Scotland and 
            Europe Day</strong>-That the Parliament is proud to mark Europe Day 
            as a celebration of the founding of the European Union (EU); endorses 
            the fundamental principles of the EU as set out in the Declaration 
            by Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950; welcomes the contribution that the 
            EU has made towards peace and solidarity across Europe; notes the 
            relevance of the EU to the working of the Scottish Parliament and 
            to the everyday lives of Scots, and encourages the people of Scotland, 
            young and old, to join with citizens across Europe, in the celebration 
            of our common values and to participate in the debate on the future 
            of Europe.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3031</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: Reduction in Wheelchair 
            Accessible Seats in New Parliament Chamber</strong>-That the Parliament 
            regrets that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, whilst noting 
            the dissent of the Holyrood Progress Group, has instructed that the 
            Chamber design in the new Parliament building be altered from that 
            circulated to all members and agreed in September 1999, with the result 
            that the choice of accessible Chamber seats for any member using a 
            standard wheelchair is reduced from 81 to 61.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John Home Robertson<strong>*</strong></p>

            in awarding medals to British servicemen deployed on convoys to Russia 
            during World War Two but deplores the failure of Her Majesty's Government 
            to give similar recognition to those who performed this highly dangerous 
            service.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3028</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: Racism</strong>-That 
            the Parliament acknowledges the important contribution made by immigrants 
            and refugees, both first and succeeding generations, to Scottish society 
            and welcomes the benefits brought about by living in a racially and 
            culturally diverse community; notes with concern the rise of far right 
            extremism in Europe, and supports the call from the European Monitoring 
            Centre on Racism for an end to the damaging negativity under which 
            issues relating to immigration or asylum are often debated or reported.</p>

            &quot;, however, believes that the use of the private health care 
            sector by the NHS in Scotland is divisive and counterproductive and 
            should not be part of the Executive's strategy.&quot;</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3022.3</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Modernising Primary 
            Care in NHS Scotland to Improve Health</strong>-As an amendment to

            &quot;applauds&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that in order to

            to purchase care from the most appropriate provider, be it public, 
            private or voluntary, and the incentives gained by the purchasing 
            of such services should be used to underpin patient choice; further 
            urges the Scottish Executive to continue to use private providers 
            where they can supplement the capacity of the NHS and provide value 
            for money, and asks the Scottish Executive to make available to patients 
            information on alternative providers and on waiting lists and times 
            to allow patients to exercise real choice.&quot; </p>

            with the general aim of the consultation paper<em> Scotland's Freshwater 
            Fish and Fisheries: Securing their Future</em>, but notes with concern 
            the substantial harm that the Scottish Executive's Land Reform (Scotland) 
            Bill will do to the future of Scotland's freshwater fish and fisheries.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3021.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Scotland's
