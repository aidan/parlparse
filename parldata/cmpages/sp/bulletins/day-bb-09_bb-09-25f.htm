<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4937</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> <strong>The Power of Scotland Renewed Report Publication</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the report, <em>The Power of Scotland Renewed</em> commissioned by Friends of the Earth Scotland, WWF, RSPB Scotland and the World Development Movement; believes that rapid decarbonisation of the energy supply is central to the challenge of meeting the emissions reduction target of at least 42% set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009; further believes that achieving this decarbonisation will require an economic environment that drives investment in energy conservation, deferrable demand and low-carbon technology; considers new unabated coal plants, such as that proposed for Hunterston in the National Planning Framework, to be incompatible with this environment; understands that, as a developed nation, Scotland should be demonstrating to the southern countries that we are prepared to introduce policies that encourage investment in clean green energy; recognises that our investment in developing these new clean technologies can result in expertise being shared and exported, thereby encouraging clean energy development in the southern countries and increasing inward investment, and calls on the Scottish Government to introduce policy for consenting to new thermal power plants under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, which supersedes the National Planning Framework, to prevent any new coal power stations from being granted planning consent unless they incorporate carbon capture and storage technology from the start.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4936</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>New Fast Train Service Between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Via Shotts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch by First ScotRail of its new winter railway timetable, including details of the new fast train service between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh via Shotts; notes that the new hourly service more than doubles the number of services available on this line; further notes that the new service will significantly reduce journey times from Shotts to Edinburgh to just over 30 minutes; believes that this new service will bring huge benefits to Shotts and surrounding villages, and looks forward to the launch of the new service in December.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4935</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Agricultural Wages Order</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Agricultural Wages (Scotland) Order (No 56) 2008 that came into effect on 1 October 2008, setting the minimum rates of pay and conditions to which workers in the agricultural sector are entitled by law, and notes that the order offers vital protection from gang masters, especially to workers who work long hours often on low pay and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4934</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Cumbernauld Restaurant Digs Deep for Malawi</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Anwar Miah and Ibrar Ali, owners of the Bombay Dreams Restaurant in Cumbernauld, and their staff on raising the magnificent sum of &pound;2,300 for Islamic Relief; notes that these funds will be used to build a water well in Malawi; further notes the ambition of the restaurant staff to expand their fundraising efforts into the wider community, and believes that this helps to build the strong partnership between Scotland and Malawi and serves as an inspiring example of how local communities can provide practical assistance to those most in need in developing countries.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4933</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>The Scotland-Malawi College Partnership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Scotland-Malawi Partnership project; commends Adam Smith College for taking the lead in the Scotland<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s Colleges International consortium in hosting the recent study tour of twelve Malawian college principals to Scotland as part of the partnership between the vocational colleges in the two countries; recognises that the aim of the study tour was to provide the Malawian principals with a greater insight into the Scottish approach to vocational educational training development and delivery; acknowledges that experienced practitioners from Scotland<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s Colleges have actively engaged in sharing their experience and expertise with Malawian staff while undertaking essential learning for their own professional development; congratulates Adam Smith College for hosting events throughout the study tour to raise funds to assist young people in Malawi to attend their local vocational college, to gain skills that will equip them for employment and to help support themselves, their families and their local communities, and looks forward to further supportive links with Malawi such as through the Kofi Annan Adam Smith Scholarship Fund.</p>
