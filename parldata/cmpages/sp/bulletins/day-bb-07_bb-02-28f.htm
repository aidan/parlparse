<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5669</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Dealing with Illegal Money Lenders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the activities of illegal money lenders who prey on and exploit vulnerable individuals and communities; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s determination to work in partnership with the UK Government to tackle illegal lending through enforcement and by developing new approaches, such as the successful illegal money lending task force pilots, and supports the Executive&rsquo;s activity to help affected individuals by increasing affordable credit from credit unions, by improving the availability of money advice, through citizens&rsquo; advice, local authority trading standards departments and other organisations which provide invaluable help to those with unmanageable debt, and by extending financial education in schools and in other settings such as the workplace and the community.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5664</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following revisions to the programme of business for Wednesday 28 February and Thursday 1 March 2007&mdash;</p>
<p>(a) Wednesday 28 February 2007</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5663</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Save Meadowbank Stadium</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the proposed demolition of Meadowbank Stadium, home to the Commonwealth Games of 1970 and 1986; notes that stadia in Berlin, Helsinki, Stockholm and Los Angeles have all been successfully refurbished and all are older than Meadowbank Stadium; notes that the proposed transfer of the stadium to Sighthill would mean that two running tracks, the other at nearby Saughton, would sit on the west of the city, while stadium users from eastern and central Edinburgh would be expected to make a round journey of up to 12 miles and users from East Lothian would largely be excluded on the grounds of travel time and travel expense; rejects the loss of Scotland&rsquo;s sporting heritage, Meadowbank having been home to Liz McColgan&rsquo;s first Commonwealth title in 1986 and Lachie Stewart&rsquo;s Commonwealth 10,000 metres victory over Ron Clarke in 1970 to name but two iconic performances, as well as being the training ground of Yvonne Murray, former European 3,000 metres Champion; notes that Meadowbank Stadium is home to Edinburgh Southern Harriers, currently the best women&rsquo;s athletics club in the United Kingdom, having won last season&rsquo;s UK League, a most notable feat for a Scottish club; notes the concerns of football clubs that use Sighthill Park for training; notes the objections of thousands of users, who have signed an ongoing petition, as well as coaches and their athletes who fear loss of facilities at a vital time in their preparations for 2012 Olympics and 2014 Commonwealth Games; notes that the current public consultation does not extend to whether or not local people want the stadium demolished but only consults on ideas for the site when demolition is complete; rejects the logic that new facilities can only be funded by the sell-off of existing facilities; notes that this proposal is at odds with need to tackle Scotland&rsquo;s appalling health record and growing obesity problem, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council to work with the Scottish Executive to restore the neglected stadium as it is part of our national sporting heritage.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5662</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Mediation Awareness Roadshow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Mediation Network on the launch of its mediation awareness roadshow and acknowledges the huge contribution mediation can make in problem solving in a wide range of public arenas, such as the health service, the planning system and neighbour and community disputes, and in family conflict, workplace differences, business and commercial disagreements, disputes about additional support needs and conflicts in schools; appreciates that mediation should always be considered before using the last resort of litigation and calls for independent, impartial and external mediation to be available for everyone working in the Parliament as a model for other workplaces, and calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise the contribution that mediation can make to civic society in every way possible.</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5657</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Condolences to all at Pennyvenie</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the tragedy that occurred on Monday 26 February 2007 at Pennyvenie Opencast Coal Mine at Dalmellington which resulted in the deaths of two workers and unites in sending its condolences to their families, friends and workmates and all those involved in the tragedy.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5655.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>The Future of Scotland&rsquo;s Organic Farming</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5655) in the name of Sarah Boyack, insert at end &quot;but believes that, as many of the targets in the current Organic Action Plan have only been partially met, it is time for a new updated organic action plan that encourages a more balanced basket of healthy, locally grown organic produce, and pledges to use public procurement to promote organic produce, to communicate the benefits to consumers and to minimise the bureaucracy associated with organic production.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5655.3</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>The Future of Scotland&rsquo;s Organic Farming</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5655) in the name of Sarah Boyack, insert at end &quot;and further commits to the production of a revised and strengthened organic action plan to include ambitious targets for increased land area and market penetration, prioritised support for the organic sector through land management contracts, grants and support for local supply chain development, including a review of barriers to further growth across the sector, an organic public procurement strategy adopting the successful &quot;Food for Life&quot; standards across the public sector, a communication strategy to engage with the public about the benefits of organic food and farming, strengthened advisory support and a review of SEERAD&rsquo;s research and development strategy.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-5637*#*</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Changing Places</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that around 3,500 people in Scotland with profound and multiple learning disabilities, as well as many thousands of other disabled people, cannot use standard accessible toilets and require public toilets with enough space for disabled people and their carers along with the right equipment, including a height adjustable changing bench and a hoist; notes the positive examples of facilities in the Meadow Centre in Dumbarton and in the Vale of Leven leisure centre; supports the Changing Places Campaign, launched by the Changing Places Consortium of MENCAP, PAMIS (Promoting a More Inclusive Society), Dumfries and Galloway Council, Nottingham City Council, the Valuing People Support Team and the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s &quot;Same As You&quot; team, which is calling for more of these toilets to be installed in public places to enable disabled people and their carers to be active citizens, and notes that the Cross Party Group on Learning Disability welcomes all efforts, including those of the Parliament, to ensure that provision is made for people with profound and multiple learning disabilities.</p>
