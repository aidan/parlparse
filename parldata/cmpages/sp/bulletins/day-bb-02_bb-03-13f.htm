          <p><strong>*S1M-2889</strong> <strong> Rhoda Grant: Screentime</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the project director and trustees of 
            Screentime on achieving charitable status for the organisation; supports 
            their plans for providing people in the Highlands and Islands with 
            access to film and media professionals, to new-media technology, to 
            industry training workshops and to community and career development 
            opportunities; welcomes the success of the two pilot programmes in 
            1999 and 2001; recognises the contribution that Screentime could make 
            to the sustainable development of the region, and wishes it well in 
            raising funds for the programme of events later this year.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2888#</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh: End-of-Life 
            Refrigerators and Freezers</strong>-That the Parliament understands 
            that from January 2002 EC Regulation 2037/2000 requires all ozone-depleting 
            substances to be recovered from domestic refrigerators and freezers 
            before they are recycled or sent for disposal; notes that minimal 
            facilities exist in Scotland for the removal of such substances and 
            that local authorities are having to stockpile end-of-life refrigerators 
            and freezers until adequate facilities are available, and is concerned 
            at the Scottish Executive's lack of preparedness concerning the implementation 
            of this legislation and its failure to ensure that adequate facilities 
            are available for this purpose. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2887#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: GM Trials, Newport</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the formation of a steering group to oppose 
            the proposed GM field trial in Newport, Fife; notes the statement 
            made by Mr Charles Saunders, consultant in public health for Fife 
            Health Board and a member of the BMA that the Scottish Executive is 
            gambling with public health, and considers that the Minister for Environment 
            and Rural Development, who is responsible for deciding whether the 
            trials go ahead, should withhold agreement until the seed manufactures 
            can offer conclusive proof that there will be no health or environmental 
            damage from GM Crops.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2886</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Rural Postal 
            Services</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the vital role that 
            the postal service has to play in our rural communities, particularly 
            those in the Highlands and Islands; supports the principle of universal 
            postal tariffs and services throughout Scotland, regardless of location; 
            notes the potential threat posed to rural postal services by the Postal 
            Services Commission's proposals, and calls upon the relevant parliamentary 
            committee to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into 
            those proposals and into the long-term future of the postal service 
            in rural areas.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2885#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie: Hamish Henderson</strong>-That

            wishes to place on record its appreciation of his lifetime devotion 
            to international solidarity, peace and socialism, his many contributions 
            to Scottish culture and politics, including his role in gathering 
            traditional songs, his support for other artists and his authorship 
            of the song that many believe should be Scotland's (inter)national 
            anthem, <em>The Freedom Come All Ye</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2884</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Scottish Qualifications

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2883</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Nuclear Power 
            Stations</strong>-That the Parliament notes that consent for nuclear 
            and other electricity power stations over 50 megawatts, under section 
            36 of the Electricity Act 1989, is a responsibility devolved to Scottish 
            Executive Ministers and believes that the final decision over consent 
            for nuclear power stations, now and in the future, must remain with 
            Scottish Executive Ministers accountable to the Parliament.</p>

            Service</strong>-That the Parliament notes that there are fewer nurses 
            and fewer acute beds in the NHS now than in 1999, that the NHS is 
            treating fewer out-patients, in-patients and day case patients now 
            than in 1999, that fewer patients are being seen within the Scottish 
            Executive's target times than was the case in 1999, that there are 
            16,000 more people on NHS waiting lists now than in 1999 and that 
            median waiting times are 10 days longer than in 1999; is concerned 
            that the NHS is shrinking, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
            pursue policies that will reverse this reduction in capacity and deliver 
            an NHS of the standard that patients in Scotland are entitled to expect.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2880</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Palestine</strong>-That 
            the Parliament condemns the policies of the Israeli government towards 
            Palestinians; urges the Prime Minister to use his best efforts to 
            convince the government of Ariel Sharon that the continued brutality 
            in territory occupied illegally by Israel under resolutions of the 
            United Nations has resulted in the inevitability of the establishment 
            of the State of Palestine, and counsels that this Israeli government 
            and future governments should seek for this to be realised in peaceful 
            co-operation between the State of Israel and the future State of Palestine.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2879</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Sportscotland

            requirement on <strong>sport</strong>scotland to consider relocating 
            from Edinburgh; recognises the potential of North Ayrshire as a place 
            for growth in government related jobs and the poor record to date 
            of such job creation in the area; urges North Ayrshire Council to 
            take positive and determined steps to attract such jobs and especially 
            those that would be created by the move of <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
            to the area; observes that <strong>sport</strong>scotland already 
            has facilities in North Ayrshire, and therefore calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to direct <strong>sport</strong>scotland to consider North 
            Ayrshire as the preferred site for its relocation. </p>

            Cannabis and Drug Laws</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText" id="MotionText">notes 
            and welcomes the resolutions at the Liberal Democrat spring conference 
            to support the legislation of cannabis and issuing of heroin on prescription 
            to registered addicts; further notes that this policy position has 
            been promoted by the Scottish Socialist Party since the Parliament's 
            inception, and believes that it is time to radically overhaul the 
            unrealistic drugs laws and invest in treatment, rehabilitation and 
            community facilities as part of a social and medical approach to drugs 
            policy, as opposed to the &quot;Just Say No&quot; rhetoric of the 
            past.</a></p>
