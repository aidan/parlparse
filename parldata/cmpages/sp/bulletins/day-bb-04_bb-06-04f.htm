          <p><strong>*S2M-1415</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Belmont 
            Academy Parliament Success</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the pupils and staff of Belmont Academy in Ayr for winning the National 
            Youth Parliament competition, Holyrood Model, where the pupils took 
            on roles of MSPs and conducted their own parliamentary sessions, bringing 
            to life the process of parliament and devolved government.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1414</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Seducing 
            our Children to Smoke</strong>-That the Parliament abhors any attempt 
            by tobacco manufacturers to try to seduce people, particularly youngsters, 
            into continuing, or starting, to smoke cigarettes; recognises that 
            in Scotland approximately 12,000 people die each year through tobacco-related 
            illnesses and registers its contempt for British American Tobacco's 
            latest attempt to replace these deceased smokers by new and younger 
            ones; agrees that any attempt to make smoking more attractive should 
            be repelled, and urges members to support any legislation that encourages 
            the people of Scotland to give up smoking and helps persuade non-smokers 
            not to start.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1413#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Assault 
            on Lanarkshire NHS</strong>-That the Parliament is extremely concerned 
            at the announcement by NHS Lanarkshire that it will make cuts of between 
            5 and 10% of its budget this year in order to address a projected 
            deficit of £20 million; is alarmed that the Scottish Executive refused 
            to assist in avoiding such draconian measures by insisting that the 
            board reach financial balance this year and by rejecting the board's 
            proposals for a two-year recovery plan; notes concern that legislation 
            and changes to be made by the Executive to consultant contracts, the 
            new deal for junior doctors, the new GP contract and other such initiatives 
            have not been fully funded by the Executive's allocation to NHS boards, 
            thereby putting the service under intolerable strain; believes that 
            the Executive should take immediate steps to avoid cuts in NHS Lanarkshire 
            by making adequate funding available; believes that the two PFI hospitals 
            at Hairmyres and Wishaw have placed unacceptable pressure on the board's 
            revenue budget to the detriment of patient care and have led directly 
            to bed cuts, reduced staffing levels and threats to the level of services 
            provided from the non-PFI hospital at Monklands whilst the PFI consortia 
            rake in huge profits; condemns specifically the consortia responsible 
            for the Hairmyres PFI who are additionally set to benefit to the tune 
            of nearly £1 billion from a re-financing deal, and believes that PFI 
            is a wasteful means of funding public building projects, that it only 
            benefits banks and big business and should be abolished and that all 
            public buildings should be financed via direct public funding and 
            the public works loan board.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1412</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            First Division Champions</strong>-That the Parliament fully condemns 
            the decision taken on 1 June 2004 by the Scottish Premier League (SPL) 
            to deny Scottish First Division champions, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, 
            entry into Scotland's top league next season, meaning that, for the 
            second successive year, the team finishing bottom of the SPL has not 
            been relegated and the First Division winners have not been rewarded 
            for their success by rightfully gaining promotion to the SPL; notes 
            that this is despite the club reaching a suitable ground-sharing agreement 
            with Aberdeen Football Club to play at Pittodrie Stadium for one season, 
            and believes that the decision takes away the basic principle of being 
            rewarded for success.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1411</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Borders 
            Voluntary Community Care Forum</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the sterling work of Scotland's countless volunteers and notes the 
            contribution of Borders Voluntary Community Care Forum, with representatives 
            from Alzheimer Scotland-Action on Dementia, Borders Independent Advocacy 
            Service, Borderline, Borders Local Health Council, Borders Carers 
            Centre, the Disabled Persons Housing Service, Borders Visual Impairment 
            Network, the British Red Cross, Encompass, Gala Day Services, New 
            Horizons Borders, Penumbra Youth Project, People First Borders and 
            Scottish Borders Elder Council and also the contribution of individual 
            members; notes its mission statement &quot;to represent the views 
            of all those with an interest in community care to the agencies responsible 
            for the planning and provision of community care services in the Scottish 
            Borders&quot;, and congratulates it on another successful year's work 
            on behalf of Borders users and carers.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1410#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Increasing 
            Gender Pay Gap</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            result of research by PayFinder.com which indicates that the gender 
            pay gap is getting wider, that it has increased by 5% in the last 
            year and that the gap is now 29% in Scotland and believes that this 
            is an unacceptable situation and that the Scottish Executive has a 
            duty to investigate the matter and bring forward proposals to close 
            the gap.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1409#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Food Train, Dumfries and Galloway - Queen's Award for Voluntary 
            Service 2004</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Food Train, 
            Dumfries and Galloway, on being one of the 110 organisations in the 
            United Kingdom to be awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service 
            on 1 June 2004; notes the expansion of its operations delivering groceries 
            to elderly and disabled people throughout Dumfries and Galloway over 
            the last year and the training and experience being offered to its 
            increasing numbers of volunteers; further congratulates the Food Train 
            on the introduction of its services in Dalkeith, Midlothian, and looks 
            forward to similar services being established throughout Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1408</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Kirkcudbright 
            Academy Junior Debating Champions</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Kirkcudbright Academy debating team and its coach on winning the 
            National Junior Debating Competition, sponsored by the English Speaking 
            Union, particularly as this was the first time the academy had entered 
            this prestigious competition which receives entries from all over 
            Scotland, and notes that the team was commended for showing &quot;maturity 
            beyond its tender years&quot; and a level of debating skills that 
            completely belied the school's previous experience in debating.</P>
