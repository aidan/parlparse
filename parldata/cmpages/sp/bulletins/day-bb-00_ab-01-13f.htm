    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-417</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: General Pinochet</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with deep concern that the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, &quot;is
    minded&quot; not to proceed with the extradition of General Pinochet on the grounds that
    he would be unfit to stand trial now or at any time in the future; believes that this
    flies in the face of the human rights of the victims of torture under General
    Pinochet&#146;s military regime and their relatives who need justice to be done, and calls
    upon the Home Secretary to agree to extradite General Pinochet to Spain.</p>

    the Parliament notes the progress achieved by the Irish Government in alleviating the
    problems for its scallop industry associated with amnesic shellfish poisoning, and calls
    upon the Scottish Executive to take similar measures to remove Scotland&#146;s scallop
    industry from its present crisis by lifting the current closures under the Food and

    (S1M-408) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end
    and insert &quot;notes the Executive&#146;s proposals to achieve this and notes that the
    Executive will bring forward a Housing Bill; calls upon the Executive to include within
    this Bill measures to deal with the alarming problem of homelessness which has increased
    dramatically since May 1997; welcomes the Executive&#146;s commitment to extend the Right
    to Buy to Housing Association tenants, but emphasises that measures may be necessary to
    safeguard individual Associations where the take-up of this right could prejudice the
    operation, viability or success of these Associations.&quot; </p>

    and insert &quot;notes the Executive&#146;s proposals to achieve this through a range of
    measures, including the introduction of a single social tenancy, the development of a
    single regulatory framework for social housing, the promotion of a stronger strategic role
    in housing for local authorities, and a new role and status for Scottish Homes, but
    believes that these measures alone will not improve the position of Scotland&#146;s 80000
    homeless people and that the Executive must give greater priority to dealing with chronic
    under investment in Scotland&#146;s public and voluntary housing including the reversal of
    their policy of wholesale stock transfer.&quot;<i><strong> </strong></i></p>

    end and insert &quot;notes that this will only be delivered by a radical and sustained
    increase in public housing investment throughout Scotland; agrees to change immediately
    the capital receipt set-aside rules and release significant resources for vital investment
    in local authority housing throughout Scotland, and further calls for a comprehensive
    Housing Bill to be presented which will reject the damaging right-to-buy legislation and
    contain provision for a strong single social tenancy and appropriate incentives to retain
    tenants in the rented sector.&quot;</p>
