<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00308 Fiona Hyslop: Scotland Bill &ndash; Scottish Broadcasting and the Scottish Digital Network</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes recent developments in digital infrastructure and broadcasting in Scotland, such as BBC ALBA becoming available on Freeview and cable, the introduction of the final stage of digital television switchover in Scotland and the success of the bid led by Highlands and Islands Enterprise for UK Government funding to pilot the introduction of superfast broadband roll-out in rural areas; recognises that much more needs to be done, particularly to realise the vision for a Scottish Digital Network as set out by the Scottish Broadcasting Commission in 2008, which would make quality public service content available to all of Scotland on television and online; welcomes the work undertaken by the Scottish Digital Network Panel to explore options for the funding and establishment of a Scottish Digital Network, and encourages the Scottish Government to continue to explore opportunities with the UK Government to deliver a digital network and to investigate options for transferring further responsibilities for broadcasting to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00304 Mary Scanlon: Supporting Action on Depression Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Action on Depression Week 2011; notes that the week will run from 15 June and that it coincides with the renaming of what it considers to be the leading charity in Scotland dealing with depression, Depression Alliance Scotland, as Action on Depression; believes that this change of name reflects the mission and activities of the charity; further believes that Action on Depression week will raise awareness of depression in Scotland, with its aims of encouraging people to seek help and of eliminating stigma; notes the charity&rsquo;s call to take action on depression, and commends the commitment of the many families affected by suicide who are working with Action on Depression in trying to achieve these aims by campaigning and fundraising in local communities in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00303 Jackie Baillie: Vale of Leven Community Midwifery Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the midwives at the Vale of Leven Community Midwifery Unit (CMU) for their commitment in providing support for new mothers in the local area; further congratulates the midwives on receiving the maximum score of 100% in all categories in an independent audit of the support provided by the CMU to mothers for breastfeeding; notes that this audit was carried out as part of the UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative; further notes that the initiative is considered to set high standards of breastfeeding accreditation and uses strict criteria to ensure a high standard of care for mothers and babies, and regards the CMU as an essential part of the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Pentland*, James Kelly*, Mary Fee*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00302 Jackie Baillie: Reduction in Laboratory Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns proposals by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to downgrade the haematology and biochemistry laboratories at the Vale of Leven and Inverclyde Royal hospitals; notes that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is proposing to downsize the current 24 hours per day, seven days per week service provided by these laboratories to one operating on a nine to five basis from Monday to Friday and that, outwith those times, it has been reported that 80% of samples will be sent to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley by taxi; understands that these proposals come at the same time as plans to convert two hospital wards at the Vale of Leven Hospital into laboratory space; further understands that these proposals will result in 50 or fewer samples per day being analysed at the Vale of Leven hospital; notes the comments by managers claiming that this will result in the laboratories becoming financially unviable and that it could ultimately lead to their closure, and calls on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to abandon this proposal and for the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy to intervene to keep healthcare local at the Vale of Leven and Inverclyde Royal hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00301 Bill Kidd: Drumchapel Early Years Centre Excels at Personal Finance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Drumchapel Early Years Centre in Glasgow on its success at the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Personal Finance Education Awards; notes that it was the only such centre in the United Kingdom to reach the finals; commends the work of teacher Catherine Cunningham, who picked up the award for best teacher in the primary school category; considers that Drumchapel Early Years Centre is committed to financial education; believes that financial education programmes in schools can help in giving children a good grounding in how to look after their money in years to come; further notes that RBS has been running these awards for four years as part of the wider programme, MoneySense for Schools, and understands that they are the only awards to recognise cases of outstanding achievement and dedication given in schools to learning about money.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00300 Kezia Dugdale: Scotland&rsquo;s First Urban Community Wind Turbine? </strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the joint venture between Greener Leith and PEDAL (Portobello Transition Town) to build and operate the first 100% community-owned urban wind turbine at the Seafield Waste Water Treatment Plant; commends their drive in pursuing the feasibility of such a project; considers the costs involved in producing noise and wildlife impact assessments prohibitive and encourages the Scottish Government to maintain and develop the schemes that it operates to ease the burden of such explorative work; considers that the development could generate tens of thousands of pounds for the local community; recognises that the environmental impact on the landscape must be assessed alongside its value as an asset to the whole community, and looks forward to seeing the results of the feasibility study in due course.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Pentland*, Bill Kidd*, Mike MacKenzie*, John Park*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00299 Gil Paterson: Scottish History in the Making</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Andy Murray and Elena Baltacha on winning the Aegon Championships and the Aegon Challenge respectively; understands that this is the first time ever that two Scottish tennis players have won tournaments at the same time and believes that these successes will inspire young people across Scotland to participate in sporting events that will help foster a healthier lifestyle, and wishes both players all the best in the forthcoming grand slam event at Wimbledon.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00297 Patrick Harvie: Europe Abandoning Nuclear Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes what it considers the overwhelming vote against nuclear power in the recent Italian referendum; further notes the German Government&rsquo;s decision to close pre-1980 nuclear power stations and to call a halt to plans to extend the operational lifespan of the country&rsquo;s nuclear plants; believes that, following the Fukushima disaster, the operating life of Scotland&rsquo;s aging nuclear plants should also not be extended; supports calls for Scotland&rsquo;s electricity supply to go 100% renewable by 2020, and urges Scottish ministers to work with the industry to close down Scotland&rsquo;s nuclear power stations by 2020 at the latest.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00293 Jamie Hepburn: Condorrat Memorial Wall </strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Condorrat Tenants and Residents Association on successfully unveiling a memorial wall in tribute to local radicals, miners and war dead on 11 June 2011; notes that the association raised the funds necessary for the erection of this wall, which was built using local labour; believes that it is right that the Condorrat radicals of 1820, most notably John Baird, after whom one of the local primary schools is named, as well as John Barr, Thomas McFarlane, William Smith and John Allan, are remembered for their efforts in fighting for the democratisation of Scotland; hopes that the 1820 Society might consider an annual commemoration at Condorrat in honour of these men, just as it has in Strathaven for those radicals from that area, and further believes that it is fitting that the six Condorrat miners killed in the Auchengeich disaster of 18 September 1959, A M Beattie, P Harvey, A T Lang, J Muir, J Mullholland and T Stokes, are commemorated locally, as it is for those Condorrat men who fell in battle throughout the years, and that this memorial is testament to the sacrifice of those who went before. <strong>R</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00290 Richard Simpson: Children with Family Members in Prison</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the merging of the Prison and Advice and Care Trust (PACT) and Kids VIP and wishes the organisation well as it continues under the PACT name; considers that having a family member in prison has an adverse effect on children; calls for moves to ensure that an assessment of the possible effects on the health and wellbeing of children should be part of every sentencing decision; further calls for the establishment of visitor centres run in conjunction with, but independently of, the Scottish Prison Service and for support for children with a family member in prison, and supports the petition on rights of such children at http://eurochips.wordpress.com/current-campaign/.</p>
