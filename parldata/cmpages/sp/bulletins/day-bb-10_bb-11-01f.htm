<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7297</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Loudoun Academy, Passionate about Pudsey</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers the extraordinary achievement of Loudoun Academy, which, since 1997, has raised more than &pound;90,000 for Children in Need; notes that, as part of this year&rsquo;s fundraising efforts, pupils and staff of the school have co-operated to write, perform, record and release their very own song for Pudsey Bear, <em>You gave back a part of me</em>; further notes that the song was played on BBC&rsquo;s <em>Fred MacAulay Show</em> on 29 October 2010 and will feature in performances at ASDA Kilmarnock on 6 November and at <em>Children In Need Rocks Scotland</em> at the SECC, Glasgow, on 19 November; welcomes news that the recording will be sold at a number of outlets, including ASDA in Kilmarnock, Ayr, Newton Mearns, Irvine, Ardrossan and Cumnock, the Co-op in Galston, Morrisons in Kilmarnock as well as through the school and is also available for download from iTunes or cdbaby.com; congratulates Loudoun Academy on its efforts to date, and wishes it well in its aim of taking its total raised for what it considers to be this excellent cause to over &pound;100,000 through this year&rsquo;s efforts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7296</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Funding for Glasgow Fastlink</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the delay by the Scottish Government in making a decision on funding for the Fastlink proposals in Glasgow; condemns the Government&rsquo;s decision to consider only the &pound;37 million route, the cheapest of the three proposals; considers that choosing this lowest price scheme is completely unacceptable when a detailed examination by Glasgow City Council and Strathclyde Partnership for Transport has deemed the middle-priced &pound;60 million route to be best value for money; notes that similar concerns about delay and stalling by the Scottish Government were raised ahead of the cancellation of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link and a decision not to fund Glasgow Crossrail; believes that the existing public transport links to the new Southern General are poor and that there will therefore be a particularly serious impact on residents in Glasgow&rsquo;s southside if Fastlink is cancelled; further believes that this government has inappropriately prioritised investment in roads projects ahead of support for public transport and active travel, and urges the Scottish Government to give Scotland&rsquo;s largest city a higher priority and improved investment for public transport.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7295</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Historic Environment (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Historic Environment (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7294</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Housing (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Housing (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
