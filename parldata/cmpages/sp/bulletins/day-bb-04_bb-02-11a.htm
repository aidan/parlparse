          <p><strong>Wednesday 11 February 2004</strong></p>
          <p>2.30 pm Time for Reflection &#8211; Rev Dr Michael Purcell, Parish 
            Priest, St Mary of the Angels, Camelon</p>
          <p><em>followed by</em> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
          <p><em> </em>The clerk has been advised of the topics of the following 
            Scottish National Party business</p>
          <p><em>followed by</em> Scottish National Party debate on The Future 
            of Scottish Football&#8212;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-889</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>The 
            Future of Scottish Football</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes 
            the crisis faced by Scottish football; recognises football&#8217;s 
            significant contribution and potential impact in terms of its economic, 
            social and health benefits and its role in our culture and identity; 
            sympathises with the backroom and playing staff of those clubs worst 
            affected; calls on professional football clubs to work with their 
            supporters to harness the emotional and financial investment they 
            make in their clubs; calls on the football authorities and clubs to 
            ensure better business planning and financial management; believes 
            that public funding for the game is essential but not the bail out 
            of individual clubs; welcomes current and proposed financial support 
            from the Scottish Executive but calls for such support to be matched 
            by structural change; calls for the Scottish Football Association 
            (SFA) to be a more integrated governing body for the game; calls for 
            a review of the professional league structure in Scotland and the 
            criteria for membership, and further calls for the SFA to regulate 
            and develop participation by all ages and at all levels from grassroots 
            in the community through to the national team.</p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-889.1</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor: The Future 
            of Scottish Football</strong>&#8212;As an amendment to motion (S2M-889) 
            in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;significant&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;importance in terms of its economic, social 
            and health benefits and also its contribution to our culture and identity; 
            believes, however, that football clubs must take responsibility for 
            their own commercial decisions and that a well-run football club should 
            be sustainable without the need for public funding; further believes 
            that the Scottish Executive can help club finances by lifting the 
            outdated alcohol ban in all-seater stadia, and invites the Scottish 
            Football Association to consider reinstating the home international 
            championship as a means of generating additional revenue for the development 
            of the game.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-889.2</strong> <strong>Colin Fox: The Future of Scottish 
            Football</strong>&#8212;As an amendment to motion (S2M-889) in the 
            name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;sympathises&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;; notes the experience of successful club 
            teams such as Barcelona that are mutually owned and elect their own 
            board of directors to run the club; further notes that some clubs 
            in the English Nationwide League have already chosen this path by 
            setting up supporters&#8217; trusts, and believes that public funding 
            should be made available to allow for wider community involvement 
            in the clubs and to co-ordinate the game across Scotland.&quot;</p>
          <p><em>followed by </em>Scottish National Party debate on Nuclear Waste&#8212;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-890</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Nuclear 
            Waste</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament is concerned that policies 
            related to nuclear waste management are being discussed and debated 
            at UK and European level without significant input from Scotland; 
            believes that appropriate statutory guidance for the Scottish Environment 
            Protection Agency on radioactive discharges is urgently required, 
            and considers that decisions regarding the control, management and 
            disposal of nuclear waste material in Scotland should be a matter 
            solely for the Scottish Ministers.</p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-890.3</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson: Nuclear Waste</strong>&#8212;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-890) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, 
            leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to end and insert &quot;agrees 
            that the review of options for the long-term management of radioactive 
            waste, currently being undertaken by the Committee on Radioactive 
            Waste Management, is the correct means of engaging Scotland in the 
            debate to find a long-term publicly acceptable solution to the disposal 
            of long-lived radioactive waste and that the Scottish Executive should 
            continue to input into UK, European and international radioactive 
            waste issues and require the Scottish Environment Protection Agency 
            to implement policy such as the <em>UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges 
            2001-2020</em>.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-890.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Nuclear Waste</strong>&#8212;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-890) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, 
            leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes 
            that nuclear power capacity is vital in meeting Scotland&#8217;s future 
            energy needs; recognises technical advances in the handling and disposal 
            of the associated waste materials, and considers that the resolution 
            of nuclear waste issues and the development of new nuclear power capacity 
            can and must run in parallel, as the lengthy commissioning process 
            means that decisions about new nuclear power stations cannot be put 
            off any longer.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-890.4</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell: Nuclear Waste</strong>&#8212;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-890) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, 
            insert after &quot;Parliament&quot;, &quot;acknowledges that radioactive 
            nuclear waste for which there is no safe disposal route will remain 
            harmful to human health and the environment for many thousands of 
            years and that responsibility for nuclear waste created by this generation 
            will have to be inherited by countless future generations; considers 
            that the most important step in tackling the growing problem of nuclear 
            waste must be to stop creating the waste in the first instance; believes 
            that Scotland should not accept nuclear waste originating outside 
            Scotland and that waste arising from Scottish civil and military nuclear 
            facilities should remain on the site of the originating facility in 
            secure, monitorable and retrievable storage;&quot;.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-847</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe:</strong> <strong>VisitScotland 
            Tourist Information</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes the criticisms 
            from the tourism industry about the performance and operation of the 
            visitscotland.com website; in particular, notes the concerns among 
            some operators about the negative impact the website is having on 
            their custom due to technical problems with the site, the high cost 
            of subscription, the apparent lack of reliable information in some 
            instances and the cost in lost tourism; recognises how important tourism 
            is to the Scottish economy, and therefore considers that the Scottish 
            Executive and VisitScotland must ensure that these problems are resolved 
            ahead of the 2004 tourist season.</p>
