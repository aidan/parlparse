          <p><strong>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks in the text show the extent of alterations made.</strong></P>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1600</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Support for Marine Renewables</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government announcement that it will provide &pound;50 million to the marine energy industry and welcomes the Scottish Executive document <em>Harnessing Scotland&rsquo;s Marine Energy Potential </em>that indicates the potential for 7,000 green jobs to be created in this sector; notes that the Portuguese have committed three times this level of investment, installed grid connection infrastructure and indicated a strong interest in purchasing six wave energy converters; urges the Executive and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to ensure that the 7,000 jobs are not lost by a failure to provide the kind of investment in development and infrastructure needed to be a world leader in this technology, and calls on the Executive to put in place the necessary investment and policy, planning and fiscal framework that will ensure that the world&rsquo;s first wave-powered farm, designed and built in Scotland, is located in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1599</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Edrington Group Dispute</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the strength of feeling expressed by the workforce at the Edrington Group plant in Drumchapel in their recent strike action taken in support of their current wage claim; notes that the demands made by the GMB union on behalf of the workforce are not unreasonable, given the current conditions across the whisky industry; hopes that a fair deal that meets the legitimate aspirations of the workforce can still be brokered, and calls on the management of the Edrington Group to respond positively to the workers&rsquo; request for meaningful dialogue with the GMB union to achieve a just resolution of this dispute.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1598</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Hillhead Children&rsquo;s Garden</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the efforts of the children and parents of Hillhead Primary School in creating a children&rsquo;s garden in Glasgow Botanic Gardens that aims to give local children the chance to learn about growing fruit and vegetables; believes that projects such as these allow city children to access a piece of garden and provide an educational resource for the future; notes the support given to the project by various public and private sector funders and the practical assistance in place from Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s Land Services Department which also utilises the garden as a training resource for apprentices, and looks forward to the planting of organic apple trees at the site in the autumn.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1597</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Israel&rsquo;s Separation Wall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the 201 MPs who have signed early day motion 407, &quot;Israel&rsquo;s Separation Wall&quot;, calling on Israel to cease immediately the building of its separation wall deep within Palestinian territory; notes that the wall will be 687 km long and will leave more that 274,000 Palestinians living in 122 villages and towns either surrounded by the wall or trapped between the wall and Israel&rsquo;s internationally recognised borders, some even requiring permits from Israel to continue living in their own homes, and that an estimated further 400,000 Palestinians living east of the wall will be separated from their farms, jobs, markets, hospitals and schools, having severe humanitarian consequences for 30% of the entire Palestinian population in the West Bank; contrasts this with the fact that UN figures reveal that 54 Israeli settlements in the West Bank and 63% of settlers will be on the side of the wall next to Israel, giving Israel control over the richest agricultural land and the aquifer system which provides much of the West Bank&rsquo;s water resources; further notes that the wall is made up of concrete, razor wire and electronic fences, trenches, motion sensors, guard towers and security roads, that it costs $4.7 million per kilometre and that it violates articles 53 and 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Britain is a high-contracting party, which forbids the destruction of property and confinement of persons by an occupier; welcomes the decision of the International Court of Justice to open hearings into the legal consequences of the construction of the wall; further notes that, whilst Israel needs security, the wall does not follow internationally recognised borders; insists that it does not become a <em>de facto</em> border for a future Palestinian state; further notes that only a reinvigorated peace process with full international support will stop the violence on both sides, not an eight metre high wall, and calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to bring all available pressure to bear on Israel to cease building this wall.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1596</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Restoration of Scottish Screen Archive</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &pound;696,000 Heritage Lottery Fund award to Scottish Screen to restore around 400 hours of fragile film at risk of disintegration; notes that film to be restored includes 1896 footage of Queen Victoria at Balmoral, thought to be the first film ever shot in Scotland, and footage of life in St Kilda before evacuation, Clydebank shipping and the 1960 European Cup Final at Hampden Park; believes that historical film held in the Scottish Screen Archive is of enormous importance to the people of Scotland in documenting the social, cultural and industrial history of Scotland in the 20th century, and further welcomes plans to increase access to historic film footage to the public through the on-line catalogue and local libraries.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1595</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Good Luck to Glasgow Bands in Mercury Music Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow bands Franz Ferdinand, Belle and Sebastian and Snow Patrol on being nominated for the Mercury Music Awards to be announced on 7 September 2004; notes that Franz Ferdinand is joint favourite to win this prestigious music industry album prize and sends support and best wishes to all three bands who are competing with top artists including Basement Jaxx, Jamelia, Joss Stone, Ty, Robert Wyatt and the Zutons; further notes that the only Scottish act to win this award has been Primal Scream in 1992; believes that the nominations confirm Glasgow&rsquo;s place as a flourishing centre for contemporary music creativity, and considers that, with a quarter of the nominations being given to Scottish acts, the Scottish Executive should actively pursue the Mercury Music Awards ceremony being hosted in Scotland in the future.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1594</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Economic Damage from New York Smoking Ban</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the results of the New York Nightlife Association study, <em>The Economic Impact of the New York State Smoking Ban on New York&rsquo;s Bars</em>, that found that the state-wide smoking ban has resulted in direct economic losses in bars and taverns of 2,000 jobs which is 10.7% of bar employment, $28.5 million in wages and salary payments and $37 million in gross state product; further notes that the study showed the economic losses in businesses that supply and service bars were 2,650 jobs, $50 million in earnings and $71.5 million in gross state product; welcomes the news that state legislators are now sponsoring new legislation to allow smoking in bars where there is good ventilation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to consider the evidence of the economic impact on Scotland&rsquo;s leisure and tourist sector that any ban on smoking could have and to consider, in partnership with the licensed trade, what measures are required to improve ventilation in bars, clubs and restaurants that choose to allow smoking by customers.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1593#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>North East of Scotland Sports Facilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets that the Scottish Executive and <strong>sport</strong>scotland felt unable to come up with the monies requested by Aberdeen City Council and its partners to create modern sports facilities in the city; believes that this will compromise the project; notes that there is a dearth of top-class facilities in the north and north east of Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should rethink its decision and come up with the resources that are needed to allow this project to progress.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1592#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Debating Time for Public Petitions Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, recognising that it must reconnect with the Scottish people, considers that the&nbsp;Parliamentary Bureau, the Procedures Committee or other appropriate body should take measures to ensure that the Public Petitions Committee is allocated parliamentary time to debate petitions chosen by that committee for an appropriate number of hours each sitting month.</P>
