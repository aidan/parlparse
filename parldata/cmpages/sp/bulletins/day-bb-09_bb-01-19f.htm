<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3241</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Value of Local Newspapers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the value of local newspapers, the important role that they play in the community in delivering local news and the benefits that they bring to the local economy; is extremely concerned about the proposal of Johnston Press to close the long-established office of the <em>Kilsyth Chronicle</em>, and believes that this will severely restrict the ability of people living in Kilsyth and the surrounding villages to engage with the paper and will cause a significant reduction in advertising revenue from the Kilsyth area, placing the future viability of the<em> Kilsyth Chronicle </em>as an independent publication<em>,</em> a paper that has been published since 1890, at risk.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3240</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Generals Say Trident Completely Useless</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the UK Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to renewing the aging Trident system at a cost of &pound;20 billion and notes that the former head of the armed forces, Field Marshal Lord Bramall, argued in a letter to <em>The Times</em> on 16 January 2009, also signed by General Lord Ramsbotham and General Sir Hugh Beach, that nuclear weapons have shown themselves to be completely useless as a deterrent to the threats and scale of violence we currently face, or are likely to face, particularly international terrorism.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3239</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Partick Thistle Celebrates 100 Years in Maryhill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Partick Thistle on its 100 years&rsquo; residence at Firhill Stadium, Maryhill; notes that the team&rsquo;s first game at Firhill was played on 18 September 1909 when Thistle defeated Dumbarton Harp by three goals to one; remembers the club&rsquo;s major triumphs in the Scottish Cup Final of 1921 against Glasgow Rangers and the Scottish League Cup Final of 1971 against Glasgow Celtic; acknowledges the esteem in which the club is held by the people of Maryhill and beyond, and wishes the Maryhill Magyars every possible success during the next 100 years.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3237</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Democracy in Belarus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the European Parliament&rsquo;s resolution on the EU strategy towards Belarus, aimed at achieving greater democratisation in the country often branded Europe&rsquo;s last dictatorship and which sets out the conditions that Belarus is required to meet in order to end the country&rsquo;s self-imposed isolation from the rest of Europe, urging the Belarusian Government to respect human rights, including guaranteeing freedom for political prisoners, freedom of expression for the media and political parties, and the legal establishment of non-governmental organisations (NGOs); condemns the Belarusian Government for continuing to deny its people the basic right of freedom of speech, and urges the European Union not to renew the period of six months during which travel restrictions imposed on certain Belarusian Government officials have been lifted, unless positive steps towards greater democratisation are clearly visible.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3235</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Appointment of Chair of the Board of the Scottish Qualifications Authority</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning on Monday 12 January 2009 of the appointment of Councillor Graham Houston as chair of the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA); also notes that Councillor Houston also holds a high profile political position in a local authority and that in this role he will be called on to participate in national and local meetings where matters relating to national qualifications will be discussed; further notes that as chair of the SQA he will be called on to make decisions relating to individual schools and local authorities, including on charging policies and performance-related issues; expresses concern about the direct conflict of interest that occurs should one individual hold these two positions, this conflict arising regardless of the abilities, experience and party affiliation of the individual and which would be particularly inappropriate in the context of the management and delivery of examinations and qualifications, which should be independent of party politics, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to recognise this direct conflict of interest and to review the appointment as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3226</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>First Minister Must Set the Record Straight</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the answers given by the First Minister to Tavish Scott MSP on Thursday 8 January 2009 in the Chamber (<em>Official Report</em>, c. 13822) regarding funding for the Scottish Inter Faith Council (SIFC); notes that the First Minister stated that funding was &quot;resolved&quot;; notes that the convenor of the SIFC has indicated that the matter was not resolved at the time of the First Minister&rsquo;s statements; believes that the First Minister therefore misled the Parliament and that he should make a statement clarifying and apologising for this position; believes that the precedent has been set in previous sessions of the Parliament that the correct action for a minister who has, even inadvertently, misled the Parliament is to return to the Parliament as soon as possible to correct the inaccuracy and apologise, and that the Presiding Officer should play a constructive and appropriate role in ensuring that this happens.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3225</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Less Favoured Area Support Scheme Payments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the failure of the SNP government to ensure that Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS) payments were made before the end of 2008, which the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment undertook to work flat out to do in a parliamentary debate on 18 September 2008 (<em>Official Report</em> c. 10921); believes that the early payment of LFASS and the single farm payment in a single calendar year would ease cash-flow problems and allow Scotland&rsquo;s hard-pressed farmers and crofters to be able to plan ahead with confidence; further believes that if the correct verification measures are put in place there is no reason why payments of both LFASS and the single farm payment cannot be achieved in a single calendar year, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary to make an early announcement on how he plans to resolve this issue and what steps he is taking, in discussion with the National Farmers Union of Scotland (NFUS), to ensure that the next round of single farm payments and LFASS payments can be made in 2009.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3205&diams;</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Supporting Conventional Plant Breeding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes a growing body of evidence that Scottish farmers, crofters and growers can benefit from the results of successful experiments to produce home-grown food for both animals and humans that does not rely on transgenic modification of plant material; also welcomes the recent work of the Scottish Crop Research Institute in producing highly nutritious purple-pigmented potatoes; applauds the S&aacute;rv&aacute;ri Research Trust based at Bangor University that confirms that blight-resistant S&aacute;rpo potatoes, which were successfully trialed in the Black Isle, are suitable for Scottish conditions; recalls that the Scottish Agricultural College has backed an international research collaboration on the Green Pig project, which plans to use home-grown legume varieties to reduce reliance on imported and expensive soya bean meal and so reduce costs for Scottish livestock producers; notes the scientific analysis of Dr John Fagan of Global ID Group, which shows that although non-GM pig feed costs a bit more than GM feed because of feed-to-meat conversion efficiency when using non-GM feed the actual cost per animal is lower, and therefore believes that a conventional plant breeding policy is an essential basis for the Scottish national food and drink policy, which itself dovetails with the conclusions of the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development that small-scale farming and ecological methods provide the way forward to avert the current world food crisis.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3204</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Interest Rate Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the failure of the financial sector to adequately pass on to borrowers successive interest rate cuts made by the Bank of England; is aware that mortgage interest rates are now commonly three to four times the base rate and commercial rates often 3% or more above base rate; recognises that banks in which the UK taxpayer has a significant stake have among the highest rates of all; is aware that standard credit card interest rates now average more than 10 times the base rate and that interest on overdrafts remains at around 1.1% per month; acknowledges that savers face declining returns while borrowers continue to struggle, and urges the UK Government to exert pressure on the banking sector to reduce the burden on business and individual borrowers alike.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2935#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Cuiken Primary and its School Playing Field</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with alarm that yet another primary school playing field, at Cuiken Primary in Penicuik, is under threat of development despite Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 11 and the presumption against building on school playing fields; notes the objection of the Penicuik and District Community Council to this proposal, and believes that there should be centralised data on the current provision of school playing fields, including location and acreage, and that sportscotland would add benefit as a mandatory consultee in any development plans that impinge on school playing fields and public open spaces.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2926#</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Shelter Scotland 40 Years On</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by Shelter Scotland of the <em>40 Years On</em> booklet, which marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of Shelter Scotland on 3 October 1968; notes that throughout its existence Shelter Scotland has consistently spoken out on behalf of those who are homeless or in poor-quality housing; further notes that Shelter Scotland has been at the cutting edge of developing services, including the opening of housing aid centres, the rural housing initiative, care and repair schemes for older people, the launch of the Housing Law Service, the returning home initiative and the Rough Sleepers Initiative, and was instrumental in the establishment of housing associations in Scotland such as Castle Rock Housing Association, now Castle Rock Edinvar Housing Association; further notes that Shelter Scotland is today the largest provider of online housing advice in the country; recognises that Shelter played a key role in the development of the Homelessness Task Force, which for the first time led to the establishment of a legal commitment to give all homeless people the right to a home by 2012, and welcomes the ongoing contribution which Shelter Scotland makes in the challenge of providing good-quality housing for all in Scotland.</p>
