          <p><strong>*S1M-3938</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Social Inclusion Partnerships 
            - New Audit Arrangements</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the 
            changes in social inclusion partnership (SIP) audit arrangements imposed 
            by Communities Scotland, which will lead to SIPs having to employ 
            private firms of chartered accountants to undertake future audit work; 
            notes that this will cost the Great Northern Partnership in Aberdeen 
            at least £3,500 per annum, which will reduce the amount of work done 
            in the communities of Middlefield, Tillydrone, Fersands and Printfield 
            as it will in other socially excluded areas throughout Scotland, and 
            calls on Communities Scotland to either abandon this imposition or 
            fully fund the cost of the new arrangements.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3937</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon: Civil Service Jobs 
            Dispersal</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the progress made 
            on the dispersal of civil service jobs throughout Scotland; believes 
            that an assessment should be made of the benefits that dispersal has 
            brought to the respective local economies; notes the pending dissolution 
            of the Parliament and seeks early expedition of the timetable for 
            future dispersals to ensure further progress; acknowledges that the 
            dispersal selection criteria take account of cost, operational effectiveness, 
            social, economic and environmental considerations and the position 
            of staff, but nonetheless believes that future dispersals should ensure 
            that all communities share in the economic and social benefits of 
            the relocation policy.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3936</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon: Fair Trade Fortnight</strong>-That 
            the Parliament is committed to encouraging the use of Fair Trade products 
            and recognises the significance of the eighth annual Fair Trade Fortnight 
            from 3 to 16 March 2003 with the campaign slogan 'Trust Your Taste' 
            highlighting the quality and range of products and launching a new 
            fair trade mark; recognises the contribution that Fair Trade makes 
            to tackling poverty in the world's poorest countries through supporting 
            people to provide for their own families, and is confident that there 
            will be an increase in both the supply and purchase of Fair Trade 
            products across Scotland. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3935</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: National Galleries 
            of Scotland Bill - Preliminary Stage</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees to the general principles of the National Galleries of Scotland 
            Bill and that the bill should proceed as a private bill.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3934</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Closure of Egunkaria</strong>-That 
            the Parliament condemns the actions of the Spanish Government and 
            the Guardia Civil in closing the Basque newspaper Egunkaria and believes 
            that this attack on the democratic rights of the Basque media is an 
            unacceptable practice in the 21st century. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3933</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Current International 
            Situation</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the strength of 
            public opinion on the possibility of military action against Iraq; 
            supports the United Nations' objective to rid Iraq of weapons of mass 
            destruction; recognises that the United Nations weapons inspectors 
            must be given time to complete their investigations in Iraq; believes 
            that recourse to war should only be as a last resort after all political 
            and diplomatic channels have been exhausted, and opposes any military 
            action not sanctioned by a further resolution of the United Nations 
            Security Council and a vote on a substantive motion in the House of 
            Commons.</p>

            Nora Radcliffe, Mr Keith Raffan, Mr Mike Rumbles, Tavish Scott, Mr 
            Jamie Stone, John Farquhar Munro, Donald Gorrie</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3932</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Post Office Card 
            Accounts</strong>-That the Parliament believes that those post office 
            customers in Scotland who wish to continue receiving their benefits, 
            pensions payments and tax credits through the Post Office, following 
            the introduction of automated credit transfer in April 2003, should 
            be allowed to do so through a post office card account opened at the 
            counter of a post office or sub-post office; further believes that 
            customers should be offered a genuine choice between the options available, 
            including a post office card account; supports the National Federation 
            of SubPostmasters' call that there should be no administrative obstacles 
            to customers opening a post office card account; notes the importance 
            of post office card accounts to the future financial viability of 
            sub-post offices, and calls upon Scottish ministers to work with Her 
            Majesty's Government to ensure that there is a level playing field 
            in the marketing, promotion and advertising of the banking options 
            from all departments of Her Majesty's Government, including the Department 
            for Work and Pensions, the Inland Revenue and the Veterans Agency, 
            the Scottish Executive and its agencies and local authorities. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3931</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: The Draft Rehabilitation 
            of Offenders Act 1974 (Exclusions and Exceptions) (Scotland) Order 
            2003</strong>-That the Justice 1 Committee, in consideration of the 
            draft Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exclusions and Exceptions) 
            (Scotland) Order 2003, recommends that the Order be approved.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3930</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: The Draft General

            the Justice 2 Committee, in consideration of the draft General Commissioners 
            of Income Tax (Expenses) (Scotland) Regulations 2003, recommends that

          <p><strong>S1M-3929</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: Possible Military 
            Action Against Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow 
            City and Dundee City councils on the recent adoption of resolutions 
            against the possible war on Iraq; recognises that, whilst this is 
            ultimately an issue reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament, it 
            remains both the right and responsibility of every elected body within 
            the United Kingdom to express the concerns of their electors; joins 
            with both Glasgow City and Dundee City councils in considering that 
            a pre-emptive attack on Iraq is neither necessary nor justified, and 
            acknowledges that any such unilateral military action contravenes 
            international law and poses a significant threat to international 
            peace and stability.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John McAllion, Dorothy-Grace Elder<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-3928</strong> <strong>Mr John McAllion: Anti-war Demonstration 
            on 15 February 2003</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 
            Scottish Coalition for Justice not War for organising the magnificent 
            anti-war demonstration in Glasgow on 15 February 2003; salutes the 
            nearly 100,000 Scots that raised their voice against any attack on 
            the people of Iraq; recognises that they represent the true voice 
            of the people of Scotland, and therefore calls on Her Majesty's Government 
            to use its influence in the UN Security Council to negotiate for a 
            peaceful solution to the current crisis.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Elaine Smith, Dorothy-Grace Elder<strong>*</strong></p>

            Language Teaching and Research, University of Stirling, in collaboration 
            with Aberdeen City Council; notes with interest the overall aim of 
            the project for children to achieve a good level of literacy and numeracy 
            in both English and French by the end of their primary education; 
            congratulates the project co-ordinators on the success of the project 
            thus far, whereby primary 2 children are able to communicate and process 
            basic French; applauds the teachers, parents, co-ordinators and pupils 
            for their enthusiasm and dedication to the project; recognises the 
            importance of our young people being exposed to a European language; 
            notes the benefits that such language proficiency will have for their 
            future education and employment prospects; wishes the project every 
            success in its next phase, and calls for consideration to be given 
            to rolling the project out to other areas of Scotland.</p>

            for peace&quot; campaign by CND whereby members of the public may 
            wear a white peace ribbon to show their opposition to a war on Iraq; 
            notes that proceeds from the sale of ribbons are going into a legal 
            fund that may be used to bring ministers of Her Majesty's Government 
            before the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity 
            in the event that Iraqi civilians are killed or injured as a direct 
            or indirect result of an attack on Iraq, and urges members of the

            the strength of public opposition to any support for unilateral US 
            military action against Iraq as evidenced by the mass protests that 
            took place in Glasgow and elsewhere across the UK and worldwide on 
            15 February 2003 and believes that a pre-emptive attack on Iraq is 
            neither necessary nor justified and would be in contravention of international

            of the United States of America on the Glenfiddich Havana Reserve 
            single malt entering the United States; notes the absurdity of banning 
            a Scotch malt on the grounds that it is matured in Cuban rum barrels; 
            further notes that this ban highlights the absurdity and iniquity 
            of the oppressive Helms Burton Act that seeks to punish any contact 
            or trade with Cuba, and looks forward to closer links between Scotland 
            and Cuba through trade, tourism and ties of friendship.</p>

            call centre responsible for the recovery of benefit overpayments; 
            further notes that to date there has been no consultation with staff 
            or users of this office; is concerned that the closure of the only 
            social security office in Glasgow city centre will result in increased 
            travel for the 6,000 claimants who rely on it for benefits advice 
            and over-the-counter payments, and calls on the management of Job

            in winning the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education, a prize 
            which is awarded in recognition of excellence, initiative and innovation;

            Scotland's leading Gaelic education college, and considers that the

            the Parliament notes the overwhelming feeling in Scotland against 
            unilateral or bilateral military action in Iraq; notes the scale of 
            the anti-war demonstrations across the world on Saturday 15 February 
            2003 and, in particular, notes that almost 100,000 people took to 
            the streets of Glasgow to express their opposition to the inevitable 
            path to war currently being taken by the Governments of the United 
            Kingdom and the United States of America; supports the role of the 
            United Nations and the rule of international law in dealing with this 
            crisis, and shares the contempt felt by the people of Scotland towards 
            the murderous Iraqi regime but recognises the overwhelming view of 
            the people that the rush to war must be halted in the name of peace 
            and world security. </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3908.1</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Not In Our Name</strong>-As

            <a name="AmendmentText">leave out from &quot;role&quot; to end and 
            insert &quot;rule of international law in dealing with this crisis; 
            shares the contempt felt by the people of Scotland towards the murderous 
            Iraqi regime but recognises the overwhelming view of the people that 
            the rush to war must be halted in the name of peace and world security; 
            further notes the need for a world forum to represent and articulate 
            the views of the nations throughout the world, but believes that the 
            United Nations (UN) in its current form does not adequately perform 
            the role because of the ability of the Government of the United States 
            of America (USA) to bribe and coerce the UN to secure its will or 
            to proceed unilaterally if it is unable to do so, and believes that 
            the 191 countries of the UN should be allowed democratic votes from 
            across the world rather than be dominated by the USA, which represents 
            only 5% of the world's population, because the evidence currently 
            shows that bombing Iraq is unjust and immoral, regardless of UN resolutions.&quot;</a>

            to endorse overwhelmingly a motion on ethical investment during its 
            general meeting; congratulates students that have chosen to highlight 
            the issue on the university campus by campaigning that the University 
            of Edinburgh's investments of £160 million should be invested only 
            in ethical companies that do not flout human rights, exploit workers, 
            pollute heavily or irresponsibly sell armaments; welcomes the decision 
            of the University Court to make available previously confidential 
            information about investments as a first step in achieving these aims 
            but considers that the University of Edinburgh should go further by 
            developing a fully accountable ethical investment policy, and believes 
            that other universities in the United Kingdom should develop similar 
            policies based on the shared values of their staff and students.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3647#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: Wick Ambulance 
            Service</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">recognises 
            the vital work of the Wick ambulance service; is concerned at the 
            lack of additional funding that was made available to the Highlands 
            from the £22 million the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) received 
            for modernisation; notes the long on-call working regime that means 
            ambulance crews are often on duty for as much as 20 hours at a time 
            and are routinely required to make long journeys of over 200 miles; 
            is further concerned that crews suffer from sleep deprivation, possibly 
            endangering themselves, their passengers and other road users, and 
            asks the Scottish Executive and the SAS to urgently review the on-call 
            working arrangements at Wick Ambulance Station, where staff are paid 
            less than 90p per hour for being on-call, with a view to upgrading 
            it from part-time on-call to full-time. </a></p>
