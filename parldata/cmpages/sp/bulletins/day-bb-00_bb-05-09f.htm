    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-818</b> <strong>Mr Alex Salmond: State of the Nation</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes that in its first year many members working in committees, in the whole
    Parliament and in their constituencies have been active in moving Scotland forward;
    regrets that the Executive has failed to match the positive approach of Scotland during
    the referendum campaign of 1997 and the continuing mood of Scotland for radical change and
    progress, notes that in particular there is a crisis in manufacturing, a reduction in
    local authority services including housing, a lowering of morale in the education and
    health services, growing impoverishment of the elderly, the reliance on expensive PFI for
    public investment, a deterioration in the transport infrastructure, the abdication of
    responsibility for genuine consultation and good governance and a general confusion and
    malaise in the partnership administration; recognises the support of a majority of Scots
    for increased power for our Parliament to tackle these problems, notes that independence
    and equality of status is the best possible constitutional settlement for our nation, and
    looks forward to offering the people of Scotland the opportunity to choose a future of
    economic progress and social justice based on such a settlement.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-817</b> <strong>Michael Russell: Edinburgh College of Art</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh College of Art where students in different artistic
    disciplines can meet and exchange ideas; notes that part of its success is due to its city
    centre location; notes the current proposals for the College to be subsumed into Heriot
    Watt University; expresses concern that no merger should be driven by the real estate
    value of the present college site or lead to the fragmentation of the art college campus;
    further notes that recent ballots shows that six out seven students and 70% of
    non-academic staff are against the merger, and urges the Scottish Executive to acknowledge
    these issues before agreeing to any merger or change of status for the College. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-816</b> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson: Committee on Substance Abuse</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament agrees to establish a committee on substance abuse with members drawn from
    the Committees for Social Inclusion, Housing and Voluntary Sector, Justice and Home
    Affairs, Health and Community Care, Education, Culture and Sport, and any other relevant
    committee. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-815</b> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Safer Routes to Schools</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that in 1998 597 children were involved in accidents on their way to
    and from school; further notes the Scottish Executive document <i>Guidance How to Run
    Safer Routes to School</i>,<i> </i>recognises that the implementation of this document by
    local authorities in partnership with schools, parents, children, the police, health
    authorities and local communities could drastically reduce the number of accidents;
    congratulates Stirling Council for its commitment to &quot;Safer Routes to School&quot;
    and urges the Scottish Executive to do everything in its power to ensure that such schemes
    are implemented around Scotland.</p>
