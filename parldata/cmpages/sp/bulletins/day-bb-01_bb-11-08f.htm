          <p><strong>*S1M-2426#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie: BT plc Sales Marketing 
            Policy</strong>-That the Parliament notes newspaper reports alleging 
            that British Telecommunications plc has issued instructions to employees 
            not to undertake sales marketing in Dundee and Kelty on the grounds 
            that these areas are not &quot;posh&quot; enough; is concerned at

            communities across Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John McAllion<strong>*</strong></p>

            Courts (Scotland) Act 1971 (Private Jurisdiction and Summary Cause) 
            Order 2001</strong>-That the Justice 2 Committee recommends that the 
            draft Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971 (Private Jurisdiction and 
            Summary Cause) Order 2001 be approved.</p>

            Order 2001 be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2422</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Scotland's Oil</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that the Brent oil field in the North Sea is 
            25 years of age and is conservatively expected to be in production 
            for a further 25 years; further notes the pessimistic predictions 
            made by some unionist politicians during the 1970s that Scotland's 
            oil would not last long and would be finished before the decade was 
            out, and draws comparison between Scotland and Alaska on how oil wealth 
            has been used to benefit the citizens of both countries by highlighting 
            that in Alaska every citizen enjoys an annual dividend of $1,850.88 
            which they are free to spend as they see fit whereas in Scotland, 
            the oil producer of the European Union, our children are born to fail 
            in higher numbers proportionately than elsewhere in the EU.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, Mr Lloyd Quinan<strong>*</strong>, 
            Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Ms Margo MacDonald<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2421</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Trade Union and 
            Employee Negotiations</strong>-That the Parliament is deeply concerned 
            at the growing number of job losses in Renfrewshire and elsewhere 
            in the West of Scotland; believes that companies experiencing difficulties 
            in domestic and international markets must take their loyal and hard-working 
            employees into their trust when difficult or harsh decisions have 
            to be taken; urges all companies to engage in honest and forthright 
            negotiations with both employees and their trade unions in order to 
            ensure reasonable settlements, retraining and redeployment for those 
            who regrettably lose their jobs, and condemns the small minority of 
            companies that obstinately refuse to engage in constructive dialogue 
            on such serious matters with employees and trade union representatives.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2420</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Disabled Drivers 
            and Supermarkets</strong>-That the Parliament commends the campaign 
            by the Baywatch Campaign, British Polio Fellowship, the Disabled Drivers' 
            Association, the Disabled Drivers' Motor Club and Disability Now to 
            give more protection to disabled parking bays in supermarket car parks; 
            deplores the selfishness of other drivers who occupy such spaces with 
            their own cars, and welcomes the initiatives taken by Asda, Safeway, 
            Sainsbury's and Tesco to tackle this problem in a much more effective 
            way than has been the case in the past.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2419</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Incompetence of 
            the North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust's incompetent 
            handling of the 16-month-long medical secretaries' dispute, the relocation 
            of the Stobhill Hospital and the mismanagement of the Beatson Oncology 
            Unit; expresses its deepest concern over the conduct of the Trust 
            board, and calls for a full inquiry to be conducted as soon as possible. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2418</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Bicycle Helmets</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that the majority of deaths in cycling accidents 
            occur as a result of head injuries; recognises that wearing a correctly 
            fitted helmet has been shown to reduce the risk of severe head injury 
            by 63 to 88%; further recognises that cost is a major barrier, particularly 
            for families on a low income, and therefore calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to promote a campaign of responsible cycling, including 
            dissemination of information on wearing helmets correctly and measures 
            to reduce the cost of bicycle helmets to the public.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2412.1</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Conduct of the 
            First Minister</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2412) in the 
            name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;and calls upon&quot; 
            and insert &quot;and recommends that the Standards Committee conduct 
            a full and thorough investigation of the First Minister in relation 
            to the <em>Code of Conduct for Members of the Scottish Parliament</em>, 
            paragraph 1.2 of Section 1, which states &quot;The Scottish electorate 
            has a high expectation of members of the Scottish Parliament and the 
            way in which they should act in their relationships with their constituents 
            and in the Parliament. Members must meet those expectations by ensuring 
            that their conduct is above reproach and worthy of the trust of the 
            electorate.&quot; and paragraph 1.3, which states &quot;The word 'Integrity' 
            is inscribed on the mace which is a symbol of authority of the Parliament; 
            it is one of a number of principles which must be observed in all 
            that members do.&quot; &quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2412.2</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: Conduct of 
            the First Minister</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2412) in 
            the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;regrets&quot; to 
            end and insert &quot;believes that the First Minister has failed to 
            respect these principles in his actions during the last few months 
            in relation to the issue of his constituency office expenses; further 
            believes that this has severely damaged the credibility of the First 
            Minister and has broken the bond of trust that must exist between 
            the First Minister and the Scottish public and that this, added to 
            the incompetence which he has exhibited during this affair, renders 
            his position untenable, and calls upon him to resign.&quot; </p>

            Disease - Public Inquiry</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2409) 
            in the name of Alex Fergusson, leave out from &quot;calls on&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;welcomes the cross-party approach towards 
            the policy adopted in Scotland to eradicate the foot-and-mouth disease 
            epidemic, but believes that it is essential that all lessons are learned 
            by means of a full, open and independently convened public inquiry 
            in Scotland and that it is important to monitor closely the impact 
            of the crisis upon the whole Scottish economy and, in particular, 
            upon those regions of Scotland most affected by the outbreak.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2409.2</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Foot-and-Mouth 
            Disease</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2409) in the name 
            of Alex Fergusson, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out from &quot;calls 
            on&quot; to end and insert &quot;, recognising the need for independent 
            scrutiny of the handling of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, supports 
            the participation of the Scottish Executive in the Royal Society inquiry, 
            the Anderson &quot;Lessons Learnt&quot; inquiry and the Royal Society 
            of Edinburgh inquiry and believes that these inquiries provide ample 
            opportunities for all interested parties to contribute to the process.</a>
