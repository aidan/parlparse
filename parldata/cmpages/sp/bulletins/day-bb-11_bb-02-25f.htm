<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-8016 Helen Eadie: Children&rsquo;s Parliament, Fife</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Fife members of the Children&rsquo;s Parliament for what it considers their successful Who We Are project, which was recently showcased in the Scottish Parliament; recognises the hard work and effort of the pupils that went into creating their papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; models showing how they view themselves in 20 years&rsquo; time; thanks the staff of the Children&rsquo;s Parliament who organised this project; considers that they work tirelessly to help Scottish children realise their potential, and hopes that the work of the Children&rsquo;s Parliament can continue long into the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8015 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Marie Curie Hospice, Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Marie Curie Hospice, Edinburgh, for organising a fundraising trek to the Grand Canyon, USA; highlights that the 80 km trek, scheduled to take place from 8 to 15 October 2011, is open to anyone hoping to explore the magnificent landscape of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River while raising what it considers to be important funds for the hospice, which treats more than 3,500 patients each year; recognises that many of those taking part, including Suzanne Hall, are taking part in support or memory of a loved one with or who has had cancer; further highlights what it believes to be the great and admirable services carried out by the staff and volunteers at the Marie Curie Hospice Edinburgh; wishes them every success with their fundraising trek, and notes that further information about the trek can be found at www.mariecurie.org.uk/en-gb/events/hospice-challenges/Edinburgh-hospice-Grand-Canyon.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8014 Dave Thompson: The People&rsquo;s Bible</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the initiative of the Scottish Bible Society to produce a <em>People&rsquo;s Bible</em> as part of the 400th anniversary of the <em>Bible</em> commissioned by a Scottish king; welcomes the opportunity provided by the travelling road show in Scotland, England and Wales, to bring people together from diverse sections of our society as they transcribe verses from the <em>Bible</em> in their own handwriting; acknowledges that these handwritten passages will be reproduced online resulting in the entire <em>Bible</em> being available as a product of the people of today; hopes that this initiative may be a catalyst for a renewed interest in reading the scriptures for the participants, and encourages the spirit of religious tolerance throughout Scotland and indeed the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8013 Cathie Craigie: Scottish Sensory Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses regret at the recent decision to cease funding for the Scottish Sensory Centre (SSC) at the University of Edinburgh as of 31 March 2011; places on record its appreciation for the work of the SSC since the early 1990s in delivering training and promoting innovative practice in the specialist training of teachers of deaf children, visually impaired children and deafblind children; is concerned at the apparent lack of consultation on the decision with the SSC and wider stakeholders, and calls on the Scottish Government to confirm its future plans for the ongoing continuing professional development and mandatory training programmes for specialist teachers of sensory-impaired children in Scotland as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8012 James Kelly: The Legal Aid and Advice and Assistance (Solicitors&rsquo; Travel Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Legal Aid and Advice and Assistance (Solicitors&rsquo; Travel Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2011 (SSI 2011/41).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8011 Mary Scanlon: The National Health Service (Free Prescriptions and Charges for Drugs and Appliances) (Scotland) Regulations 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Health and Sport Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the National Health Service (Free Prescriptions and Charges for Drugs and Appliances) (Scotland) Regulations 2011 (SSI/2011/55).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8010 Bill Kidd: Work Capability Assessment is a Complete Mess</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern following the reported news in the <em>Guardian</em> that Professor Paul Gregg, an architect of employment and support allowance (ESA) is of the opinion that the work capability assessment (WCA) test for ESA &quot;is badly malfunctioning. The current assessment is a complete mess&quot; and calls on the UK Government to further review, reform and fully test the WCA to make it much more sensitive to what sick and vulnerable people can and cannot do before rolling it out nationally to people currently on incapacity benefit.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8009 Bruce Crawford (Stirling) (SNP) on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Substitution on Committee&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees that David McLetchie be appointed to replace John Lamont as the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party substitute on the Justice Committee.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-8006 Christine Grahame: Swim Team Borders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Swim Team Borders on its recent successes at district and national levels and the dedication of the coach, young swimmers and their families, some of whom attend nine training sessions per week; considers that proposals to close pools in the Borders would have a detrimental effect on Swim Team Borders&rsquo; progress; acknowledges the benefits to mental and physical health that come from the activity of swimming; further considers that closing pools would have a detrimental effect on the wider community, and backs Borders GPs who have voiced their strenuous opposition to any proposed closures, warning that the bill stored up for future generations in healthcare costs if exercise opportunities dwindle will dwarf current financial difficulties in the NHS and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8005 Hugh Henry on behalf of the Public Audit Committee: Session 3 Reports of the Public Audit Committee, Key Themes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Public Audit Committee&rsquo;s 1st Report, 2011 (Session 3): <em>Session 3 reports of the Public Audit Committee &ndash;</em> <em>key themes</em> (SP Paper 559).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8004 Jim Hume: Galashiels Town Band</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges what it sees as the hard work of the Galashiels Town Band; further acknowledges what is considered to be the excellent entertainment provided by the band for the people of Galashiels since 1834; also congratulates Galashiels Town Band on its fundraising campaign and wishes it well in further fundraising, and recognises the importance of such bands to local communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8003 Linda Fabiani: 35th Anniversary of the Declaration of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 27 February 2011 will be the 35th anniversary of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR); considers that, although this is cause for some celebration by the Sahrawi people, there is still no just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution that provides for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara; believes that, as the current mandate of the United Nations precludes human rights&rsquo; protection, monitoring and reporting, the role of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) should be thus widened, and expresses solidarity on this 35th anniversary with the Sahrawi people and their demand for a free and fair referendum that allows them to decide their future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7996 Ian McKee: Scotland Needs Minimum Pricing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the findings of NHS Scotland&rsquo;s alcohol statistics 2011 report showing that Scots drink far higher quantities of alcohol than their counterparts in the rest of the United Kingdom; observes that the report, published every two years to give an account of Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol, relates to data from 2009 and reveals that in that year Scots drank the equivalent of 11.9 litres of alcohol per person over the age of 16 compared with 9.6 litres per person in England and Wales; further notes that *the number of alcohol-related deaths* has doubled in Scotland over the past 20 years *and that* more than 100 alcohol-related hospital admissions *are reported* each day; expresses further concern at the increase in alcohol-related deaths in women and in the 8% increase in the number of alcohol-related discharges from psychiatric hospitals; highlights that 54% of men and women drink the most alcohol at home and that off-license sales have increased year on year; considers that Scotland&rsquo;s drink culture will not change unless concrete action is taken to increase the price of alcohol, and believes that, if the SNP government&rsquo;s proposals for minimum unit pricing had been passed, fewer people would be suffering the consequences of cheap alcohol and progress to save lives and reduce alcohol-related hospital admissions would already be underway.</p>
