<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3688</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Support for the Govanhill Baths Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the development of the business plan by Govanhill Baths Trust in response to the future use of the former Calder Street Baths site in Govanhill, Glasgow; acknowledges the spirit and commitment of the community and volunteers in putting together their business plan along with the professional advice of Nord Architecture; recognises that the health and wellbeing centre proposed would be of major benefit not just to the Govanhill area but also the wider southside of Glasgow; calls on all possible funding agencies to consider the business plan in a positive way, and further calls on the Scottish Government to consider the business plan as an application that is of merit and to consider providing exceptional funding to the Govanhill Baths Trust through end-year flexibility funding.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3687</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Royal Mail&rsquo;s Threat to Lifeline Postbus Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the valuable social role that the Postbus service plays in remote areas of the west and north Highlands; therefore notes with regret the decision by the Royal Mail to withdraw the three postbus routes in the west Highlands from Diaper to Achnasheen, Applecross to Torridon and Torridon to Strathcarron and two routes in the far north of Scotland from Thurso to Tongue and Tongue to Bettyhill; considers that the Royal Mail is unwilling to negotiate further with Highland Council over this matter and continues to avoid the issue, and asks the Scottish Government to step in and secure the Postbus service, which is vital to many people in these communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3686</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>20th Anniversary of Cumbernauld Action Care for the Elderly</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Cumbernauld Action Care for the Elderly (CACE) on reaching its 20th anniversary in 2009; recognises the important work that the organisation has carried out over the last two decades, supporting and encouraging the senior citizens of Cumbernauld to make the most of their later years; notes that official celebrations will mark the anniversary on 21 April in Cumbernauld Town Hall, and looks forward to many more years of dedicated service to the older people of Cumbernauld from CACE.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3685</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Norway&rsquo;s &pound;10 Billion Investment to Combat the Credit Crunch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes proposals from the Government of Norway to establish two new funds with a total capital of NOK100 billion (approximately &pound;10 billion), designed to improve access to loans for companies and households and to help stabilise the financial market; further notes the range of measures that the Government of Norway, which is an independent country with a population comparable to that of Scotland, has taken to insulate the country&rsquo;s economy against the global economic downturn; considers that there is no evidence whatsoever that Norway is, or is about to become, insolvent, and therefore believes that the actions of the Government of Norway are an example of why independence for Scotland is even more necessary in the face of global recession.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3684</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant:</strong> <strong>Rejection for Proposals for a Separate Quota Management and Licensing System</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament rejects the SNP government&rsquo;s proposals for a separate quota management and licensing system, which are potentially damaging to the fishing industry; believes that the proposals create new bureaucracy for fishermen; calls on the Scottish Government to publish any legal advice that they have taken on the competence of the proposals; urges the Scottish Government to take a coordinated approach with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government and the devolved administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland to develop a marine strategy for the benefit of the fishing industry and marine conservation, and calls on the Scottish Government to encourage cooperation between all sectors, including local fishing communities, to enable them to work to develop regional fisheries management and also work with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to ensure reform of the Common Fisheries Policy to enable the devolution of decision making to regional management structures.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3683</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>EU Vote on Genetically Modified Organisms</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the vote by EU environment ministers to maintain the right of individual countries to impose bans on genetically modified&nbsp;(GM) organisms; notes that the right to ban was upheld by an overwhelming majority of 22 out of the 27 member states; expresses deep regret that UK ministers voted in favour of the European Commission&rsquo;s attempts to force Austria and Hungary to lift their bans; accepts that the UK Government&rsquo;s pro-GM position is at odds with the bulk of public and political opinion throughout Europe, including in Scotland, and supports the continued rejection of all GM farming in Scotland as a vital protection for farmers, the food they grow, wildlife and Scotland&rsquo;s public health.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3682</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>University of St Andrews Fundraising Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the multi-million pound fundraising campaign by the University of St Andrews, launched by its new principal, Dr Louise Richardson, to mark the university&rsquo;s 600th anniversary; applauds the university&rsquo;s aim to create bursaries to attract talented students from poor backgrounds; notes its efforts in trying to raise funds rather than rely on government handouts, and urges graduates of the university and all those who support it to back the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3681</strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Govanhill International Women&rsquo;s Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Govan Integration Network and its member organisations for their outstanding work in organising an international women&rsquo;s day event on 10 March 2009 at Govanhill Neighbourhood Centre; acknowledges that the free event offered workshops, spa treatments and information stalls with many useful resources; notes that the event was very well attended by local women from diverse age, ethnic and cultural groups, and salutes the organisations instrumental in its planning, including Crossroads Youth and Community Association, Glasgow City Council, Culture and Sport Glasgow, Glasgow South East Regeneration Agency, Home-Start, Karibu and Govanhill Social Inclusion Project.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3680</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>White-coated Roe Deer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by reports in <em>The Sunday Times</em> on 9 March 2009 that a rare white-coated roebuck discovered on an estate in Dumfriesshire is being auctioned by the person owning the stalking rights for the estate; understands that deer numbers need to be controlled and that stalking is a legitimate way of undertaking such control; but believes that targeting an individual animal because of its rarity is unacceptable, and further believes that this animal will make a far greater contribution to nature tourism and the local economy if it is allowed to survive rather than if it is shot by the highest bidder.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3679</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Glasgow City Council Announces &pound;7 Minimum Wage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Glasgow City Council, Scotland&rsquo;s largest local authority, to pay its staff a new minimum wage of &pound;7 per hour; notes that this move will boost the wages of the lowest paid staff by more than &pound;1,100 a year; further notes that up to 80,000 workers in Glasgow earn less than &pound;7 per hour and that this move has the potential to improve the lives of thousands of families across the city; acknowledges that the decision follows a similar successful scheme in London, and recognises that the national minimum wage was introduced by the UK Labour government without the support of other parties.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3678</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Wales Can, The Independence Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of <a href="http://www.walescan.com/" target="_blank">www.walescan.com</a>, Plaid Cymru&rsquo;s new website to promote the debate about independence for Wales; notes that the site features a collection of films and articles by prominent Welsh politicians and commentators discussing the future of Wales and the kind of nation that they envisage Wales becoming; believes that the launch of the site demonstrates growing confidence among people in Wales for greater autonomy and powers for the National Assembly for Wales, and looks forward to continuing, alongside the National Assembly for Wales, on the journey to independence.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3677</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Red Cross Holyrood Update</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the British Red Cross&rsquo;s most recent edition of <em>Holyrood Update</em>; notes that the Red Cross has responded to recent international emergencies in Zimbabwe and Gaza with an appeal to help thousands of people affected by cholera and food shortages in Zimbabwe, raising &pound;280,300 so far, and an appeal in response to the humanitarian situation in Gaza that had raised &pound;77,800 by 22 January 2009 when the organisation joined an appeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee, and congratulates the Global Glasgow Youth Project for its work with vulnerable young people in South Africa and for its overall group award at the British Red Cross Humanitarian Citizen Awards.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3675.1</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Minimum Income Guarantee for Students</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3675) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave out from &quot;its proposals&quot; to end and insert &quot;all of its proposals for not adequately addressing student hardship; expresses serious concern at reports of childcare and hardship funds being stretched to breaking point across colleges and universities in Scotland; recognises the calls of the NUS and other student representatives for a &pound;7,000 minimum income guarantee but believes that a &pound;7,000 minimum income for all students in Scotland is unachievable with the funds allocated for student support by the Scottish Government in this spending review period, and calls on the Scottish Government to come forward with new proposals that focus the available resources at the poorest students to genuinely address student hardship in Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3675.2</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Minimum Income Guarantee for Students</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3675) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave out from &quot;made up&quot; to end and insert &quot;, and to revisit its decision not to honour the SNP manifesto pledge to abolish student debt during this parliamentary session.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3675.3</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Minimum Income Guarantee for Students</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3675) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert <strong>&quot;</strong>notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation on student support, Supporting a Smarter Scotland, which closes on 30 April 2009, and the proposals it outlines, including a minimum income guarantee; further notes that under the previous administration student debt doubled between 1999 and 2006; welcomes the falls in average student debt achieved as a result of the enhanced support on offer from the Scottish Government; further welcomes the restoration of the principle of free education with the abolition of the graduate endowment fee; commends the Scottish Government on the introduction of a &pound;38 million package of grants for part-time learners, replacing loans with grants for up to 20,000 students per year; congratulates the Scottish Government on the 14.6% increase in student hardships funds over the last two years; further welcomes the additional support that has been made available for students with disabilities, and calls on the Scottish Government to respond positively to the outcome of the consultation.<strong>&quot;</strong></p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3674.1</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Crossrail</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3674) in the name of Alison McInnes, after &quot;region&quot; insert &quot;and for the wider national transport network in Scotland&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3674.2</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Crossrail</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3674) in the name of Alison McInnes, leave out from &quot;with commuter&quot; to end and insert &quot;; notes the comments of NESTRANS, previously chaired by Alison McInnes MSP, in its regional transport strategy, that &quot;it is clear that improved rail services can only realistically be delivered on an incremental basis and in a way that capitalises on existing planned investment&quot;; welcomes the recent improvements to the timetable, meaning that there is now a significantly better service north of Aberdeen than was the case when Nicol Stephen MSP and Tavish Scott MSP were ministers for transport; considers that proposals contained in the Strategic Projects Transport Review to improve services north and south of Aberdeen must be progressed as a priority as a key means of securing better crossrail services; welcomes the forthcoming opening of Laurencekirk station and considers that plans to open Kintore station should now be taken forward; further considers that local agencies should work together to build strong cases for the opening of stations at Newtonhill and Altens; notes with regret the very poor stewardship of rail projects under successive Liberal Democrat transport ministers, notably the significant cost overruns and delays that blighted the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line and the managerial paralysis at the heart of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link, and regrets the additional investment for projects such as Aberdeen Crossrail that has been lost as a result of this mismanagement.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3674.3</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Crossrail</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3674) in the name of Alison McInnes, leave out from &quot;which would&quot; to end and insert&nbsp;&quot;which is being tackled incrementally by the introduction of new services from Inverurie, the opening of Laurencekirk station, the re-timetabling of other services and the bringing forward of work on Kintore station; believes that this incremental approach delivers early and cost-effective benefits to rail services across Aberdeen; recognises that the introduction of additional stops increases journey times and can, in certain circumstances, reduce the viability of services overall; welcomes the real progress being made by the Scottish Government after years of inaction, and looks forward to further rail investment in the north as announced in the Strategic Transport Projects Review.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3626*#*</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Credit Unions, Pioneering Roles in the Community</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the important role of credit unions within the Glasgow Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and throughout Scotland; in particular, congratulates Pollok Credit Union on its unique and pioneering decision to set up an enterprise trust to take over the running of Pollok Post Office, manage a daycare nursery and offer a budgeting service to those with multiple debt problems, thereby securing jobs and services in the local community and beyond; recognises the real opportunity that these partnerships can provide in offering financial services and money advice to communities feeling the impact of economic recession, and considers that all possible ways by which further such enterprises can be encouraged should be explored.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3625</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>25th Anniversary of the Miners&rsquo; Strike</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that March 2009 marks the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the 1984-85 miners&rsquo; strike, with the announcement of the closure of 20 pits across the United Kingdom being made on 6 March 1984 and the strike in Scotland starting on 12 March 1984; believes that the strike represented a defining moment in the history of industrial relations across the UK; regrets the damage inflicted upon the trade union movement by Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s government at the time; recognises the devastating immediate effect and lasting damage caused to communities across Scotland by pit closures; notes that at the peak of the strike over 90% of Scottish miners had walked out, demonstrating the massive solidarity in Scotland for the miners&rsquo; cause, and hopes that no government ever again shows the contempt to organised workers shown to the miners by the Conservative government of the day.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3625.1</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>25th Anniversary of the Miners&rsquo; Strike</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3625) in the name of Jamie Hepburn, leave out from &quot;; regrets&quot; to end and insert &quot;with the eventual outcome ensuring that the country would thereafter be governed by the Government as opposed to a collection of militant trade union barons and left wing rabble-rousers; considers that the ballot-less and illegal strikes were rightly opposed at the time by the Labour party under the leadership of Neil Kinnock and urges everyone to reflect on this fact before attempting to rewrite history for political advantage; fully acknowledges the suffering experienced by local communities during this period but also considers that the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) busied itself concealing millions of pounds that could have been used to ameliorate this suffering in order to avoid potential sequestration as a consequence of its illegal actions; believes that Arthur Scargill was directly and personally responsible for the demise of the NUM and therefore finds it deeply ironic that he remains Life President of the NUM to this day; welcomes the fact that this period of economic restructuring transformed the country into a fully fledged, modern, free market economy subsequently used as a blueprint for success the world over, and therefore pays tribute to the Thatcher government for having had the determination, resolve and foresight to make these reforms when it did and for the period of unprecedented economic expansion, wealth creation and personal and economic liberty that followed.&quot;</p>
