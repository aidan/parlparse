<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3786</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3785</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Human Tissue (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Human Tissue (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3783</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Joint Inspection of Children&rsquo;s Services and Inspection of Social Work Services (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Joint Inspection of Children&rsquo;s Services and Inspection of Social Work Services (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robert Brown<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3782#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Borders Carers Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the essential and unsung role of many young people who act as carers, young people who require our support; notes that there are currently 180 such young people supported by the Borders Young Carers Project in Galashiels, although 300 young carers have been identified; further notes that their age ranges from 6 to 18 and that they are among the most vulnerable young people with 42% of referrals from social work, 20% from health and 10% from education services; recognises that the Princess Royal Trust for Carers has recently estimated that there are approximately 2,000 young carers in the Scottish Borders alone; is alarmed that the current shortfall for generic work is some &pound;64,000 and some &pound;28,000 for drug and alcohol work, and believes that the Scottish Executive should liaise with the appropriate agencies in the Scottish Borders to provide adequate and secure funding for this essential service.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3781</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Financial Education by CAB Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates CAB Scotland on the invaluable assistance it provides, noting in particular the financial education projects including one in Haddington established to help vulnerable people to avoid debt problems, and notes that the bureaux work with agencies such as NHS boards, credit unions and specialist charities; considers that these schemes should be expanded, given that money and debt problems account for the majority of enquiries at advice bureaux accounting for some 12% of all enquiries amounting to some 50,000 enquiries in the year 2004-05, and further recommends that the Scottish Executive fund outreach programmes from CABs into secondary schools to provide young people who are vulnerable to credit card inducements with basic but essential awareness of the ease of falling into consumer debt.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3780</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Christmas Card Recycling Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 100 million Christmas and New Year greetings cards are thrown away by Scottish households in the days following New Year; welcomes the Christmas Card Recycling Scheme promoted by the Woodland Trust Scotland and supported by the Scottish Waste Awareness Group (SWAG); urges people to help achieve a target of 6 million cards recycled by taking their cards to special recycling bins placed in WH Smith and Tesco stores from 2 to 31 January 2006; encourages people who do not traditionally recycle their waste to participate in the scheme and make recycling part of their daily lives all year round, and notes that the funds raised from the scheme will help to save woods and trees.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3779</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Potential New Gas Fields</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the contents of the report by Professor Alex Kemp on the viability of tapping into 23 potential gas fields in the Atlantic, which are believed to contain 3 trillion cubic feet of gas; further notes that Professor Kemp&rsquo;s study, which was carried out before the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s oil tax hike, makes it clear that these fields are marginal; recognises that supplies to western Europe are extremely precarious after Russia&rsquo;s recent decision to switch off its gas pipeline, leading to the European Union holding talks on developing a new strategy on energy security, and calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to take a strategic overview of the current situation and to review its shambolic tax policies which are impacting on oil and gas exploration.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3778</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Draft Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 (Licensing of Skin Piercing and Tattooing) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the draft Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 (Licensing of Skin Piercing and Tattooing) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3777</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Safety of Christmas Lights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls for an immediate and urgent review of the safety of Christmas lights including an assessment of the fire risk that certain brands may pose with a view to taking whatever action may be necessary to restrict the sale of any brands which are deemed to be insufficiently safe.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3776</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Lowering the Drink-Driving Limit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that an average of one in six deaths on Scottish roads is caused by drink-driving; regrets the increase in the number of under-21s convicted of drink-driving, up 38% between 1996 and 2002; is concerned by the fact that the current drink-driving limit of 80mg per 100ml of blood is amongst the highest in western Europe and that the average drink-driving limit in Europe is 40 to 50mg; supports any measures that will lead to a reduction in the number of people who choose to drink and drive, including increased enforcement and greater education and awareness campaigns; acknowledges that the Parliament does not have the power to deal with this issue, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to take this matter up with the UK Government in an attempt to get the issue legislated on at Westminster as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3775</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Enterprising Spirit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the renewed joint commitment between the Scottish Executive and the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) to promote the Scotch whisky industry; commends the launch of the Scotland&rsquo;s Enterprising Spirit partnership which sets out the economic importance of Scotch whisky and identifies areas of Executive and industry co-operation including growing exports, ensuring a fair tax and regulatory burden and encouraging tourism and sustainable development; notes that this initiative builds on the positive news earlier in the year that Scotch whisky exports have risen to over &pound;1,000 million in the first six months of 2005, the highest level since 1997; welcomes this increased growth in key markets such as China, India and Russia, underlining the world-wide importance of the industry; further welcomes the Memorandum of Understanding between the SWA and HM Revenue and Customs, a landmark agreement to tackle spirits fraud; acknowledges the instrumental role in securing such an agreement played by the Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Scotch Whisky and Spirits Group, led by John McFall MP, and strongly believes that the interests of the Scotch whisky industry have been well served by the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government and, not least, by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury, which has frozen spirit duty since 1997.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3774</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Forward Training Partnership Ltd&rsquo;s Christmas Lunch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff and seven teenagers who are participating in Forward Training Partnership Ltd, established in 1997 to provide training for 16 to 62-year-olds in numerous NVQs, for successfully preparing a full Christmas lunch which was served in Campsie Memorial Hall, Lennoxtown, to seven pensioners chosen from their community.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3762 Withdrawn</strong></p>
<p><strong>S2M-3735#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Closure of Six Post Offices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern over Post Office Ltd&rsquo;s announcement that it will be closing six town centre post offices, including the main post office in Dumfries, replacing them with franchises in SPAR shops; notes that SPAR itself is a franchise; is concerned over the implications for staff numbers and terms and conditions of employment; believes that in cases such as Dumfries the new location is less convenient for customers; further believes that the proposed arrangements may not offer a sustainable and long-term future for these post offices; expresses concern that the announcement was made less than two weeks before Christmas and considers that Post Office Ltd should extend the consultation period beyond the current seven weeks to ensure that all customers get the opportunity to express their views, and believes that no irreversible decisions should be made without paying full consideration and attention to the views of customers and staff.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3558#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>The Tayside Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Marie Curie Cancer Care for joining forces with NHS Tayside, Dundee City Council, Perth and Kinross and Angus Councils and the Scottish Ambulance Service to deliver the first Scottish project of the Delivering Choice Programme in Tayside, which aims to look at the problems in palliative care provision in the region before developing a strategy to deliver the best possible palliative care and end-of-life care for patients in the area, allowing them to be cared for in the place of their choice; notes that Tayside has specific problems in this area, with 75% of the admissions to the cancer centre in Ninewells Hospital being for palliative care, and that over the three-year project issues like this will be tackled, and believes that the findings of the project should be utilised in other areas of Scotland to inform palliative care policy so that everyone in Scotland can benefit from this ground-breaking project.</p>
