<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4844</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Education Committee considers the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 in the following order: sections 1 to 8, sections 47 to 63, section 79, sections 9 to 46, sections 64 to 78 and sections 80 to 113 and that each schedule is considered immediately after the section that introduces it.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4843&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>No Need to Shout...Just Learn to Sign!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Learn to Sign Week from 2 to 8 October 2006; commends the work of the British Deaf Association and supports its objective of building a nation where British Sign Language (BSL), with its Scottish dialect, is a shared communication medium for both deaf and hearing communities; welcomes its 2006 UK-wide campaign, &quot;No need to shout...just learn to sign!&quot;, which aims to encourage people to learn BSL; applauds the work of the Scottish Deaf Association (SDA) in raising awareness of deaf issues in our schools, further education establishments and workplaces, and considers that the Scottish Executive should be encouraged to support the efforts of the SDA.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kate Maclean<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4842</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Action on Positional Plagiocephaly</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the growth in the number of reported cases of positional plagiocephaly in babies in Scotland since 1995; acknowledges that this cranial disorder, which makes the back or side of a baby&rsquo;s head appear flattened, is mainly caused by outside pressure placed on the skull and is generally associated with the prolonged periods of time that babies can spend with their heads resting in one position; accepts that the increasing incidence of the disorder has been linked to the success of parental guidance on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), urging parents to place babies on their backs to sleep; recognises that early interventions are possible to prevent or correct plagiocephaly which, most importantly, do not negate the significance of SIDS advice; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s action to develop, with NHS Health Scotland, a leaflet to advise new parents of these interventions, and believes, however, that this action should be supplemented with properly constituted research into the treatment of this condition, including the potential use of cranial remoulding orthoses and more detailed guidance for NHS staff, particularly at primary care level, to allow for more timely diagnosis and treatment of positional plagiocephaly.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4841</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Perth and Kinross Cittaslow Bid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the commitment and ambition being shown by Perth and Kinross Council and Scottish Enterprise Tayside in their aim to make Perth Scotland&rsquo;s first Cittaslow town and Perth and Kinross the first Cittaslow area in the United Kingdom; notes that Cittaslow, which has grown out of the Slow Food movement, is a network of over 100 towns across Europe that have committed themselves to promoting a healthier way of life through encouraging healthy eating, protecting the environment, promoting local produce and local traditions and enhancing the quality of the urban fabric; recognises that over 60 detailed criteria have to be met to be accepted into Cittaslow membership; believes that being part of the Cittaslow network would help Perth and Perth and Kinross to increase demand for local produce and endorse the excellent environmental qualities of the area; supports the drive by Perth and Perth and Kinross towards Cittaslow membership, and further believes that they can provide a model that other Scottish towns and communities can follow to eventually establish a strong network of Cittaslow towns across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4840</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Hugo Chavez</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hugo Chavez, democratically elected president of the Bolivarian Socialist Republic of Venezuela, on his address to the United Nations in New York, where he described George Bush as a &quot;devil&quot; in international terms and the greatest threat to peace and security across the planet; condemns the plans expressed by the United States of America to undemocratically undermine the Chavez government in Venezuela, and applauds the Venezuelan Government&rsquo;s commitment to anti-poverty and democratic policies and to world peace.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4839</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>&pound;76 Billion Cost to Replace Trident</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the latest cost estimate to replace and maintain a new nuclear weapons system in place of Trident has reached an incredible &pound;76 billion, as revealed in House of Commons parliamentary answers; re-affirms its opposition to nuclear weapons on grounds of morality and consistency with international law but notes that the economic arguments against replacing Trident are now also unanswerable; believes that &pound;76 billion committed over the next 30 years to wage war on poverty and grotesque inequality would concretely raise the quality and standard of life of all pensioners, children and families across the United Kingdom, and further believes that the latest astronomical cost estimate to replace Trident also adds political urgency to the cause of independence and that an independent, nuclear-free and socialist Scotland offers the best guarantee of peace and security for all Scotland&rsquo;s citizens.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4838</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Housing Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the record level of housing mortgage debt reached in Scotland and believes that thousands of young workers, in particular, are priced out of housing purchase and demands a co-ordinated and massive social rented housebuilding programme funded by the Scottish Executive to meet the current demand for new and affordable housing and the removal of the counter-productive, unfair and unsustainable right-to-buy policy.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4837</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Hands Off Cuba</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the passage from the recently released report of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba (CAFC) from the Bush administration in Washington which states &quot;For reasons of national security and effective implementation some recommendations are contained in a separate classified annex&quot;; also notes CAFC&rsquo;s demand for $80 million in the next two years, followed by $20 million in each successive year, to facilitate the destabilisation of Cuba and overthrow its socialist government; condemns the interference by the United States of America in Cuba&rsquo;s internal affairs over the last 47 years and its ongoing, deeply damaging and illegal economic blockade of the island; recognises and applauds the record of the Fidel Castro&rsquo;s government in developing a free health and education system admired worldwide, eradication of illiteracy, improvements in life expectancy, huge reductions in poverty and unmatched international aid and assistance programmes, and demands that the USA keeps out of Cuba and insists on tackling disgraceful health inequalities and poverty in its own backyard and not in undermining socialist governments in Cuba, Venezuela or Bolivia.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4836</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Avon Gorge Road</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament  welcomes the increased use of the Grangemouth rail freight terminal by Tesco; recognises that this will have environmental benefits for the people of Scotland but believes that some of the benefits will be offset by over 200 lorries passing through the Braes villages on a road that is not suitable for such an increase in heavy traffic, particularly at the notorious Avon Gorge, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work closely with Falkirk Council, West Lothian Council and the communities on both sides of the Avon Gorge to make sure that the main Falkirk to Bathgate road is fit for purpose, with the building of a bridge at the Avon Gorge which will accommodate the expected increase in lorry traffic.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4835</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>The Draft Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 (Consequential Provisions) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Environment and Rural Development Committee recommends that the draft Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 (Consequential Provisions) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4834</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Support Civil Service Union Call for Relocation Moratorium</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern at the contents of the Audit Scotland report into the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s relocation policy; notes the report&rsquo;s findings, including that the Executive has developed the policy in a completely ad hoc and inconsistent way and that there have been limited attempts to evaluate the policy and programme; agrees with the PCS which has always contended that there is no link between criteria set for relocation reviews and clear and transparent policy objectives of ministers and that Scottish ministers have looked too narrowly at the relocation of Scottish civil service jobs without fully taking into account the existing location of many thousands of public sector jobs already spread throughout Scotland, in UK civil service departments and agencies and other public sector bodies, including local government and the health service, and supports the call by the PCS for an immediate moratorium on further relocations and believes there should be a rigorous examination of the merits, efficacy and implications of the current relocation policy.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4831*#*</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Dental Health Services Research Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Dental Health Services Research Unit (DHSRU), based in Dundee University, on its various achievements in the last year, especially in winning, with collaborators, a &euro;1.8 million grant known as EGOHID II and the SCOT (Scottish Collaboration of Trialists) award of &pound;1.2 million; notes with pleasure the joint initiative of the University of Dundee and NHS Highland in their preparations for the appointment of a new Professor of Public Health Research and Consultant in Dental Public Health, and applauds the DHSRU&rsquo;s international recognition and invited involvement in National Institutes of Health funding for specific Cochrane Oral Health Group reviews in the area of oral cancer, its European Union funding with the University of Lyon and a range of partners across Europe to develop and operationalise European global oral health indicators across 25 member states, its invitation from the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry to help set out the direction of travel to protect oral health in the vulnerable child and its central involvement with US and Scandinavian partners in the International Caries Detection and Assessment System Group.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4828*#*</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Life. Live It - British Red Cross</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the British Red Cross on its report, <em>Life. Live it</em>; notes that every year there are 5.5 million attendances at hospitals across the United Kingdom; agrees with the view that in many health emergencies interventions in the first few minutes, before the emergency services arrive, can make a crucial difference to the outcome for the casualty and that people in the UK should have basic first aid knowledge; notes that Norway, Denmark and France already teach first aid as a core part of the  school curriculum; congratulates New Zealand for measuring the impact of a public health campaign on first aid for burns; applauds all organisations similarly engaged in first aid activity, such as the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Ambulance in Cardenden where a new course for local people started on 18 September 2006, and hopes that the Scottish Executive will take the appropriate measures to ensure that schools, colleges, universities and workplaces make it a core part of their programme of activity to provide first aid education and training.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4826*#*</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>European Day of Modern Languages 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that 26 September 2006 is the annual European Day of Modern Languages; believes that learning a modern language other than English is a vital tool in helping our young people to broaden their horizons and improve their employment opportunities; agrees that the teaching of European languages in schools raises awareness and understanding of Scotland&rsquo;s place in the European Union; notes the findings of a recent report from the European Parliament&rsquo;s Culture and Education Committee that member states should include at least two foreign languages from a very early age in their school programmes, and therefore welcomes the efforts of Scottish local authorities to improve language attainment in primary schools, such as North Ayrshire Council which has recently provided training for 18 primary teachers in the delivery of Spanish lessons, to complement the existing availability of French tuition at primary level.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4822.1</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Graduate Debt</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4822) in the name of Ms Sandra White, leave out from first &quot;which&quot; to end and and insert &quot;and notes that the SNP&rsquo;s incoherent proposals to cancel all existing and historic graduate debt would cost nearly &pound;1.7 billion while creating not one extra place at college or university and contributing nothing to the quality of teaching and research at our academic institutions; challenges the SNP to recognise that a &pound;100 million spending commitment would be woefully inadequate to fund its policy; recognises that contributions to the graduate endowment are used to fund the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s student bursary scheme which has been increased in this session of the Parliament, and asks the SNP to confirm whether it is standing by its muddled policy and, if so, what public services it will cut to fund it or whether it is going to come clean with students and admit that the policy cannot be implemented.&quot;</p>
