<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5006</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Votes for 16 and 17-year-olds</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the intention of the Scottish Government to allow 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote in an independence referendum and believes that this could be a great opportunity for young adults to have their opinions listened to and to have their say about Scotland&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Michael Matheson<strong>*</strong>, Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Ian McKee<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, Shirley-Anne Somerville<strong>*</strong>, Joe FitzPatrick<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-5005&diams;</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>International Credit Union Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises International Credit Union Day, taking place on 15 October 2009; congratulates Scotland&rsquo;s credit unions for their continued growth; recognises the important role that credit unions play in tackling financial exclusion in the Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and throughout Scotland, serving 250,000 members with &pound;200 million in savings and lending &pound;170 million; notes the potential for credit unions to serve even more of the population with a full range of financial services; encourages support for more credit unions to offer new services such as current accounts, and believes that, as trusted co-operative enterprises, credit unions can play a valuable role in the future of Scotland&rsquo;s financial services industry.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5004</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Vivendi Should Treat Scotch Whisky Pensioners Fairly</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern about the plight of 1,500 former whisky industry workers, whose company pensions have been frozen by French media and telecom giant Vivendi, in breach of firm undertakings given; condemns Vivendi for its refusal to reinstate annual percentage increases and adding insult to injury by awarding an increase of 77 pence, and calls on Vivendi to treat Scotch whisky pensioners fairly in future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5003</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Forres in Bloom Wins Entente Florale Europe Gold Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Forres in Bloom on being awarded a prestigious gold award by the Entente Florale Europe competition judges; notes that this is an invitation only competition and that Forres was the only Scottish representative; further notes that the town was invited to compete in the European event after consecutive wins in the Scotland in Bloom and Britain in Bloom contests; recognises that the judges were particularly impressed by the woodland, well-maintained open spaces for informal activity and high-quality seasonal planting schemes, providing wonderful colour throughout the year along with a high level of community involvement, and praises the work of the Forres in Bloom committee and all the many volunteers who work tirelessly throughout the year and whose efforts have been recognised by this award, one of only six gold medals awarded across Europe for the whole of the competition, in which 24 countries took part.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5001</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>HorseWatch Strathclyde, Combating Equine-related Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the essential work of HorseWatch Strathclyde in partnering with Strathclyde Police to ensure protection against the theft of horses and related property in the local area and to provide vital support services and information to victims of such crime while also laying out preventative measures to ensure that horse owners are not targeted in the first place; commends the initiative, run entirely by volunteers and which, where possible, charges no fees for its services, and hopes that police forces from across Scotland will learn from and adopt similar partnering schemes to enable the effective combating of equine-related crime.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5000</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Plains Needs a Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recently stated commitment of the Airdrie Local Area Partnership that it remains fully supportive of a railway station at Plains; recognises that this commitment is across all political parties within North Lanarkshire Council; further recognises the benefits that such a station would provide to the people of Plains, which is an area that suffers from relatively high levels of deprivation and has low levels of car ownership, and calls on the Scottish Executive to re-examine the case for this station as a matter of urgency so that the people of Plains can benefit from the improved access to educational, employment and recreational opportunities that the Airdrie to Bathgate rail line will provide.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4999</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Friends of Cumbernauld Community Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Friends of Cumbernauld Community Park for winning the Community Environmental Project award at the North Lanarkshire Council environmental awards dinner on Thursday 1 October 2009; notes that this great achievement was made possible through the National Lottery&rsquo;s Breathing Spaces grant programme and notes the worthwhile charitable work carried out by the National Lottery across Scotland; praises the commitment and enthusiasm of the group that worked tirelessly to achieve this success, and finally thanks the North Lanarkshire Council staff who assisted the Friends of Cumbernauld Community Park to achieve this feat.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4998</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Post Office Network</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the statement from the Prime Minister that he wants the Post Office &quot;to play a much bigger role, bringing banking services back to the heart of people&rsquo;s communities&quot;; agrees that the creation of a post bank would build on the strong foundations of the Post Office; recognises that the Post Office has popular confidence and trust, and looks forward to early action to establish a community post bank that would revive and protect the Post Office network.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4997</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Labour and Conservative Consensus Over Welfare Reform</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the congruity of the welfare reform proposals of the UK Labour Government, laid out in the green paper, <em>No one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility, </em>and the Conservative Party&rsquo;s <em>Get Britain Working </em>plan; considers that both sets of proposals promote the further privatisation of welfare, with private sector and voluntary organisations being awarded contracts and bonus incentives to find work for those on benefit; believes that this marked concordance is unsurprising, considering that both schemes were devised chiefly by David Freud, as a government adviser under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and then as shadow minister for welfare for the Conservative Party; further believes that both sets of proposals fail to grasp properly the scarcity of employment opportunities afforded to job seekers in the current economic climate and the changing nature of employment, with many benefit claimants going into jobs that lack any security, for example on the basis of zero-hour contracts, with income and hours varying significantly; recognises that under such circumstances all the risk is borne by the low-skilled worker while the benefits are enjoyed entirely by the employer, and acknowledges that such proposals, if taken forward, would drastically weaken, rather than strengthen, financial support given to jobseekers in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4995</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>The Tobin Tax</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent comments by Lord Adair Turner, Chairman of the Financial Services Authority, that options such as a tax on international financial transactions (the Tobin tax) should be considered in the debate on future regulation of financial systems; notes that the Tobin tax was originally proposed in the early 1970s by James Tobin, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, who argued that a small tax levied on currency exchanges could discourage short-term currency speculation without being a burden on trade, and considers that this would be a worthwhile option for the UK Government to discuss with its international counterparts with a view to developing a more stable global financial system that discourages speculative transactions that are of no social benefit.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4994</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>STV ITV Dispute</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the current dispute between STV and ITV; further notes the impact that the loss of programmes has on Scottish viewers, and calls on all parties to resolve this dispute urgently in the best interests of the Scottish public.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4993</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Proposed Closure of Girvan and Cumnock courts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the division in the Justice Committee on 5 May 2009, which resulted in a recommendation to annul the Justice of the Peace Courts (Sheriffdom of South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway) Order 2009 (SSI 2009/115), which proposed to close courts in the Sheriffdom of South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway, including Girvan and Cumnock courts; deeply regrets the recent move to reinstigate closure proposals; believes that the principle of community justice is undermined by the centralisation of courts; notes the strong community support for the retention of these courts, and calls on the Justice Committee to reject again the misguided proposal by the Scottish Government to close courts in Girvan and Cumnock.</p>
<p>Supported by: Sarah Boyack</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4992</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Trade Union Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the central role of the trade union movement in the campaign for a Scottish parliament and its continuing contribution throughout the first decade of devolution; welcomes the participation and involvement of the trade union movement in the Scottish parliamentary process and, in particular, the constructive engagement with parliamentarians and staff that is reinforced through Trade Union Week; congratulates the STUC on its Agenda for Rebuilding Collective Prosperity, which argues for a new economic architecture that reconnects a strong flexible economy to the living standards of all, with more income equality, sustainable and healthy jobs, investment in manufacturing, housing and green technologies, a strong, innovative public sector delivering equality of opportunity and outcome and a just transition to a greener economy built on fairer international development, and believes that the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government should work with trade unions and encourage others in the voluntary, public and private sectors to work together to create a vibrant economy based on principles of equality, fair taxation, strong public services, sustainable employment and support for a just transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4990</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Gordon Brown Is Congratulated by Bono in New York</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is immensely proud of and congratulates Gordon Brown for the honour that he was awarded in the United States last week when he was in New York for the UN General Assembly and was hailed as a hero for stabilising the world economy and showing compassionate leadership; notes that he was named World Statesman of the Year at a VIP-packed gala dinner and that the award was presented on behalf of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an interfaith organisation that campaigns for religious freedom and human rights, by the veteran former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who praised Gordon Brown for his vision and dedication in handling the world economic crisis and said, &quot;his leadership has been essential to our ability to overcome the moment of danger&quot;; notes the praise that he received from the foundation, which stated that the award was for his &quot;compassionate leadership in dealing with the challenging issues facing humanity, his commitment to freedom, human dignity and the environment, and for the major role he has played in helping to stabilise the world&rsquo;s financial system&quot;, and finally notes Barack Obama&rsquo;s praise for Gordon&rsquo;s integrity as the two men vowed to work together to tackle the unprecedented global recession.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4990.1</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Gordon Brown Is Congratulated by Bono in New York</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4990) in the name of Helen Eadie, leave out from &quot;is immensely proud&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that Gordon Brown was presented with an award by former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, while in New York; recalls the record of Henry Kissinger while part of the US administration and accusations of his involvement in supporting Operation Condor, a programme of political repression involving assassination across Latin America, as well as in the undermining of the democratically elected Chilean administration of Salvador Allende, which was overthrown on 11 September 1973, heralding the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a period that resulted in the deaths and disappearances of at least 3,000 people; considers that Henry Kissinger&rsquo;s attitude to democracy is characterised by his reported remarks, &quot;I don&rsquo;t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people. The issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves&quot;; recalls that Henry Kissinger was also involved in perpetuating the Vietnam War while part of the US Government, including the secret bombing of Cambodia as part of Operation Menu, resulting in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths; also considers that Henry Kissinger advocated that the US Government turn a blind eye to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, an event of which he allegedly had prior knowledge, and believes that, given this track record, being presented an award by Henry Kissinger is a highly dubious honour indeed.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4989</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>A Fair Pay Deal for Fife Council&rsquo;s Lowest Earners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes calls for Fife Council&rsquo;s top earners&rsquo; pay to be frozen immediately for three years instead of a pay freeze across the council workforce, which would hit the lowest earners the hardest; notes the current disparity in salaries within Fife Council, where last year the chief executive earned nearly &pound;150,000 while the median salary for full-time staff was &pound;22,682; further notes with alarm a persisting pay gap in Fife Council whereby last year the median salary for full-time male staff was &pound;25,329 while for full-time female staff it was only &pound;18,541; is concerned that, while frontline staff are in their third year of a pay freeze due to single status, chief officers have a three-year pay deal worth a 2.5% increase in each year that has seen the chief executive receive a rise this year of &pound;3,657 and executive directors an increase of &pound;2,655, and urges Fife Council to ensure that, at this time, the needs of its lowest earners are put first in any pay-related savings measures, considering that the impact of a three-year pay freeze for its lowest earners would mean considerable hardship, whereas for its chief officers the impact would hardly be felt, if at all.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4978</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Human Development Report 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the United Nations <em>Human Development Report 2009</em>; further notes that Norway is ranked first in the human development index rankings and that its consistently high performance in the index and its desirable living standards have been attributed, in large part, to its wise use of the revenues generated by its natural gas and oil deposits; notes that Iceland and Ireland also feature in the top 10, with Denmark and Finland in the top 20, and that all these countries are identified in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s National Conversation document as being part of the arc of prosperity; notes also that the United Kingdom is ranked twenty-first; recognises that, even though the figures were compiled in 2007, before the economic downturn, the human development index does not simply take economic factors into account but also social indicators including life expectancy and poverty levels, which means that these countries can expect to maintain relatively high rankings in future publications of the index, and looks forward to the day when Scotland takes its place among the countries of the United Nations, has the normal powers of the 182 other countries featured in the index and can work towards achieving the best possible ranking in the index and quality of life for people in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4937.1</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>The Power of Scotland Renewed Report Publication</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4937) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that the UK Government&rsquo;s Department of Energy and Climate Change&rsquo;s consultation paper, issued on 17 June 2009, would require a new coal-fired power station to demonstrate at the outset a carbon capture and storage (CCS) capacity of only 400MW gross; recognises that, if this were applied to the proposed 1,600MW coal-fired power station at Hunterston, 75% of the CO2 emissions would continue unabated until the technology was proven, which could take at least 15 or 20 years; regrets that Scottish ministers have confirmed their intention to align the Scottish position with that of the United Kingdom, irrespective of the implications for the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009; believes that CCS technology would best be developed on existing coal-fired and gas-fired stations, such as Longannet; believes that the Scottish Government must differentiate between existing coal-fired and gas-fired stations and new coal-fired and gas-fired stations, and calls on the Scottish Government to introduce policy for consenting to new thermal power plants under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, which supersedes the National Planning Framework, to prevent any new coal power stations from being granted planning consent unless they make full use of CCS technology from the outset.&quot;</p>
