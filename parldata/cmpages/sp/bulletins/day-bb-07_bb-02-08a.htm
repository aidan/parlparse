<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-5535</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Forth and Tay Road Bridges Tolls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the tolls should be removed from the Forth Road Bridge and the Tay Road Bridge. </p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5535.2</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Forth and Tay Road Bridges Tolls</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5535) in the name of Tricia Marwick, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;commits to a replacement crossing across the Forth and calls on the Cabinet to commit to preparatory work to start immediately; calls for the case for abolition of the tolls on the Fife Bridges to be considered in the light of the commitment to the new crossing; notes that the SNP&rsquo;s sums do not add up and that under its current plans the SNP would not be able to afford to lift the tolls and pay for the construction of a new crossing; notes that its proposals do not address the impact of congestion or other environmental, social and economic impacts, and notes the importance of a sustainable transport policy, including smart tolling and investment in public transport to meet the long-term needs of Scotland.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5535.1</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard: Forth and Tay Road Bridges Tolls</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5535) in the name of Tricia Marwick, leave out from &quot;the tolls&quot; to end and insert &quot;existing tolls on the Forth Road Bridge and the Tay Road Bridge should be replaced with a scheme of variable charging which takes into account factors such as occupancy levels, peak hour traffic flows and specific exemptions, including for public transport, and that the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board and the Forth Transport Estuary Forum should be given more flexibility to use toll revenues to deal with transport issues in the vicinity.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by </em>Scottish National Party Debate: Early Years Education, Development and Care&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-5549</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Early Years Education, Development and Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that early years education, care and development support for our youngest children can provide firm foundations for later life and that there needs to be an increase in pace and attention in terms of delivery for the early years in Scotland; further believes that Scotland needs a 10-year strategy for care, development and education in the early years; recognises the vital role that nursery nurses play in delivery of this service as part of a team approach to early years services; calls for a 50% increase in free nursery education with access to a nursery teacher for all children; condemns the Scottish Executive for falling two years behind England and Wales in the provision of nursery education despite the fact that resources have been made available through the Barnett formula, and calls on ministers to offer an explanation. </p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5549.2</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Early Years Education, Development and Care</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5549) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &quot;that there needs&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the significant increase in pre-school education entitlement that has been delivered since 1999; recognises that teachers have, and will continue to have, a major role to play in delivering pre-school education; recognises the vital role that qualified early years practitioners play in delivering early years services and welcomes proposals to deliver greater professionalism and improved career pathways for early years staff; welcomes proposals under A Curriculum for Excellence to introduce more active learning into early primary education; recognises that early years strategy needs to reflect these developments, and recognises that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s investment in education has rebuilt the foundations of a successful education system in Scotland&quot;. </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5549.1</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Early Years Education, Development and Care</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5549) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &quot;that there needs&quot; to end and insert &quot;can assist parents with the difficult but rewarding task of raising children; further believes that provision must be advanced, highly-skilled and flexible in order to meet the range of needs that parents and children in Scotland have; therefore expresses its concern that access to qualified teachers in nurseries may be insufficient in some areas of Scotland; recognises the potential that early intervention has for helping children from disadvantaged backgrounds, or who have additional support needs or are otherwise at risk, and calls for serious consideration to be given to expanding the number of family centres, particularly in areas of deprivation.&quot; </p>
