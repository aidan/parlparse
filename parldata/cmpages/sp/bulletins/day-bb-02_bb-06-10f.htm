            the potential for escalation to nuclear war including the immediate

            his personal relationship with the President of the United States 
            of America to urge that the President also visits the region, and 
            calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government to suspend immediately the 
            sale of all arms and munitions to the region and to put a proposal 
            before the United Nations for a peacekeeping force to be introduced

          <p> <strong>S1M-3175</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: The Parliament

            28 to 30 May 2002, particularly to all at the University of Aberdeen 
            and Aberdeen City Council and to parliamentary staff who were involved 
            in the planning and execution of parliamentary business and associated 
            events throughout the week, and notes that the success of the visit 
            and warm welcome from the north-east community suggests that the parliament 
            should explore the possibilities of repeating the exercise in Aberdeen 
            and elsewhere in Scotland in coming years. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3174</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Care Provision 
            for Elderly People in Dunbar</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the reduction of care provision for elderly people in 
            Dunbar and, in particular, the reduction in the number of beds at 
            Belhaven Hospital which may result in frail elderly people being transferred 
            to facilities in Edinburgh, distant from family, friends and familiar 
            surroundings; further notes the imminent closure of the Church of 
            Scotland respite day care centre at the Old Manse, reducing the provision 
            of respite relief for carers; is concerned by the distress that this 
            will cause frail elderly people and their carers, and therefore urges 
            the Scottish Executive as a matter of urgency to correct the failure 
            to provide locally by providing adequate resources in order to ensure 
            that the elderly in Dunbar and, indeed, elsewhere in East Lothian, 
            can remain in their failing years in their home locality, that they 
            are treated with the dignity and consideration they have earned and 
            that their carers, families and friends are given practical support.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3173#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Loan Sharks</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament commends the excellent initiative of the <em>Daily Record 
            </em>to name and shame the "loan sharks" who prey on vulnerable people 
            living in poverty throughout Scotland; agrees with the newspaper that 
            Scotland must not be a country where it is a crime to be poor and 
            where loan sharks obtain huge profits out of other people's precarious 
            financial circumstances, and is of the firm view that the Parliament, 
            in close partnership with the UK Parliament, the police and other 
            appropriate public agencies, must take decisive action to drive these 
            predators out of their sordid "business" in the interests of their 
            victims and victims&#146; families.</p>

            of Grantown-on-Spey; congratulates everyone involved in ensuring that 
            the community purchase will be successfully completed; acknowledges 
            support from the Scottish Land Fund and Highland and Islands Enterprise 
            Community Land Fund, and hopes that the safeguarding of these woods 
            will safeguard the environment and also provide opportunities for

          <p><strong>S1M-3171#</strong> <strong>David Mundell: VisitScotland Funding 
            of Dumfries and Galloway Tourist Board Foot-and-Mouth Recovery Plan</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with extreme concern the failure of VisitScotland 
            to allocate the necessary £280,000 to fund the second year of the 
            foot-and-mouth recovery plan prepared by Dumfries and Galloway Tourist 
            Board; believes that funds allocated nationally to VisitScotland by 
            the Scottish Executive to help the tourist industry recover from the 
            foot-and-mouth disease outbreak should be targeted on those areas 
            most affected by the disease, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should enter into urgent dialogue with VisitScotland to review their 
            funding allocation to the board in the expectation that the necessary 
            funding will be made available to support the Board's foot-and-mouth 
            recovery plan which has already had considerable success in its first 
            year.</p>

            and agrees that there is a need for a national framework for epilepsy, 
            as already exists for diabetes, to improve standards of health care, 
            and further notes that England and Wales are working towards such 
            a framework for 2005.</p>
