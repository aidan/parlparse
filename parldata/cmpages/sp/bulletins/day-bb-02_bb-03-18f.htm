          <p><strong>*S1M-2915</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Removal of Chewing Gum from our Streets</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that Aberdeen City Council estimates that clearing 
            discarded chewing gum from Union Street and its environs will cost 
            £100,000; further notes that the problem could cost as much as £150 
            million per annum in the United Kingdom, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to consider 
            introducing a levy on chewing gum manufacturers, the proceeds of which 
            should then be redistributed in full to local authorities in order 
            to help them deal with the massive and costly problem of removing 
            gum from our streets and pavements.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2914</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: GM Crop Trials</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive has approved the planting 
            of a GM oilseed rape crop at three trial sites in Scotland this spring, 
            that, while Scottish Ministers have the responsibility to approve 
            the planting, they have little discretion under the EU and UK regulations 
            unless there is verifiable evidence that there is a direct physical 
            threat to the environment or human health caused by the GM crop and 
            that the advice of the independent Advisory Committee on Releases 
            to the Environment and the Food Standards Agency to Scottish Ministers 
            is that there is no such direct threat; further notes that the GM 
            oilseed rape grown in the trials is the subject of an application 
            to be granted commercial approval in Europe but that the industry 
            and Her Majesty&#146;s Government have agreed that no decision will 
            be taken on this application at least until the results of these field 
            trials are known, and calls for the Scottish Executive to lobby the 
            European Commission for a moratorium on all future planting of GM 
            crops to allow a full assessment of the environmental and health implications, 
            taking account of the results of the trials and international evidence 
            and of a full and informed public consultation on the desirability 
            or otherwise of GM crops. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2913</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Skill Force Pilot Scheme</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the early success of the pilot scheme &quot;Skill 
            Force&quot; being undertaken in schools in North Lanarkshire in conjunction 
            with retired armed forces instructors; notes the increased attainment 
            and improving attendance and attitude of pupils within the pilot who 
            were previously disengaged from the education system; further notes 
            that the pilot has also been welcomed by pupils themselves, and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to give further freedom to Scotland&#146;s 
            schools to introduce local initiatives to inspire those pupils to 
            benefit from education who are disengaged from the standardised academic 
            approach.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2912</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Streaming in Schools</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates St. Paul&#146;s High School, Pollok, 
            Glasgow on its decision to reverse decades of dogma by reintroducing 
            streaming for its S1 and S2 pupils; welcomes the increased diversity 
            that this brings to Scotland&#146;s education system, and calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to confirm that decisions on streaming and 
            other diverse approaches to improving educational attainment should 
            be a matter for individual schools to determine in order to increase 
            choice for parents within our state school system.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2911</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Stirling's Successful Bid for 
            City Status</strong>&#151;That the Parliament warmly congratulates Stirling 
            on being awarded city status as part of celebrations to mark Her Majesty 
            The Queen&#146;s Golden Jubilee, as well as the four other successful 
            applicants from across the UK: Preston, Newport, Lisburn and Newry.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2910</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Transport Infrastructure in Aberdeen</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises that Aberdeen is the only city of its size 
            in the UK that does not have a by-pass; further notes that, according 
            to the Aberdeen branch of the Institute of Directors, the cost to 
            the community of Aberdeen&#146;s inadequate transport infrastructure 
            is in the region of £20 million per year and that others estimate 
            the cost to be nearer £100 million; recognises that Aberdonians living 
            near the current trunk roads suffer from the effects of air and noise 
            pollution from heavy traffic and have their safety put at risk; notes 
            that the Labour group on Aberdeen City Council have decided to close 
            the Grandholm Bridge from 10 July 2002, which will cause further traffic 
            chaos in the city, and calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise 
            that Aberdeen and the north east are an economic powerhouse whose 
            future well-being is vital to Scotland and to allocate the resources 
            necessary to construct a western peripheral route, with a third bridge 
            over the River Don. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2909#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Underfunding of Glasgow City 
            Council in Respect of Roads Maintenance, Winter Maintenance and Street 
            Lighting </strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes that Glasgow City 
            Council is badly underfunded in terms of Grant-Aided Expenditure (GAE) 
            in respect of roads maintenance, winter maintenance and street lighting; 
            notes (a) that GAE for roads maintenance is calculated using a standard 
            set of parameters, based on carriageway length without taking account 
            of road width, except in the case of dual carriageways, additional 
            funding also being granted for principal roads and roads constructed 
            over peat, (b) that Glasgow, in common with other cities, has a large 
            number of roads greater in width than is standard, resulting in, for 
            example, a five-lane road such as Hope Street, which is not untypical 
            in the city, receiving the same allocation as a single track road 
            in Argyll, (c) that Glasgow City Council is adversely affected by 
            parameters concerning the lengths of roads classified as principal 
            routes, i.e. routes that link population centres, whereby Glasgow, 
            as a population centre, is linked to other such centres by roads of 
            which the majority of the length lies in other authority areas, such 
            as (i) Perth and Kinross Council area through which principal routes 
            pass in order to link centres outwith the authority area and where 
            433km of such routes account for 18% of total road network and (ii) 
            Western Isles Council area where 333km of principal routes constitute 
            the main road network and account for 28% of total road network, compared 
            with 132km of principal routes in the Glasgow City Council area which 
            account for only 7% of total road network, (d) that the parameters 
            on lengths of principal routes do not result in the calculation of 
            a figure that is fair to urban authorities and, consequently, a secondary 
            factor is applied, based on the number of private light goods vehicle 
            licences registered within the local authority area, which, as an 
            indicator, is also of little use as light goods vehicles and cars 
            do little damage to the structure of the road compared with heavy 
            goods vehicles (HGVs), (e) that the registration of HGVs cannot be 
            used as a measure as, for example, they are registered at the address 
            of the company's headquarters which is not necessarily located in 
            the area in which the vehicles operate, (f) that buses similarly have 
            a more detrimental effect on roads and, whilst roads in rural areas 
            may only see two or three buses a day, 2,780 buses use Hope Street 
            in Glasgow each day, (g) that other factors not considered for the 
            purposes of calculating GAE include (1) commuting, tourism and shopping, 
            which are obviously major issues for Glasgow but for few other authorities 
            and almost none of the rural authorities, (2) drainage of rainwater 
            from roads, which, in Glasgow, necessitates the maintenance of a network 
            of road gullies whilst in rural areas rainwater drains into adjacent 
            fields and ditches, (3) footways, which, in Glasgow, are often wide 
            in order to cope with large numbers of pedestrians<font color="#000080"> 
            </font>whereas there are often no footways on rural roads and (4) 
            the provision of street furniture, such as signs, pedestrian barriers, 
            bollards and traffic control, which is more widespread in Glasgow 
            than in rural areas, (h) that, in cities, there are many more customers 
            for public utilities which, in turn, leads to more excavation of carriageways 
            and subsequent re-instatement to a standard that leads to potholes 
            and general deterioration of the road surface, whilst in rural areas 
            such excavations are few and far between leading to fewer potholes 
            and a more<font color="#000080"> </font>homogeneous surface and (i) 
            that, in Glasgow, almost all roads are lit whilst in rural areas only 
            a small percentage of roads are lit; considers that the combined effect 
            of such factors is such that, in comparison with local authorities 
            that are responsible for rural areas, Glasgow is considerably worse 
            off, and further considers that the method of calculating GAE in respect 
            of roads maintenance, winter maintenance and street lighting should 
            be changed and improved in order to deliver more adequate funding 
            for Glasgow City Council and for other urban authorities.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2908#</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Court of Appeal Opinion on 
            Appeal Against Conviction of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the Opinion of the Appeal Court of 14 March 2002 
            refusing the appeal against conviction of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al 
            Megrahi; commends the hard work and diligence of the Crown Office 
            team in the presentation of the Crown case; acknowledges the sterling 
            public service rendered by the Lord Advocate, Colin Boyd QC, his predecessor 
            the Right Honourable the Lord Hardie, Alastair Campbell QC, Alan Turnbull 
            QC, Jonathan Lake and Morag Armstrong together with the Crown Office,

            nationally and internationally who co-operated with and assisted them 
            in the course of the investigation and prosecution of the case, together 
            with the emergency services, church folk, friends and carers who cared 
            for and continue to support the ground survivors, the families and 
            friends of the 270 murder victims of the explosion of Flight Pan Am 
            103 to New York while in flight near to Lockerbie on 21 December 1988, 
            and considers that the Government of Libya should comply fully with

            Linda Donnelly and the staff and pupils at Carleton Primary School 
            in Glenrothes, Fife, on achieving a very successful report from Her 
            Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Education, which identified a number

          <p><strong>S1M-2905#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan: Market Opening of Postal Services

            will have on the post office network in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2904#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Improving Glasgow's Council 
            Homes Without a Penny of Borrowing Required</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes the comments of the Minister for Social Justice in relation 
            to the wholesale stock transfer ballot in Glasgow reported in the 
            <em>Evening Times </em>on 13 March 2002; notes specifically his statement 
            that &quot;Glasgow&#146;s tenants must not miss this historic opportunity 
            to vote for warm, dry houses, rejuvenated neighbourhoods and a real 
            say in how their homes should be managed and improved. It would take 
            close to twenty years to match the level of improvements that the 
            GHA plans to undertake in ten years&quot;; further notes that, in 
            a letter of 12 March 2002, the Director of Housing Services at Glasgow 
            City Council stated that, if the housing debt burden were removed 
            from the council, it could invest £129.2 million per year in modernising 
            and improving Glasgow&#146;s council homes without a penny of borrowing 
            required; believes that it is a duty of Ministers to present available 
            information in a fair and honest fashion; accepts that, if Glasgow 
            City Council were relieved of its £900 million capital debt burden, 
            it would be able to invest £129.2 million per annum, i.e. £1.3 billion 
            over ten years without any new borrowing or additional grant aid from 
            the Scottish Executive, and considers that the Parliamentary Bureau 
            should timetable a debate on the Glasgow stock transfer issue in order 
            to allow all the information available to be discussed openly and 
            frankly. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2903#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Trade Union Rights for Police 
            Officers</strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes that members of police 
            forces should be entitled to join a trade union of their choice as 
            a fundamental human right.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2902</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: UN Resolution on State of

            in criticising the lack of humanity and purpose in the bloody and 
            brutal policies of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon towards the 
            Palestinian people; thanks him for his honesty and courage, and notes 
            the UN resolution commending the establishment of an independent state 
            of Palestine existing peacefully side-by-side with the state of Israel.</p>

            the present dispute between freelance photographers and The Scotsman 
            Publications Limited; regrets that in an age of global media The Scotsman 
            Publications Limited and others seem determined to impose unfair trading 
            conditions on workers whose flexibility and independence is a key 
            component of success in the information market, and calls upon The

            by Struan Stevenson MEP</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns comments 
            by the Chair of the European Parliament Fisheries Committee, Struan 
            Stevenson MEP, that labelled Scottish fishermen as "cheats" if they 
            accepted decommissioning grants but did not leave the fishing industry; 
            notes that the purpose of decommissioning is to reduce capacity in 
            the catching sector rather than remove individuals from the industry, 
            and further notes that having a Scot as Chair of the European Parliament 
            Fisheries Committee should be a benefit to the fishing industry in 
            Scotland rather than a liability.</p>

            the magazine <em>Restaurant </em>as one of the best places in the world 
            to eat, coming in at number 28 in its world rankings; acknowledges 
            that the outstanding success of the restaurant has been achieved through 
            a combination of traditional Scottish cooking, a welcoming atmosphere, 
            and the dedication of the Spear family; notes that celebrity diners 
            and tourists travel from all over the world to sample the quality, 
            home-made food served at The Three Chimneys; recognises the significant 
            impact that such a prestigious restaurant can have on the local economy; 
            and urges the Scottish Executive, Scottish Enterprise and Visitscotland 
            to do all within their power to raise the international profile of 
            Scotland as a centre of excellence for food and drink, particularly 
            in terms of the potentially lucrative niche marketing opportunity 
            that such an image could provide.</p>

            people in the Highlands and Islands with access to film and media

            success of the two pilot programmes in 1999 and 2001; recognises the 
            contribution that Screentime could make to the sustainable development

          <p><strong>S1M-2888#</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh: End-of-Life Refrigerators and 
            Freezers</strong>&#151;That the Parliament understands that from January

            to be recovered from domestic refrigerators and freezers before they 
            are recycled or sent for disposal; notes that minimal facilities exist 
            in Scotland for the removal of such substances and that local authorities 
            are having to stockpile end-of-life refrigerators and freezers until 
            adequate facilities are available, and is concerned at the Scottish 
            Executive&#146;s lack of preparedness concerning the implementation 
            of this legislation and its failure to ensure that adequate facilities 
            are available for this purpose. </p>

            made by Mr Charles Saunders, consultant in public health for Fife 
            Health Board and a member of the BMA that the Scottish Executive is 
            gambling with public health, and considers that the Minister for Environment 
            and Rural Development, who is responsible for deciding whether the 
            trials go ahead, should withhold agreement until the seed manufactures 
            can offer conclusive proof that there will be no health or environmental 
            damage from GM Crops.</p>

            and Islands; supports the principle of universal postal tariffs and 
            services throughout Scotland, regardless of location; notes the potential 
            threat posed to rural postal services by the Postal Services Commission&#146;s 
            proposals, and calls upon the relevant parliamentary committee to

            wishes to place on record its appreciation of his lifetime devotion 
            to international solidarity, peace and socialism, his many contributions 
            to Scottish culture and politics, including his role in gathering 
            traditional songs, his support for other artists and his authorship 
            of the song that many believe should be Scotland&#146;s (inter)national

            Palestinians; urges the Prime Minister to use his best efforts to 
            convince the government of Ariel Sharon that the continued brutality 
            in territory occupied illegally by Israel under resolutions of the 
            United Nations has resulted in the inevitability of the establishment 
            of the State of Palestine, and counsels that this Israeli government 
            and future governments should seek for this to be realised in peaceful 
            co-operation between the State of Israel and the future State of Palestine.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2879</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Sportscotland Relocation to North

            to consider relocating from Edinburgh; recognises the potential of 
            North Ayrshire as a place for growth in government related jobs and 
            the poor record to date of such job creation in the area; urges North 
            Ayrshire Council to take positive and determined steps to attract 
            such jobs and especially those that would be created by the move of 
            <strong>sport</strong>scotland to the area; observes that <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
            already has facilities in North Ayrshire, and therefore calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to direct <strong>sport</strong>scotland to consider North 
            Ayrshire as the preferred site for its relocation. </p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2878</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Legalisation of Cannabis and

            at the Liberal Democrat spring conference to support the legislation 
            of cannabis and issuing of heroin on prescription to registered addicts; 
            further notes that this policy position has been promoted by the Scottish 
            Socialist Party since the Parliament&#146;s inception, and believes 
            that it is time to radically overhaul the unrealistic drugs laws and 
            invest in treatment, rehabilitation and community facilities as part 
            of a social and medical approach to drugs policy, as opposed to the 
            &quot;Just Say No&quot; rhetoric of the past.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2877#</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Hamish Henderson</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recalls the unique and vigorous contribution made by 
            Hamish Henderson to Scotland and its culture; notes that he was a 
            strong supporter of a Scottish Parliament but an even stronger supporter 
            of opening up the minds and hearts of the peoples of Scotland to social 
            justice and song; pays tribute to his work to record and maintain 
            the languages, stories and passions of ordinary Scots folk and to 
            carry such traditions forward, and determines to find an appropriate 
            way to honour him and the many national and international causes he 
            espoused in the new Parliament building at Holyrood.</p>

            companies are unwilling to provide third party cover against accidental 
            contamination by GM crops; further notes with concern how vulnerable 
            this may leave organic farms in the vicinity of GM crop field trials, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the 
            European Commission that a temporary moratorium on GM crop field trials 
            should be imposed until a statutory third party insurance scheme is 
            introduced that will protect the interests of other third parties.</p>

            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">expresses concern about the number 
            of lives lost in road traffic crashes that may have been caused by 
            people driving whilst under the influence of legal and illegal drugs; 
            recognises that, in law, driving while unfit through drugs is an offence; 
            notes that Transport Research Laboratory tests demonstrated a significant 
            increase between the 1980s and 1990s in the percentage of people testing 
            positive for illegal drugs who have been involved in fatal collisions; 
            welcomes the launch by the British Medical Association of its web 
            resource on research that has been undertaken and is currently in 
            progress; considers that there should be speedier and more specific 
            and co-ordinated research in order that appropriate and conclusive 
            drug testing devices can be introduced, and believes that there should 
            be a Scottish campaign in order to educate the public that the side 
            effects of illegal and certain prescribed drugs can affect their ability 
            to drive. </a></p>
