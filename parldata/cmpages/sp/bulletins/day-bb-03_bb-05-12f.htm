          <p><strong>S2M-7#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: National Breastfeeding 
            Awareness Week</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the importance 
            of National Breastfeeding Awareness Week, 11-17 May 2003, to the aims 
            of raising awareness, increasing social acceptance and promoting support 
            for breastfeeding throughout the United Kingdom; acknowledges that 
            breastfeeding holds major health benefits for mothers and babies and 
            notes the ongoing research that suggests that these benefits may extend 
            to childhood and later life; congratulates healthcare professionals 
            in this country on their commitment to combating the worryingly low 
            levels of breastfeeding in Scotland, and accepts that there is still 
            significant progress to be made in order to achieve the national breastfeeding 
            target, set in 1994, of having 50% of mothers still breastfeeding 
            their babies at six weeks of life by 2005.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-6#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Falkirk Football 
            Club</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Falkirk Football 
            Club on winning the Scottish Football League First Division Championship 
            and believes that Falkirk Football Club now deserves to be promoted 
            to the Scottish Premier League.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-5</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Lodging of Motions</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament believes that, in order to realise further the spirit 
            of consensual politics, the procedure for lodging motions should be 
            changed to enable motions to be lodged in the name of more than one 
            member.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mark Ruskell, Eleanor Scott, Shiona Baird, Chris Ballance, 
            Mark Ballard</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-4</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Borders Railway</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament endorses the commitment by its predecessor on 1 June 
            2000 to reinstate the Borders railway from Edinburgh to Carlisle; 
            notes the Liberal Democrats' election pledge to fund this line, and 
            therefore expects all parties within the Executive to make an unequivocal 
            commitment to finance the line.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-4.1</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Borders Railway</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-4) in the name of Christine Grahame, leave 
            out from &quot;and" to end and insert "further notes the failure of 
            the Scottish National Party to give a similar commitment; welcomes 
            the imminent publication of a draft bill on the Borders railway, and 
            urges all parties in the Parliament to support it."</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-3</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Cod Crusaders</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates the "Cod Crusaders" on their campaign 
            in support of the Scottish fishing industry and welcomes their success 
            in keeping the issue of the damage done to our communities by the 
            present Common Fisheries Policy at the forefront of political debate.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Relocation of Scottish 
            Natural Heritage</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the decision 
            by the Scottish Executive to relocate the headquarters of Scottish 
            Natural Heritage (SNH) from Edinburgh to Inverness; acknowledges the 
            campaigning work of the Public and Commercial Services Union to highlight 
            the effect of this proposed relocation for SNH employees; believes 
            that the operational effectiveness of SNH should be paramount in any 
            decision to relocate SNH, and therefore considers that the Executive 
            should reconsider the decision to relocate SNH to Inverness.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Susan Deacon, Mike Pringle, Jeremy Purvis, Mrs Margaret 
            Smith, Bristow Muldoon, Mr John Home Robertson, Elaine Smith</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Raffan: Cairngorms National 
            Park</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the successful establishment 
            of Scotland&#146;s second national park in the Cairngorms; notes that 
            highland Perthshire is a vital part of the coherent natural and cultural 
            identity of the Cairngorms; believes that the park's boundary should 
            include this area, as recommended by Scottish Natural Heritage and 
            supported by the overwhelming majority of respondents to the Scottish 
            Executive&#146;s consultation on the draft designation order and by 
            the Rural Development Committee unanimously in the first session of 
            the Parliament, and calls on the Executive to institute an immediate 
            review of the park's boundary.</p>
