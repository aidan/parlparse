<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Liberal Democrats Debate: Aberdeen Crossrail&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3674</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Crossrail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament affirms its support for the Aberdeen Crossrail project, a vital infrastructure link for the region, which would provide a frequent cross-city rail service with commuter trains leaving Inverurie and Stonehaven for Aberdeen every 15 minutes and the opening of new stations north and south of Aberdeen including at Kintore, Newtonhill and Altens; notes that the project previously enjoyed cross-party support and was hailed as a key transport priority for the north east with the potential to bring significant economic and environmental benefits; deeply regrets that the project has been omitted from the Strategic Transport Projects Review, and calls on the Scottish Government to make a firm commitment to work with Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City councils through NESTRANS and its rail industry partners to restart the active development of the Aberdeen Crossrail project immediately. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3674.3</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Aberdeen Crossrail</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3674) in the name of Alison McInnes, leave out from &quot;which would&quot; to end and insert&nbsp;&quot;which is being tackled incrementally by the introduction of new services from Inverurie, the opening of Laurencekirk station, the re-timetabling of other services and the bringing forward of work on Kintore station; believes that this incremental approach delivers early and cost-effective benefits to rail services across Aberdeen; recognises that the introduction of additional stops increases journey times and can, in certain circumstances, reduce the viability of services overall; welcomes the real progress being made by the Scottish Government after years of inaction, and looks forward to further rail investment in the north as announced in the Strategic Transport Projects Review.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3674.1</strong> <strong>Des McNulty: Aberdeen Crossrail</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3674) in the name of Alison McInnes, after &quot;region&quot; insert &quot;and for the wider national transport network in Scotland&quot;. </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-3674.2</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Aberdeen Crossrail</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3674) in the name of Alison McInnes, leave out from &quot;with commuter&quot; to end and insert &quot;; notes the comments of NESTRANS, previously chaired by Alison McInnes MSP, in its regional transport strategy, that &quot;it is clear that improved rail services can only realistically be delivered on an incremental basis and in a way that capitalises on existing planned investment&quot;; welcomes the recent improvements to the timetable, meaning that there is now a significantly better service north of Aberdeen than was the case when Nicol Stephen MSP and Tavish Scott MSP were ministers for transport; considers that proposals contained in the Strategic Projects Transport Review to improve services north and south of Aberdeen must be progressed as a priority as a key means of securing better crossrail services; welcomes the forthcoming opening of Laurencekirk station and considers that plans to open Kintore station should now be taken forward; further considers that local agencies should work together to build strong cases for the opening of stations at Newtonhill and Altens; notes with regret the very poor stewardship of rail projects under successive Liberal Democrat transport ministers, notably the significant cost overruns and delays that blighted the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line and the managerial paralysis at the heart of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link, and regrets the additional investment for projects such as Aberdeen Crossrail that has been lost as a result of this mismanagement.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Liberal Democrats Debate: Minimum Income Guarantee for Students&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3675</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Minimum Income Guarantee for Students</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of the higher and further education sector; notes the outcome of the <em>New Horizons: responding to the challenges of the 21st century </em>report and the need to involve key stakeholders in discussions about the funding of the university sector; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s students have been let down by the SNP government&rsquo;s failure to deliver on its manifesto pledge to dump student debt; notes the <em>Supporting a Smarter Scotland</em> consultation on student support and rejects its proposals for not adequately addressing student hardship, and calls on the Scottish Government to deliver a simplified support system, which includes a minimum income guarantee of &pound;7,000 per annum for full-time higher education students made up from a combination of grants, loans and parental contributions. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>

    <p><strong>S3M-3675.1</strong> <strong>Claire Baker: Minimum Income Guarantee for Students</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3675) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave out from &quot;its proposals&quot; to end and insert &quot;all of its proposals for not adequately addressing student hardship; expresses serious concern at reports of childcare and hardship funds being stretched to breaking point across colleges and universities in Scotland; recognises the calls of the NUS and other student representatives for a &pound;7,000 minimum income guarantee but believes that a &pound;7,000 minimum income for all students in Scotland is unachievable with the funds allocated for student support by the Scottish Government in this spending review period, and calls on the Scottish Government to come forward with new proposals that focus the available resources at the poorest students to genuinely address student hardship in Scotland.&quot;</p>
