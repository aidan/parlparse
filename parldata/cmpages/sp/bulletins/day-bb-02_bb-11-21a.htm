the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations of the Lessons to be 
Learned, Royal Society and Royal Society of Edinburgh inquiries into foot-and-mouth 
disease and welcomes the Scottish Executive response which builds on their recommendations 
and aims to develop a framework for reducing the risk of importing infectious 
diseases, reducing the vulnerability of livestock and minimising the impact of 
any future outbreak to give better protection to Scotland&#146;s valuable livestock 
industry</P><DIR> <DIR> <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3602.2</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Fergus Ewing: Scottish Executive Response to the Foot-and-Mouth Disease 
Inquiries</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3602) in the name of Ross 
Finnie, <A NAME="AmendmentText">leave out from &quot;and welcomes&quot; to end 
and insert &quot;; welcomes the fact that the Scottish Parliament was able to 
deal with the foot-and-mouth crisis more efficiently than it was tackled in England; 
endorses many of the proposals contained within the Scottish Executive response 
to the inquiries but considers that insufficient progress has been made to tighten 
import controls; believes that emergency vaccination should be deployed in any 
future outbreak, that there should be a total transfer to Scotland of all necessary 
power to handle any such outbreak and that the continued application of the 20-day 
rule is creating significant difficulties for Scottish farmers and crofters, and 
considers that the restrictions on access to the countryside were retained for 
far too long and had a severe impact upon the rural economy of many parts of Scotland.&quot;</A></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3602.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Alex Fergusson: Scottish Executive Response to Foot-and-Mouth Disease 
Inquiries</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3602) in the name of Ross 
Finnie, leave out from &quot;and welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;; regrets 
the late publication of the Scottish Executive&#146;s response to the inquiries 
and the curtailment of the debate on the issue; considers the response to be vague 
and urges the Executive to clarify its position on key issues such as the future 
use of vaccinations; calls on the Executive to produce clear evidence that it 
is working urgently with Her Majesty&#146;s Government to reduce the risk of importing 
infectious diseases, and seeks reassurance that the outcome of the inquiries will 
form the basis for continuing vigilance and regular updated contingency arrangements 
in the event of a future outbreak.&quot; </P></DIR></DIR><P><em>followed by</em>&#9;Parliamentary

Munro:</STRONG> <STRONG>Affordable Rural Housing</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
<A NAME="MotionText">notes the shortfall in affordable housing in rural areas 
for rent or for purchase particularly for young families; acknowledges that, in 
part, the cause of this can be traced to second home ownership; believes that 
in order to maintain a sustainable future for rural Scotland measures must be 
taken to encourage young people and families to remain in their communities, and 
considers that the Parliament should review the provision of socially rented housing 
as well as the extent of second home ownership throughout rural Scotland.</A>
