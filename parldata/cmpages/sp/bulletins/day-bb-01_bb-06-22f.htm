            <strong>Donald Gorrie: Frozen Money</strong>—That the Parliament notes the evidence 
            in the report <i>Frozen Money</i> produced by the Citizen’s Advice 
            Bureaux (CABx) Scotland; accepts the conclusions of that report, particularly 
            regarding the hardship and misery inflicted upon individuals and families 
            on the basis of debts accrued to local authorities; acknowledges the 
            concern expressed by CABx Scotland that the level of such arrestments 
            may rise since the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001 
            was passed; notes that, although the regulation of bank arrestments 
            and benefits is reserved to Westminster, the governance of local authorities, 
            responsible for around 91% of such arrestments, is within the competence 
            of the Scottish Parliament; urges all of Scotland’s local authorities 
            to accept a voluntary code of conduct which will pledge them to (a) 
            keep all of their residents meticulously well-informed in terms of 
            how much they owe for council tax and other charges, (b) ensure that, 
            when residents fall into debt, they will do everything in their power 
            to negotiate mutually acceptable terms of repayment and (c) guarantee 
            that they will use sheriffs’ officers and bank arrestments only as 
            an absolute last resort; calls upon the Scottish Executive to enter 
            into negotiations with Scotland’s local authorities in order to agree 
            terms for that code of conduct, and urges Her Majesty's Government 
            to bring forward legislation, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that 
            there is no conflict between the principle of protecting benefits 
            from arrestment and the operation of this protection in practice.<strong><i>
