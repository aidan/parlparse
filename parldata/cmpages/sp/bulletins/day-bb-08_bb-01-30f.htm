<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1260</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that poverty, inequality and deprivation are among the greatest challenges to be faced in Scotland today, that tackling these challenges is core to the delivery of the Government Economic Strategy and that development of a framework for taking forward these aspects of the Government Economic Strategy will contribute to the creation of a fairer Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1259</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Suspension of Standing Orders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, for the purpose of allowing up to 2 hours 5 minutes to debate motion S3M-1256 (Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2008) on Thursday 7 February 2008, the final sentence of Rule 10.7.1 of Standing Orders be suspended.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1258</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of high-quality school buildings to young people&rsquo;s learning; notes the SNP&rsquo;s commitment to match the previous administration&rsquo;s school building programme &quot;brick for brick&quot;; further notes that the previous administration built 200 schools between 2003 and 2007; condemns the Scottish Executive for its total failure to publish details of its school building programme, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to make a statement to the Parliament detailing the Executive&rsquo;s plans for building the new schools that Scotland&rsquo;s children deserve and that the SNP promised in its 2007 manifesto.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1257</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Concern Over Glasgow Housing Association Rent Increase</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) has agreed a 5.2% increase in rent; observes that this increase, the maximum allowable, was pushed through on the casting vote of the tenant chair against the wishes of 60% of tenants, while the rent on GHA properties remains significantly higher than that charged by other registered social landlords; recognises that many tenants remain in unmodernised properties with the threat of demolition hanging over their heads; further notes that this increase comes at a time when public sector pay increases are running at a low level and that the increase is likely to contribute further to financial hardship, and calls on the GHA board to consult further with tenants with a view to reconsidering its decision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1256</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>The Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2008 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1255</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Black and Ethnic Minorities Infrastructure in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates BEMIS for its excellent HMIE evaluation which classified it as a sector leader organisation; acknowledges its very positive contribution to the race equality agenda, the development of the ethnic minority voluntary sector and the communities that this sector represents in Scotland, and welcomes BEMIS&rsquo;s very effective work with ethnic minority communities and in support of the equality agenda in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1254</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Referral of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2008 be considered by the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1253</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Management of Offenders etc. (Scotland) Act 2005 (Members&rsquo; Remuneration and Supplementary Provisions) Order 2008 be approved.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1246</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Accessible Passenger Transport and the National Concessionary Fares Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance of accessible passenger transport to achieving the Scottish Government&rsquo;s climate change objectives and in tackling the significant inequalities in Scottish society; expresses concern over capped allocations for reimbursement for concessionary travel and the Bus Service Operators Grant over the next three years and the implications for fare-paying passengers; urges ministers to reconsider their decision not to increase the Bus Service Operators Grant in line with the support given by the UK Government to bus service providers in England and Wales; calls on ministers to urgently review the national concessionary travel scheme to extend eligibility to disabled people in receipt of the lower rate of disability allowance and to older and disabled people using community transport in rural areas, enabling these extensions to be introduced by the parliamentary summer recess, and invites ministers to consult users, passenger service operators and the Parliament on other desirable changes to the scheme.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1239#</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Penguin Publishers and the Future of Scottish Publishing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision made by leading publishers, Penguin, to end its presence in Scotland and its reported comments that &quot;it made more business sense&quot; to commission Scottish writers from London; considers that this is an ironic decision, given that Penguin will be leaving Edinburgh, a UNESCO City of Literature, and at a time when Scotland celebrates its most famous writer and bard, Robert Burns; believes that the decision could have a significant impact on both publishing in Scotland and the effective nurturing of Scottish literary talent in the south of Scotland and throughout the country, and further believes that Penguin&rsquo;s decision should be reconsidered.</p>
