          <p><strong>*S2M-959</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Highland 
            Peace Movement</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the Lochinver 
            Declaration for Peace launched on 14 February 2004; commends all those 
            people who have signed up to it and pledged to act for peace; supports 
            the growing movement for peace across Scotland; notes that this movement 
            will converge on Inverness on 28 February 2004 to urge Tony Blair 
            to do more to find non-violent resolutions to international conflicts, 
            and deplores Highland Council's imposition of charges on the Highland 
            Coalition for Justice not War for the demonstration.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-958</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Appointment 
            of a New Controller of BBC Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Ken MacQuarrie on his appointment as the new Controller of BBC Scotland 
            and looks forward to co-operating with him in developing Scottish 
            cultural activity, good quality entertainment and political commentary 
            and the reporting of the many good parts of Scottish life.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-957</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Nursery Nurses' All-Out Strike Action</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that Scotland's nursery nurses deliver an excellent package 
            of pre-school education and care to Scotland's children but receive 
            a woefully inadequate salary in return; further notes that Scotland's 
            nursery nurses have not had their pay reviewed for over 15 years, 
            have been trying to negotiate an improved pay and conditions package 
            for over three years and have been involved in selective industrial 
            action in pursuit of their claim for over nine months, but sadly both 
            the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Executive 
            have ignored the pleas of UNISON on behalf of the nursery nurses and 
            the nursery nurses have now voted by an 80% margin to embark on all-out 
            strike action; accepts that such all-out strike action will cause 
            difficulties for thousands of parents, but believes that nursery nurses 
            have been left with no choice; resolves, therefore, to support their 
            action by visiting picket lines, attending rallies and meetings and 
            organising financial donations, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to intervene on the side of the nursery nurses in recognition of the 
            fact that they are scandalously low-paid and deserve a starting salary 
            of £14,000 per annum and an improved career structure.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-956#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Conflicts 
            of Interest and Vaccination Policy</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the lecture given by Member of Congress, Representative Dave Weldon, 
            M.D. to the Institute of Medicine in the United States of America, 
            on 9 February 2004 in which he cites the in-built conflict of interest 
            of the Center for Disease Control, which &quot;is tasked with promoting 
            vaccination, ensuring high vaccination rates and monitoring the safety 
            of vaccines&quot;, which means that &quot;they serve as their own 
            watchdog - neither common nor desirable when seeking unbiased research&quot;; 
            recognises that this same conflict is replicated in the United Kingdom 
            by our system and believes that such a conflict fatally undermines 
            confidence in vaccination policy and is untenable; notes the interests, 
            including direct financial interests in pharmaceutical companies that 
            manufacture vaccines, of members of bodies such as the Joint Committee 
            on Vaccination and Immunisation, the Committee on Safety of Medicines 
            and the Medicines Control Agency; notes that Dr Andrew Wakefield has 
            issued a full statement robustly defending the allegations against 
            him and welcoming any investigation into his research; recognises 
            that his findings have been replicated by, for example, Dr Arthur 
            Krigsman, consultant paediatric gastro-enterologist at Harvard University 
            and Kawashima, Takayuki et al, in &quot;Detection and Sequencing of 
            Measles Virus from Peripheral Mononuclear Cells from Patients with 
            Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Autism&quot;, <em>Digestive Diseases 
            and Sciences </em>vol. 45, No. 4, April 2000, pages 723-729; is concerned 
            to note the lack of government-funded medical research and examination 
            of autistic children; notes with concern the physical findings of 
            persistent measles virus in the guts and cerebro-spinal fluid of autistic 
            children with bowel problems who have been examined, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive and the Chief Scientist Office should 
            proactively seek to fund and enable replicative clinical research 
            to identify the cause, or causes, of autism, with particular reference 
            to gastrointestinal dysfunction identified by parents, Dr Wakefield 
            and others.</P>

            <strong>Building and Supporting NHS Workforce</strong>-As an amendment 
            to motion (S2M-944) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from 
            &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the recent increases 
            in staff numbers across the NHS in Scotland and the need to promote 
            more flexible ways of working, create safer workplaces and give greater 
            protection for all frontline staff; seeks improvement in support for 
            continuing professional development and in developing new roles and 
            teamworking, but recognises the challenges facing the Scottish Executive 
            in achieving a sustainable healthcare workforce in the long-term through 
            local, regional and national service and workforce planning and redesign, 
            against the background of wider demographic and labour market challenges, 
            while recognising that over-centralisation of services and critical 
            GP and consultant shortages in some board areas is leading to reduced 
            patient access to health care.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-944.2</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Building 
            and Supporting NHS Workforce</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-944) 
            in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;is concerned that consultant, nurse and allied 
            health professional vacancies are at an all-time high and that these 
            healthcare workforce shortages are resulting in the ad-hoc and arbitrary 
            centralisation of services across Scotland without adequate public 
            consultation and often to the detriment of patient care, and therefore 
            urges the Scottish Executive to carry out a national review of service 
            planning and redesign in order to ensure equality of access to acute 
            and primary care services in all parts of Scotland.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-944.3</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Building 
            and Supporting NHS Workforce</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-944) 
            in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;recent&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;moderate increases in staff numbers in some 
            staff and professional groups but regrets the lack of resources and 
            effective planning devoted to the NHS workforce by successive governments, 
            in particular the failure to plan effectively to ensure that enough 
            NHS professionals were trained and employed to meet the needs and 
            changing demography of the Scottish population, the requirements of 
            the working time directive, the New Deal for Junior Doctors, the new 
            consultant and GP contracts or the increasing demands for staff in 
            specialisms; further regrets the continuance of the two tier workforce 
            through PFI/PPP and the unacceptably wide gaps in pay and pay settlements 
            between NHS workers; believes that our health service in Scotland 
            will only be able to properly meet the needs and aspirations of the 
            people of Scotland by stopping all PFI/PPP projects, making substantially 
            greater investment in training, professional development, recruitment 
            and retention, eradicating poverty pay and gender discrimination in 
            pay, rewarding all NHS staff equally, proportionately and appropriately 
            and by reducing the unacceptably high workload pressures on NHS staff.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-943.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>A 
            Better Deal for Young People</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-943) 
            in the name of Peter Peacock, insert at end &quot;and calls on the 
            Executive, as part of its overall strategy to address the offending 
            behaviour of young people, to reconsider its decision to withdraw 
            funding from the Airborne Initiative.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-943.2</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> 
            <strong>A Better Deal for Young People</strong>-As an amendment to 
            motion (S2M-943) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;acknowledges that having a strong economy 
            with efficient and effective well-run public services benefits all 
            in society, and specifically calls on the Executive to adopt the schools 
            passport policy, which gives all schools the incentive to achieve 
            and maintain high standards, thereby ensuring a better start in life 
            for Scotland's young people.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-943.3</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>A 
            Better Deal for Young People</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-943) 
            in the name of Peter Peacock, insert at end &quot;but regrets the 
            Executive's decision to withdraw funding from the Airborne Initiative; 
            commends the staff for the excellent work that they have put in over 
            the last 10 years; recognises that the initiative's strategy, in terms 
            of what was possible, has been a huge success in that at least half 
            of the participants completed the last course, and believes that the 
            Executive should consider whether it has any other scheme that is 
            likely to be anywhere near as effective in helping serious and persistent 
            offenders back into society and out of prison on a permanent basis.&quot;</P>
