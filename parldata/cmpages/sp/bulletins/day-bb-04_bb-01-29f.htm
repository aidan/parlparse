          <p><strong>*S2M-833#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Tax 
            Stamps on Scotch Whisky Products</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with concern that Her Majesty's Government is once again considering 
            the introduction of tax stamps on spirits, but not on wine or beer; 
            recognises that any such tax stamp would impact particularly on the 
            Scotch whisky industry; believes that the case for a tax stamp system 
            is not proven and that it would be an ineffective means of combating 
            fraud and illicit trade while imposing substantial costs and practical 
            problems on the industry, particularly in relation to labelling and 
            storage; notes the Scottish Executive's Scotch whisky framework which 
            supports a fair taxation regime for Scotch whisky, and therefore believes 
            that the Executive should make representations to Her Majesty's Government 
            against the introduction of tax stamps or any similar burdens on the 
            Scotch whisky industry.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-832#</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Charitable 
            Organisations' Water Charges</strong>-That the Parliament expresses 
            concern over the current rules of the Water and Sewerage Charges Exemption 
            Scheme for charities which exclude charities formed after 1 April 
            1999, and any formed before that date which subsequently moved premises, 
            from exemption from water and wastewater charges; notes that the move 
            to high standing charges recommended by the Water Industry Commissioner 
            has adversely affected such organisations, and further notes that 
            the Water Customer Consultation Panel's report on the principles of 
            charging in August 2003 sought a national, open consultation on the 
            best principles to be applied and that such consultation needs to 
            be started soon.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-831#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Disabled 
            Parking Spaces</strong>-That the Parliament notes the difficulties 
            experienced by people within local communities who have secured disabled 
            parking spaces outside their homes; deplores the fact that these spaces 
            can become a focus of conflict within communities where people seek 
            to use a space, although they do not have a disabled parking badge; 
            recognises that the current legal position, which distinguishes between 
            courtesy parking spaces and those supported by traffic regulation 
            orders, creates problems for people with disabilities who need to 
            rely on a designated parking space; considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should examine how it might legislate to address this problem, and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive, local authorities and all relevant 
            agencies should work together to develop an awareness campaign to 
            highlight the rights of disabled people and to emphasise the unacceptability 
            of harassing those who have been allocated such spaces.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Bill Butler<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-830</strong> <strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing:</strong> <strong>Rikki 
            Fulton</strong>-That the Parliament notes with great affection the 
            work of Rikki Fulton for the joy and laughter he brought to generations 
            of Scots; extends its sympathy to his wife, family and wide circle 
            of friends, and commends his courage in speaking openly of his struggle 
            with the debilitating illness, Alzheimer's Disease, over the last 
            two years.</P>

            Angiolini<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-828.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Modernising 
            the Court System - A New Supreme Court</strong>-As an amendment to 
            motion (S2M-828) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from &quot;believing&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;for England and Wales; considers, however, 
            that its creation affords an opportunity for the modernisation and 
            repatriation of Scotland's justice system, including an end to the 
            historic anomaly that allows civil, but not criminal, cases to be 
            appealed to a UK court and, having established that principle, calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to consult on whether the Inner House of 
            the Court of Session or a higher appellate authority within Scotland 
            should be the final court of appeal in Scottish civil cases.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-828.2</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> 
            <strong>Modernising the Court System - A New Supreme Court</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-828) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave 
            out from &quot;it is&quot; to end and insert &quot;in the event of 
            a United Kingdom Supreme Court being created, the Scottish Executive 
            needs to ensure both that Scottish judges are appointed to sit in 
            all civil appeals from Scotland and that decisions of the Supreme 
            Court in non-Scottish cases are not binding in Scots law except in 
            so far as the law determining such cases is applicable on a United 
            Kingdom basis.&quot;</P>
