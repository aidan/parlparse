<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am </strong>Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Liberal Democrat Party Business: Local Services </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em> </em><strong>S3M-8120 Robert Brown: Local Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the apparently endless desire on the part of centralising national politicians to attempt to take over control of local services, witnessed by proposals on police, fire and social work; opposes the flawed proposals for a single police force, under which, for example, local control of policing will be removed from the Northern and Grampian police force areas; does not support centralisation by government assertion, where no robust costs of change are produced; believes that a single one-size-fits-all approach to social work will waste money by destroying those successful local initiatives that are already in place, and believes that the people of Scotland will be better served by a new approach from government that trusts local people to make good decisions for their areas and equips local government with the powers, levers and authority to drive innovation and improvement in local services.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-8120.2 Kenny MacAskill: Local Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-8120) in the name of Robert Brown, leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that Scotland and policing have changed significantly since the existing structure of policing was introduced over 35 years ago; notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation papers on police and fire services reform and agrees that, given the significant financial challenges, such reform is necessary to protect and improve local services and to strengthen and improve local accountability and engagement; agrees that reform can only happen if it gives local communities and local elected members a greater say on local priorities and services, and notes that the expectations and requirements of health and social care have similarly changed significantly since existing structures were introduced and that reform is needed to deliver integrated services that are sustainable and appropriate and that make best use of resources focussed on the needs of local populations.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-8120.1 Michael McMahon: Local Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-8120) in the name of Robert Brown, leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the case for reform and innovation in Scotland&rsquo;s public services is unanswerable and that meeting the needs of the public is more important than preserving structures; recognises that the need to protect frontline services in the face of UK Government cuts requires the status quo in public services to be reassessed; believes that moving to a single fire and rescue service, a single police service and the creation of a national care service offers the best opportunity for improving delivery of these services in Scotland, and believes that these new structures will allow the reinvestment of savings to maintain frontline staff while ensuring that there are improved mechanisms for local democratic accountability and delivery on local priorities.&quot; </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-8114.1 Fiona Hyslop: Scotland Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-8114) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from first &quot;the Bill&quot; to end and insert &quot;Scotland is best served by a Scottish Parliament that has the full range of powers and responsibilities necessary to improve Scotland&rsquo;s economic performance and promote sustainable economic growth; agrees that the current provisions of the Scotland Bill do not provide those powers and responsibilities; recognises the improvements to the Bill suggested by the Scotland Bill Committee but is of the view that further improvements are needed to provide the financial responsibility that Scotland needs and to address other flaws in the Bill; nevertheless agrees that the UK Parliament should consider the Bill, apart from the provisions that reserve insolvency and the regulation of health professions (clauses 12 and 13) and allow UK ministers to implement international obligations in devolved areas (clause 23) and partial suspension of Acts subject to scrutiny by the Supreme Court (clause 7), and further agrees that, given the amendments requested by the Scottish Parliament, the incoming Scottish Parliament should consider the Bill as amended by the UK Parliament in a further legislative consent motion before the Bill is passed for Royal Assent.&quot; </p>

<p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-8024 Willie Coffey: The Co-operative Model, Born in Fenwick, 14 March 1761, Still Flourishing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 250th anniversary of the founding of the Fenwick Weavers Society in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun village of Fenwick as a significant milestone in the development of co-operative enterprises in Scotland and throughout the world; welcomes plans to recognise the founding of the society, which was recorded in the signing of a charter in Fenwick Parish Church on 14 March 1761, in a range of projects organised by the modern-day Fenwick Weavers Society in co-operation with East Ayrshire Council and with the support of a wide range of funders; notes that the projects will include the building of a commemorative wall on the spot in Fenwick where the weavers held their parliament and by the signing of a modern Fenwick Charter, to take place in the same church on 14 March 2011; further notes that the Fenwick Weavers Society has been described as &quot;the oldest example of distributive Co-operation of which there is documentary evidence&quot; and also as &quot;probably the pioneer of what is now described as the &lsquo;Co-operative supply association&rsquo;&quot;; highlights that among those signing the Fenwick Charter will be Scots from all walks of life including Scotland&rsquo;s growing co-operative sector, representatives of UK co-operative bodies, including Co-operatives UK and the Co-operative Group, the president and director general of the International Co-operative Alliance and a representative of the MONDRAGON Corporation, a co-operative group founded in 1956 that now has over 85,000 employees and plants in 18 countries, the largest business group in the Basque Country and seventh largest in Spain; applauds the fact that the worldwide co-operative movement, of which the early roots are in Fenwick, now brings together over one billion members, providing in excess of 100 million jobs, and considers that, in addition to being an important part of Scotland&rsquo;s history, co-operative enterprises offer Scotland a viable, efficient and accountable means of organising to produce goods and services for their members, for the wider Scottish community and for export. </p>
