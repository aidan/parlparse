    <p align="left">*S1M-379 #</b> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Fife Rail Service</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with concern the appalling level of rail services being provided to the
    people of Fife and makes representations to ScotRail and Railtrack to improve this
    service; notes with concern the overcrowding on these trains and the health and safety
    issues this presents; calls upon ScotRail to announce and implement an immediate action
    plan to improve punctuality, reduce train cancellations and increase the number of
    carriages on peak-time trains, with such an action plan to have been successfully
    implemented within six months, and further calls for an explanation why the new rolling
    stock which was ordered from the train manufacturing companies by ScotRail for use on this
    line has still not been delivered more than four years later.</p>

    <p align="left">*S1M-378</b> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell: Draft 2000-2001 Budget - Level 2
    Figures</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the Executive&#146;s expenditure plans
    published in the consultation paper <i>Spending Plans for Scotland</i> on 17 November 1999
    and endorses the spending priorities set out in the paper in line with the commitments of
    the Partnership Agreement and the Programme for Government.<b></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">*S1M-377#</b> <strong>Alex Neil: Malnutrition in Scotland: A Public Health
    Problem</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that malnutrition in Scotland is a serious
    public health problem; notes that up to 40% of people admitted to hospital are
    malnourished and the majority continue to lose weight in hospital; further recognises that
    the major burden of malnutrition lies in the community where one in ten post-operative,
    cancer and chronic disease patients are malnourished, accepts that many patients move
    between hospitals and the community on a &quot;malnutrition carousel&quot;; acknowledges
    that malnutrition has adverse clinical consequences such as post-surgical complications,
    delayed wound healing and impaired recovery from disease; further acknowledges that
    malnutrition costs the NHS millions of pounds each year in increased treatment costs and
    prolonged hospital stay; believes that unrecognised and untreated malnutrition has no
    place in a modern and dependable health service; welcomes the formation of the
    Malnutrition Advisory Group, made up of academics, clinicians and other health
    professionals to produce guidelines on the prevention, treatment and identification of
    malnutrition in the community, and supports working closely with this group to eradicate
    malnutrition in Scotland.</p>

    <p align="left">*S1M-376</b> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Agricultural Business Improvement Schemes</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament believes that Her Majesty&#146;s Government is under a moral obligation to

    Business Improvement Schemes following the specific assurances to that effect given by a
    Minister of Her Majesty&#146;s Government in February 1999.</p>

    <p align="left">*S1M-375</b> <strong>Maureen Macmillan: Highlands and Islands</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament expresses its confidence in the people and organisations of the Highlands and
    Islands; notes the historic and continuing trend of growing population in the Highlands
    and Islands encouraged by the area&#146;s strong cultural revival; notes the recent
    downward trend of unemployment that has seen unemployment fall by 5.8% in the Highlands
    and Islands Enterprise area; welcomes the growth of inward investment, including 1,275
    jobs that have stemmed from 18 inward investment projects, that will help sustain a strong
    and more diversified economy in the Highlands and Islands than at any recent time;
    condemns those who constantly seek to talk down the capacity of the people of the
    Highlands and Islands to effectively deal with new challenges to their prosperity, and
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to continue its support for Highlands and Islands
    Enterprise, Highland Council and relevant groups to ensure that the revival of the
    Highland economy over recent years is sustained for the long term.<b></p>
