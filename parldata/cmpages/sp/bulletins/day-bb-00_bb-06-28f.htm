    possibility of extending the vote in community council elections to 16 year olds, as a
    first step in extending the franchise in all elections to 16 year olds, and further calls
    upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to promote
    and support appropriate amending legislation at the first available opportunity so that in
    all future elections young people from the age of 16 will be able to vote.</font></p>

    decision to close their nuclear power stations; notes that this move is in line with the
    Rio Declaration&#146;s aims of sustainable development and application of the
    precautionary principle and the international Bruntland Commission&#146;s conclusions that
    nuclear power caused a decline in quality of life and that the only solution was the
    adoption of sustainable development and to start living from &quot;nature&#146;s
    income&quot;; further notes that it was in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that developed
    countries agreed to reduce emissions of six greenhouse gases by 5.2% in total, and
    concludes that a truly sustainable energy policy, as being adopted in Germany, should be
    the long-term solution to pollution and global warming.&quot; </p>
