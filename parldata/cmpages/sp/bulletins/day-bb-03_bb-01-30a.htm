          <p>9:30 am&#9;Debate on Transforming Public Finance for Social Justice, 
            Regeneration and the Environment&#151; </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3818</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Transforming 
            Public Finance for Social Justice, Regeneration and the Environment</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes recent studies by the Scottish Executive and 
            is interested in building on them by considering and investigating 
            the contribution that land value taxation could make to the cultural, 
            economic, environmental and democratic renaissance of Scotland</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3818.1</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson: Transforming 
              Public Finance for Social Justice, Regeneration and the Environment</strong>&#151;As 
              an amendment to motion (S1M-3818) in the name of Robin Harper, leave 
              out from &quot;is&quot; to end and insert &quot;considers land value 
              tax to be a punitive form of taxation which takes no account of 
              existing taxation, profit or income streams and requires payment 
              in respect of land regardless of an absence of income.&quot;</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Debate on Abolition of the Council Tax&#151; 
          </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3809</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Abolition 
            of Council Tax</strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes that the 
            council tax is a fundamentally unfair and regressive tax; believes 
            in social justice and the redistribution of wealth from the rich to 
            the poor; therefore agrees to abolish the council tax and replace 
            it with the Scottish Service Tax which is based on an individual&#146;s 
            income and is inherently fairer, more efficient and redistributive; 
            notes that this tax would raise more revenue than the council tax 
            and that it would remove the burden of paying for local government 
            jobs and services from the shoulders of low-paid workers and pensioners 
            and place it firmly on the shoulders of the well-paid and the wealthy, 
            and believes that the introduction of this tax should be complemented 
            by the return of the right for local authorities to raise and retain 
            their business rates and a thorough investigation of land value and 
            speculation taxes to supplement local authority revenue</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3809.1</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock: Abolition of 
              Council Tax</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3809) in 
              the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave out from first &quot;believes&quot; 
              to end and insert &quot;notes that the Local Government Committee, 
              in its 6th Report 2002, <em>Report on Inquiry into Local Government 
              Finance</em>, published in March last year, saw no merit in the Scottish 
              service tax as outlined in evidence to it.&quot;</p>

            on Iraq Demonstration in Glasgow&#151; </p>

            for the February 15 Anti-War on Iraq Demonstration in Glasgow</strong>&#151;That

            the demonstration on 15 February 2003 in Glasgow called by the Scottish 
            Coalition for Justice Not War against attacking Iraq, and believes 
            that waging world-wide war against poverty and injustice would deliver 
            a more stable, peaceful and just world than a war waged on Iraq with 
            the resultant loss of innocent Iraqi citizens' lives</p>

            of the Clyde</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the importance 
            to Scotland of efforts to regenerate the Clyde; considers that the 
            Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise should establish and resource 
            a development framework for the Clyde which encourages joined-up thinking 
            and action; further considers that the respective councils, enterprise 
            companies, regeneration agencies and private developers should work 
            co-operatively in reclaiming derelict land, ensuring adequate flood 
            protection and improving the transport infrastructure, and believes 
            that ministers should make the regeneration of the Clyde one of the 
            top economic, environmental and social justice priorities for Scotland.

          <p><strong>S1M-3766</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>British 
            Cattle Movement Service</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            widespread concern amongst the Scottish farming community in relation 
            to the operation of the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) and, 
            in particular, the volume of administrative errors and the delays 
            by the BCMS in dealing with correspondence; further notes that, as 
            a result, the operation of the service has contributed to financial 
            hardship in the farming sector at a time when farming incomes are 
            already at desperately low levels, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive's Environment and Rural Affairs Department should institute 
            an amnesty for all farmers that have been alleged by the BCMS not 
            to have accurately and timeously supplied cattle record information 
            and make representations to the Department for Environment, Food and 
            Rural Affairs that a thorough review of the operation of the BCMS 
            should be instituted with a view to eradicating the difficulties that 
            have been identified. </p>
