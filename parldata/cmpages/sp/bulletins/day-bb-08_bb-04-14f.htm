<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1698</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Moving Forward with Free School Meals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the partnership between the Scottish Government and five local authority areas that are participating in the pilot scheme for the provision of free and nutritious school meals to all children in P1, P2 and P3; notes that this pro-health and anti-poverty pilot ends in summer 2008 and that it will be evaluated in 2009 with the hope that all P1, P2 and P3 pupils across Scotland will receive these from August 2010, as outlined in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s concordat with local authorities; further notes that sections of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 have been disapplied until the end of June 2008 through a statutory instrument passed by the Parliament in order to allow local authorities to provide free and nutritious school meals; calls on the Scottish Government to use section 57 of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 to allow any local authority that wishes to provide such meals to all children in P1, P2 and P3 to do so before August 2010 and hopes that local authorities, particularly those involved in the pilot which is coming to an end, would use such freedom to look seriously at continuing to provide free and nutritious school meals in the school year 2008-09 rather than waiting until August 2010.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1697</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Wind Farms and National and Regional Parks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the unique and valuable role that regional parks play in Scottish life and the need to protect them for future generations; notes that Scotland&rsquo;s three regional parks together cover less than 0.5% of Scotland&rsquo;s entire land mass and offer outstanding beauty to visitors; understands that Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park, covering parts of Renfrewshire, Inverclyde and North Ayrshire, has recently been threatened by a number of industrial wind farm developments that could see the installation of up to 240 wind turbines; accepts that if no turbines are built within Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park, North Ayrshire can still provide sufficient suitable areas for wind farms to meet its contribution to national renewable energy targets; is aware that the Scottish Tourism Economic Activity Monitor (STEAM) reported that there were some 1.6 million tourist days in Muirshiel Regional Park in 2005, with visitors generating &pound;77 million that year; is clear that a study undertaken on the impact on visitor numbers, should wind turbine developments progress, shows that more than a quarter of those visitors would not visit, at a possible cost of  &pound;20 million to the already depressed local economy which has suffered severe job losses through de-industrialisation and depopulation over many years; is sensitive to the fact that the park is used for hill walking, nature study, orienteering, hang gliding, paragliding and peace and tranquillity and that wind turbine construction would pose a great risk to bird, animal and plant life as well as to water courses and aquatic life; supports the campaign of the Ladymoor Windfarm Factory Action Group to prevent despoilation of Muirshiel Regional Park by industrrial wind farms; congratulates the unanimous decision of the Public Petitions Committee on 19 February 2008, following a discussion of Petition 1095, to write to the Scottish Government to seek a further response on whether adequate protection is afforded to regional parks in terms of development, such as windfarms, and the pressure these are under and what consideration it has given to discourage applications for windfarms in regional parks, and urges the Scottish Government to exclude certain areas, such as regional parks, from such developments.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1696</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>China and Dalai Lama Must Begin Talks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the European Parliament to support a resolution by the Greens/EFA group calling for opening of unconditional talks between China and the Dalai Lama on autonomy for Tibet; applauds the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, Fiona Hyslop MSP, on taking the opportunity at a recent meeting with Wu Qidi, Chinese vice minister of Education, to highlight the Scottish Government&rsquo;s concerns about human rights in China, particularly in relation to the situation in Tibet; believes in the individual&rsquo;s right to peaceful protest, and calls on the Chinese Government to immediately release Tibetan protesters still being held in custody.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1695</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>SGF Healthy Living Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Grocers Federation (SGF) on the success of the Healthy Living Programme launched in 2004 with the support of the previous administration and which continues to have Scottish Government backing; recognises the importance of the programme in improving the availability of healthier food options to communities through the local convenience store sector; notes that convenience stores are becoming the main focus for many low income areas where car ownership is below the national average; further notes the current discussions surrounding the development of a national food policy, and welcomes the contribution of the convenience store sector to these discussions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1694</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>The SNP&rsquo;s Broken Promises on Stobhill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, prior to May 2007 election, Shona Robison MSP pledged that the SNP was &quot;committed to retaining Stobhill as a small general hospital attached to the ACAD, with a casualty unit and an appropriate number of inpatient beds&quot;; further notes that since forming a minority government the SNP has repeatedly rebuffed calls to honour this unambiguous pledge, creating a growing sense of anger and resentment amongst staff and users of Stobhill Hospital; congratulates the Save Stobhill campaigners on their continued efforts to hold the SNP to its word and, at the very least, calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to establish an independent scrutiny panel for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&rsquo;s proposals for the Greater Glasgow area in order to interrogate the assumptions behind the original plans for Stobhill, the solutions identified and the progress made to date.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1693</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Apprehension of Gang Members</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes recent media reports and congratulates Strathclyde Police force in apprehending 17 youths in a strike against gang violence; notes that the raids on the gang members were low-key and were an attempt to use the parents as a way of helping the police; is disturbed that some of the weapons seized consisted of hockey sticks, golf clubs, bicycle chains and metal bars, and considers that gang violence in Scotland is a serious problem which needs to be dealt with by the police and communities working together.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1692&diams; </strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>How Much is that Doggy in the Window?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the international trade in dog and cat fur leads to the slaughter of around 2 million dogs and cats in Asia each year; further notes that there is considerable public concern about the lack of protection for animals in China, given its role as the main exporter in the dog and cat fur trade; notes that it takes 12 to 15 adult dogs, usually Alsatians, for a dog fur coat, which may be labelled for instance &quot;fox&quot;or &quot;sobaki&quot; and up to 24 cats for a cat fur coat, to be made and that these may also be used as trim on hats and gloves; notes that EU Regulation 1523/2007 banning the sale, production, marketing and import into or export out of the EU of dog and cat fur and products containing these types of fur will not come into effect until the end of 2008 and that, in any event, it is difficult to identify, after processing, the skins without DNA testing, and considers that stringent DNA testing of unclassified furs presented for import should begin without delay and, when the species of the animal is not clearly identified, entry of the item in question should be prohibited, in the south of Scotland and elsewhere.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1691</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Strategy for Play</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the introduction of the UK Government&rsquo;s play strategy for England and the commitment of &pound;235 million over three years to fund the strategy including the rebuilding or renewal of playgrounds and the creation of supervised adventure playgrounds; notes with concern that many children have deficiencies in communication skills when they start school; welcomes the contribution that play makes to the development and life chances of children; believes that the time is ripe for the development of an innovative play and communication strategy for Scotland, and urges the Scottish Government to give play and communication a high priority in its programme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1690</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Spiralling Costs of London Olympics</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the comments of Jack Lemley, former Chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority, that the true cost of the London Olympics has been suppressed and that the total bill could top &pound;20 billion; notes that good causes in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have already had their lottery funding slashed to meet the increasing cost of the London games, and calls on the UK Government to ensure that lottery funds are not further raided to meet the cost of the London games.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1686</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Restore the 10p Tax Rate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments of The Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP, Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, that it &quot;is a matter of regret&quot; that people on low incomes are to lose out from the abolition of the 10p income tax rate; further notes the comments of the leader of the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Party, in 2000 when she was Minister for Communities, that the introduction of the 10p tax rate would put &quot;more money&quot; in the purses of working women; expresses concern that the abolition of this rate will increase the taxes of at least 324,000 low-paid Scottish workers who only pay the 10p rate, and calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to abandon this policy, in light of its disproportionate effect on low-paid workers, particularly at a time of rising food and energy prices<font color="#0000ff">.</font></p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1685</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Widening the Gap Between Rich and Poor</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the gap between rich and poor has reached levels not seen for more than 40 years with the level of social mobility in the United Kingdom among the lowest of any developed country; believes that this inequality can only be exacerbated by the abolition of the 10% tax rate, announced by the Prime Minister in his last Budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer, implemented from April 2008; strongly disapproves of this fiscal measure which hits those earning less than &pound;17,000 per annum, effectively increasing the amount of income tax that they must pay; understands that those on low pay lose the benefit of the 10% lower rate and do not have enough income chargeable at the 22% rate to benefit from the cut to 20%; acknowledges that, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, around one-fifth of families in the United Kingdom will be worse off as a direct result of this measure and that three out of four women will pay more tax; is aware that, because the wage gap between Scotland and England is over &pound;2,000, there are more lower-paid workers in Scotland, therefore hard-working Scots will be heavily penalised by this measure; is alarmed that, according to figures published by Deloitte, in 22 Scottish Westminster parliamentary constituencies more than 50% of workers will be worse off, including North Ayrshire and Arran, and therefore condemns what the abolition of the 10% tax rate means in practice, which is that the poor are subsidising the better off and urges the Scottish Government to lobby the UK Government to reconsider this measure.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1684</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Scotrail Franchise Renewal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its grave concern about the decision taken by the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change to extend the First Scotrail franchise for three years to 2014 without consulting MSPs, transport authorities, passenger groups, trade unions and other stakeholders, especially in light of the fact that nearly two thirds of First Group plc&rsquo;s income to run Scotland&rsquo;s rail services is public subsidy; notes that the First Scotrail franchise is the largest contract let by Scottish Ministers, with the level of public subsidy to be paid over the lifetime of the franchise likely to reach &pound;2 billion; calls on the Parliament&rsquo;s Transport, Climate Change and Infrastructure Committee to conduct an immediate inquiry into the decision, and believes that the minister should have made the announcement to the Parliament.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1681</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>HITRANS Supports Equal Treatment for All Island Ferries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Chairman of HITRANS, Duncan Macintyre, when interviewed by BBC Radio Orkney, stated that HITRANS was keen to see all islands benefiting from the reduced ferry fares which are currently to be granted exclusively to the Western Isles, Coll and Tiree under the two-and-a-half-year pilot of the Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) charging regime; further notes that Mr Macintyre stated that HITRANS&rsquo;s preference was for a straight 40% reduction in ferry fares for all islanders to follow the example of the successful Air Discount Scheme, introduced by the previous administration, which cuts the cost of island residents&rsquo; air travel on all lifeline routes to the islands; believes that the excessive length of the RET pilot scheme seriously discriminates against Orkney, Shetland, the Argyll islands and all other islands excluded from the pilot, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider its plans for the RET pilot and to replace it with an equitable distribution of any funding available to cut ferry fares across all island routes.</p>
