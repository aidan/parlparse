          <p><strong>*S1M-2404#</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: Strategic Planning 
            in Fife</strong>-That the Parliament notes the strong opposition from 
            Fife Council, residents and community councils in Fife to the proposals 
            contained in the Scottish Executive's consultation document <i>Review 
            of Strategic Planning</i> which would split Fife for strategic planning 
            purposes between the cities of Dundee and Edinburgh; further notes 
            that Fife Council is the only local authority area proposed to be 
            split for strategic planning purposes; recognises that Fife Council 
            shares boundaries with other major public sector agencies such as 
            Scottish Enterprise Fife, NHS Fife and Fife Tourist board which, together 
            with its unique geography, make Fife ideally suited for strategic 
            planing as a single unit, and therefore considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should review its proposals in the light of the consultation 
            and retain Fife as a single strategic planning area.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2403#</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Edinburgh Tourism 
            Action Group</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the work and 
            success of Edinburgh Tourism Action Group (ETAG) in a difficult financial 
            and international climate; commends its work as a model of best practice 
            in private and public sector partnership, between private companies 
            and the City of Edinburgh Council, Edinburgh and Lothian Tourist Board 
            and Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian; acknowledges Edinburgh's 
            position as a tourist gateway to Scotland and one of the world's premier 
            city destinations, and believes that the Scottish Executive should 
            do all it can to support ETAG and the 25,000 people who work in the 
            tourist industry in Edinburgh. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong><a name="2402"></a>*S1M-2402#</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: 
            Research into Myalgic Encephalomyelitis</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the privately funded research to be carried out by Dr Derek 
            Pheby in Bristol, and that being carried out by Dr Vance Spence in 
            Dundee, into the factors which may be involved in the development 
            of severe myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME); recognises that ME is a 
            condition growing in incidence among both adults and children in Scotland, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should take the lead within 
            the UK by commissioning further research under the remit of the NHS 
            into the causes of, and cures for, this debilitating condition. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John McAllion<strong>*</strong>, Mary Scanlon<strong>*</strong>, 
            Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, 
            Margaret Smith<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2401#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie: 15th Anniversaries 
            of Greentrax and Kilbirnie Records</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Greentrax and Kilbirnie Records on their 15th anniversaries; recognises 
            the contribution of these companies, and in particular Ian Green, 
            to traditional music in Scotland, and hopes that together they will 
            continue to build upon their achievements. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2400#</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon: Proposed Closure 
            of Binny House, Sue Ryder Care</strong>-That the Parliament condemns 
            the unilateral and disgraceful decision by Sue Ryder Care to close 
            the Binny House care centre in Ecclesmachan, West Lothian; considers 
            that this shows a complete disregard for the interests of the residents 
            and staff of the centre; believes that by walking away from very substantial 
            offers of additional finance from health boards and local authorities 
            Sue Ryder Care has demonstrated bad faith, and further believes that, 
            unless this decision is reversed, local authorities and the NHS should 
            regard Sue Ryder Care as an unsuitable partner for any future care 
            projects.</p>
