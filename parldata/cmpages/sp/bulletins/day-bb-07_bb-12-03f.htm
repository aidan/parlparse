<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-954</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>The Future of Non-Formal Adult Education and Learning Opportunities in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the concern expressed by the Edinburgh Adult Education Group about the effect of the proposed cuts on adult learning in the City of Edinburgh and the consequent impact on current and future services; notes that in 2006-07 more than 40,000 citizens in Edinburgh took part in non-formal adult learning opportunities delivered by the Council and voluntary sector providers; further notes that one in five adults in Scotland have difficulty with reading, writing and number work; recognises the pressure on council budgets but notes that proposals to substantially cut the budget of the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s Community Learning and Development department look likely to result in the loss of a significant number of City of Edinburgh Council Community Learning and Development posts, the closure of community centres including Riddles Court, which has been a city centre hub for adult learning activity for more than 100 years and cuts in revenue grant funding to voluntary sector adult learning providers, and recognises that the cuts will seriously diminish a good-quality service which has taken years to build, will result in the loss of services to the people of Edinburgh, will seriously limit the city&rsquo;s ability to contribute effectively to its lifelong learning priority and will constrict the Parliament&rsquo;s ability to deliver a skills strategy that provides opportunity for all people across Edinburgh.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-953#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Support Project Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its dismay at the decision of the Scottish Government to withdraw funding from Project Scotland, the ground-breaking volunteering project, which since its inception has secured well over 1,000 placements for young people throughout Scotland; recognises the very real and tangible benefits both to local communities and organisations, such as the Temple Shafton Youth Project in Glasgow, which have participated in the scheme and wholeheartedly applauds the effort and commitment of the volunteers involved; acknowledges that participants have been able to discover and develop new skills during their time with Project Scotland; notes the cross-party support for motion S3M-695 in the name of Sandra White, which acknowledged the positive role played by Project Scotland in helping &quot;those previously excluded from participating in society to realise their true potential and aspirations&quot;, and believes that the decision should be reversed and support given to a project which, through the sterling efforts of volunteers, has made a significant contribution to a more inclusive and co-operative Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-952</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Kevin Rudd and the Australian Labor Party</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kevin Rudd and the Australian Labor Party on their election victory; applauds the new administration&rsquo;s commitment to taking &quot;action and action now on climate change&quot;, especially its decision to ratify the Kyoto protocol immediately, and welcomes Mr Rudd&rsquo;s intention to work closely with the UK Government, a recognition of the UK&rsquo;s international leadership on the issue of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-951</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Housing Supply Task Force</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the first meeting of the Housing Supply Task Force; notes that this taskforce incorporates a wide range of bodies with interest in housing, and hopes that this will provide a long-awaited way forward to tackle the shortage of affordable housing in many parts of rural Scotland.</p>
