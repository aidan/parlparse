          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S1M-736 Andrew Wilson: Financing Public Services</strong>&#151;That
          the Parliament expresses its concern at the level of resources allocated to Scotland by
          Westminster which takes no account of the requirements of Scottish public services, the
          level of revenues raised in Scotland or of the priorities of the Scottish people; notes in
          particular that health expenditure is rising faster in the rest of the UK than in Scotland
          despite the fact that there is no evidence of relative improvement in health standards in
          Scotland; observes that the latest polling evidence suggests that more than two thirds of
          Scots want greater powers for the Parliament, and therefore calls upon the Scottish
          Executive to bring forward proposals for a fairer, more fiscally responsible and more
          democratically accountable system of funding Scottish public services that allows the
          Scottish people, through the Scottish Parliament, to make the key choices about the share
          of the nation&#146;s wealth that should be allocated to public services.<i> </p>

                <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">S1M-418</b> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Suicide</strong>&#151;That the
                Parliament notes with deep concern the death of 874 Scots by their own hand in 1998; is
                aware that since 1984 the proportion of male Scots aged 35 or under whose deaths can be
                attributed to suicide has increased from one in nine to one in four, and for females from
                one in twenty to one in seven in the same age category, making suicide the most common
                cause of death in young Scots; recognises that in Scotland the suicide rate for males and
                females of all age groups is 32 and 10 respectively per 100,000 and increasing, whereas in
                England it is 18 and 6 per 100,000 and decreasing; believes the reasons for suicide to be
                complex, multi-functional and poorly understood, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to
                commission, at the earliest date possible, wide ranging, comprehensive research into the
                issue of suicide, analysing what makes people take their own lives, why the suicide rate
                in Scotland is increasing, why particular groups in society are more vulnerable than
                others, how other countries prevent suicide, and introducing an early warning system of
                diagnosis and intervention.<i><strong> </strong></i></font></p>
