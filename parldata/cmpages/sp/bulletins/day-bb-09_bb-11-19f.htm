<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5237</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Orkney RFC Win Scottish Hydro Club of the Month</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Orkney RFC for becoming the first island-based rugby club in two years to be recognised with the Scottish Hydro Club of the Month award and the &pound;1,000 prize; notes that the club has enjoyed an extraordinary start to its Scottish Hydro Caledonia Division One campaign, winning 10 out of 10 games by an average of 39 points per match, which is an impressive feat for a side that begins all but one away fixture with a seven-hour ferry journey; understands that the award also recognises the club&rsquo;s excellent disciplinary record and its extensive rugby development work in partnership with Scottish Rugby and Orkney Islands Council, which led to the appointment of Scotland&rsquo;s first island-based jointly funded development officer, Bruce Ruthven, and offers best wishes to all the club&rsquo;s players, coaches and the many volunteers who support it for continued success for the rest of the season.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5236</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Climate For Success at Brucehill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Brucehill Early Education and Childcare Centre in Dumbarton on becoming the 900th school in Scotland to be awarded the prestigious Eco-Schools Green Flag; notes that the Eco-Schools programme is an international initiative designed to encourage whole-school action on the environment; further notes that there are over 3,000 schools registered with the Eco-Schools programme in Scotland; understands that the Green Flag is the highest award level in the programme, and commends all the pupils and staff at Brucehill Early Education and Childcare Centre on their hard work and effort in improving the environment and attaining this recognition.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5235</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>9 to 5 Is Not an Option for Vale Babies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to reduce the community maternity unit (CMU) of the Vale of Leven Hospital from a 24/7 service to a 9 to 5 service; notes information that shows that the majority of babies born at the CMU are actually born at night; further notes that, of the 97 babies born at the CMU in 2008, 74 were born at night and only 23 were born during the daytime; believes that switching to an on-call service with minimal evening cover will affect the majority of expectant mothers in the area who have chosen the CMU to deliver their babies, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to intervene and strongly encourage NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to reverse this decision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5234</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Credit Union Strategy Conference</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Glasgow Credit Union Strategy Conference that took place on 19 November 2009; congratulates the organisers on the launch of a new promotional credit union DVD; further recognises the discussion on the role that credit unions in Scotland play in promoting the credit union movement internationally, and calls on all levels of government to support the continued development of credit unions.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5233</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Captain James Evans</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Captain James Evans of Eyemouth on being awarded the Merchant Navy Medal for his many years of service to the fishing fleet in Berwickshire; notes his vast experience as a captain and his tireless campaigning on fishing and maritime issues as well as his involvement in many other local organisations; considers Captain Evans to be a credit to the community he worked so hard to represent, and wishes him and his family well in their future endeavours.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5232</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>State of Scotland&rsquo;s Greenspace 2009 and SROI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Greenspace Scotland on the publication of <em>State of Scotland&rsquo;s Greenspace 2009</em>, the first comprehensive report on the extent of urban green space in Scotland, which amounts to 23 square metres per person; notes that the report contains information on the work of Renfrewshire and 19 other local authorities with regard to green space; further notes that the first social return on investment (SROI) analysis of a green-space-related project, the Greenlink project run by Greenspace Scotland and the Central Scotland Forest Trust, which examined the impact of a new cycle path on antisocial behaviour, health and activities for children, concluded that it produced a sevenfold return on investment; believes that this level of return is likely to apply to other green space projects in view of the beneficial effects of green space on health and wellbeing, acknowledged by the Chief Medical Officer, Dr Harry Burns, and others; calls for SROI methodology to be adopted widely by local authorities, the Scottish Government and other public bodies when assessing projects and making investment decisions, and believes that such methodology and the <em>State of Scotland&rsquo;s Greenspace 2009</em> report will both prove invaluable for improving the wellbeing of the people of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5231</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill, debate on the group of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5230</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Homophobic Bullying</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Stonewall&rsquo;s Education for All campaign, which aims to tackle homophobic bullying in schools; notes with concern research that shows that 9 in 10 secondary school teachers and more than two in five primary school teachers report that their pupils currently experience homophobic bullying, name-calling or harassment; further notes that homophobic bullying can result in lower educational achievement and also increase the rate of self-harm and suicide among young lesbian, gay and bisexual people; welcomes Stonewall&rsquo;s Some people are gay. Get over it! poster campaign, which was created by young people and will be used to directly target young people travelling to and from school on buses during National Anti-Bullying Week from 16 to 20 November 2009; further notes the steps taken by the Scottish Government to combat homophobic bullying with the toolkit resource for teachers, <em>Dealing with Homophobia and Homophobic Bullying in Scottish Schools</em>, and hopes that the forthcoming national anti-bullying strategy will further address the issue of homophobic bullying in order that all young people can enjoy the full benefits of learning in a safe and an inclusive environment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5229</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>The Future of Beechwood House and Albyn House</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report, <em>Managing the Needs of Drunk and Incapable People in Scotland: a Literature Review and Needs Assessment</em>; notes that the only existing designated places under the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 where drunk people can sober up safely are Beechwood House in Inverness and Albyn House in Aberdeen; understands that these institutions are under significant financial pressure, and calls on the Scottish Government, local authorities and NHS boards in Highland and Grampian to ensure that, at least until the Scottish Government considers its response nationally to this important review, Beechwood and Albyn houses are kept open.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5228</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Sandra White be appointed to replace Jamie Hepburn as the Scottish National Party substitute on the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5227</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and Buchanan Bus Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that over a year has passed since Glasgow City Council granted outline planning permission for construction of a multistorey car park on top of Buchanan Bus Station, to expand the retail space at Buchanan Galleries by up to two thirds and to demolish the popular Royal Concert Hall steps and replace them with a shopping centre entrance; further notes the objections made to the planning application relating to the bus station by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport and Transport Scotland and the concerns expressed by the city&rsquo;s major bus operators; shares their concerns that building on top of the bus station would diminish the attractiveness of the space and limit future flexibility and the development of bus services; acknowledges that improvements in accessibility to the Royal Concert Hall and better maintenance of the steps are desirable but rejects the idea that this requires the removal of the open, communal space of the steps and their replacement with another commercial facade; agrees that it is vital that public awareness of these plans is greatly increased, and calls on Glasgow City Council to assume responsibility for encouraging widespread public debate and engagement with the ongoing planning process for these major and contentious projects for Glasgow city centre.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5226</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>All Wales Convention Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the final report of the All Wales Convention; notes that the report calls for full legislative powers to be transferred from Westminster to the National Assembly for Wales in areas where the Welsh Assembly Government already has executive responsibility; further notes that implementation of these recommendations would be subject to endorsement by the people of Wales in a referendum, recommended to be held before the next National Assembly for Wales elections in 2011, and believes that a consensus exists in Wales both in favour of the Convention&rsquo;s proposals and in favour of a referendum as the correct and democratic method to bring about important constitutional change.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5225</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Inverclyde Chosen for Lottery Funding Boost</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Inverclyde has been chosen as one of five areas to receive a share of &pound;9 million of National Lottery money; notes that Greenock Central and East has been selected for a new Big Lottery Fund programme aimed at helping to revive communities; further notes that the Our Place initiative has been developed in order to make increased investment in areas that have not seen the expected level of grants over the last three years, and looks forward to seeing the development of this community and the others selected to receive this funding boost.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5221.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Tackling Clostridium difficile</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5221) in the name of Jackie Baillie, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;agrees that tackling Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) must continue to be a top priority for the Scottish Government; notes the range of actions that are now in place to drive down infections, backed by an investment in excess of &pound;50 million; welcomes the establishment of an independent Healthcare Environment Inspectorate that has begun its programme of announced and unannounced visits to all acute hospitals over the next three years; acknowledges that the establishment of a public inquiry into the events at the Vale of Leven Hospital last year will ensure that any additional actions are identified to help prevent such a tragedy happening again; further acknowledges that the HAI Taskforce has fully considered the Labour Party 15-point action plan and has agreed to further consider those measures not already included in its current three-year work programme; recognises the progress that has been made on a national staff uniform for NHS Scotland; further notes that the Scottish Government has agreed to pilot approaches to electronic bed management and tracking infections and will fully evaluate these pilots and take whatever action is appropriate, and further notes that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing will continue to ensure that systems and processes for the notification and management of outbreaks are improved in light of experience.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5221.1.1</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Tackling Clostridium difficile</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-5221.1) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to review the remit of the public inquiry currently being conducted by Lord MacLean so as to require that inquiry to consider the circumstances of other cases of Clostridium difficile in hospitals across Scotland to verify that the measures taken by the Scottish Government are sufficient to meet the needs of all Scottish hospitals.&quot;</p>
