            Executive to give serious consideration to the findings and recommendations 
            within the report, principally that a Children’s Commissioner for 
            Scotland should be appointed to ensure that children’s rights are

            in November as they are unable to pay their £11,000 wage bill due

            would mean that, of the 71 clients, an estimated 20 to 30 frail clients

            the two superb projects they run, Bealach House Day Care, Oldwood

            for more than 70 frail clients, ranging from those with cerebral palsy 
            to autism and dementia, is at stake; further notes that people, including 
            an 87 year old caring for her sister of 100 years of age, are able 
            to remain in their own homes only because of the existence of the

            all appeal for the service, which was founded in 1992, to be saved

            relative to other countries, resulting for example in Britain having 
            only eight Olympic sized swimming pools compared with 1,500 in Australia, 
            which has a population only a third of the size of Britain’s; notes 
            that the 199 countries participating excluded one of Europe’s oldest 
            nations, Scotland; notes that while most national Olympic Committees 
            are from nations, the International Olympic Committee also recognises 
            independent territories, commonwealths, protectorates and geographical 
            areas and that therefore, despite the Minister for Children and Education’s 
            statement on 28 September 2000 (<i>Official Report,</i> col. 792-3), 
            there is not necessarily only a single recognised Olympic committee 
            for each independent nation state; is pleased that American Samoa, 
            Aruba, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, 
            Guam, Hong Kong, Netherlands Antilles, Palestine, Puerto Rico and 
            US Virgin Islands all entered teams in the Olympics despite their 
            non-independent status; recognises that Scotland competes in the cricket, 
            football and rugby union world cups and Commonwealth Games in its 
            own right; believes that Scotland should compete in the Athens and 
            subsequent Olympic Games in its own right, and calls upon the Scottish

            believes that this discrimination against Scottish institutions can 
            only harm them and in the case of Ballet West may force it out of 
            business or to relocate from Taynuilt to outwith Scotland, to the 
            detriment of the local economy and employment; notes that Ballet West 
            attracts students from across the United Kingdom, the EU and as far 
            afield as Guatemala, Japan and Malaysia and outperforms competitor 
            schools from south of the border in ballet competitions and quality 
            of training; is puzzled by the Minister for Children and Education’s 
            view that &quot;there is no evidence of significant demand for Dance 
            and Drama training for young people aged 16 and over in Scotland&quot; 
            when 613 applications were received by Ballet West for 23 places;

            only progression into tertiary training encouraged by the Scottish 
            Executive is in England; is concerned that Scotland will become denuded

            talent as a result of this discrimination; believes the current position 
            of the Scottish Executive on this issue contradicts its own cultural

            promoting education, developing and celebrating excellence&quot; and
