          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-962#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: 
            Travel Dundee</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the actions 
            of Travel Dundee in removing or reducing the bus services on certain 
            routes in Dundee; believes that this reduction in service will affect 
            many people without access to a car, particularly the elderly, and

            Parthenon Marbles</strong>-That the Parliament notes the latest request 
            by the Greek Government for the return of the Parthenon Marbles, which 
            were unlawfully taken from Turkish-occupied Athens almost 200 years 
            ago and which are now held by the British Museum in London; rejects 
            claims by the British Museum that they can look after them more effectively 
            than the people of Greece, these being both patronising and also undermined 
            by recent evidence of defective cleaning work carried out by the Museum 
            on the Marbles; believes that, just as the Scots have received back 
            the Stone of Destiny, so the people of Greece have a right to receive 
            back one of their most important artistic and cultural treasures, 
            and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to return the Marbles to their 
            rightful home in Greece. </font></p>

            decline with the recent announcement of a further 290 jobs lost with 
            the closure of Laidlaw and Fairgrieve Ltd; further notes the £100

            Arbroath; notes the concerns currently being expressed by the parents 
            of children attending St. Vigeans about the possible closure of the
