                          result in much beneficial development of our educational

                          directly contrary to the Scottish educational ethos 

                          but would re-create resentment and division in our schools;

                          to improve Scotland’s distinctive education system by 

                          following the example of the Northern Ireland Executive 

                          in abandoning league tables, and further encourages 

                          the Scottish Executive to re-examine critically target 

                          setting for schools and the burden of externally imposed 

                          assessment on Scotland’s young people. </font></p>
