<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7429 Sandra White: Growing Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Garnetbank Primary School Gardening Club on achieving the Royal Horticultural Society&rsquo;s Campaign for School Gardening Level 5 award; notes that the level 5 award is the highest award available in the campaign, the criteria for which includes a termly planner showing lessons that have been taught in the garden, including which subject and year groups were taught and a couple of sentences on aims, objectives or content of the lesson; believes that the aims and objectives of the scheme, which are to encourage all schools to get growing and to acknowledge the right of every child to get involved in gardening, to demonstrate the value of gardening in enriching the curriculum, teaching life skills and contributing to children&rsquo;s mental and physical health, to convince everyone involved with education in schools of the value of gardening in developing active citizens and carers for the environment and to show how gardening can contribute to a sustainable environment are worthy aims, which will enrich pupils&rsquo; learning experiences, and hopes that the campaign will continue to grow throughout Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7428 Marilyn Livingstone: World COPD Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Wednesday 17 November 2010 is World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Day, an annual event organised by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease to improve awareness and care of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; notes with concern that the prevalence of COPD has more than doubled in the last two decades, killing more women than breast cancer and more men than prostate cancer and making it the fourth biggest cause of death in the United Kingdom; believes that events such as World COPD Day are important in raising the profile of the disease and its causes and encouraging people to have their symptoms checked as soon as possible, and congratulates the British Lung Foundation and Breathe Easy Kirkcaldy and other Breathe Easy groups across Scotland for promoting the importance of respiratory health and providing support and information to those with lung conditions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7427 Jim Mather: AV Referendum and 2011 Scottish Parliament Election Clash</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with real concern the UK Government&rsquo;s intention to hold a referendum on voting reform for UK Parliament elections on the same day as elections to the Scottish Parliament and other devolved institutions in May 2011; regrets the UK Government&rsquo;s failure to consult the Scottish Government or the Scottish Parliament on this matter, and calls on the UK Government to work with the Scottish Government to agree a new date that will avoid a clash with elections to this parliament.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7426 Ian McKee: Scotland Leads the Way on Distinction Awards Reform</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s action to reform the distinction awards scheme for consultants, which has seen the value of awards frozen for 2010-11 to &pound;28 million; further welcomes the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing&rsquo;s decision that in 2011-12 the freeze will continue and that no new awards will be granted; notes that the move will save the NHS up to &pound;2 million, which will be reinvested in frontline services on top of the &pound;2 million already saved by freezing the scheme in 2010-11; further notes that 2011-12 will see the distinction awards budget decline for the first time since devolution to &pound;26 million; congratulates the Scottish Government for taking the lead in its reform of a UK-wide scheme that is now under review by the Doctors&rsquo; and Dentists&rsquo; Review Body; strongly believes that the current system, which excludes other health professionals, including nurses, from being awarded for excellence, has no place in a modern health service; further believes that any NHS reward scheme must take into account the harsh realities of budgetary restraints that will affect the public sector in the years to come, and calls on the UK Government and other devolved administrations to follow Scotland&rsquo;s lead in reforming the scheme and directing more resources to frontline services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7425 John Wilson: Reported Incidents of Domestic Abuse against Men on the Increase</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the release of official statistics detailing incidents of domestic abuse recorded by the police for 2009-10; notes with concern that the number of reported incidents of male victim/female perpetrator domestic abuse has more than doubled since 2000-01 from 2,696 to 7,938; recognises that this now brings the total number of reported cases of male victims of female abusers up to 15% of all reported cases; considers that these statistics show a significant increase in reported incidents of male victim/male perpetrator domestic abuse from 173 in 2000-01 to 666 in 2009-2010, and considers that these figures demonstrate that a concerted effort is needed to bring to an end all instances of domestic violence irrespective of gender.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7424 Bill Wilson: Measures of Wellbeing, GDP and Free-market Ideology</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the UK Government on its decision to instruct the Office of National Statistics to produce measures to gauge general wellbeing and welcomes reports of David Cameron&rsquo;s ambition to place the eventual results at the heart of future government policy-making; predicts that, if these measures are robust and objective, they will steer policy away from free-market ideology and toward reducing socioeconomic equality by such means as implementing a truly progressive system of taxation, preventing tax evasion and avoidance, setting maximum pay ratios, eliminating the bonus culture and mandating the extensive use of community benefit clauses and related indicators of meaningful value in public procurement, and hopes that such measures will ultimately supplant GDP as a determinant of policy because it is of the view that ever-increasing GDP cannot be considered sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7423 Derek Brownlee: Prescription Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the financial pressures on the NHS and that the Independent Budget Review established by the Scottish Government has estimated that the full abolition of prescription charges would remove a further &pound;25 million of income each year from the NHS and accordingly calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider its position on prescription charges.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7422 Mary Scanlon: Care Home Costs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the changing demographics of Scotland and the increasing financial pressures on services providing care for older people; notes that independent and local authority-run care homes in Scotland are regulated in accordance with standards set by the Care Commission; further notes the wide disparities that exist between different service providers with regard to fees and costs and the disparities in the amounts paid by or on behalf of service users for the same service, and accordingly calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that its public engagement process, Reshaping Care for Older People, reviews existing models of funding and provision to ensure that value for money is coupled with continuing high standards of care.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7421 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 2007 (Membership of the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission) Amendment Order 2010 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7420 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 (Supplemental and Consequential Provisions) Order 2010 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7419 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Certification of Death (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1 be completed by 4 February 2011.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7418 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Historic Environment (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill be completed at Stage 2 by 17 December 2010.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7416# Kenneth Gibson: Energy Best Deal Scotland Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Consumer Focus Scotland&rsquo;s Energy Best Deal Scotland campaign and its aim of supporting consumers in Scotland to get the best deal on their energy bills; particularly welcomes the work that it will do with advice agencies to build the advice and support available for low-income consumers who are most likely to save by switching but currently least likely to do so; notes that Consumer Focus Scotland&rsquo;s <em>Paying the Right Price</em> research found that almost half of all households in Scotland have never switched energy supplier or tariff, meaning that around one million households are potentially missing out on average savings of &pound;100 per year, with many lower income households able to save much more; further notes that, of those who have switched, the vast majority have either saved as much or more than they expected to and that most also found it easy to switch; recognises the important contribution that switching energy supplier or tariff can make to saving on household outgoings and tackling fuel poverty, alongside wider energy savings initiatives, and backs the campaign&rsquo;s aim to support Scottish households in constituencies such as Cunninghame North to get the best deal on their energy bills.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7415&diams;   Jeremy Purvis: A Scottish Veterans Charter</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament appreciates the service that the men and women of the armed forces veterans community in the South of Scotland and beyond have made to the nation; values the breadth of commitment made by veterans, including carrying out what it regards as uniquely dangerous and challenging conditions of service; appreciates that, as a result of the particular characteristics of armed forces service, many veterans might need to call on support for physical and mental health problems, employment advice and social care; believes that there should be sensitivity with regards to the unique nature of military service when designing and delivering such services, and would welcome a Scottish veterans charter that would allow all public bodies to be able to recognise their duties and responsibilities in providing support to veterans and that would ensure that all veterans and their families are reintegrated, without disadvantage, to civilian life.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7414 Patrick Harvie: Human Rights Abuses in Gambia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the reported catalogue of human rights abuses taking place in Gambia, which, according to Amnesty International, include torture, secret detention, lack of fair trials and the disappearance of many people including journalists, civilians and politicians; highlights the case of missing journalist Ebrima Manneh who disappeared after allegedly attempting to publish an article criticising the Gambian Government for violations of human rights; expresses solidarity with the people of Gambia in facing these reported abuses and who are now living in what it sees as a culture of silence; particularly supports those Gambians who are resident in Scotland but who might feel unable to speak out about the situation in their country for fear of the consequences, and urges the UK and Scottish governments to ensure that international pressure is put on the Gambian Government in defence of human rights.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7413 Jackie Baillie: SNP in a Spin with the Living Wage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by SNP councillors on West Dunbartonshire Council to vote down a proposal to introduce a living wage for its lowest paid employees; notes that this is the fourth time that SNP councillors have voted down a proposal by the Labour Group to introduce a living wage for those workers earning less than &pound;7.15 an hour; believes that this flies in the face of comments from Councillor Ronnie McColl, SNP leader of the council, who, following what it regards as Alex Salmond&rsquo;s belated support for the living wage, performed a U-turn by saying that he had got it wrong and that he now supported the policy; believes that, with what it considers all their spinning, the local SNP must now feel very dizzy in light of this U-turn, and calls on West Dunbartonshire Council to implement the living wage without further delay.</p>
