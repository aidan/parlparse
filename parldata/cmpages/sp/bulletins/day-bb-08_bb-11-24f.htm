<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2945</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Call for Parliamentary Scrutiny of Aid Effectiveness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates and commends the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association UK branch on its timely International Parliamentary Conference which was held between 17 and 21 November 2008 in the Palace of Westminster for 92 colleagues from across the Commonwealth and beyond on the scrutiny of the effectiveness of international aid; notes that, following the Accra High-Level Forum in September 2008, the conference debated the vital role of parliamentarians in donor and partner legislatures in holding their executives to account on international aid effectiveness and commitments made under the Paris Declaration in 2005; further notes that the conference discussed the need to enhance the capacity of partner parliaments to undertake more effective scrutiny; recognises an outreach responsibility in this Parliament to assist in strengthening the capacity of partner parliaments, and calls on the Scottish Government to seek a meeting between representatives of the Scottish Parliament and the Malawi Parliament&rsquo;s International Relations Committee with a view to mutually improving parliamentary scrutiny of the bilateral aid agreements between Scotland and Malawi.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2944</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>The Robert Burns Humanitarian Award 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the Robert Burns Humanitarian Award on the eighth anniversary of the event; recognises the work of the award in giving an international platform to organisations and individuals who may not have been previously recognised for their humanitarian work; notes that 2009 represents the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns, and therefore welcomes the award, both as a representation of the universal ideals espoused by Robert Burns in his works of universal brotherhood and self-sacrifice and the hard work carried out by people across the world.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2943</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Molendinar Park/Moore Street Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the opening of the Moore Street housing development in the Gallowgate in the east end of Glasgow; compliments Molendinar Housing Association in producing a high-quality, mixed-tenure housing project that brought together four architectural practices to create a fantastic, new residential quarter in the east end; further commends the engagement with local residents in regenerating a former derelict site, and calls on the Scottish Government to learn from the experiences of organisations such as Molendinar Housing Association in how best to utilise resources for maximum benefit in the housing sector.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2942</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Emmaus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of a new Emmaus furniture store in the east end of Glasgow; recognises the tremendous value of Emmaus in working with some of our most disadvantaged individuals and of the work done by volunteers in bringing the values of social justice exemplified by Emmaus to a wider public; appreciates the work being done by Terry Waite<strong>, </strong>the national president of Emmaus, in promoting the contribution that Emmaus can make in tackling inequality; wishes the new Bridgeton furniture superstore a positive future, and hopes that it can provide a quality service to all its customers and assist Emmaus to raise funds to assist its companion programme in Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2941</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Govanhill Law Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the Govanhill Law Centre, a new law centre offering free legal advice to residents of Govanhill, which will work with the local community to root out slum landlords, gangmasters and organised criminals; congratulates principal solicitor Mike Dailly for his commitment to the centre; thanks Glasgow City Council leader Steven Purcell and Govanhill Housing Association chairperson Janice McEwan for their work on behalf of the centre; further thanks Louise Carlin of Oxfam Scotland&rsquo;s Poverty Programme for the charity organisation&rsquo;s ongoing support, and hopes that the Govanhill Law Centre will help empower the community to solve the problems that it faces and provide further confidence to residents in their campaign for a better Govanhill.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2939</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water Dispute</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern that Scottish Water has breached six years of constructive partnership with staff by imposing a 15-month pay rise of 3%, which equates to an annual offer of 2.4%, far short of the current rate of inflation, and as a result of this imposition staff have voted in favour of industrial action; notes that, by stark contrast, the remuneration of Scottish Water&rsquo;s executive directors has risen from an average of &pound;108,000 in 2002-03 to &pound;172,000 in 2007-08; commends the hard work and commitment of Scottish Water staff and the world-class public service that they provide and fully understands that their decision to strike has not been taken lightly; recognises that Scottish Water is publicly owned and accountable to Scottish ministers who are also responsible for setting the pay remit and approving any pay deal, and believes that the Scottish Government should engage directly and as quickly as possible with both trade unions and Scottish Water to resolve this dispute and ensure that public servants are awarded a fair and negotiated pay settlement.</p>
