- 12 October 2002</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the University 
of Glasgow and all associated with the Arts in Medicine Week, 7 - 12 October 2002,

the culmination of nine months of planning and hard effort by medical undergraduate

of the new purpose-built medical school building in University Avenue, created

<STRONG>Mr Gil Paterson: Listen Louder Campaign</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
<A NAME="MotionText">congratulates Scottish Women&#146;s Aid on its &quot;Listen 
Louder&quot; campaign, which aims to highlight the lack of services available

domestic abuse has on children and calls on the Scottish Executive to evaluate 
the current provision of services, in order to ascertain what further service 
provision is needed.</A></P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3477.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Mrs Lyndsay 
McIntosh: Closing the Opportunity Gap</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
(S1M-3477) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;notes the document <em>Closing the Opportunity Gap: Scottish 
Budget for 2003-06</em>; believes that the Scottish Executive&#146;s centralised, 
target-based approach will prevent the most vulnerable from realising their full 
potential, and further notes that the best way to close the opportunity gap is 
to offer vulnerable people real choice and diversity through reform of public 
services and to promote a low-tax market economy which creates jobs and allows 
our vulnerable people to lift themselves out of the poverty trap, thereby delivering 
a better life for all.&quot; </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3477.2</STRONG> <STRONG>Linda 
Fabiani: Closing the Opportunity Gap</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3477) 
in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end 
and insert &quot;notes the failure of the Scottish Executive to make any improvement 
in the field of social justice; further notes its inability to close the opportunity 
gap; agrees that the lack of adequate powers of the Executive and the Parliament 
perpetuates inequalities, and calls for the return of full parliamentary powers 
to Scotland.&quot; </P><P>Supported by: Mr Kenneth Gibson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3477.3</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Closing the Opportunity Gap</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3477) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, <A NAME="AmendmentText">leave 
out from &quot;which shows&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes, however, that 
the record and growing numbers of poor people in Scotland can only be lifted out 
of poverty by radical measures to redistribute income and wealth in Scotland, 
in particular by abolishing water charges for domestic households and the adoption 
of a scottish service tax based on income to replace the council tax.&quot;</A></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3474
