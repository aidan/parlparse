<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions  and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on  which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments  lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin  every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains  any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the  Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have  not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond  symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked  with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk  or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3819 Richard Baker: Beating  Bowel Cancer - 7th Loud Tie Campaign&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that,  despite increased efforts to raise awareness of bowel cancer, 3400 new cases  are diagnosed every year in Scotland; believes that, because of the importance  of comprehensive screening and early diagnosis, progress made though the new  national screening programme will be crucial in reducing the number of deaths  from bowel cancer; recognises that the screening programme, already piloted in  Grampian, Tayside and Fife, will see over 650,000 potentially vulnerable people  screened from 2009; supports further improvements in bowel cancer services,  building on the increased patient involvement and public awareness being  delivered though managed clinical networks; believes that more needs to be done  to raise awareness of bowel cancer; welcomes and supports Beating Bowel  Cancer&rsquo;s seventh &ldquo;Loud Tie Campaign&rdquo;, and urges MSPs to wear a loud tie or  scarf between 30 January and 5 February 2006 and help beat bowel cancer.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3818 Tommy Sheridan: End  Illegal Blockade of Cuba&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the UN General Assembly  vote of 182 to 4 to demand that the United States of America ends &ldquo;as soon as  possible&rdquo; its 45-year-old economic and commercial embargo against Cuba taken  last month; further notes that last month&rsquo;s vote at the UN General Assembly was  the 14th successive year that the vast majority of the world&rsquo;s nations have  voted to condemn and demand an end to the USA&rsquo;s illegal economic and commercial  blockade of the Socialist Republic of Cuba; regrets that the USA, Israel, Palau  and the Marshall Islands voted against the resolution and Micronesia abstained  but believes that these countries are completely out of step with the majority  of the world who believe that the USA&rsquo;s continued blockade is legally, morally,  politically and ethically unacceptable, and resolves to write to the US Embassy  in Edinburgh and in London to demand that the USA adhere to the overwhelming  will of the United Nations and respects resolutions passed by the United Nations  in the same way as it expects other countries to do.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3817 Tommy Sheridan: Socialism  Breeds Across Latin America&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the overwhelming  victory of Evo Morales, the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) presidential  candidate, in Bolivia last month and resolves to send a message of  congratulations and solidarity to him and his new administration for their  inauguration on 22 January 2006; notes that a centrepiece commitment of Evo  Morales was to nationalise Bolivia&rsquo;s vast natural gas holdings, the second  largest in South America, and to reject the US-inspired neo-liberal economics  of privatisation and inequality; welcomes the growing strength of the socialist  movement across Latin and South America, indicated by the growing strength of  Cuba, the rise of Hugo Chavez&rsquo;s socialist Venezuela, the election of Evo  Morales in Bolivia and the lead that left candidate, Ollanta Humala, currently  commands in the run-up to Peru&rsquo;s presidential elections in April, and recognises  that new winds are blowing across Latin and South America and that these winds  spell the end of imperialist neo-liberal subjugation of that sector of the  world in favour of wealth redistribution, public ownership, national  sovereignty and anti-poverty policies.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3816 Tommy Sheridan: Boycott  Coca-Cola&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the growing campaign to boycott  Coca-Cola based on serious claims of violence, including murder, against employees  in bottling plants in Colombia and environmental destruction in villages  surrounding its facilities in India; notes that universities like Oxford in  England and New York and Michigan in the United States of America have voted to  boycott Coca-Cola, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to  organise a boycott of Coca-Cola within the Parliament in solidarity with trade  unionists in Colombia and India.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3815 Tommy Sheridan: Impeach  the Prime Minister&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the recent comments on BBC  Radio 4 of General Sir Michael Rose, former Commander of Forces in Bosnia, in  relation to Prime Minister Tony Blair&rsquo;s responsibility for committing British  troops to what many believe to have been the illegal invasion of Iraq that &ldquo;certainly  from a soldier&rsquo;s perspective there can&rsquo;t be any more serious decision taken by  a Prime Minister than declaring war&hellip;and then to go to war on what turns out to  be false grounds is something that no-one should be allowed to walk away from&rdquo;;  further notes General Rose&rsquo;s specific statement in <em>The Scotsman</em> on 9  January 2006 that &ldquo;the politicians should be held to account, and my own view  is that Blair should be impeached. That would prevent politicians treating  quite so carelessly the subject of taking a country into war&rdquo;, and believes  that General Sir Michael Rose is, on this occasion, absolutely right and that  Tony Blair should be impeached for, as many believe, misleading Britain into an  illegal war under cover of lies, distortions and deceit.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3814 Mrs Margaret Ewing: Scottish  Environment Week 2006&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming Scottish  Environment Week which will take place from 6 to 12 February 2006; notes that  the event will highlight the importance of our environment and its value to  Scotland&rsquo;s society and economy; further notes that as a nation Scotland has  awoken to the importance of protecting our rich and diverse environment, and  recognises the dedication of individual people, workplaces and communities in striving  to safeguard our environment so that future generations can benefit from and  enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3813 Ms Rosemary Byrne: MilkLink  Job Losses&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with regret the decision of Tesco to  move UHT milk production abroad, jeopardising jobs at the Kirkcudbright  factory; supports and applauds the hard work and dedication of workers and  unions at MilkLink in fighting to save jobs; notes that the decision of Tesco  is a direct result of the current free market economic policy in world food  production, which is based on profit rather than promoting locally grown  produce, and calls on the Scottish Executive to promote Scottish farming in an  environmentally, economically and socially just manner to produce healthy  Scottish produce and protect and promote jobs.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3812 Carolyn Leckie: Equal Treatment for Local Government Pension Scheme Members&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament is concerned that local government workers are faced with  proposals to diminish their existing pension arrangements; believes that local  government workers deserve at least equal treatment with other public sector  workers in relation to pensions; is concerned that, despite the fact that the  Scottish Executive has responsibility for the Scottish Public Pensions Agency,  it has no direct input into the negotiations that will impact on Scottish local  government pensions; is further concerned that the Scottish Public Pensions  Agency has declared its intention to follow policy established in England and  Wales, where the proposals for local government involve the removal of Rule 85,  no protection for existing scheme members, a 1% increase in employee  contributions and an increase in the age at which benefits can be taken from 50  to 55, and believes that the Executive should exercise its full powers and  responsibilities in order to achieve a fair deal and equal treatment for local  government pension scheme members and not leave their fate in the hands of  negotiations being conducted in England.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3811 Dr Sylvia Jackson: Commonwealth Games 2014 in Stirling&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive on encouraging major world  sporting events to come to Scotland; welcomes the benefits that will accrue to  provincial towns and cities and all other areas of our country, and asks that  Stirling is considered to provide hotel and training base facilities for the  national sports teams competing in the Commonwealth Games 2014.</p>
<p>S2M-3810<strong>#</strong> Campbell Martin: <strong>North Ayrshire Schools PPP Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that  North Ayrshire Council, through a PPP project, intends to amalgamate St Andrew&rsquo;s  Academy in Saltcoats with St Michael&rsquo;s Academy in Kilwinning and to build a  &ldquo;superschool&rdquo; to be erected on Laighdykes playing fields in Saltcoats, the only  playing fields serving the towns of Saltcoats and Ardrossan; is concerned that  the council&rsquo;s plans will impact adversely on the educational attainment of  pupils and on the provision of open space and sports pitches in Saltcoats and  Ardrossan; is further concerned that questions remain over aspects of the  bidding and procurement processes adopted by North Ayrshire Council in its PPP  for Schools Project, and considers that public private partnerships do not  represent best value for local taxpayers and local communities.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3809 Sarah Boyack: Scotland&rsquo;s Ecological Footprint&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament acknowledges  the value of the ecological footprint as a resource management tool that is  easily understood and can help guide us to reduce our impact on the planet;  notes that the size of Scotland&rsquo;s ecological footprint currently represents  Scotland as using and polluting much more than our fair share of the global  environment and that, if everyone on the planet consumed and polluted at this  rate, we would need three planets to sustain us; therefore welcomes the  Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to reduce Scotland&rsquo;s ecological footprint and  to use the footprint as a key tool for communicating and delivering sustainable  development; further welcomes the first ecological footprint exercise by the  Parliament and commends Scotland&rsquo;s Global Footprint Project, involving the  local authorities in North Lanarkshire, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire, for  leading the way in the United    Kingdom by using the footprint to reduce  their global environmental impacts; looks forward to all local authority area  results being published in spring 2006, and encourages everyone to calculate  their own footprint at <a href="http://www.scotlandsfootprint.org" target="_blank">www.scotlandsfootprint.org</a> and set out to reduce it.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3788 Margaret Mitchell: Lanarkshire Health Accident and Emergency  Consultation&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament &nbsp;is  disappointed at the decision taken by the board of NHS Lanarkshire to omit from <em>A Picture of Health, </em>its accident and emergency care public consultation  document, the option to keep all three accident and emergency departments  within Lanarkshire open; believes that it is essential that the consultation  process should include the proper scrutiny and appraisal of the possibility of  retaining all three accident and emergency departments; further believes that,  if NHS Lanarkshire has a strong and overwhelming case for the retention of only  two accident and emergency departments, then it should have no difficulty in  convincing the public that this is the way forward, and therefore calls on the board  to ensure that it is included as an option for the reconfiguration of services  in Lanarkshire in order to give patients an influential voice in the future of  the health service and their own care.</p>
