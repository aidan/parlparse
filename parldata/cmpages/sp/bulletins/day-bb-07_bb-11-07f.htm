          <p><strong>*S3M-788</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Holding the SNP Government to Account</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the critical importance of the forthcoming three-year spending review to meeting the hopes and aspirations of the people of Scotland; welcomes the detailed scrutiny of the SNP Government&rsquo;s spending plans by parliamentary committees as a central part of the budget process; believes that there should be the widest possible debate about the spending priorities for the next three years, and therefore resolves to set aside chamber time for individual debates on the budget priorities for each Cabinet Secretary&rsquo;s portfolio: Finance and Sustainable Growth, Health and Wellbeing, Education and Lifelong Learning, Justice and Rural Affairs and the Environment not later than the conclusion of Stage 2 of the budget process.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-787</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Cuba&rsquo;s Sustainable Development</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, while encouraging Cuba to become a more democratic and open society, nonetheless congratulates that country on achieving, as reported in the WWF&rsquo;s <em>Living Planet Report 2006</em>, both a global ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per person and a rating of over 0.8 on the United Nations Development Programme&rsquo;s Human Development Index, thus being the only country in the world to meet minimum criteria for sustainability; further notes that this has been achieved despite an ongoing boycott by the United States of America, a country with a global ecological footprint of over 9 hectares per person; expresses its condemnation of this boycott and of the USA&rsquo;s continued operation of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and flouting of the Geneva conventions, and calls on all the governments of the world to learn from Cuba how to improve standards of health, welfare and education for their citizens with minimal environmental impact.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-786&diams; </strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Lancastria</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the forthcoming armistice commemorations and takes time to reflect on the remarkable sacrifice made by veterans of many countries during numerous conflicts since the First World War; notes, in particular, the loss of the troopship, Lancastria, which was sunk on 17 June 1940 with the loss of 4,000 lives, an estimated 400 of them Scots, including individuals from the South of Scotland; notes the decades of official silence surrounding this loss, the worst for British forces in the whole of the Second World War, and supports the calls from the remaining survivors and relatives of victims for official recognition of this tragedy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-785#</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Showmen&rsquo;s Guild Scottish Section on its 100th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish section of the Showmen&rsquo;s Guild of Great Britain on its 100th anniversary this year; notes the enjoyment that generations of Scots have gained through fairs and shows across Scotland during this time and their importance to Scotland&rsquo;s tourism, culture and economy; further notes the concerns of the Showmen&rsquo;s Guild Scottish section in relation to the fact that Planning Circular 22/91 is not applicable in Scotland and about a possible lack of sites for shows and fairs and storage in Scotland, and hopes that local authorities and the Scottish Executive will engage positively with the travelling show sector to ensure that fairs and shows can continue to be enjoyed for many decades to come.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-784.1</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>A National Food Policy for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-784) in the name of Richard Lochhead, after &quot;factors&quot; insert &quot;; believes that a national policy must include more assistance for public procurement of home-grown Scottish food to be achieved by improved co-operation between Scotland&rsquo;s local food producers and government,&quot;.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S3M-784.2</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>A National Food Policy for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-784) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;believes that educating children about where their food comes from must be central to any national food policy; resolves that early action is required to amend public procurement policy to ensure greater use of freshly produced healthy food in the public sector, including in our schools, hospitals and other public bodies; calls on the Scottish Government to assist in the development of farmers&rsquo; co-operatives and farmers&rsquo; markets, and further calls on the Scottish Government to work with retailers to encourage more use of local Scottish produce in stores.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-784.3</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>A National Food Policy for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-784) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;that takes into account&quot; to end and insert &quot;, building on work done by the previous administrations, and believes that policy priorities should include local procurement, affordability, sustainability and reducing Scotland&rsquo;s climate footprint, taking into account the views of the Parliament, industry and wider society.&quot;</p>
          <p>Supported by: Margaret Curran<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S3M-784.4</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>A National Food Policy for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-784) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;commends the positive work of Soil Association Scotland&rsquo;s Food for Life (FFL) programme in promoting food education and school meals that are 75% fresh and unprocessed, 50% locally produced and have 30% organic ingredients; urges the Scottish Government to consider how a national food policy could drive the implementation of FFL standards across the public sector in Scotland; further believes that sourcing ingredients locally is crucial for the future viability of Scottish producers and independent shops, supporting strong and cohesive local economies as well as reducing food miles and climate change emissions; is seriously concerned, however, that supermarket domination has undermined local economies, and calls on the Scottish Government to consult on replacing the Supermarket Code of Conduct with independent regulation without delay in order to protect consumer choice and the environmental, social and economic benefits of local food.&quot;</p>
          <p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S3M-765*#*</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>Extra-curricular Outdoor Education for Every School Pupil</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the vital contribution that taking part in extra-curricular activities makes in developing our young people; notes that extra-curricular programmes help our young people to learn new skills, to enjoy new responsibility, to appreciate the work of other people and to learn about leadership; notes the success of projects such as Crieff High School&rsquo;s Community Awareness Project, and considers that, in an age when too many of our young people are in the headlines for the wrong reasons and when there are increasing concerns about school discipline and the numbers of youngsters involved in incidents of antisocial behaviour, extra-curricular activities in schools and five days outdoor education for every school pupil in Scotland should be supported.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-721</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Social Work Cuts Force Frail Fife Pensioners to Stay in Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses profound concern that frail and vulnerable patients in Fife who have been clinically assessed as being suitable for return to their own homes or to a residential home are being denied the right to do so as a consequence of the policy change of the SNP and Liberal Democrat-led Fife Council, where a package of &pound;600,000 cuts has been made to the social work budget; further notes that these cuts have resulted in at least one patient dying while in hospital against his will and that despite clinicians saying that he could go home he died before he could do so because of the policy decisions of the council; observes that there has been a dramatic increase since July 2007 in the number of beds being blocked for patients waiting for vital surgery, with the outcome that savings made by Fife Council are being transferred to NHS Fife, resulting in no overall saving for taxpayers who instead now have to cope with the personal tragedies that are impacting on patients, with the additional  possibility that the beds being blocked will reduce capacity as clinicians seek to prepare plans for winter when increases in flu and chest infections can rise to very high levels, depending on a variety of circumstances, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to intervene in the outrageous situation where the savings by the SNP and Liberal Democrat-controlled council has not resulted in net savings to the taxpayer but has instead caused unnecessary misery and anxiety to the patients and relatives concerned.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-721.1</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Social Work Cuts Force Frail Fife Pensioners to Stay in Hospital</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-721) in the name of Helen Eadie, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that the Labour party, in control of Fife Council since its inception in 1996 until May 2007, did not face up to the financial crisis that it created within the authority; welcomes the fact that the new administration, in charge for less than six months, is taking steps to tackle the funding shortfall in many sectors; notes that this includes instigating a benefits check for elderly Fife residents which has thus far resulted in them receiving an additional &pound;1 million to which they did not know they were entitled, and wishes the new administration well in providing for all the people of Fife.&quot;</p>
