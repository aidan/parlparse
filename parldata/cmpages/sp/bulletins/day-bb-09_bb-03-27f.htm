<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3818</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations on the Opening of the New Burns Memorial Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates East Ayrshire Council on the opening of the new Burns Monument Centre at the Kay Park, Kilmarnock; congratulates East Ayrshire Council architects, 3D8, for their interior design and Hunter and Clark for the restoration and new building work; recognises that this is an exciting development for East Ayrshire and Scotland as a whole, bringing together first-class facilities to provide a research room and PC room that will now house previously scattered local history archives and records from each of the East Ayrshire burghs; notes that the centre will provide access to family history, census and burial records and will act as a complete guide to family and local history in the area; commends the fact that the centre will also house a collection of 1,500 volumes of Burns poetry, songs and letters as well as providing new registration services for the area, a new conference centre and a new venue for weddings and ceremonies, and hopes that the new centre will revitalise Kay Park and that it will be a source of pride for local residents, attracting many visitors to the area and resulting in a massive boost to tourism in the Year of Homecoming 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3817</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>End the Burden of Housing Date</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the urgent need to increase the provision of affordable housing for rent in Scotland; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s action to reverse decades of decline in council house building and the record investment of &pound;644 million in its affordable housing programme for 2009-10; regrets that 45 pence in every pound of rent paid by council tenants in Edinburgh currently goes towards servicing the city&rsquo;s &pound;280 million historic housing debt; considers that resources would have been made available to write off this debt if tenants had not exercised their democratic right to reject stock transfer, and urges the UK Government to take action during this time of economic crisis to enable local authorities to invest in affordable housing by writing off the almost &pound;2 billion of housing debt across the country.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3816</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Inn at Lathones</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Inn at Lathones in Fife on winning the title of Music Pub of the Year at the Publican Awards 2009; notes that, despite being one of the country&rsquo;s smallest live competition venues, it beat stiff competition from pubs in Croydon, London and St Albans; further congratulates the Largoward pub on hosting the Fifestock Festival, and looks forward to further successes.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3815</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Extension of Concessionary Accompanied Travel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Scottish Blind Persons&rsquo; Travel Card scheme, which gives free travel on all bus, coach, rail and ferry services throughout Scotland, and the fact that the card can cover a companion for those people who can use public transport only with assistance; notes that there are others who similarly can travel only if accompanied but that their provision for a companion is limited to bus travel, and considers that all those who need to be accompanied should be covered by the travel scheme, on all bus, coach, rail and ferry services throughout Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3814</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Praise for Scottish Productions in the Edinburgh International Festival 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the unveiling of the Edinburgh International Festival programme for 2009 with its wide-ranging and exciting mix of events; particularly notes its inclusion of Scottish material in a programme ranging from classical music, through the Age of Enlightenment theme, to St Kilda, Island of the Birdmen and The Last Witch; notes with satisfaction the inclusion of the Caledonia Sessions, which feature Concerto Caledonia, including an evening dedicated to Robert Burns&rsquo;s Worldly Friends, and encourages audiences to attend these top-flight shows and particularly seeks to welcome visitors from furth of Scotland to join our celebrations in this Year of Homecoming.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3813</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>North Glasgow Housing Association&rsquo;s &pound;10.5 Million Investment in Local Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by North Glasgow Housing Association that it will invest &pound;10.5 million in local housing in the coming year; notes that this investment will help build new affordable homes as well as improving existing stock, and believes that this will be of great benefit to local residents and will play an important part in the continuing regeneration of the communities of North Glasgow, such as Possilpark.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3812</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Knighthood for Bill McLaren</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the campaign calling for Bill McLaren, whom most fans would consider to be the voice of rugby, to be knighted; notes that, during a radio and television broadcasting career that stretched over four decades, he came to be regarded as one of the great sports commentators by rugby fans from across the globe; fondly remembers his particular brand of colourful commentating, which included phrases such as describing a player as being like a demented ferret up a drainpipe; further notes his immense contribution to Scottish rugby as a teacher and rugby coach in his native Hawick, and suspects that there will be dancing in the streets of Hawick and indeed many other communities around the world should this campaign prove successful.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3811</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Dunfermline Building Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes reports about the future of the Dunfermline Building Society, possible losses and its exposure to the commercial property market; further notes that the Dunfermline has for 130 years been a solid and trusted mutual and is now Scotland&rsquo;s largest building society; expresses concern that building societies are being penalised by the increased capital requirement and funding formula for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and calls on the Scottish and UK governments to do everything in their power to keep the Dunfermline as a strong independent Scottish mutual.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3810</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of Knoydart&rsquo;s Land Buy-out</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Knoydart Foundation on the 10th anniversary of the successful buy-out; notes that the community buy-out model adopted for Knoydart provided expert outside support incorporated into the membership structure; recalls that Knoydart along with Assynt and Eigg applied community models that were not adopted in the land reform legislation subsequently passed by the Parliament; celebrates the progress in developing sustainable services such as the hydro scheme to serve the peninsula&rsquo;s population; recognises the significant and well-deserved application of public support to aid the development of a severely disadvantaged community, which had suffered severe decline under the whims of private landlords, and offers fulsome praise for the recovery of one of the most deprived rural communities in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3809</strong> <strong>Christopher Harvie:</strong> <strong>Sunday Express Apology over Dunblane Article</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the apology by the<em> Sunday Express </em>for its wholly unacceptable front page article on 8 March 2009 about the young survivors of the Dunblane massacre upon their entry into adulthood, a dismaying intrusion into the lives of young people who suffered traumatic experiences and have done their best to come to terms with them; deplores the level of journalism in this article, now subject to a Press Complaints Commission adjudication, and expresses hope that the newspaper&rsquo;s contrite response marks a move towards more responsible journalism at a time of economic hardship where high quality information-driven reporting is one way to counter the financial troubles of the Scottish newspaper industry.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3762*#*</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>St Bridget&rsquo;s Chapel and the Mary&rsquo;s Meals Backpack Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the work of the Mary&rsquo;s Meals international movement and in particular the group working from St Bridget&rsquo;s Chapel in Baillieston; commends the initiative, which is helping to feed over 350,000 children in poor areas of the globe on a daily basis, encouraging hungry children to attend school to be fed and, through education, gain a better future for themselves and their communities; expresses great pride in the fact that Mary&rsquo;s Meals is based in Glasgow and administers volunteers and feeding programmes in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and recognises the hard work of the volunteers at St Bridget&rsquo;s who participate in the Backpack Project, providing deprived children across five continents with school bags and school essentials donated by local community members.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ken Macintosh<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-3741*#*</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Inadequate Infertility Treatment in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that couples seeking fertility treatment in the NHS have to wait for 20 months in Glasgow, 13 months in Lanarkshire, 13 months in Ayrshire and Arran, 15 months in Dumfries and Galloway, three years in Lothian, six months for Lothian self-funding, up to 18 months in Grampian, up to 14 months in Highland, 12 months in Tayside, up to two years in Fife and up to two years in Forth Valley and that Orkney decides on a case-by-case basis; is pleased to learn that Shetland has no waiting restrictions; is extremely disturbed to note that Fife NHS board ranks among the worst providers of the service in Scotland in that each frozen embryo is counted as a cycle when other NHS boards require fresh and frozen embryo(s) to count as a cycle and that Fife NHS board only provides two cycles whereas other NHS boards provide three, thereby effectively giving Fife couples a third less of an opportunity for this treatment that some other couples in Scotland have; expresses particular concern that when a woman is in a relationship with a partner who has a child from a previous relationship she is denied access to any form of NHS provision in this area of specialism, and considers that NHS Lothian provides an example in increasing the age at which it accepts prospective fertility treatment candidates in consideration of the fact that many couples will not know that they need fertility treatment until their late 30s and are subsequently restricted by the unacceptable waiting times.</p>
