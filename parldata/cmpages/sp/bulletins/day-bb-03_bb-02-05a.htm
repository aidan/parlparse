            young people and school children on the growing social, personal and 
            health problems associated with underage drinking; notes that many 
            of the youngsters that have attended the project's counselling programmes 
            have benefited from their participation; further notes that they and 
            their parents now have a greater awareness and a more sensible view 
            of alcohol and its dangers; is pleased to see that there is growing 
            interest in the project's work from as far away as the New Zealand 
            Police, and believes that such initiatives dealing with alcohol and 
            substance misuse amongst children and young people should receive 
            appropriate support from the Scottish Executive. </p>
