            of the Convention on the Future of Europe as an open and innovative 
            means of addressing the issues now facing the European Union; believes 
            that, in light of experience, the European Union needs to become more 
            effective, efficient, easier to understand, democratic, transparent 
            and accountable; recognises the role that Sub-Member State Administrations 
            can play in realising these objectives; welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
            engagement with Scottish civil society to stimulate discussion and 
            to seek views on the Future of Europe; welcomes the contribution that 
            the Executive has made to the debate so far, and calls on the Executive 
            to press the Convention to bring forward proposals for strengthening 
            the profile of the Subsidiarity Principle in the EU treaties, adopting 
            a new mechanism for enforcing it which allows for full Sub-Member 
            State Administration involvement, making greater use of framework 
            legislation, consulting Sub-Member State Administrations at an early 
            stage of policy development, generating greater transparency in European 
            decision-making and introducing financial impact assessments for legislative 
            proposals</p>

              out from &quot;Scottish Executive&#146;s&quot; to end and insert 
              &quot;Convention&#146;s proposal for a constitution or constitutional 
              treaty for the European Union which will delimit the powers of the 
              EU and member states; believes that the people of Scotland must 
              be given the opportunity to approve any such treaty in a referendum; 
              supports the Liege Declaration and the European Committee&#146;s 
              calls for powers for sub-member state legislatures that would give 
              Scotland full access to the European Court of Justice; urges the 
              Scottish Executive to actively pursue this objective, and recognises 
              that the most effective representation in the EU for small nations 
              like Scotland is gained by full membership.&quot; </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3508</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> Osteoporosis&#151;That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText"></a>notes that osteoporosis is 
            a major public health problem which results in more than 20,000 fractures 
            a year in Scotland, that the cost of osteoporotic fractures in the 
            United Kingdom each year is estimated at over £1.7 billion and that 
            one third of women and one in 12 men over 50 will suffer an osteoporotic 
            fracture; further notes that with an ageing population profile this 
            problem will become even more serious; is aware that osteoporosis 
            is both treatable and largely preventable; welcomes the fact that 
            the public and health professionals are becoming increasingly aware 
            of osteoporosis as a major health problem but is concerned that health 
            service provision throughout Scotland is patchy and that access to 
            diagnostic testing and monitoring varies around the country; believes 
            that sufficient funding can be made available so that all patients 
            have equal access to services for both the diagnosis and treatment 
            of osteoporosis and that all patients suffering a fragility fracture 
            or having other risk factors for the disease should be assessed for 
            the presence of osteoporosis, and further believes that public health 
            campaigns should be promoting the importance of lifestyle factors 
            as influencing bone health and preventing osteoporosis.</p>
