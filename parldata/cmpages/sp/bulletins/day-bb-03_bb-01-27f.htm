Margo MacDonald: Performance of Holyrood Progress Group</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament has no confidence in the political judgement and sense of proportion 
displayed by the Holyrood Progress Group as represented by its decision to celebrate 
and congratulate itself on the purchase of a reception desk for the new Parliament 
building, the price of which adds insult to the injury already done to the reputation 
of the Parliament by the group&#146;s inept management of the Holyrood building 
project and its complete failure to fulfil the remit to bring the project in on 
time and budget, and therefore directs the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body 
to relieve the current members of the group of their duties and replace them with 
a representative and competent group of MSPs.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3803</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Christine Grahame: Medacs and the NHS</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
is concerned at the consequences of the privatisation of prison medical services 
in November 2000 and the award of the contract to Medacs, a company that primarily 
supplies locum doctors; notes that these consequences include (a) the last information 
on the cost of primary care being pre-privatisation, when it was in the order 
of £1.3 million, but no subsequent figures being available owing to commercial 
confidentiality, (b) the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) not knowing how many doctors 
Medacs provides because it is for the contractor to arrange to provide the outputs 
specified in the contract, (c) there being no &quot;output&quot; specification 
because the contract is to deliver services in accordance with the SPS&#146;s 
<em>Standards of Healthcare for Prisoners </em>and (d) there having been no attempt 
to audit the company&#146;s compliance with the <em>Standards of Healthcare for 
Prisoners</em>; further notes that the poor performance of Medacs is demonstrated 
by a trebling of prisoner complaint numbers about medical services, substantial 
fines about which there has been no detailed information owing to commercial confidentiality, 
the comments of the British Medical Association on the lack of co-ordination between 
Medacs and the NHS on discharge for ongoing and future care and changing from 
30 minutes to 60 minutes the time within which a doctor on call must be able to 
reach the prison; is further concerned at gaps in SPS knowledge on the state of 
health of prisoners in that the SPS does not know how many inmates suffer from 
hepatitis C, HIV and other blood-borne illnesses, tuberculosis or mental illnesses 
requiring treatment and, in the light of the above and need for openness and accountability, 
calls upon the Scottish Executive to integrate healthcare into the NHS. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3802</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Ms Margaret Curran: Special Grant Report No.1: Special Grant for Scotland 
Asylum Seeker Assistance - Report by Scottish Ministers</STRONG>&#151;That the

<STRONG>*S1M-3799 Mr Duncan McNeil on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
Body: Appointment of Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament agrees with the recommendation of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
Body under Rule 3A.1.2 of Standing Orders that Dr James Dyer should be appointed 
as Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner under section 1(2) of the Scottish 
Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Act 2002 with effect from 1 April 2003. </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3796</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Pauline McNeill: Glasgow Twinning with Havana</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
congratulates Glasgow on becoming the first UK city to twin with Cuba; notes that 
the twinning of Glasgow and the Cuban capital of Havana will enhance cultural, 
educational and business links between the two cities that are historically linked 
by their respective roles in the sugar and tobacco trades; applauds the efforts 
of Havana Mayor, Hector Perez, and Glasgow Lord Provost, Alex Mosson, in bringing 
the twinning to fruition; further notes the crippling difficulties that Cubans 
continue to face as a result of 40 years of US imposed economic sanctions against 
their country, and urges other cities to join Glasgow in promoting friendship 
and exchange with the people of Cuba.</P><P>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Scott 
Barrie</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3795#</STRONG> <STRONG>Donald Gorrie: Care Homes' Water 
Charges</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned at the implications of 
the Court of Session decision on <em>Scottish Water</em> v <em>Clydecare Limited</em> 
as a result of which care homes will have to pay their water charges in full, 
when they already face continuing deficits because of long-term underfunding by 
successive governments, and believes that the Scottish Executive should examine 
this problem urgently and take appropriate action. </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3794#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Dennis Canavan: Safeway's Support for Scottish Football</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the bids being made to take over Safeway and asks that any 
prospective buyer give a firm commitment to continue the existing arrangements 
between Safeway and the Scottish Football Association for sponsorship of the Scottish 
football team and continue to support the development of youth football and the 
provision of a match ticket distribution network through local stores.</P><P>Supported

12th Report 2002, <em>The Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Act 2002:

2003.<em> </em> </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3785</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: Budget (Scotland) 
(No.4) Bill - Stage 1</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament agrees to the general 
principles of the Budget (Scotland) (No.4) Bill.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Jack McConnell, 
Mr Jim Wallace, Patricia Ferguson</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3784#</STRONG> <STRONG>Trish 
Godman: The Widening Pay Gap Between Men and Women</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
views with concern the widening pay gap between men and women; believes that the 
overwhelming majority of Scots will share this opinion; urges all employers in 
all industries and throughout public services to reassess their pay systems to 
ensure that female employees are not being discriminated against in relation to 
their male colleagues, and considers that the Scottish Executive should do all 
in its power to challenge the discrimination and prejudice suffered by many women 
in their terms and conditions of employment and where promotional opportunities 
are denied to them.</P><P>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson, Ms Sandra White, Mr

<STRONG>S1M-3783#</STRONG> <STRONG>Christine Grahame: Litter Louts</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the concerns of many people regarding the blight of litter 
in towns, the countryside and on the seashore, illustrated in the correspondence 
from pupils at Chirnside Primary School, Duns, which highlighted the increased 
risk of accidents to children, pets and livestock as a consequence of, for example, 
broken glass and discarded polythene bags; notes that traffic accidents can arise 
if drivers take avoidance measures when confronted with debris on our roadways 
and motorways and that the effect on tourism and its consequences to the local 
and national economy can only be deleterious; further notes that the pupils drew 
attention to the lack of litter bins, the impact of fast food outlets, the cut 
in refuse collections and the culture of disregard for the environment and that 
it may even be regarded by some as "cool" to throw away litter, and therefore 
believes that the Scottish Executive should consider the following measures: (a) 
providing education from an early age with accompanying publicity to bring about 
a culture change of regard for our environment and bring us into line with our 
European neighbours, (b) endorsing stiffer fines and penalties for litter louts, 
including community service in clearing litter, (c) being more committed to recycling 
and providing more assistance to local authorities who have a track record in 
recycling provision, (d) considering measures, including legislation, to make 
it mandatory that fast food outlets clear litter from their environs and (e) commissioning 
a questionnaire for tourists to ascertain their views on the cleanliness or otherwise 
of our towns, countryside and seashore.</P><P>Supported by: Michael Matheson, 
Mr Andrew Welsh, Tommy Sheridan, Alex Neil, Ms Sandra White</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3782 
Grampian Records Liquidation</STRONG> (lodged on 17 January 2003) Robin Harper<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>S1M-3779</STRONG> <STRONG>Roseanna Cunningham: Reported Comments by the 
Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes the recent statement of the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service 
as reported in <em>The Herald </em>on 16 January 2003 threatening to move HM Prison 
Perth to Dundee in response to Perth and Kinross Council&#146;s development control 
committee&#146;s legitimately expressed concerns regarding the demolition of C 
Hall at the prison and saying that Dundee &quot;would love (a prison) because 
a lot of prisoners come from Dundee&quot;; believes that such comments would be 
deliberately confrontational and, regrettably, all too typical of the Chief Executive 
of the Scottish Prison Service&#146;s management style, unnecessarily unsettling 
for the staff at HM Prison Perth and their families and outrageously disparaging 
of the residents of Dundee; believes that there should be an apology, and calls 
on the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice to make it clear that he 
would not support the closure of HM Prison Perth.</P><P>Supported by: Irene McGugan,

<STRONG>S1M-3766#</STRONG> <STRONG>Murdo Fraser: British Cattle Movement Service</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the widespread concern amongst the Scottish farming community 
in relation to the operation of the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) and, 
in particular, the volume of administrative errors and the delays by the BCMS 
in dealing with correspondence; further notes that, as a result, the operation 
of the service has contributed to financial hardship in the farming sector at 
a time when farming incomes are already at desperately low levels, and considers 
that the Scottish Executive's Environment and Rural Affairs Department should 
institute an amnesty for all farmers that have been alleged by the BCMS not to 
have accurately and timeously supplied cattle record information and make representations 
to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that a thorough review 
of the operation of the BCMS should be instituted with a view to eradicating the 
difficulties that have been identified.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Jamie McGrigor,

<STRONG>Gordon Jackson: Regeneration of the Clyde</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
recognises the importance to Scotland of efforts to regenerate the Clyde; considers 
that the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise should establish and resource 
a development framework for the Clyde which encourages joined-up thinking and 
action; further considers that the respective councils, enterprise companies, 
regeneration agencies and private developers should work co-operatively in reclaiming 
derelict land, ensuring adequate flood protection and improving the transport 
infrastructure, and believes that ministers should make the regeneration of the 
Clyde one of the top economic, environmental and social justice priorities for 
Scotland.</P><P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan, Ms Sandra White, Donald Gorrie,
