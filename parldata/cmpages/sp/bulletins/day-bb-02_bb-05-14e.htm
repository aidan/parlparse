          <p><strong>S1W-25844</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> To ask

            that the alleged rule of law stating that boundary divisions are held 
            <em>ad medium filum</em> is unmanageable in practice, that on a day-to-day 
            basis current practice in allocating rights and responsibilities uses 
            the principle of common property <em>pro indiviso</em> and that the 
            position resulting from this is such that this aspect of the law should 
            be subject to a most serious and considered review.</p>
