<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7061 Murdo Fraser: The Reverend Ian Galloway&rsquo;s Comments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament fully supports the armed forces for their dedication and service to Scotland and the United Kingdom, especially the Scottish soldiers currently serving in Afghanistan; notes that the Reverend Ian Galloway, convener of the Church of Scotland&rsquo;s Church and Society Council, stated in evidence to a parliamentary committee that medals should not be awarded to soldiers who kill their enemy on the battlefield; deeply regrets what it considers Reverend Ian Galloway&rsquo;s lack of understanding about the award of medals for valour; recognises that medals are awarded to soldiers for their courage and the sacrifice that they make on behalf of Scotland and the United Kingdom; believes that Reverend Ian Galloway&rsquo;s opinion does not represent the view of the majority of members of the Church of Scotland, and further believes that his comments have caused offence to church members and others and that he should reflect on whether he is an appropriate person to hold the prominent office that he occupies as a public spokesman for the Church of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7060 Kenneth Gibson: World Parkinson&rsquo;s Congress</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the accomplishment of the World Parkinson&rsquo;s Congress 2010 in bringing together what is considered one of the largest and most diverse groups of people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, caregivers, scientists and other health professionals, official and non-governmental organisations ever convened to discuss and investigate Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and the issues related to living with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease; considers that Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is one of the most debilitating, socially disruptive and costly neurodegenerative conditions in the world today and that people who live with it face serious challenges with movement and other functions that worsen as the condition progresses; believes that the scientific advances achieved to date and the further advances that will be made possible by increased investments in neuroscience over the next several years will provide the basis both for significant improvement in the management of Parkinson&rsquo;s and ultimately the prospect of a cure, and further believes that this will only happen through the allocation of significant research funding from government among others.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7059 Sarah Boyack: Edinburgh Chamber&rsquo;s Business Rate Plea</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the call from Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce for the reintroduction of transitional relief by the Scottish Government to soften what it considers to be the blow of this year&rsquo;s rates revaluation; joins the chamber in expressing its concern that the tone date,1 April 2008, on which new rateable values are based, came at a time when the Scottish economy was at the height of a lengthy period of growth and immediately prior to what is considered to be the longest and deepest recession in recent history and that the new rateable values do not adequately take into account the effects of the recession; notes that many businesses across Scotland are facing increases of 100% to 200% in their business rates bill; further notes that, as a result of the revaluation, many small-to-medium-sized businesses in Edinburgh and across Scotland have been valued out of eligibility for the small business bonus scheme and believes that this has led to a situation where they are being doubly hit; further notes that the revaluation is also hitting public services, with NHS Lothian facing a reported &pound;5 million hike in rates, which is equivalent to the cost of approximately 180 nurses; further notes that 3,300 businesses and organisations across the capital, including NHS Lothian, have appealed their rates bill and that that number is reported to be rising quickly, and further supports calls from the Edinburgh chamber for the Scottish Government to carry out an urgent review of the rating appeals process to ensure that businesses have the best possible opportunity to challenge unrealistic rating valuations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7058 David Whitton: Congratulations to Gillian Dick</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament would like to congratulate Gillian Dick on winning the Young Business of the Year title from the Association of Scottish Businesswomen; would further like to congratulate her on being shortlisted in the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce Business Awards for Best Use of Social Media; notes Gillian&rsquo;s hard work and wide range of business skills, and is confident that she will be a continual success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7057 David Whitton: Congratulations to Caurnie Soap</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament would like to congratulate Caurnie Soap on being the number one soap company in the ethical good shopping guide; understands that the family-owned company has an excellent reputation and is the oldest soap processor in the world; would additionally like to congratulate the owner for his 30 years&rsquo; service to the industry, and is confident that Caurnie Soap will continue to serve the public as a very successful business in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7056 Gil Paterson on behalf of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee: Report on the recommendations of the Commission on Scottish Devolution regarding Scottish Parliament procedures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&rsquo;s 5th Report 2010 (Session 3), <em><strong>Report on the recommendations of the Commission on Scottish Devolution regarding Scottish Parliament procedures</strong></em> (SP Paper 490) and agrees to its recommendations and conclusions.</p>
<p>Supported by: Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7055 Kenneth Gibson: Fossil Fuel Levy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the UK Government&rsquo;s respect agenda is already faltering after only five months in office; believes that, in order for coalition soundbites to be taken seriously, the UK Government should immediately release the &pound;185 million fossil fuel levy, which can only be spent on renewable energy projects in Scotland and is currently held by Ofgem; considers that, during this difficult financial period, this input of capital would create and safeguard thousands of jobs in Scotland while also advancing Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy potential in accordance with the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009; believes that, should the UK Government refuse to release these funds, it will have failed to meet one of the key political reforms that it proposed in its publication, <em>The Coalition: Our Programme for Government</em>, which stated that &quot;We will review the control and use of accumulated and future revenues from the Fossil Fuel Levy in Scotland&quot;, and further believes that the release of such funds should not be deducted from the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s block grant as was inferred by the previous chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7054 Kenneth Gibson: A Reduction in Smoking Means Fewer Asthma Attacks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the findings of recent research by the University of Glasgow concluding that the admission of children with asthma-related problems to hospital has dropped by more than 18% since the introduction of the ban on smoking in public places in 2006, a reduction equivalent to three fewer children being admitted each day; recognises that, prior to the ban, the admission of children with asthma was increasing at a rate of over 5% per year; notes that the researchers also discovered that, since the ban, there had been a 17% year-on-year drop in hospital admissions from heart attacks and a significant decline in respiratory problems among bar staff; considers that the smoking ban has resulted in a massive step being taken toward shedding Scotland&rsquo;s image of being the sick man of Europe, and believes that this legislation has greatly improved the health and wellbeing of the Scottish people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7053 Alasdair Allan: Scottish Quad Champion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates John Neil Mitchell of Newmarket, Isle of Lewis, on being named Scottish quad champion at the Quad Racing Scotland Championships that were held in Duns on 12 September 2010 and wishes John Neil all the best for future races and championships around the world, starting with the 2010 European Quadcross of Nations in Slovakia on the 26 September.</p>

  Bill Wilson: Business and Human Rights Conference, October 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes to Edinburgh the business and human rights conference of 80 national human rights institutions from around the world, taking place in the Parliament from 8<sup> </sup>to 10 October 2010; considers that the corporate sector has a significant impact on the enjoyment of human rights from Paisley to Phuket and believes that humanitarian concern does not compromise but rather helps deliver long-term commercial success; believes that the integration of human rights into business practices should be enabled and encouraged, building on the United Nations Global Compact and the framework developed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, and, as a first step, would welcome an acknowledgement of the relevance of human rights principles and standards in defining Scottish business practice at home and abroad.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7051 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Tricia Marwick be appointed to replace Bill Wilson as the Scottish National Party substitute on the Equal Opportunities Committee.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7050 Bill Wilson: Westminster Thinking on Science Not Just Wrong, But Mad</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes<em> New Scientist&rsquo;s</em> editorial of 15 September 2010, <em>Don&rsquo;t let Britain&rsquo;s politicians ruin science</em>, in which Professor Robert M May, former Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government, criticises the UK Government&rsquo;s attitude towards science; agrees with Professor May that Vince Cable&rsquo;s &quot;crude advocacy of more commercially related research showed little awareness of the complex interplay between basic research - new ideas - and their translation into products&quot; and, that money put into basic research &quot;is not a cost but an investment&quot;; notes that the proposed UK Government cuts in science funding come at a time when the United States has announced a $21 billion boost for science as part of a stimulus package, France is investing &euro;35 billion and Germany and China are also supporting science, and believes that the UK&rsquo;s pre-eminent position in terms of the quantity and quality of its scientific research, which puts it in what is considered to be a unique competitive position, must be maintained, and that, as Professor May expresses it, &quot;the current thinking is not just wrong, it&rsquo;s mad&quot;.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7049 Bill Wilson: Women Advised not to Have Children as Legacy of US and UK WMD</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes a report in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, <em>Cancer, Infant Mortality and Birth Sex-Ratio in Fallujah, Iraq 2005-2009</em>, on the effects of the United Kingdom and United States&rsquo; attack on Fallujah in 2004; notes the reports that this attack involved the use of illegal chemical weapons, phosphorous bombs and nerve gas; understands that it has been further reported that this has led to an explosion of infant mortality, leukaemia and cancers, exceeding those following the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to the extent that local doctors are advising women not to have children; supports the international courts in their pursuit of war criminals since 1945; believes that no individual guilty of such crimes should escape justice, and calls for the detention and trial of Anthony Charles Lynton Blair.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7048 Tricia Marwick: Congratulations to Glenrothes Heritage Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the pilot Glenrothes Heritage Centre, which celebrates the history of the Glenrothes area; considers that the unstinting work of the volunteers, particularly the chairperson, Linda Ballingall, has made it a reality and congratulates them; thanks the businesses for support in kind and Fife Council for financial assistance through Celebrating Fife 2010; notes that 7,500 people have visited the heritage centre in a two-week period, and believes that a permanent heritage centre in Glenrothes is now needed.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7047.3 Liam McArthur: A Low Carbon Economy for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7047) in the name of Stewart Stevenson, insert at end &quot;; welcomes the announcement by Ofgem of a review of the charging arrangements for gas and electricity transmission networks and hopes that this will pave the way to removing barriers to the development of Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy industry, and believes that the UK Government&rsquo;s plans for a Green Investment Bank to fund low-carbon transport and energy schemes and a Green Deal to overhaul the energy efficiency of homes and small businesses will benefit Scotland&rsquo;s efforts to build a low- carbon economy.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7047.4 Patrick Harvie: A Low Carbon Economy for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7047) in the name of Stewart Stevenson, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">regrets that the cross-party support for the long-term targets in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 has not been followed by consensus on the urgent and radical policy changes that are needed to bring about a low-carbon economy; believes that the Scottish Government should reconsider its support for increased road capacity, growing the aviation industry and building new coal-fired power stations, given the detrimental impact on Scotland&rsquo;s climate change emissions; regrets the lost economic opportunities from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s failure to heed calls for a rapid increase in investment in energy efficiency; calls on the Scottish Government to introduce more substantial support for the marine renewables industry, and believes that a sustainable economic vision should not leave Scotland dependent on the whims of the international money markets, which have failed the country repeatedly in the past, but instead should focus on building resilient low-carbon local economies.&quot;</span></p>
