            ex-Celtic player Paul McStay and ex-Ranger's junior coach David Preston,

            sport, fitness, team work and co-operation, develop interests and 
            skills and encourage friendship between youths from neighbouring communities.</p>

            congratulates the Scottish Executive on its commitment to making Scotland&#146;s 
            roads safer; welcomes its promise to introduce an Accident Investigation 
            and Prevention Scheme at the Laurencekirk/Marykirk junction as an 
            important first step, and believes that the Executive should introduce 
            similar safety schemes at other junctions along this stretch of road.</p>

            Boys B Division tournament in Olten, Switzerland between 1 and 6 July 
            2002; congratulates the team on winning its group by beating Wales

            A division; further congratulates the team on this significant and 
            well-deserved sporting success, and commiserates with the English
