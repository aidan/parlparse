<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4672</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Home Energy Efficiency Targets Required</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Sustainable Development Commission on the publication of its latest report, <em>Stock Take: delivering improvements in existing housing</em>; welcomes the report as a valuable contribution to the debate on how to improve the energy efficiency and sustainability of existing housing stock, reducing fuel poverty and helping to tackle climate change; recognises that around 70% of existing housing will still be in use in 2050, the date by which the UK Government has pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 60%; acknowledges that it is not sufficient merely to improve building standards for new housing and notes that if the 60% carbon reduction target is to be met by 2050 there must be significant improvements to the energy efficiency of existing housing, and calls on the Scottish Executive to include a commitment to set challenging and legally binding energy efficiency targets for all Scottish housing as part of its long-awaited energy efficiency strategy.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4671</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Concerns with Police Force Merger</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the significance of Stirling Council&rsquo;s unanimous decision to support a Conservative motion expressing opposition to any merger of police forces on the grounds that local accountability, community policing and public satisfaction will be reduced; commends the enviable detection rate, widely recognised as the single most important indicator of performance, of Central Scotland Police in clearing up 61% of local crime last year compared with the Scottish average of 45%, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to consider the effectiveness of crime fighting, rather than bean-counting efficiency savings, as the key driver to any reform.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4670</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Scottish Women&rsquo;s Hospital for Foreign Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its disappointment that the recent Edinburgh commemoration service for the Battle of the Somme, remembering those who sacrificed life and limb, failed to recognise the vital role carried out by the heroic volunteers of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Scottish Women&rsquo;s Hospital for Foreign Service and considers that Scottish parliamentarians and members of the Edinburgh City Council should redouble their efforts to support and deliver a commemorative statue to the women who contributed so much during the Great War of 1914-18.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4669</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Raising Awareness of Alcohol</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the initiative by Aberdeen Joint Alcohol and Drug Action Team to have youngsters aged between 16 and 24 in the north east submit story ideas for a film competition in a bid to raise awareness of alcohol issues; believes that such an initiative is an excellent way to raise awareness of alcohol among young people and put across a peer-driven message; hopes that as many young people as possible will enter the competition and take part in the subsequent film production, and commends Aberdeen Joint Alcohol and Drug Action Team for this innovative approach to educating young people about alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4668</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Sales Promotions of Alcohol</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the effect which the very low prices charged by some supermarkets for alcohol in some of their recent sales promotions are likely to have in increasing the level of alcohol abuse and especially of binge drinking and under-age drinking and believes that the Scottish Executive and licensing boards should encourage supermarkets to end their sales promotions of alcohol and agree with them arrangements to remove the incentive for customers to buy larger quantities of alcohol than their normal consumption because of very low prices.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4667</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Renewables Industry Job Losses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses the gravest concern over the loss of more than 50 skilled jobs in the renewable energy fabrication firm, Camcal, due in part to lack of orders; recognises the skills developed at Camcal&rsquo;s Arnish Yard in Lewis in both the offshore wind and marine renewable sector in building not only the wind turbines for the much-heralded Beatrice platform pilot project but also sections for the world-leading wave machine, Pelamis, and agrees that if the Scottish Executive is serious about tackling climate change, maintaining long-term green jobs and demonstrating its support for the Scottish renewables industry, it must play its part by reducing time delays in issuing planning consents for wind farms and speed up its plan to review support for marine renewables.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4666</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Scottish Homes&rsquo; Failure to Have Roads, Footpaths and Lanes Adopted Prior to Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to mount an investigation into why Scottish Homes transferred housing estates to other housing associations without ensuring that all roads, pavements and car parks were brought up to adoptable standards and transferred to local authority control and furthermore calls on the Executive to instruct Communities Scotland, Scottish Homes&rsquo; successor organisation, to stop washing its hands of this situation and to take action to try to resolve this debacle, which has left many householders faced with the prospect of paying for the upgrade of these roads and pavements.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4665</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>&pound;5 Charge to Park at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns NHS Grampian for introducing a &pound;5 parking charge at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for those parking longer than five hours and believes that this is a revenue-raising ruse which punishes the sick and their families, rather than an attempt to halt abuses by a small minority of individuals who are taking advantage of the facilities.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4664</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Samaritans&rsquo; 24:7 Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 24:7 campaign being held by the Samaritans on 24 July 2006 to raise money for, and awareness of, the life-saving work carried out by the Samaritans; notes that the money raised will help to pay for volunteers to answer calls, training of staff and recruitment of new volunteers; recognises the excellent service that the 951 active volunteers provide in the 20 branches of the Samaritans throughout Scotland; further notes that a series of events will be held throughout the United Kingdom in a bid to link up all Samaritan branches which includes sponsored walks and runs and five-a-side football tournaments; congratulates the Dundee branch for its innovative method of linking up with other Scottish branches as they travel to Perth via an aeroplane, and urges MSPs to publicise this campaign in their constituencies.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4663</strong> <strong>Dave Petrie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Knox Academy, Haddington</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Knox Academy, Haddington, on winning the prestigious Schools Question Time Challenge 2006 award.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong>, Mr Ted Brocklebank<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4662</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Clearwater Forth Oil Spill Contingency Plan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conditional approval of the revised Clearwater Forth oil spill contingency plan by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which will allow ship-to-ship oil transfers to proceed in the Firth of Forth, subject to the consent of Forth Ports plc; is concerned that this decision disregards a consensus from experts, statutory agencies such as Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, wildlife organisations such as the RSPB, and local authorities opposed to ship-to-ship transfers in the Forth; believes that there is a major conflict of interest between the role of Forth Ports plc as a competent authority under the EU Habitats Directive and as a public limited company set to financially benefit from the oil transfer operations in the Forth, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use all relevant powers to ensure that ship-to-ship transfer operations are not given approval if&nbsp;Forth Ports plc cannot show that there will be no impact on the area&rsquo;s birds and marine mammals as a result of the oil transfer operations.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4604.1</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Election of Cuba to UN Human Rights Council</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4604) in the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets that the resolution establishing the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) did not ensure that those participating should first agree to the universal periodic review mechanisms set up to ensure that all countries&rsquo; records are regularly evaluated; further regrets that elected members of the council include representatives of some of the world&rsquo;s least democratic states who have already made it clear that their focus will be on their primary foes, the United States of America and Israel; believes that the UNHRC will be hampered by the same approaches and biases that doomed its predecessor, the UN Commission on Human Rights, when a member state such as Cuba has, since 2003, denied basic human rights to 61 political dissidents, independent journalists and human rights advocates imprisoned in April of that year, and therefore calls on Cuba to invite the UNHRC experts on human rights, torture, independence of the judiciary and arbitrary detention to visit the country so that it may be exposed to the same standards to which it wishes to expose others.&quot;</p>
