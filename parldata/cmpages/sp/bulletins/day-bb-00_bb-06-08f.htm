            <strong>Christine Grahame: Alcohol Misuse</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            that there are estimated to be 200,000 people in Scotland who misuse 
            alcohol; notes that in the past 25 years there has been an increase 
            in the number of deaths for which alcohol is the recorded cause of 
            death of 760% for females and 552% for males; notes further that the 
            figure for the number of children using alcohol is up to 64% in the 
            12 to 15 age group, and urges the Scottish Executive to give a higher 
            profile to this addiction which has substantial costs both financially 
            and otherwise to both the individual, their families and society at 
            large.</font></p>

            and throughout Scotland; acknowledges the sensitivity and kindness 
            of panel members and reporters in handling cases, some of which are

            concerns of test veterans and Sue Rabbit-Roff on her research into 
            the health effects associated with participation in the tests; further 
            notes the actions of those governments which have compensated their 
            nuclear veterans, and invites the Scottish Executive to make representations

            disabilities and special needs in Pollok, Glasgow and Scotland; congratulates 
            the users, carers and providers of Glasgow's internal transport service 
            in building a crucial partnership through the Parallel Transport Liaison 
            Group which is shaping the development of the service and was central 
            in designing the pioneering fleet of buses which are now coming into 
            use; applauds Glasgow City Council for its willingness to listen to 
            and work with those who know best what service needs are and urges 
            the Scottish Executive and the appropriate committees of the Parliament 
            to examine the process developed in Glasgow in order to inform best 
            practice across Scotland, a practice which empowers the users of the 
            service and, as a consequence, ensures that the service puts the users 
            at the centre and delivers real &quot;best value&quot;.</font></p>
