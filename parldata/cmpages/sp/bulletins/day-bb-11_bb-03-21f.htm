<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-8201 John Wilson: Towards a More Equal Scotland?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Poverty in Scotland 2011: Towards a more equal Scotland</em>; recognises that this gives a detailed overview of poverty and anti-poverty policies in Scotland, highlighting the main trends and the effects that poverty has on people; acknowledges that poverty is still a major problem in society, and considers that social and economic justice must remain a priority in these difficult economic times.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8200 Mary Scanlon: Without Frontiers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Without Frontiers exhibition and the display of images from this exhibition that were recently shown at Kiltarlity Village Hall; congratulates the organisers on securing grants for the project from CashBack for Communities and the Heritage Lottery Fund; notes that the project works with Northern Constabulary, Grampian Police and Strathclyde Police and that the exhibition, which has been three years in the making, shows how the natural world connects people and is to be one of the central features of the 2011 science festival in Glasgow; considers that the Without Frontiers programme provides a powerful and effective route through which to raise awareness and understanding of the environment among the general public in an attractive way, combining the arts and science with a connecting link of photography, and giving audiences the opportunity to interface directly with people in the field, and wishes the exhibition every success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-8199 Jamie Hepburn: Congratulations for CashBack for Communities Confidence in Cumbernauld Colts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the announcement from the Scottish Government that that Cumbernauld Colts Football Club has been awarded &pound;400,000 from the CashBack for Communities programme; notes that this funding will help to fund a new full-size 3G pitch and changing and recreational facilities and believes that this will have considerable benefits for the club and the wider community; congratulates the club chairman, Stewart McKenzie, and everyone involved in the club on putting together such a successful bid, and looks forward to Cumbernauld Colts FC going from strength to strength in the future.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-8192 Elaine Smith: Women&rsquo;s Health and Hygiene</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of supporting women&rsquo;s health and wellbeing; is concerned that the purchase of sanitary products is having an increasing financial strain on women earning low incomes and young girls with no personal income; considers that these products are a necessity that are fundamental to the sustainment of good health and hygiene; commends the UNISON Women&rsquo;s Conference 2010, which saw 200 votes in favour of providing free feminine hygiene products for women on low incomes; recognises that a lack of access to suitable sanitary provision can hinder young girls&rsquo; enthusiasm, concentration and general wellbeing in school; considers that schools should ensure that a sanitary product vending machine is readily available in school toilets; considers that access to sanitary products is a developmental issue that has a direct link to a young girl&rsquo;s health, education and general welfare both in Scotland and across the world, and consequently believes that these items should not be considered to be a consumer luxury but should be available at no charge in healthcare facilities.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-8191 Elaine Smith: Hypothyroidism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 17% of women over the age of 60 will experience some form of hypothyroidism; considers that the issue of thyroid disorders is an important gender issue as women are five times more likely to have such a disorder than men; believes that many very ill people with thyroid dysfunction are not being correctly diagnosed by general practitioners; notes that Dr Anthony Toft, a world-renowned and highly respected Scottish endocrinologist, believes that doctors should take a whole-picture approach that takes into consideration all of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and does not rely entirely on test results; believes that this approach is particularly important in patients who have a lack of triiodothyronine as tests can show that their thyroxine levels are satisfactory thus leading to GPs&rsquo; wrongly concluding that a patient&rsquo;s thyroid function is within the normal range; understands that variations in the strength and quality of a drug such as thyroxine can impact negatively on a patient&rsquo;s health thus making it unsuitable for generic prescribing; believes that it is vital that the views of the patient are taken on board in the spirit of partnership in patient care; considers that in many cases it may be more effective to prescribe a combined course of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and calls for more research into the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disorders.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-8178 Ian McKee: Nuclear Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the radioactive leaks from Japan&rsquo;s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant following the recent earthquakes and tsunami that have devastated the region; believes that Fukushima demonstrates that, even in the world&rsquo;s most technologically and scientifically advanced nations, it is impossible to guarantee safety in the running of atomic plants; welcomes the news that, following the Fukushima incident, the Swiss Government has suspended plans to build and replace nuclear plants and that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced a three-month suspension of a law aimed at prolonging the activity of old nuclear plants; further welcomes the emergency meeting that has been called by the EU energy commissioner to discuss the possible application of EU-wide stress tests for the 143 nuclear reactors currently operating in EU territory and to debate the wider issue of nuclear security in Europe; endorses the SNP government&rsquo;s position that Scotland, which it considers to be a world leader in green, clean, reliable renewable energy, does not require nuclear power, and challenges the other political parties in Scotland and across the United Kingdom to unite on the issue by adopting a similar stance.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-8151.1 Jamie Hepburn: Parliament Questions Behaviour of Minister</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-8151) in the name of Helen Eadie, leave out from &quot;that the Minister for Housing and Communities&quot; to end and insert &quot;at what it sees as the use by the Labour Party of misleading, false and inaccurate information about the funding of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust (CRT) and related matters; notes that the Scottish Government has awarded every penny that the CRT requested for its 2011-12 funding, some &pound;1.6 million; considers that the SNP administration has invested an unprecedented sum of nearly &pound;30 million in former mining communities through the Town Centre Regeneration Fund and other funding streams in recent years; deplores the Tony Blair/Gordon Brown-led Labour government&rsquo;s use of court action against the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) in relation to the entitlement of former miners to compensation for various types of lung disease, which it considers resulted in nearly 2,000 Scottish miners dying before they could receive compensation; also deplores what it sees as the silence of Labour politicians on this matter and their presumed acquiescence on this line of action; further notes the dozens of pits that closed while Labour was in government, and calls on Labour MSPs to apologise to the former mining communities for their behaviour in this matter.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-8150 Mary Scanlon: Herbal Medicine Regulation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the UK Secretary of State for Health on 16 February 2011 asking the Health Professions Council to establish a statutory register for practitioners supplying unlicensed herbal medicines; notes that this announcement followed discussions with health departments in the three devolved administrations to establish a unified UK-wide approach to the regulation of these practitioners; considers that the UK Government will have to have further discussions with the Scottish Parliament and the devolved institutions as it prepares draft legislation prior to the proposed implementation of this register in April 2012; welcomes that this proposal aims to ensure that the public can have access to a register of properly trained and qualified herbal practitioners who in turn will have access to all the medicines that the public wish to use, and supports further collaboration between the UK Government and the Scottish Parliament to secure a vibrant and healthy herbal sector that has potential, following regulation, to work alongside conventional medicine to provide good quality healthcare for Scottish people.</p>
