          <p><strong>*S1M-2654</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Local Government 
            Finance (Scotland) Order 2002</strong>-That the Parliament agrees 
            that the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2002 be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2653</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: New Royal Infirmary 
            of Edinburgh</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates all those 
            involved in the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh project, which has 
            now started to treat patients and was completed on time and within 
            budget; notes that this essential development would not have proceeded 
            without the foresight of successive Conservative Secretaries of State 
            for Scotland nor without the use of the innovative PFI scheme, and 
            calls on Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust to retain the historic 
            name of &quot;Simpson&quot; for its maternity unit.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2652</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Digital Audio in 
            Visual Impairment Education (DAVIE)</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Darnley Primary School in the Glasgow Pollok constituency, Glasgow 
            City Council, and the Royal National Institute for the Blind Scotland 
            (RNIB) on their excellent, pioneering and challenging work in supporting 
            young people with visual impairment in mainstream education through 
            the use of the innovative and much-praised RNIB equipment, Digital 
            Audio in Visual Impairment Education (DAVIE); celebrates the work 
            of the staff involved and the benefit experienced by all pupils in 
            Darnley because of this project; notes that RNIB revealed in a recent 
            research report, <em>Shaping the Future,</em> that, while 70% of blind 
            and partially-sighted pupils in Scotland attend their local primary 
            school, almost a quarter of such pupils do not receive the support 
            they require; further notes the support of Scottish Power plc in underpinning 
            the start of the Scottish roll-out of this initiative through the 
            award of a £132,000 grant, following an initial £42,000 grant awarded 
            by the Scottish Executive, to pilot DAVIE in Darnley Primary School, 
            and urges the Executive and the appropriate committees of the Parliament 
            to consider how this crucial work in the integration of, and support 
            for, visually impaired pupils and students in mainstream education 
            might best be supported and developed across Scotland.</p>

            Police Reform Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament agrees 
            that the provisions within the Police Reform Bill which relate to 
            devolved matters, including provisions relating to the terms and conditions 
            of service of constables seconded to the Independent Police Complaints 
            Commission, the inspection of the Ministry of Defence Police in Scotland, 
            the removal of the nationality bar for police officers, extending 
            (pursuant to certain international agreements) the liabilities of 
            chief constables in relation to foreign officials from other member 
            states carrying out investigations in Scotland and extending offence 
            provisions in relation to such foreign officials, should be considered

            to achieve this end in the Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
