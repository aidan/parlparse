            Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) 
            (Orkney) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>-That the Health Committee 
            recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic 
            Shellfish Poisoning) (Orkney) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/221) 
            be approved.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1352</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Palestine</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that stability will not be achieved in the 
            Middle East without a just and durable solution to the situation in 
            Israel and Palestine; notes that, despite countless UN resolutions 
            requiring withdrawal, the West Bank and Gaza continue to be illegally 
            occupied by Israel; firmly believes that most Israelis and Palestinians 
            simply want to live in peace and freedom; asserts that it is not acceptable 
            for Ariel Sharon to dictate to the world which parts of Palestine 
            he is prepared to quit and which parts he wants to incorporate into 
            Israel and to build a 30ft wall dividing Palestinian communities from 
            essential services and facilities; condemns President Bush's backing 
            of the Sharon plan to combine annexation of large parts of the West 
            Bank with withdrawal from Gaza; believes that, by backing the Sharon 
            plan, President Bush is endorsing a flagrant flouting of international 
            law by Israel and is dismissing the right of Palestinian refugees 
            to return to their homeland, overriding an explicit decision of the 
            United Nations; condemns the latest illegal attack by the Israeli 
            Defence Force (IDF) on an unarmed peaceful demonstration in Rafah 
            which resulted in the deaths of 10 and wounded 50 people; welcomes 
            the condemnation of this latest atrocity by the UN Security Council 
            and the call from Kofi Annan for an immediate halt to Israeli military 
            operations in Gaza, and further welcomes the denunciation of the IDF 
            action by Peter Hain MP, Leader of the House of Commons.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1351</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Deplorable 
            Treatment of Campbell Martin MSP</strong>-That the Parliament endorses 
            the statement attributed to Campbell Martin MSP that the Scottish 
            National Party leadership was not fit to run Scotland; considers that 
            he was simply stating the obvious, and therefore deplores the decision 
            to suspend him.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1350</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Communication 
            Impairment</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that communication 
            impairment (Cl) affects every aspect of every waking moment of a person's 
            life and that those affected with Cl are not easily able to speak 
            up about their needs; acknowledges that speech and language therapists 
            have a unique understanding of, and provide a vital service to, those 
            affected by Cl, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support quality 
            social action research to explore the experience of people with Cl, 
            seek solutions to improve that experience and the quality of life 
            for people with Cl and work towards providing a comprehensive and 
            coherent framework for action on Cl in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1349</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Fife's 
            Nursery Nurses</strong>-That the Parliament notes the overwhelming 
            rejection by Fife's nursery nurses of the final pay offer by the Labour-led 
            Fife Council and considers that the council should seek agreement 
            from UNISON to take the claim to ACAS with the objective of reaching 
            an agreement as close to the East Dunbartonshire Council settlement 
            as possible, while allowing Fife's nursery nurses to return to work 
            and continue to deliver educational and developmental opportunities 
            to Fife's three and four-year-olds and prepare them for success in 
            school and life.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop, Tricia Marwick<strong>*</strong>, Ms 
            Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, Rob 
            Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Mrs 
            Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1348#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Public 
            Inquiry for the Davies Family</strong>-That the Parliament believes 
            that there are many unanswered questions in relation to the death 
            of Mrs Annie Davies, 84, who was found dead at the bottom of her stairs 
            with her front door open having sustained terrible injuries; notes 
            that, whilst the police have concluded that her death was a tragic 
            accident, the Procurator Fiscal viewed Annie's death as highly suspicious; 
            further notes that the Davies family have been trying to establish 
            the truth surrounding their mother's death and the subsequent police 
            investigation for over six years and to date have been given no satisfactory 
            explanation; considers that, despite there being named suspects, the 
            police have failed to act, and therefore supports the need for a public 
            inquiry to establish whether there could have been a failure in the 
            criminal justice system and, if so, what the reasons were for such 
            a failure.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1347</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Impingement 
            Syndrome</strong>-That the Parliament believes that those who have 
            impingement syndrome of the shoulder relative to an industrial injury 
            should be entitled to Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit under 
            the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit scheme; recommends that 
            the syndrome should be added to the list of prescribed diseases; notes 
            that the matter was referred to the research working group of the 
            Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, but considers that this may 
            result in a further delay before the syndrome is recognised and that, 
            in the interim period, those individuals who suffer from this syndrome 
            will continue to lack the benefits to which they would have been entitled 
            had they incurred another form of bursitis to the knee (Beat Knee) 
            or elbow (Beat Elbow), and believes that the lack of inclusion of 
            bursitis of the shoulder in the list of prescribed diseases is anomalous 
            and unfair and, as a result, those workers who are denied benefit 
            are suffering from a manifest injustice.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1346</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Stop the Occupation Appeal Concert</strong>-That the Parliament 
            supports the appeal for the music world to organise a global concert 
            for Palestine; notes that this appeal has been launched by Gazzella, 
            an Italian NGO that helps rehabilitate Palestinian children wounded 
            in Israeli ground and air attacks on Palestinian cities and villages, 
            and believes that a large international music concert would help bring 
            the humanitarian crisis to the attention of young people throughout 
            the world, building on the successes of the Concert for Bangladesh 
            in 1972, Live Aid in 1985, Mandela Freedom at 70 Concert in 1988 and 
            the Freedom for Tibet Concert in 1997.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1345</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Regulation 
            of the Security Industry</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Frontline Scotland for highlighting the risks posed by unregulated 
            security firms with links to underworld figures; notes with concern 
            that the services of some of these firms have been retained by major 
            organisations funded from public monies, and believes that it is the 
            duty of the Scottish Executive to introduce legislation on regulating 
            the security industry in order to ensure that this sector does not 
            become the preserve of organised crime.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1344</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Parental 
            Involvement</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the case 
            of the 14-year-old girl in England who had an abortion arranged for 
            her by her school health worker without parental notification or consent; 
            acknowledges, while recognising the current role of health workers 
            and teachers in sexual health education, the pre-eminent role of parents, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that no such practices 
            will be allowed to occur in Scotland as part of the sexual health 
            strategy.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Michael McMahon, Murdo Fraser, Mrs 
            Nanette Milne, Mr David Davidson, Mr Andrew Welsh, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, 
            Mary Scanlon, Mr Brian Monteith</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1343</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Israel 
            and War Crimes</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continued illegal 
            occupation of Palestinian territories by the Israeli Army and the 
            indiscriminate killing of men, women and children within the occupied 
            territories and the deliberate destruction of over 3,000 Palestinian 
            homes over the last three-and-a-half years; condemns the most recent 
            killings of 19 Palestinians by the Israeli army, including 15-year-old 
            Asmaa al Mughayer and her 13-year-old brother Ahmed who were shot 
            through the head by Israeli Army snipers while on the roof of their 
            home; believes, given the indiscriminate killings and deliberate demolition 
            of so many Palestinians' homes, that the Israeli Government, and Prime 
            Minister, Ariel Sharon in particular, are guilty of war crimes through 
            breach of Article 53 of the Geneva Convention, which states that &quot;Any 
            destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging 
            individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, 
            or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, 
            is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely 
            necessary by military operations&quot;; believes that Israel's actions 
            are not justified military operations and therefore condemns its actions 
            as unacceptable war crimes; agrees to communicate its disgust over 
            the Israeli Government's actions to the British Prime Minister and 
            directly to the Israeli embassy, and further agrees to investigate 
            a Scottish parliamentary boycott of Israeli goods in protest at their 
            actions.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1342</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Dietary 
            Needs of Infants in Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre</strong>-That 
            the Parliament is concerned about the health and well-being of two-year-old 
            Eric Nakimbugwe who was recently removed from Dungavel House Immigration 
            Removal Centre with his mother, Deborah, where, due to inadequate 
            provision of food suitable for the dietary needs of infants, the child 
            has lost weight which is causing his mother great concern; demands, 
            furthermore, that Her Majesty's Government hands over powers to the 
            Parliament in order to allow it to take action in relation to this 
            and other child protection issues that are outside its powers, and 
            recognises that the children of detainees in Dungavel should be allotted 
            the same levels of protection and care as any other children in Scotland.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan, Frances Curran, Carolyn Leckie</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1339</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Firefighters' 
            Dispute</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the breakdown of the 
            national June 2003 agreement reached by fire service employers and 
            the Fire Brigades Union, which brought the 2002-03 national dispute 
            to an end; hopes that both parties remain within the parameters of 
            the June 2003 agreement in order for the agreement to be progressed 
            and completed; hopes that the fire service employers recognise the 
            efforts of firefighters and emergency fire control operators in the 
            modernisation process and consequently pay firefighters and emergency 
            fire control operators their promised pay increases, and hopes that, 
            by the Fire Brigades Union's reconvened annual conference in Southport 
            in June, agreement can be reached between the fire service employers 
            and the Fire Brigades Union that allows this long-running dispute 
            to be drawn to a satisfactory conclusion, sees the process of true 
            improvements in the fire service continuing and ensures that firefighters 
            and emergency fire control operators are rewarded to a level that 
            fully recognises the many skills they have acquired.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1338</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Quagmire 
            in Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament notes the assassination of Izzedine 
            Salim, head of the United States-appointed Governing Council of Iraq; 
            believes that US, British and coalition troops are fighting an unwinnable 
            war in Iraq, and further believes that, with reports indicating a 
            further commitment of British troops including Scottish regiments, 
            an opportunity must be given for it to debate the current international 
            situation in relation to Iraq and reports of human rights abuses committed 
            by coalition troops.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1337</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            of Royal Mail Sorting Office in Broxburn</strong>-That the Parliament 
            regrets the decision by Royal Mail to close its Broxburn sorting office; 
            believes that this decision is driven by pressures of privatisation 
            and will inevitably lead to a poorer mail delivery service for people 
            in the Broxburn area; notes the strike action taken by staff in Broxburn, 
            and applauds their efforts to persuade Royal Mail to maintain a local 
            sorting office in that area.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1336</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Eurovision 
            Song Contest</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned to note the 
            successive failures of the British Eurovision song contest entry in 
            recent years; believes that voting across Europe is related to the 
            views of European people on Her Majesty's Government's role in the 
            war on Iraq and on other issues, and further believes that a UK entry 
            is unlikely to succeed as long as Her Majesty's Government continues 
            with current foreign policy, that a Scottish entry is less likely 
            to be tainted and that Scotland should be entitled to a separate Eurovision 
            song contest entry.</P>

            Sign Language (BSL) is used by around 2 million people within the 
            United Kingdom; notes that it has not, to date, been recognised as 
            a minority language by the Council of Europe's European Charter for 
            Regional and Minority Languages, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should make representations to Her Majesty's Government and European 
            Union in support of the recognition of BSL.</P>

            to the people of Glasgow in respect of maintaining casualty facilities 
            at Stobhill Hospital for five years and calls on the Minister for 
            Health and Community Care to refuse permission to NHS Greater Glasgow 
            to close the casualty department at Stobhill Hospital or risk breaking 
            a pledge in relation to the previous commitment in connection with

          <p><strong>S2M-1330</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>64th 
            Anniversary of the 51st Highland Division's Rearguard Action at St 
            Valery</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the sacrifice made 
            by the 51st<SUP> </SUP>Highland Division in June 1940 as they assisted 
            the French Army in making a stand against the German invasion, relieving 
            the pressure on the Channel ports, action which ultimately lead to 
            the capture of the division at St Val&eacute;ry-en-Caux; further recognises 
            that this action by the 51st Highland Division helped win time for 
            the Royal Navy to evacuate over 300,000 British and French soldiers 
            from Dunkirk; notes that, without the evacuation from Dunkirk, Britain 
            and her allies might well not have been able to regroup and reorganise 
            and ultimately return to French soil in 1944; recognises how different 
            Britain, and indeed Europe, might have been today without this vital 
            contribution, and invites the First Minister, when he takes part on 
            behalf of the Scottish people in commemorative activities to mark 
            the 60th anniversary of D-Day, to also pay tribute to the 51st Highland 
            Division's contribution to the evacuation from Dunkirk and then ultimately 
            to the success of D-Day.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1329#</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Affordable 
            Housing in North-east Fife</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the shortage of affordable housing for rent or sale in many 
            communities in north-east Fife; recognises that this is due to many 
            factors including the decline in the amount of public sector rented 
            accommodation, the popularity of many communities as retirement and 
            holiday locations and, in the case of St Andrews, the accommodation 
            needs of the growing student population; expresses its concern about 
            the difficulties faced by many people in trying to obtain affordable 
            accommodation in their own communities and the pressures on rural 
            services such as schools, and considers that Fife Council, Communities 
            Scotland and the Scottish Executive should develop an effective housing 
            plan for north-east Fife that addresses these concerns to ensure viable, 
            vibrant and sustainable communities throughout north-east Fife.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1328</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Abolition 
            of Prescription Charges</strong>-That the Parliament notes a recent 
            Teletext poll that asked for opinions on whether prescription charges 
            should be abolished in Scotland where 89% said &quot;yes&quot; and 
            11% said &quot;no&quot; and believes that the Scottish Executive should 
            follow the example of the National Assembly for Wales and abolish 
            this additional tax on ill-health.</P>

            the proposed transfer by Heriot-Watt University of the textile design 
            course from the Netherdale Campus to the Riccarton Campus; notes that 
            this proposed closure will affect mostly female students who make 
            up 80% of the course intake; congratulates the students of the Netherdale 
            Campus on their decision to hold a referendum on the proposed transfer, 
            and calls on the Vice-Principal, Professor John Simmons, and the Heriot-Watt

            of 20% in takings; further notes that visitor numbers were up with 
            a larger than normal number of townspeople attending; recognises the 
            role that shows such as this play in the rural life of Scotland, and

            at Maryhill; praises the expertise and hard work of all organisations 
            and individuals, including the NHS, in providing rescue services to 
            all involved in the Maryhill explosion; appreciates all offers of 
            expert help from outwith Scotland; is especially proud of hospitals, 
            such as Stobhill, that not only treated the walking wounded from the 
            explosion site but also took on board all medical and surgical emergencies 
            scheduled for Glasgow Royal Infirmary, thus allowing the hospital 
            to manage the acute cases from Maryhill; commends those who counselled 
            the bereaved relatives and friends, and acknowledges the impact of 
            such a tragedy on all involved, accepting the need to provide long-term

          <p><strong>S2M-1321#</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Bearsden 
            Post Office Closures</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the announcement 
            by Post Office Ltd of its proposal to close three post offices in 
            the Bearsden area, in addition to the closure of the post office at 
            Killermont; considers that consultation time was not sufficient, given 
            that the Easter holiday break was within the period set for consultation; 
            acknowledges that the most vulnerable people in society will be affected 
            since the majority affected are elderly, few drive and there is a 
            paucity of public transport and guaranteed parking and therefore the 
            suggested alternative post office at Roman Road is not suitable as 
            it would require considerable adaptation to meet the needs of elderly 
            people; deplores the fact that communities surrounding the post offices 
            proposed for closure will be bereft of vital services, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should exert pressure on Post Office Ltd 
            to reconsider these closures, which are detrimental to the well-being 
            of an increasingly aging population.</P>
