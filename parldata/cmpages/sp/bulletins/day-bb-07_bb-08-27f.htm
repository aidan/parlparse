          <p><strong>*S3M-387</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Proposed Closure of Schools in the Western Isles</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with serious concern the planned consultation on the proposed closure of four primary and seven junior secondary schools in the Western Isles Council area; believes that their closure would lead to the ending of secondary education in rural communities and involve some children as young as 11 making 60-mile return trips to school every day; recognises the local council&rsquo;s need to ensure that its education provision is on a sound financial footing but notes the very strong feeling in communities across the islands that schools should be closed only if there are educational grounds, and asks the council and the Scottish Government to work together to ensure that the curriculum for excellence can be delivered within the existing format of the islands&rsquo; education system.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-386</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Scotland to Norway Ferry Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposed new Scotland to Norway ferry service; welcomes the addition of Lerwick as a possible mid-point in the crossing; notes the potential for increased freight traffic through the port of Rosyth for the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe and the subsequent consolidation of the existing Rosyth to Zeebrugge service; recognises the economic benefits of the proposal and the increased tourism that the new route would bring to Shetland, Rosyth and south-east Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with SESTRAN and other bodies to secure the route for Rosyth.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-385</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Media Literacy Education in the Curriculum for Excellence</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the absence of media literacy education in proposals for the curriculum for excellence and is concerned that Scottish education is neglecting the education of pupils in understanding how the media produce messages and meaning, that pupils will not be enabled to develop the critical and creative skills necessary for informed and active citizenship and that Scottish education is missing the chance to produce a workforce, skilled in digital communication media, which can face the challenges of a globalised information economy, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that media literacy education is given a place in the new curriculum.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-384</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Disability Sport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of sportscotland to announce new funding of &pound;250,750 for Scottish Disability Sport; expresses concern in relation to the level of funding in the context of preparations for the 2012 Paralympic Games and the five disability sports on Glasgow&rsquo;s provisional 2014 Commonwealth Games programme, and seeks assurances from the Scottish Executive that it will consider how best to provide adequate funding for disability sport.</p>
