          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-4046</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Scottish Agricultural 
            College Restructuring</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            decision of the board of the Scottish Agricultural College to restructure 
            the colleges at Edinburgh as recommended in the Deloitte &amp; Touche 
            survey; regrets that this decision ignores the social impact of the 
            recommendations on the south west and north east of Scotland and runs 
            contrary to the Scottish Executive&#146;s policy of dispersing agency 
            and department jobs and offices outwith the central belt; considers 
            that the basis for some of the evidence, such as the student survey, 
            is questionable as is the weighting system which was devised by the 
            board itself, and calls for a further study into the potential of 
            the Auchincruive campus as the sole location of the colleges&#146; 
            educational and advisory services in its future structure.</p>
          <p>Supported by: David Mundell<strong>*</strong>, John Scott<strong>*</strong>, 
            Phil Gallie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-4046.1</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Scottish Agricultural 
            College Restructuring</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-4046) 
            in the name of Alex Fergusson, leave out from &quot;potential&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;Scottish Agricultural College&#146;s educational 
            and advisory services.&quot; </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4045</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: United Kingdom 
            Social Enterprise of the Year</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            that McSence of Midlothian, the biggest social enterprise in Scotland, 
            has won the title of United Kingdom Social Enterprise of the Year; 
            congratulates McSence on winning this prestigious <em>New Statesman</em> 
            award; further notes that the community business was started up following 
            the closure of the Bilston Glen and Monktonhall coal mines, and welcomes 
            the fact that it now turns over £1.5 million per annum, with £250,000 
            of the profits being ploughed back into projects for the unemployed, 
            children, elderly people and the local community.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4044</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Scottish Agricultural 
            College</strong>&#151;That the Parliament views with concern the plans 
            by the Scottish Agricultural College Board to move the college&#146;s 
            teaching and research services from Auchincruive, Ayrshire, and Craibstone, 
            Aberdeenshire, to Edinburgh and calls for a full economic impact assessment 
            that takes into account the effect that this move will have on students, 
            staff and local communities before the proposal is approved by the 
            Scottish Executive.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4041</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Comments by SNP 
            Councillor on Firefighters</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns 
            the comments of SNP councillor and Convener of the Tayside Joint Fire 
            Board, Frances Duncan, who labelled firefighters who take part in 
            democratic strike action on 20 March 2003 as "irresponsible"; condemns 
            her specific comments in the <em>Dundee Evening Telegraph</em> of 
            18 March 2003 that "I feel it would be rather irresponsible for FBU 
            General Secretary Andy Gilchrist to encourage his members to strike 
            during a time of imminent war"; believes these comments to be wholly 
            inappropriate, especially in the light of the disgusting attacks on 
            firefighters made by Tory MP Bernard Jenkin to the effect that firefighters 
            were the "friends of Saddam", and upholds the democratic right of 
            trade unionists to engage in legitimate industrial action, including 
            the withdrawal of their labour, regardless of any central government 
            action in an illegal war with Iraq.</p>

            Armed Forces</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-4031) in 
            the name of Ben Wallace, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end 
            and insert &quot;sympathises with the men and women of Her Majesty&#146;s 
            armed services who are being placed in an unacceptably difficult position 
            by being ordered to participate in an unjust, immoral and illegal 
            bombardment and invasion of Iraq which will, according to World Health 
            Organisation estimates, result in civilian casualties ranging from 
            100,000 to 500,000 and create in excess of two million refugees and 
            therefore believes that the best way to support Scottish troops and 
            other UK armed service personnel is to bring them home immediately.&quot;</p>
