<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3858</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant:</strong> <strong>Sheep Electronic Identification</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the outcome of the Council of Ministers&rsquo; negotiations on sheep electronic identification; acknowledges that HM Government and the Scottish Government worked hard to find an alternative; further acknowledges the work undertaken at European level by the National Farmers Union of Scotland; is disappointed that this alternative was not achieved, while recognising that the EU Commissioner for Health has offered a degree of flexibility regarding the implementation; notes that the United Kingdom has launched a consultation on the implementation, and urges the Scottish Government to consult farmers and crofters in Scotland in order to find ways to implement the legislation that causes the least harm to the industry.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3857</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Defend Afghan Women&rsquo;s Human Rights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern at news reports that President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan has recently signed into law a Shia family law bill that is believed to deny the most basic human rights to Afghan women, including the right to refuse sex within marriage, to leave their homes without permission from a husband or father or to seek custody of their children following divorce; recalls that the denial of human rights to Afghan women by the Taliban was cited as a justification for the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001; believes that those countries involved in military action in Afghanistan then and since have a duty to protect Afghan women&rsquo;s rights; calls on the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office to establish urgently exactly what provisions are contained in the Shia family law and to place diplomatic pressure on President Karzai to repeal all legislation that violates the human rights of women and children, and urges the UK Government to condemn in the strongest possible terms these latest attacks on the basic humanity of Afghan women and to exhort its international partners to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3856</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Central Mosque Terrorist Threat</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns any threat to personal liberty or a person&rsquo;s place of worship; recognises that it is a duty of the free press and media in Scotland to be even-handed when reporting issues of terrorism and threats; expresses disappointment that recent threats to Glasgow Central Mosque and threats to behead one Muslim a week have been under-reported, and calls for the media to ensure that abhorrent acts of terrorism are covered regardless of the perpetrators.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3855</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Remembering the Real G20</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the leaders of the G20 group of countries meeting in London to remember, in their deliberations about the global economy, the people of the G20 postcode area in Glasgow and other ordinary communities hard-hit by the recession in Scotland and around the world; notes that, while the G20 leaders will be staying in plush embassies and hotels, 29% of people in Glasgow&rsquo;s G20 are classified as income deprived by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, and believes that Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s plans to close schools in the G20 area and beyond can only further damage such hard-pressed communities.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3854</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>European Year of Volunteering</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement that the European Commission has started work to prepare for the European Year of Volunteering 2011; notes that over 100 million European citizens contribute to society as volunteers; further notes that the Volunteer Centre Network Scotland estimates that nearly half of all people in Scotland volunteer over the course of a year and that the Scottish Household Survey calculates that around eight million hours are volunteered in Scotland each month; agrees that volunteering can bring people together in areas such as sport, environmental work and charity; acknowledges the hard work and dedication of those who freely give up their time to contribute to society, and therefore encourages the Scottish Government to work alongside the UK Government to make 2011 a year when we can thank all of Scotland&rsquo;s volunteers for their work in local communities across the country.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3853</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Campsie Black Watch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the achievement of the Campsie Black Watch under-21 football team, based in Lennoxtown in East Dunbartonshire, on reaching its 13th Scottish Cup final; notes that, since being formed in 1943, Campsie Black Watch under-21s have won over 30 league titles and the Scottish Cup a record nine times, and also notes the dedication and hard work of the coaching staff, players and the manager, Gerry Marley, on taking his side to another Scottish Cup final.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3852</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>House of Commons Business and Enterprise Committee Report on Part-privatisation of the Royal Mail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the report of the House of Commons Business and Enterprise Committee that concludes that the UK Government has not properly made the case for its planned part-privatisation of the Royal Mail and that &quot;it is entirely unacceptable for Parliament to be asked to approve such fundamental changes to Royal Mail Group when there is no indication of how much money Royal Mail Group needs for investment while the Government appears to have no business plan and has not indicated the use to which any private sector capital would be put&quot;; believes this to be convincing evidence, if more were needed, that the UK Government&rsquo;s plans in this area are simply wrong, and calls on the UK Government immediately to halt its plans for the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3850</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Impact of Disclosure Policy on Services for Vulnerable People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes recent changes to Disclosure Scotland&rsquo;s interpretation of the regulations that limit access to enhanced disclosure checks for charity and voluntary organisation staff and volunteers working with vulnerable groups; notes that a number of different charities, including MND Scotland, Befriending Network Scotland and Clydesdale Befriending Group, have raised concerns that their ability to provide services to vulnerable groups may be affected as a result of these changes; calls on Disclosure Scotland to clarify the reasons for the change and to assess the practical impact on the ability of charities and voluntary organisations to deliver services; welcomes the work being done by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) to resolve this situation, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with SCVO and other relevant voluntary sector organisations to reduce the risk that any services and support for vulnerable people in Scotland might be lost.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3849.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3849) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from &quot;it builds&quot; to end and insert &quot;the success of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 has not been universal; agrees that antisocial behaviour blights the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and should not be tolerated but believes that prevention is better than cure when it comes to protecting communities from disorder and encourages communities to report all incidents of crime and disorder so that they can be properly addressed, and appreciates the wealth of good practice followed in some areas of Scotland and the importance of replicating it as widely as possible.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3849.2</strong> <strong>Paul Martin:</strong> <strong>Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3849) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that too many communities in Scotland are still blighted by antisocial behaviour and recognises that the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 was a response to these concerns; further believes that there should not be reduced use of legal remedies, which have been effective in providing individuals and communities with relief from the selfish activities of a minority; recognises that while the Antisocial Behaviour Framework is right to highlight good practice and preventative measures, such initiatives must be properly resourced; acknowledges that, while only a small minority of young people engage in antisocial behaviour, parental responsibility is crucial in addressing this problem, and believes in widening access to legal remedies for communities that wish to tackle problems of antisocial behaviour in their areas.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3849.3</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3849) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;; welcomes the framework&rsquo;s emphasis on addressing the causes of antisocial behaviour, such as drug and alcohol addiction and deprivation, and on improving life chances; supports the promotion of the new prevention, early intervention, enforcement and rehabilitation (PIER) model, including the use of acceptable behaviour contracts pioneered by Liberal Democrats in Islington, and regards increased community involvement and empowerment as vital components of success in action to tackle antisocial behaviour.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3848.1</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Hospital Waiting Times</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3848) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;staff&quot; to end and insert &quot;and independent sector staff who have contributed to delivering these significant improvements for the people of Scotland; notes the progress made by the previous administration; acknowledges the substantial investment being made to increase NHSScotland capacity and the continuing work on integrating, modernising and redesigning services to speed access, diagnosis and treatment, but cautions that, while shorter waiting times are welcome, patient care and health outcomes should not be jeopardised by attempts to meet centrally determined targets.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3848.2</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Hospital Waiting Times</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3848) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;but believes that the achievement of maximum waiting times should ultimately be at the discretion of clinicians to protect those with the greatest clinical need.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3848.3</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Hospital Waiting Times</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3848) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;while welcoming the extension of the waiting times guarantee to include child and adolescent mental health services<font color="#0000ff">,</font> calls on the Scottish Government to consider extending the range of specialties to include adult mental health services; further calls on the Scottish Government to ensure sufficient resources to bring NHSScotland in line as soon as possible with the NHS in England where a &quot;whole journey&quot; national waiting time standard of 18 weeks was delivered by December 2008, and notes that this compares to a target of 18 months introduced by the previous Conservative administration.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3825 *#*</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Polish Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Polish Cultural Festival that will take place from 20 to 26 April 2009 in Edinburgh; notes that this week-long celebration aims to present the best of Polish culture in Scotland and is a chance to show Edinburgh residents a culture that is a vibrant part of today&rsquo;s Scotland; applauds the commitment of the hard-working team of volunteers from the Polish community who put together the varied programme of events, which ranges from traditional music and dance to film and visual arts; notes that the festival website and full programme details can be found at www.polishculturalfestival.org.uk, and wishes the organisers every success in their aim to bring Edinburgh&rsquo;s diverse cultural communities together.</p>
