<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1325</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Averting Humanitarian Disaster in Afghanistan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Oxfam&rsquo;s report of January 2008, <em>Afghanistan: Development and Humanitarian Priorities</em>, outlining the need for urgent action to address immediate challenges in Afghanistan and to avert humanitarian disaster, and particularly notes the recommendations, with respect to narcotics, that the Afghan government and donors should support a long-term, multi-sectoral approach which above all seeks to achieve sustainable rural development and, with regard to peace-building, that it be approached in a way that is participatory and bottom-up, that strengthens community capacities to resolve disputes and conflicts, developing trust and social cohesion within and between communities, and that promotes inter-ethnic and inter-group dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1324&diams; </strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>2008: Women and the Vote</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that&nbsp;6 February&nbsp;2008 is the 90th&nbsp;anniversary of women winning the right to vote and be elected to&nbsp;parliament under the 1918 Representation of the People Act; further notes that this year is also the 80th anniversary of women being granted equal voting rights; believes that much still remains to be done to achieve full equality for women, and therefore welcomes the formation of 2008: Women and the Vote, bringing together&nbsp;organisations to celebrate, assess the current situation, and ask all political parties and central and local government to put this issue at the top of their political agendas.</p>
<p>Supported by: Patricia Ferguson<strong>*</strong>, Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1323</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Increasing Access to Insulin Pumps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the considerable benefits that insulin pumps have for diabetics to help them to manage their condition; notes with concern the current restrictive criteria for eligibility for use of insulin pumps which have contributed to insulin pump usage in Scotland being among the lowest in Western Europe, with only around 0.75% of people with Type 1 diabetes using pumps in Scotland compared with 15 to 20% in the United States of America and Germany; is concerned at the extreme regional disparity in uptake of insulin pumps across NHS boards, with only two patients receiving insulin pump therapy in NHS Ayrshire and Arran compared with 42 in NHS Tayside in the most recent figures, despite all NHS boards having received funding for access to insulin pumps; supports the campaign of Diabetes UK to increase access to insulin pumps and welcomes the review being undertaken currently by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the eligibility for use of pumps in the NHS, and calls for immediate action to be taken by the Scottish Government to ensure that new NICE guidance that seeks to relax access criteria is adopted swiftly in Scotland, to support all NHS boards to increase access to insulin pumps for patients with diabetes and to enable more training for health practitioners to support patients in moving to the use of pumps where it is clearly of benefit in the management of their diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1322</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Save Stirling University Post Office</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposed closure of the post office at the University of Stirling; recognises that the branch provides a vital service to students, staff and other users; further notes that the particular needs of international students and disabled users are satisfied uniquely by the on-campus post office; supports wholeheartedly the campaign by the university, Stirling University Students&rsquo; Association, Stirling Council and Bridge of Allan Community Council to retain this branch, and urges all interested individuals to respond personally to the ongoing consultation regarding the future of this post office.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1321</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Cyber-Impersonation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with particular concern the increasing level of cyber-impersonation taking place through social networking websites; further notes the occurrence of false profiles increasing steeply, often with the purpose of bullying or undermining the individual being targeted; calls for greater continuity in the implementation and enforcement of copyright laws and user agreements, so as to ensure the greatest level of security for legitimate social network users, and finally urges internet service providers and administrators to practise a more rigorous vetting procedure to verify the true identity of individuals applying to their service.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1320</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Wilson Doctrine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Wilson Doctrine, developed in the late 1960s, banned the tapping of MPs&rsquo; and peers&rsquo; telephones; further notes that in 2006, following representations to have the doctrine revoked, the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, rejected revocation after a backbench rebellion and that this remains the position to this day; notes with concern that the Wilson Doctrine does not apply to MSPs, and considers that duly elected members of the Scottish Parliament should be offered the same protection from intrusion as applies to duly elected members of the Westminster government in the interests of performing their public duty free from covert surveillance and in the interests of democracy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1319</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Inverclyde Council Funding for Voluntary Groups</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with dismay Inverclyde Council&rsquo;s refusal to release further funding to voluntary organisations such as the Federation of Community Learning Centres in Inverclyde; further notes that this has resulted in redundancy notices being issued to valued members of staff and will have a detrimental effect on services provided to the most vulnerable in our society, and calls on the Labour-controlled Inverclyde Council to release funding from the &pound;928,000 underspend from its General Fund Revenue Budget to safeguard jobs and enhance the quality of life of the most vulnerable in society.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1318</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>American Super Bowl</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Greenock-born Lawrence Tynes, kicker for the New York Giants, who made history by being the first Scottish-born player to win America&rsquo;s National Football League Super Bowl and notes that Lawrence contributed with a 32-yard field goal and converted two touchdowns as his team triumphed 17-14 against the New England Patriots.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1316</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Congratulating Scottish Science</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of the recently published <em>Metrics for the Scottish Research Base</em> report commissioned by the Scottish Government; notes that outcomes, in terms of research recognition, citations, training and research quality, are excellent at 2% of world highly-cited papers, 1% of world citations and 0.8% of publications; notes that Scottish scientists perform well in a variety of fields and are first in the world in terms of impact, in health and related sciences, and first in the world in terms of citations per GDP; further notes that, for the Scottish research base as a whole, the average impact has increased progressively over the last 10 years, placing Scotland second in the world behind only Switzerland, and congratulates Scottish-based scientists for the quality of their research.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1316.1</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Congratulating Scottish Science</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1316) in the name of Bill Wilson, leave out from &quot;placing&quot; to end and insert &quot;under a Labour government at Westminster and the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition in Scotland; expresses concern that underfunding of universities by the SNP government poses a serious threat to the continued success of Scotland&rsquo;s research scientists who were recently placed second in the world behind only Switzerland; recognises that the constitutional changes proposed by the SNP represent an even more serious threat to research excellence, which is why the overwhelming majority of Scotland&rsquo;s scientists and scientific bodies want research in Scotland to remain part of the UK research funding framework within which Scottish-based scientists have been outstandingly successful, and congratulates our scientists for the quality of their research.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1315.1</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Commercial Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1315) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end &quot;welcomes the firming up of the 25% target for forest coverage, planted in ways and using techniques which will contribute to carbon capture; further welcomes the fact that the majority of this additional planting is likely to be established through grant aid to the private sector, and supports efforts to increase the biodiversity value of all forestry in receipt of public funds, in particular new schemes which enhance habitats for key native species such as the capercaillie and the Scottish crossbill.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1315.2</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Commercial Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1315) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end &quot;and further notes the significant role that Scotland&rsquo;s woodland plays in the mitigation of climate change and the conservation of biodiversity.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Karen Gillon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1315.3</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Commercial Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1315) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end &quot;further recognises the role that forestry can play in helping to meet Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets through biomass generation; welcomes the work of the previous administration on promoting the biomass sector through the highly successful Biomass Support Scheme, and calls on the Scottish Government to maximise the opportunities for growth, jobs and sustainability offered by the expansion of the biomass sector in Scotland by delivering the previous administration&rsquo;s Biomass Action Plan.&quot;</p>
