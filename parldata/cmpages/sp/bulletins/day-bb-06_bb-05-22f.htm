<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4426</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>The Draft Student Fees (Specification) (Scotland) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Enterprise and Culture Committee recommends that the draft Student Fees (Specification) (Scotland) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4425</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>The Draft Electronic Communications (Scotland) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that the draft Electronic Communications (Scotland) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4424</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>The Draft Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Treatment of Public Transport Users&rsquo; Committee for Scotland as Specified Authority and Amendment of Specified Authorities) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that the draft Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Treatment of Public Transport Users&rsquo; Committee for Scotland as Specified Authority and Amendment of Specified Authorities) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4423#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Scottish Maritime Museum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of maintaining and promoting Scotland&rsquo;s maritime heritage; commends the work of the Scottish Maritime Museum in furthering this aim; notes that the Scottish Maritime Museum has premises in Irvine, Dumbarton and Braehead; recognises that the museum at Irvine Harbourside is currently home to the puffer Spartan, HMS Carrick, and the fishing boat Antares; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to the museum and, in particular, notes that the Executive has provided additional grant funding to allow the Irvine museum to maintain the collection for the last three financial years; notes that the Irvine museum, incorporating the Puffer coffee shop, attracted 25,248 visitors in 2005 and in the same year 701 educational group visits took place; commends the museum for its work in involving the local community of Irvine through organising events for North Ayrshire residents, such as the recent &quot;Show Scotland&quot; event which allowed 807 local people to visit the museum free of charge and the recently launched Fablevision project, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, which brings together disadvantaged young people from Irvine to research and document the history of the puffer Spartan, culminating in the production of a short film; notes that the museum has also been very active in providing opportunities for long-term unemployed people and that the museum currently has six unemployed New Deal placements; regrets that long-term funding for the museum has yet to be secured, thereby preventing the museum from accessing lottery and other funding opportunities; agrees that the Scottish Maritime Museum at Irvine makes a valuable contribution to Scotland&rsquo;s cultural heritage and to the North Ayrshire economy, and considers that long-term funding should be offered to secure its future.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4419#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Leisure Facilities in Penicuik</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed closure of Ladywood Leisure Centre, Queensway Leisure Centre and the Jackson Street Centre and the threat to Penicuik Town Hall, all valuable resources for Penicuik&rsquo;s people; notes that the consultation by Midlothian Council was initiated after the decision to make the closures and is only directed at the transition of provision to the Penicuik High School development; considers that, while the facilities being provided adjacent to Penicuik High School are to be welcomed, these will not meet the requirement for those facilities which are to be closed nor will have the capacity to accommodate all activities; further considers that these closures will impact on the community&rsquo;s health and well-being, will remove the provision of services to the young in keeping them off the streets and to mothers and elderly people in providing a point of social contact, and considers that the Scottish government should enter into discussions with local community groups, including the community council, to assist in identifying options to ensure that these facilities remain open.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4416</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Carbon Trading - Emission Impossible</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of ARREST, an EU-25 wide campaign calling for &quot;A Real Review of EmissionS Trading&quot;; believes that the European Union&rsquo;s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), though well-meaning, is fundamentally flawed and unlikely to be effective in tackling climate change in an efficient, effective and equitable manner; strongly feels that ownership of greenhouse gas emission permits should be allocated to all adults on an equal per capita basis, not to existing large polluters free of charge under a grandfathering arrangement as is presently the case with the EU ETS; notes that a chronic oversupply of permits in the European market led to a collapse in the value of carbon from 29 euros per tonne in late April 2006 to a value in mid-May of less than nine euros per tonne; considers that such an oversupply is symptomatic of the total inability of the scheme to effectively address European carbon emissions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the European Commission calling for a thorough review and a dramatic overhaul of EU ETS.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4415</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Literacy in Angus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Angus Council&rsquo;s Education Department on the upcoming literacy conference, &quot;Language for Learning - Literacy in a Curriculum for Excellence: A Conference to Launch the Angus Literacy Strategy&quot;, to be held in Carnoustie on 23 May 2006; is aware of the fact that in Angus there has been an increase in English language attainment in the last five years while the Scottish average for attainment in writing has declined in the same period, and hopes that the lessons learned in Angus from the many initiatives taken by Angus Council with regard to education will be useful in tackling the literacy problems throughout Scotland based on the Scottish tradition that education, and the right to education, is the key to progress.</p>
