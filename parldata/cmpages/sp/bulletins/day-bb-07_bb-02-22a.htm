<p align="center"><strong>Section A &ndash; Today&rsquo;s Business</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Road Tolling&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5598</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Road Tolling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament opposes the introduction of any additional nationwide charges for using Scotland&rsquo;s existing roads and calls for the repeal of Part 3 of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001. </p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5598.2</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Road Tolling</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5598) in the name of Mr David Davidson, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s massive increase in funding for public transport since 1999; notes the growing problem of traffic congestion in Scotland and the impact this has on the economy and the impact of pollution on health and the environment; notes the lack of an alternative from the opposition parties to tackling congestion; notes that the Executive does not support penalising motorists, and believes that the potential benefits of all new measures to tackle congestion, such as road user charging, need to fully assessed, tested and evaluated in order to keep Scotland moving.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5598.1</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Road Tolling</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5598) in the name of Mr David Davidson, insert at end, &quot;believes further that full fiscal powers should be transferred to the Scottish Parliament in respect of taxation of motorists; notes that levels of taxation levied on motorists by successive Labour and Conservative governments have consistently been, or been among, the highest in Europe; considers that a variety of measures is needed to tackle levels of congestion, including more use of park and ride schemes as well as the use of flexible working and home working, and supports the further expansion of public transport in Scotland to provide people in Scotland with more alternatives to car use.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5598.3</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard: Road Tolling</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5598) in the name of Mr David Davidson, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that traffic congestion creates a huge burden for society in terms of delays, ill-health and social exclusion; notes that &quot;the CBI estimates that the costs to employers of transport congestion are around &pound;20 billion a year&quot;; recognises that any long-term strategy to reduce congestion and climate changing pollution will require the provision of quality public transport alternatives to car use together with a sensible and appropriate system of demand management; notes the failure of the Scottish Executive to provide leadership over the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s proposal for a congestion charging scheme and the Executive&rsquo;s plans for massive investment in new road capacity; notes that new road capacity has been shown to generate more traffic; notes that studies indicate that the introduction of nationwide road pricing is at least 10 years away; therefore calls on ministers to work with regional transport partnerships to consider the introduction of congestion charging and smart charge schemes at specific pinch points and congested areas of the road network, and believes that, in the immediate term, the Executive must reallocate funding for new road schemes to invest in public transport and cancel plans for new trunk roads that will generate increased traffic such as the M74 extension and the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Double Jeopardy&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-5613</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>Double Jeopardy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the criminal law of Scotland be changed so that persons acquitted of serious criminal charges can be tried again if new and compelling evidence comes to light. </p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5613.1</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Double Jeopardy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5613) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the issue of the double jeopardy rule in the operation of the criminal justice system; recognises that this issue must not be seen in isolation, but instead should be considered within the wider context of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s ongoing reform and modernisation programme; commends the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to placing the needs of victims at the heart of the criminal justice system and its achievements over the last four years in fundamentally modernising and reforming that system, including the introduction of the Victim Information and Advice Service across Scotland and the Victim Notification Scheme, and further recognises that any decision on the future of double jeopardy should be taken within the context of Scots law.&quot; </p>

  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5617.2</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Affordable Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5617) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that between 1999 and 2004 fewer houses were built for social rent under the Labour/Liberal Democrat government than in 1995 under the Conservative government and that waiting lists and those presenting as homeless are at record levels; notes the failure of the Scottish government to keep the promises made to Glasgow tenants on second stage stock transfer, and considers that this Scottish government has failed to adequately address the housing crisis in Scotland.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5617.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Affordable Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5617) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that the private and public rental and purchase sectors are under considerable pressure and are not able to keep up with the high demand for affordable housing, especially in rural areas; is alarmed that last year first-time buyer activity reached its lowest level in 25 years; regrets that the Lib-Lab pact has failed to enable Scottish tenants to take advantage of housing stock transfer and, over the last year, has overseen four &quot;no&quot; votes in Edinburgh, Stirling, Renfrewshire and the Highlands and welcomes the Scottish Conservatives&rsquo; support for housing stock transfer and the continuation of tenants&rsquo; right to buy their local authority homes; is opposed to the proposal for the single seller survey as it &quot;will cause difficulties for disadvantaged buyers and sellers, who may be on low incomes and/or be buying or selling low-value properties in areas of low demand&quot;, as highlighted by the Scottish Consumer Council, and considers that the single seller survey is based on an inadequate pilot and is an unnecessary and costly intervention in a sensitive market.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong> Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-5481</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Clyde Fishermen Ahead of the Game on Conservation!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the intention of the Clyde Fishermen&rsquo;s Association to stop, voluntarily, trawling in areas of Upper Loch Fyne and Loch Shira in the interests of biodiversity and conservation and notes that such action provides a further example of the fishing industry&rsquo;s commitment to a sustainable environment by adding to the association&rsquo;s weekend ban on fishing in the Clyde estuary, self-imposed some 20 years ago when its awareness of the need for conservation preceded the anxieties now expressed by politicians at European, UK and Scottish government levels. </p>
