        Soldiers&#151;That the Parliament believes that it is not too late to restore the names
        and reputations of the soldiers of the British Empire Forces court martialled and
        executed, mostly on the Western Front, in the four years 1914-18, following charges
        ranging across desertion, cowardice, quitting posts, sleeping at posts, disobedience,
        striking a superior officer and casting away arms; regrets deficiencies in their
        opportunity to prepare adequate defence and appeals; notes the marked and enlightened
        change in the Army's attitude just over a score of years later to the consequences of
        soldiers enduring long periods of severe cold and damp, lack of food and sleep coupled
        with the stress and shock of constant shellfire with the result that not a single solider
        was executed on these charges throughout the six years from 1939-45; considers that the
        vast majority of the 307 executed were as patriotic and brave as their million other
        compatriots who perished in the conflict and that their misfortune was brought about due
        to stress, or the stress of their accusers, during battle, and that even if the behaviour
        of a small minority may have fallen below that of the highest standards then time,
        compassion and justice dictates that all of these soldiers should now be treated as
        victims of the conflict, and urges Her Majesty&#146;s Government to recommend a posthumous
        pardon, thus bringing to a close a deeply unhappy and controversial chapter in the history
        of the Great War.<strong> </strong></p>
