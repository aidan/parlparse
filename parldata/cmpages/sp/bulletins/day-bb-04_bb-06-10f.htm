          <p><strong>*S2M-1451</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> 
            <strong>Heart Week 5 to 13 June 2004</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates the British Heart Foundation on its Heart Week campaign, 
            the Big Red Fightback, from 5 to 13 June 2004, against coronary heart 
            disease (CHD); notes that, while heart disease rates in Scotland are 
            falling, more people than ever before are living with the disease; 
            further notes that lack of physical activity is one of the key causes 
            of CHD, yet only around one in three men and one in four women achieves 
            the recommended 30 minutes of exercise, five times a week, and therefore 
            believes that the Heart Week campaign's focus on encouraging people 
            to increase their level of physical exercise will be an important 
            contribution to fighting the causes of heart disease in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1450#</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>NHS 
            Argyll and Clyde's Clinical Strategy Review</strong>-That the Parliament 
            rejects the inadequate and short-sighted proposals expressed in <em>Shaping 
            the Future</em>, the clinical strategy for NHS Argyll and Clyde, and 
            specifically its proposals to close both the Dumbarton Joint Hospital 
            and the Helensburgh Victoria Infirmary and to further downgrade the 
            Vale of Leven Hospital while centralising services at the Royal Alexandra 
            Hospital (RAH) in Paisley; notes that, in a recent consultation held 
            by Jackie Baillie MSP and John McFall MP with nurses, consultants, 
            voluntary groups and the local community, 88% of those who responded 
            said that they wanted services delivered north of the river Clyde; 
            agrees that travelling long journeys to reach suitable health care 
            should be the exception and not the rule; further notes with concern 
            the apparent lack of detailed regional planning in arriving at these 
            proposals, and therefore considers that these proposals should be 
            rejected and that local services should be maximised as the first 
            priority and thereafter, for those services that cannot be delivered 
            locally, that serious consideration should be given to the use of 
            Gartnavel Hospital and the Golden Jubilee Hospital.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1449</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>RCN 
            Scotland's Right for Nurses, Right for Patients Campaign</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the recent launch of the Royal College of Nursing 
            Scotland's Right for Nurses, Right for Patients campaign that aims 
            to focus attention on five key nursing issues, including staffing 
            levels and workload, pay modernisation, professional development, 
            specialist nurses and nurse leadership; welcomes the Scottish Executive's 
            positive response to the <em>Facing the Future Nursing and Midwifery 
            Workload and Workforce Planning Project </em>report in accepting all 
            of its 20 recommendations, and further welcomes the forthcoming Facing 
            the Future national convention on Monday 28 June 2004 in Edinburgh 
            and the opportunity it presents for nurses across Scotland to influence 
            future policy on nursing.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1448</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>NHS 
            Argyll and Clyde's Draft Clinical Strategy</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the publication of NHS Argyll and Clyde's draft clinical strategy, 
            which proposes to move in-patient and emergency services from Inverclyde 
            Royal Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH) in Paisley; expresses 
            concern that the RAH, which is already struggling to cope with the 
            increased numbers of patients that it is required to treat as a result 
            of previous centralisation exercises, will be even more severely stretched; 
            condemns the denial of access to NHS services for people in Inverclyde, 
            Largs, Dunoon and beyond, and calls on the NHS board to consider alternative 
            options which may be brought forward for dealing with the real external 
            pressures it faces.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1447</strong> <strong>Iain Smith on behalf of the Procedures 
            Committee:</strong> <strong>Suspension of Standing Orders and Two 
            Minor Changes to Standing Orders</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the Procedures Committee's 3rd Report, 2004 (Session 2), <em>Suspension 
            of Standing Orders</em> (SP Paper 93), and its 5th Report, 2004 (Session 
            2), <em>Two Minor Changes to Standing Orders</em> (SP Paper 174), 
            and agrees that the changes to standing orders set out in Annexe A 
            to each Report be made with effect from 6 September 2004.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1446</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Dying 
            from Cancer is No Pleasure</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            dismay the comments made by Dr John Reid, UK Secretary of State for 
            Health, that &quot;people from those lower socio-economic categories 
            have very few pleasures in life and one of them they regard as smoking&quot;; 
            notes that the people Dr Reid speaks of are those most at risk of 
            dying of smoking-related illnesses; considers these remarks to be 
            ill-judged and dangerous and also that these comments are unhelpful 
            to the Scottish Executive's proclaimed strategy to cut smoking levels 
            among all categories in society, and urges its members to make it 
            clear that the health of those in the lower socio-economic groups 
            is equally as important as those in other socio-economic categories 
            and support speedy legislation to get anti-smoking legislation on 
            the statute book as soon as possible to protect the health of all 
            the people of Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1445</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Fair 
            Play at the Olympics</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that 
            the Olympic Games is supposed to be a showcase for fairness and human 
            achievement but that the exploitation and abuse of workers' rights 
            endemic in the sportswear industry is violating that Olympic spirit; 
            notes that a recent report by Play Fair has found that employees of 
            international corporate sportswear companies are working long hours 
            for low wages in arduous conditions, often without the most basic 
            employment protection; commends the work of the Play Fair at the Olympics 
            campaign, which is attempting to persuade sportswear companies and 
            the International Olympic Committee to take their responsibilities 
            seriously and challenge the abusive business practices of its sponsors 
            and licensees, and believes that the Scottish Executive should pledge 
            its support for this campaign and help place pressure upon the Olympic 
            movement to become part of the solution to end such labour abuses.</P>

            the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Establishment of Committee</strong>-That
