<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2848</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Winning through Unity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly congratulates Barack Obama on his election as 44th President of the United States of America; believes that his election represents, in the words of the Prime Minister, &quot;a moment that will live in history as long as history books are written&quot; and is a watershed event in the history of the USA, parts of which experienced racial segregation within living memory; admires President-elect Obama&rsquo;s campaign, which placed emphasis on unity over division, and believes that his election is testament not only to himself as an individual, his party and all those who have supported him in his campaign, but also to the achievements of a non-violent civil rights movement, which has inspired other struggles against injustice and helped to transcend divisions in countries around the globe; further believes that President-elect Obama shares the values of progressive politics in Scotland and the United Kingdom, and looks forward to engaging constructively with his administration for the betterment of our respective countries and the wider world.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2847</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>SMARTies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of the SMARTies Airdrie Youth Forum, a group of young people from throughout Airdrie aged 12 to 15 years, set up to represent the views of young people in the area; recognises that the group has listened to the views of local young people through conducting a survey and plans to campaign on the issues that have emerged as a result, and wishes group members well in their efforts to improve the lives of young people in Airdrie.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2846</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Airdrie Remembers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff and pupils of Caldervale High School on the success of their recent Airdrie Remembers event, an evening of music, songs, poems and memories involving the history, geography, music, French and English departments, that commemorated the lives of all those who fought and died for their country during the two world wars, and recognises the cross-curricular benefits of this approach to making history real and relevant to pupils, in which business studies pupils handled publicity and tickets for the event, school technicians produced a film of the pupils&rsquo; Flanders visit, home economics pupils provided a World War One purvey of tea, cakes and scones and art department pupils put on a display of paintings.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2845</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>A Tax on Your Identity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent comments by the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith MP, to the effect that most people cannot wait for the introduction of the Westminster Government&rsquo;s proposed ID card scheme; believes that, in fact, there is large-scale opposition to the imposition of identity cards on the people of Scotland and that the cost of compulsory identity cards is nothing more than a tax on an individual&rsquo;s identity, and expresses its concern about plans to use commercial retailers to roll out the card scheme, especially in light of the Home Office&rsquo;s miserable track record of managing large data-handling and IT projects.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2844</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> <strong>Renfrewshire Nursery School Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the plans by Renfrewshire Council to downgrade six nursery schools, four to nursery classes and two to pre-5 centres; considers the removal of all dedicated nursery head teachers to be wrong; deplores the forced redeployment of nursery teachers in these establishments; condemns the fact that, at the end of this exercise, there will be a maximum of 20 instead of 39 teachers dedicated to teaching pre-5s in Renfrewshire; congratulates Renfrewshire parents for their efforts to resist these changes, and, with this in mind, calls on the SNP/Liberal-controlled council to use the formal consultation period now underway to retract these unpopular proposals and retain teacher-led nursery schools in Renfrewshire.</p>
