pm</STRONG></P><P>9:30 am&#9;Debate on The Current International Situation-</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3760</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr John Swinney:</STRONG> <STRONG>The Current International Situation</STRONG>-That 
the Parliament endorses United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 on the 
basis that it provides a mandate for weapons inspection in Iraq; welcomes the 
legal opinion of Matrix Chambers on behalf of CND which concluded that Resolution 
1441 does not provide an authorisation for military action in Iraq and that any 
such use of force would breach international law; believes that UN weapons inspectors 
must be afforded total freedom of access in Iraq and to all evidence in the possession 
of other states, together with sufficient time in order to produce a comprehensive 
report for the consideration of the Security Council on the state of Iraqi compliance 
with the resolution; believes that no commitment of UK forces should be made without 
a specific mandate for military action in Iraq in the form of a further Security 
Council resolution based on clear, published and compelling evidence provided 
by the UN inspectorate of a material breach of Resolution 1441, and expresses 
its deep and serious concern that Her Majesty's Government is currently pursuing 
an inevitable path to war</P><DIR> <DIR> <P>The Presiding Officer has selected 
the following amendments</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3760.3</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Tom McCabe: 
The Current International Situation</STRONG>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3760) 
in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; to end and 
insert &quot;notes the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 as unanimously 
adopted by the Security Council; agrees that the Government of Iraq must comply 
fully with all the provisions of that resolution and that, if it fails to do so, 
the Security Council should meet in order to consider the situation and the need 
for full compliance; notes that a further material breach of Iraq's obligations 
under resolution 1441 will be reported to the Security Council for assessment; 
further notes that responsibility for policy on this matter lies with Her Majesty's 
Government, and also notes the current support given to the Middle East peace 
process by Her Majesty's Government.&quot;</P><DIR> <P><STRONG><em>The Presiding 
Officer has selected the following amendment to the amendment</em></STRONG></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3760.3.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Phil Gallie:</STRONG> <STRONG>The Current International Situation</STRONG>-As 
an amendment to amendment (S1M-3760.3) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, <A NAME="AmendmentText">insert 
at end &quot;and extends its full support to our armed forces if, as a consequence 
of an Iraqi failure to comply, military action should prove necessary.</A> </P><P><STRONG><em>The 
Presiding Officer has selected the following manuscript amendments to the amendment</em></STRONG></P><DIR><P><STRONG> 
() (): The Current International Situation</STRONG>-As an amendment in the name 
of , leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the reserved 
nature of issues relating to the current international situation and the public 
concerns that exist and therefore agrees to support UN Security Resolution 1441 
as unanimously adopted by the UN Security Council; agrees that the Government 
of Iraq must fully comply with all the provisions of the resolution; agrees that, 
if it fails to do so, the UN Security Council should meet in order to consider 
the situation and the need for full compliance; believes that any decision that 
Iraq is in &quot;material breach&quot; of resolution 1441 is for the UN Security 
Council as a whole to determine and that no military action to enforce Resolution 
1441 should be taken against Iraq without a mandate from the UN Security Council, 
and further believes that no British forces should be committed to any military 
action against Iraq without a debate in the House of Commons and a substantive 
motion in favour.&quot;</P><P></P></DIR><P><STRONG> () (): The Current International 
Situation</STRONG>-As an amendment in the name of , leave out from &quot;notes&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;endorses United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 
on the basis that it provides a mandate for weapons inspection in Iraq; welcomes 
the legal opinion of Matrix Chambers on behalf of CND which concluded that Resolution 
1441 does not provide an authorisation for military action in Iraq and that any 
such use of force would breach international law; believes that UN weapons inspectors 
must be afforded total freedom of access in Iraq and to all evidence in the possession 
of other states, together with sufficient time in order to produce a comprehensive 
report for the consideration of the Security Council on the state of Iraqi compliance 
with the resolution; considers the Iraq inspections should be the first stage 
in comprehensive investigations of weapons of mass destruction possessed and being 
pursued by states throughout the world, including the USA, UK, Israel, Pakistan, 
India, North Korea, Russia and any others who must be persuaded to allow full 
and comprehensive assessments of nuclear, chemical, biological and other weapons 
of mass destruction, with a view of pursuing genuine and all-encompassing disarmament 
of such weapons throughout the world; believes that there is no moral, humanitarian 
or military reason to go to war with Iraq whether or not the UN gives its approval, 
and therefore calls on all MSPs to oppose the coming war by all means possible 
including civil disobedience.&quot;</P><P></P></DIR></DIR></DIR><P>2:30 pm&#9;Question

on the subject of-</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3679</STRONG> <STRONG>Johann Lamont:</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Private Rented Housing Sector</STRONG>-That the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">notes 
with concern the lack of regulation of the private rented housing sector, despite 
the capacity of that sector to receive public funding through housing benefit; 
further notes the stark contrast between the obligations placed on landlords in 
the social rented sector and landlords in the private rented sector; believes 
that private sector landlords who are in receipt of public funding should be expected 
to meet minimum standards and procedures in the way that their properties are 
managed, in order to protect the rights of private sector tenants and their neighbours 
and to ensure probity in the distribution of public funds, and considers that 
the Scottish Executive should address these serious matters as a matter of priority.</A>
