<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4049</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Betfred, Stop the Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Betfred&rsquo;s staff notification to remove overtime premium pay for Sundays, bank holidays and general overtime; considers that the poor compensation package will leave staff out of pocket in year one and all remaining years; also notes that in the year to March 2008 Betfred&rsquo;s operating profits for the group improved by 22.7% to &pound;13.2 million, its recent acquisition of a further 23 betting shops and its recent multi-million sponsorship of the World Snooker Championship; believes that wider economic challenges should not be a pretext or excuse to cut terms and conditions, especially in industries where profit continues to be made; understands that Betfred is issuing termination of contracts notification to those not accepting the compensation package; commends the work of Community: The Union for Life in its work to stand up for betting shop workers, and calls on Betfred to rethink its proposals, engage in meaningful consultation with its staff and their union representatives and refrain from cuts to terms and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4048</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>70th Anniversary of the Rotary Club of Leven</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Rotary Club of Leven on its 70th anniversary; notes that since 1939 the organisation has worked tirelessly for the benefit of the local community and to raise funds for a number of worthwhile causes, and wishes the Rotary Club of Leven a long and prosperous future.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4047</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Dispensing GP Practices in Rural Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the important role of dispensing GP practices in remote and rural communities across Scotland; acknowledges the high level of patient satisfaction with these practices; is concerned about the process of the community pharmacy application in Chirnside, which has failed to involve properly the affected GPs or take account of the views of the local population; is aware of the current inquiry on dispensing under consideration by the Public Petitions Committee; therefore supports the British Medical Association&rsquo;s calls for the pharmacy regulations to be reviewed, and agrees that all decisions regarding pharmacy applications should be suspended until this process is concluded.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4046</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Withdrawal of UK Troops from Iraq</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the withdrawal of UK troops from Iraq on 30 April 2009, six years after the start of the UK and US invasion of the country in 2003; recognises the bravery of members of the armed forces who served and gave their lives in Iraq; notes that no weapons of mass destruction have ever been found since the invasion; regrets the massive loss of life among both military personnel and civilians in the country; reiterates its call for an immediate public inquiry into the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to take military action in Iraq in 2003; believes that hostile military action of this nature, in the face of massive international opposition, should never again be perpetrated, and calls on all levels of government in the United Kingdom and across the world to continue to work for peace and stability in Iraq and across the Middle East.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4027</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Pro-anorexia Websites</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply concerned about the proliferation of pro-anorexia websites, which portray anorexia as a glamorous lifestyle choice rather than a potentially fatal psychiatric illness; acknowledges that such sites have been condemned by Beating Eating Disorders, the leading eating disorder charity in the United Kingdom; is aware that these sites share tips on how to accelerate weight loss and disguise fasting from concerned friends and family and advise on how best to induce vomiting and using laxatives; recognises that the appearance of pro-anorexia websites on social networking sites has allowed them to reach a much wider audience, aimed particularly at young women, and that they often pose as a means of support or claim that their intentions are neutral and support recovery while advocating an illness that can lead to infertility, heart disease and even death; understands that many people with anorexia go undiagnosed and up to 20% of those who become seriously ill die prematurely and are at particularly high risk of suicide, and calls on the UK Government to follow the example of the French Government in taking robust action against UK-based websites that actively promote harm and discourage vulnerable people with anorexia from seeking treatment by validating their behaviour, given that not all web portals are prepared to regulate these sites.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3989 *#*</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>HBOS, Lloyds TSB Merger</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that there would be merit in a public inquiry to look into the information that persuaded the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to set aside the usual procedures that apply to company mergers and takeovers when HBOS and Lloyds TSB were given government support to do so, with a subsequent significant impact on the finance sector and employment in Edinburgh and in spite of the likelihood of the proposed merged bank being in breach of competition law and the cost to the taxpayer, before the shareholders and employees of both banks had been made aware of the full facts of the financial situation of both and before any alternatives had been explored.</p>
