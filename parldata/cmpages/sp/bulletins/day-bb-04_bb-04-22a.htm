          <p>9.30 am&#9;Ministerial Statement on Cultural Review</P>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Executive Debate on Mental Health-</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1184</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Mental 
            Health</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges, in National Depression 
            Week, the Scottish Executive's commitment, reflected in the Partnership 
            Agreement, to maintain the mental well-being of the people of Scotland 
            and to improve the situation of those with mental health problems; 
            notes that National Depression Week aims to raise awareness of the 
            realities of depression and to reduce the stigma associated with it; 
            commends the work of the National Programme for Improving Mental Health 
            and Well-Being and progress towards implementation of the Mental Health 
            (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003; welcomes specific initiatives 
            in relation to workforce development and service re-design, such as 
            the Doing Well by People with Depression projects, but also urges 
            the Executive to continue to support efforts to reduce suicides through 
            the &quot;Choose Life&quot; strategy, to remove stigma and to increase 
            the range and quality of services available to those with mental health 
            problems. </P>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1184.1</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Mental Health</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-1184) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, 
            insert at end &quot;while expressing concern that the large number 
            of vacant consultant psychiatrists' posts represents a significant 
            barrier to delivering much sought after improvements.&quot; </P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1184.2</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson: Mental Health</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-1184) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, 
            leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes 
            National Depression Week and its aims to raise awareness, reduce the 
            stigma and make more effective the treatment of depression; notes 
            the work of the Scottish Executive to implement the Mental Health 
            (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 but also notes the conclusions 
            of the National Mental Health Services Assessment which highlights 
            shortcomings in mental health services; is concerned about recruitment, 
            retention and support issues surrounding the mental health workforce; 
            notes that the number of those receiving care in inappropriate settings 
            is still too high, and urges the Executive to increase its efforts 
            to address the rising incidence of suicide in Scotland.&quot; </P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1184.3</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Mental Health</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-1184) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, 
            leave out from &quot;through&quot; to end and insert &quot;; notes 
            that mental health problems disproportionately affect those living 
            in deprived areas and that despite the Executive's commitment to tackling 
            mental health problems as a priority, mental health services remain 
            underfunded and overstretched in many parts of Scotland; believes 
            that abolishing prescription charges would help to address the poverty 
            trap faced by mental health service users who return to work, and 
            further believes that more resources should be directed towards treatment 
            and rehabilitation in community settings, that there should be a greater 
            emphasis on children's mental health, that in-patient treatment facilities 
            should be housed in modern buildings, accessible to the communities 
            that they serve, that more practical and financial support should 
            be given to the families and other carers of those experiencing mental 
            health problems and that, as a priority, a well-resourced, independent 
            national advocacy service for users of mental health services should 
            be established in Scotland.&quot; </P>

            efficiency make to reducing carbon emissions, and supports the Executive's 
            commitment to tackling climate change. </P>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1185.1</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Renewable 
            Energy and Energy Efficiency</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1185) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;recognises the contribution that both renewable 
            energy and energy efficiency make to tackling carbon emissions; further 
            recognises the importance of tackling climate change; agrees, therefore, 
            to raise the Scottish Executive's targets for generating increasing 
            amounts of electricity from renewable resources to 25% of electricity 
            generation capacity by 2010, 30% by 2015 and 50% by 2020; regrets 
            that energy policy is largely reserved to Westminster and rejects 
            calls for an expansion of the nuclear contribution to Scotland's electricity 
            production; acknowledges the important contribution that can be made 
            by small-scale, domestic and community-based renewable energy projects; 
            notes the recent growth in applications for wind farm developments 
            and regrets the absence of clear, concise and coherent guidelines 
            for the approval of such developments; acknowledges the long-term 
            potential for the development of renewable energy technologies, including 
            the associated economic benefits and rural regeneration and export 
            opportunities, and urges the Executive to ensure that these technologies 
            are supported beyond the research and development stage to ensure 
            that Scotland can become a world leader in renewable energy technologies.&quot; 
          </P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1185.2</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Renewable Energy 
            and Energy Efficiency</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1185) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;notes the increasing scepticism about the 
            achievability of the Scottish Executive's targets for renewable energy 
            from a number of sources, including former Energy Minister Brian Wilson 
            MP and UNISON; further notes the publication of reports from the Royal 
            Academy of Engineers and Professor David Simpson of the David Hume 
            Institute on the costs of wind power generation as against other generation 
            methods; regrets the current rush to develop onshore wind capacity 
            to the exclusion of other technologies such as hydro, wave, tidal 
            and biomass, and calls on the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's 
            Government to work together to develop an energy strategy for Scotland 
            which will include a mix of generating capacity, with components from 
            renewables, gas, coal and nuclear power.&quot; </P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1185.3</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird: Renewable Energy 
            and Energy Efficiency</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1185) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Executive can play 
            a much more significant role in tackling climate change by encouraging 
            reductions in energy use through greater energy efficiency and by 
            achieving a greater shift in energy use from fossil fuels to renewable 
            sources, whilst at the same time creating sustainable &quot;green&quot; 
            jobs; welcomes the targets set by the Executive for generation of 
            40% of electricity from renewable sources but notes that this amounts 
            to only about 8% of Scotland's total energy use; recognises that a 
            study commissioned by the Executive shows that the energy potential 
            from renewable energy in Scotland is as much as 60 gigawatts and therefore 
            that renewable energy has a massive potential to supply energy, not 
            only for electricity but also for fuels; further recognises that Scotland 
            leads the world in research and development of wave energy converters; 
            is gravely concerned that the first order for wave converters has 
            come from outside Scotland and that the potential for a manufacturing 
            industry for wave converters may be lost to Scotland because of insufficient 
            market incentives, and therefore calls on the Executive to set concrete 
            targets for energy efficiency, to publish an action plan, including 
            targets, for renewable energy to supply non-electrical uses and to 
            improve market-based incentives for emerging renewable energy technologies.&quot;

          <p><strong>S2M-1076</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>MS 
            Awareness Week</strong>-That the Parliament pays tribute to the work 
            carried out by the Multiple Sclerosis Society in helping thousands 
            of people with multiple sclerosis across Scotland; welcomes MS Awareness 
            Week, 18 to 25 April 2004, as an ideal opportunity to raise awareness 
            of a condition that affects over 10,000 people in Scotland; recognises 
            that there remain serious shortcomings in treatment and support for 
            multiple sclerosis in Scotland, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should develop a national standard of care for people with multiple 
            sclerosis to ensure that levels of treatment and support are the same 
            regardless of where in Scotland they live. </P>
