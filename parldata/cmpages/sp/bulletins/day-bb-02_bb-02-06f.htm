          <p> <strong>*S1M-2704</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Heritage Lottery 
            Fund</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the Heritage 
            Lottery Fund on the publication of its report <em>Sustaining our Living 
            Heritage - Skills and training for the heritage sector</em> and for 
            the support provided to the teaching of traditional skills, helping 
            to maintain these aspects of our national heritage which might otherwise 
            be lost to future generations.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2703</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Scotland's 
            Road Network</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            recent dangers and problems affecting travellers and the economy and 
            caused by a deteriorating winter roads maintenance service; believes 
            that the privatisation of trunk road maintenance is a false economy, 
            resulting in loss of efficiencies of scale, knock-on increased costs 
            to local authorities for clearing non-trunk roads and an overall cost 
            in the form of reduced standards of service; further notes that BEAR 
            Scotland Ltd and Amey Highways Ltd have failed to deliver a quality 
            of service necessary for the safety of road users and the movement 
            of goods, and condemns the Scottish Executive for its actions in ignoring 
            warnings regarding privatisation and in failing to address the current 
            problems.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2702</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Scottish Parliamentary 
            Standards Commissioner Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees

          <p><strong>*S1M-2701</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe: Merger of AEEU 
            and MSF</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the merger of the 
            Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union with MSF to form Amicus, 
            the second largest union in Britain, bringing the benefits of union 
            membership to over one million people, and believes that Amicus will 
            continue to support and promote training and skills development, pension 
            rights, health and safety issues, environmental concerns and involvement 
            and consultation in decision-making by and on behalf of its members.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2700</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: GM Crop Trials</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament believes that the GM crop trials, proposed for three 
            farms in Aberdeenshire and Fife and announced by the Scottish Executive 
            on 31 January 2002, should not proceed in the light of (a) the report 
            by the Royal Society on 4 February 2002, (b) the study by English 
            Nature revealing that genes from separate GM varieties can accumulate 
            in plants that grow from seed spilled at harvest through a process 
            known as &quot;gene-stacking&quot; and (c) the recent admission by 
            the Executive that horizontal gene transfer from GM foods has taken 
            place under laboratory conditions.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2699</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Iain Anderson 
            on BBC Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament, while respecting 
            the right of BBC Radio Scotland to set its own schedules, notes the 
            station's intention to end this Spring the afternoon programme presented 
            by Iain Anderson; regrets the damage done to the programme over the 
            last year by constant managerial interference in a highly successful 
            formula which mixed classical and Celtic music, now allowing only 
            the blandest of contemporary music to be broadcast in the key afternoon 
            slot; observes in particular the damage that this did to audience 
            numbers and to the total air time given to Scottish music by the main, 
            publicly-funded Scottish broadcaster; is saddened that such a wrong-headed 
            policy was persisted with, despite much opinion to the contrary expressed 
            to the BBC by loyal listeners, and hopes that Iain Anderson&#146;s 
            new programme, to be broadcast on weekday evenings, will be left free 
            of such meddling and allowed to develop the style and content that 
            has made Iain Anderson deservedly popular with a very wide range of 
            listeners.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2698#</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Child Witness 
            Reform</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the report <em>Justice 
            for Children &#150; The Welfare of Children in the Justice System</em>; 
            commends Children 1st, Childline, NCH Scotland and the other participants 
            for producing this report, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should look closely at the findings and recommendations of the report 
            and act accordingly.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2697</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Class Sizes and 
            Pupil Attainment</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes increasing 
            research that indicates considerable short-, medium- and long-term 
            benefits from reducing early primary class sizes, preferably to 18 
            or below, and the particular impact that such reductions have on children 
            living in poverty; further notes the performance indicators 2000-01 
            report by the Accounts Commission published on 24 January 2002, which 
            shows that the Scottish Executive has not yet achieved its own class 
            size targets, and therefore calls on all parties in the Parliament 
            to support the SNP&#146;s radical initiatives on this matter as an 
            important step in not only assisting individual educational attainment 
            and individual lifetime achievement, but also bringing collective 
            economic benefit for Scotland as a whole.</p>
