            Harper: Discharges of Technetium-99 (Tc-99) from Sellafield</strong>—That 
            the Parliament with regard to the UK Environment Agency’s public consultation 
            on proposals for the future regulation of Technetium-99 discharges 
            from Sellafield, objects to the Environment Agency’s proposal to allow 
            Sellafield’s high discharges of Tc-99 to continue until at least 2006; 
            notes that Tc-99 remains dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years 
            and builds up in the food chain, particularly in lobsters; notes with 
            concern that lobsters are still being found in south-west Scotland 
            with levels of Tc-99 close to the European Community Intervention 
            Level (1,250 Bq/kg) after a nuclear accident, that levels in seaweed 
            range from 2,800 Bq/kg in south-west Scotland to 910 Bq/kg in Cape 
            Wrath and therefore that the whole of the west coast of Scotland and 
            beyond is contaminated with Tc-99; is concerned that British Nuclear 
            Fuels Limited (BNFL) is planning to increase discharges of Tc-99 and 
            many radioactive substances as a result of its plan to increase the 
            throughput of its MAGNOX reprocessing plant, contrary to the UK Government’s 
            stated intent to substantially reduce or eliminate these discharges; 
            believes that radioactive waste should be concentrated and contained 
            in monitorable and retrievable form rather than being diluted and 
            dispersed in the seas around Scotland, and therefore requests that 
            Government and the nuclear industry’s regulators should stop BNFL 
            producing any more liquid Tc-99 and other radioactive wastes by ending 
            MAGNOX reprocessing at Sellafield and closing BNFL’s MAGNOX reactors 
            and furthermore should stop BNFL discharging its existing liquid Tc-99 
            wastes into the sea by converting them into a solid form that can 
            be contained and shielded on the Sellafield site.</font></p>

            to phase out reliefs for water and sewerage charges for charitable 
            bodies starting from 1 April 2001; recognises that if implemented 
            this decision will mean an estimated additional bill of £27 million 
            for Scotland’s voluntary sector in 2001-02 and more than double that 
            for the following year; notes that the additional costs that will 
            result will threaten the ability of many voluntary organisations engaged

            2001-02 to 2003-04 which is substantially below the Scottish average; 
            is aware that Glasgow in financial year 2003-2004 will receive £72 
            per capita less in real terms than in 1996-97; notes that council 
            tax in Glasgow has risen by 36% since 1996-97, compared to the Scottish 
            average of 25.1% over that period, taking it from the third highest 
            to the highest in Scotland and that, according to the City Council 
            itself, council tax will have to rise by twice the rate of inflation 
            to prevent service cuts in 2001-02, placing an unfair burden on Glasgow’s 
            already hard-pressed council tax payers; is aware that Glasgow has 
            already had to implement service cuts of £242.7 million from 1996-97 
            to 2000-2001 and shed 2327 full-time equivalent posts, net, from December 
            1996 to September 1999; appreciates that Glasgow has, in common with

            awards and new statutory responsibilities such as those imposed by 
            the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 in recent years; accepts that Glasgow 
            has more than half of Scotland’s areas of deprivation with only 12% 
            of its population and that it requires resourcing that reflects this; 
            agrees with Glasgow City Council’s leader that the Scottish Executive 
            is &quot;walking away from its own social inclusion agenda&quot; in 
            relation to its 2001-02 to 2003-04 local government settlement for 
            Glasgow and urges the Scottish Executive to act immediately to ensure 
            that Glasgow City Council’s 2001-02 to 2003-04 local government funding 
            settlement is increased to a level commensurate with Glasgow’s economic

            <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Discrimination Against Teaching Centres of Artistic 
            Excellence</strong>—That the Parliament notes the decision of the Department 
            for Education and Employment to introduce Dance and Drama Awards for 
            students to study at institutions in England and Wales; is aware that 
            Scottish students compete on equal terms for places at such institutions 
            with their counterparts from other parts of the United Kingdom and 
            the European Union (EU); is concerned that tuition fees are only paid 
            if students study in England and Wales and regrets that no parallel 
            funding scheme exists for students who wish to study in Scotland; 
            believes that this discrimination against Scottish institutions can 
            only harm them and in the case of Ballet West may force it out of 
            business or to relocate from Taynuilt to outwith Scotland, to the 
            detriment of the local economy and employment; notes that Ballet West 
            attracts students from across the United Kingdom, the EU and as far 
            afield as Guatemala, Japan and Malaysia and outperforms competitor 
            schools from south of the border in ballet competitions and quality 
            of training; is puzzled by the Minister for Children and Education’s 
            view that &quot;there is no evidence of significant demand for Dance 
            and Drama training for young people aged 16 and over in Scotland&quot; 
            when 613 applications were received by Ballet West for 23 places; 
            regrets that 34 students withdrew or rejected offers from Ballet West 
            due to lack of funding, compared with only two students doing so at 
            English institutions; notes that the Excellence Fund supports and 
            encourages talent secondary school dancers in Scotland but that the 
            only progression into tertiary training encouraged by the Scottish 
            Executive is in England; is concerned that Scotland will become denuded 
            of teaching centres of artistic excellence and be drained of artistic 
            talent as a result of this discrimination; believes the current position 
            of the Scottish Executive on this issue contradicts its own cultural 
            strategy that has as its key themes &quot;widening opportunities, 
            promoting education, developing and celebrating excellence&quot; and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should act in order that students 
            from across the UK can choose where to study dance, drama or stage 
            management based on the quality of course offered rather than on whether 
            or not tuition fees will be paid.</font></p>
