          <p><strong>*S2M-604#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>South 
            Lanarkshire Secondary Schools PPP Proposal</strong>-That the Parliament 
            shares the concerns of parents and pupils in East Kilbride with regard 
            to South Lanarkshire Council's public private partnership proposal 
            for secondary schools which, if implemented, will result in 50% of 
            secondary schools in East Kilbride being closed and school rolls amongst 
            the highest in Scotland; notes that, as the locations of the proposed 
            schools are all in the north of the town, this will lead to considerably 
            longer school journey times for pupils; further notes that St Andrews 
            School, which is earmarked for closure, currently operates at over 
            80% capacity and has a healthy mix of denominational and non-denominational 
            pupils thus contributing to the Scottish Executive's stated policy 
            of combating sectarianism, and considers that the Executive should 
            fully investigate this situation and the concerns of parents and pupils 
            prior to agreeing the closure of St Andrews school and giving approval 
            to South Lanarkshire Council's secondary school provision proposal.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-603</strong> <strong>Iain Smith on behalf of the Procedures 
            Committee:</strong> <strong>The Founding Principles of the Parliament</strong>-That 
            the Parliament takes note of the previous Procedures Committee's 3rd 
            Report, 2003 (Session 1), <em>The Founding Principles of the Scottish 
            Parliament</em> (SP Paper 818); continues to endorse the four principles 
            of access and participation, equal opportunities, accountability and 
            power sharing as the guiding principles for the Parliament, and encourages 
            all members to play a part in applying these principles throughout 
            the range of their Parliamentary work.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Kenneth Macintosh<strong>*</strong>, Murray Tosh<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-602#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Belford 
            Hospital, Lochaber</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 
            people of Lochaber for their massive attendance at the public meeting 
            on Tuesday, 11 November 2003 to express their support for the future 
            of the Belford Hospital, Fort William; notes that around 2,500 people 
            attended the Nevis Centre, representing about one fifth of the population 
            of Lochaber; recognises that the Belford Hospital has established 
            a very high reputation for the standard of its work, particularly 
            in relation to acute trauma; considers that the Belford Hospital must 
            continue to be recognised as a medical training centre in order to 
            retain its nine junior medical, surgical and casualty staff; believes 
            that consultant-led services must be retained locally to ensure that 
            high quality acute emergency services continue to be provided at the 
            Belford Hospital; notes that the Lochaber Medical Community Option 
            (the &quot;Lochaber option&quot;) has the support of a substantial 
            majority of doctors working in Lochaber, as well as the unanimous 
            support of the Belford Hospital staff, including nurses, physiotherapists, 
            domestic staff, porters, secretaries, radiographers, laboratory staff 
            and midwives as well as that of the full Highland Council; believes 
            that the &quot;Lochaber option&quot; has, thus far, not been properly 
            considered nor fully evaluated; further believes that the &quot;Lochaber 
            option&quot; must be included as one of the options in the formal 
            consultation process which is to be launched by the Highland Health 
            Board early next year, and considers that members from all political 
            parties should express their support for the &quot;Lochaber option&quot; 
            being included in the formal consultation process.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-601</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Water 
            and Sewerage Charges</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the 
            Scottish Executive's current water and sewerage charges reduction 
            scheme should be extended in scale, scope and time and that the gap 
            between the Income Support Allowance for water and sewerage and the 
            actual level of charges should be progressively closed.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-600#</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Laurencekirk 
            Railway Station</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement 
            made by Aberdeenshire Council and Scotrail on the possibility of reopening 
            Laurencekirk Station; recognises the support in Laurencekirk and the 
            north east as a whole for the station's reopening; notes the Scottish 
            Executive's commitment to encouraging the increased use of rail transport 
            as an alternative to the car, and encourages Aberdeenshire Council, 
            Scotrail and the Scottish Executive to continue to make progress towards 
            the station's reopening.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-599</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>Bonnington 
            and Stonebyres Power Stations</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            all those who have been involved in the Lanark hydros at Bonnington 
            and Stonebyres Power Stations over the last 75 years; acknowledges 
            that this was the first hydro-electric scheme in Scotland to serve 
            the public supply, and welcomes recent investment which will see the 
            stations continuing to deliver clean, green energy to homes and businesses 
            in years to come.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-582*#*</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Natural Heritage Vote Against Relocation</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that 70% of the staff balloted by the Public and Commercial 
            Services Union at Scottish Natural Heritage's (SNH) headquarters in 
            Edinburgh expressed their opposition to the forced relocation to Inverness 
            and will not transfer when their jobs move; notes that the remaining 
            30% will only move with improved and enhanced conditions; further 
            notes that this lack of staff support will impose a serious threat 
            to the long-term effectiveness and efficiency of SNH to carry out 
            its core function of protecting Scotland's natural heritage, and *considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should* stop this move before it brings 
            the Executive's worthwhile relocation policy further into disrepute.</P>
