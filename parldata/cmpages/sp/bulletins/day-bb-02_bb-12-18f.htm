<STRONG> Alasdair Morgan: Planning Application for an Extension of the Landfill 
Site at Aucheninnes, Kirkcudbrightshire</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament calls 
on the Scottish Executive to hold a full public enquiry into the planning application 
which is now with it, lodged by Shanks Waste Management with Dumfries and Galloway 
Council, for the extension of the landfill site at Aucheninnes, Kirkcudbrightshire, 
given the application's potential detrimental environmental effects on the community 
of Dalbeattie.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3717#</STRONG> <STRONG>Brian Fitzpatrick: Dialogues 
Project</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates all concerned on the launch 
of the Dialogues project by the University of Glasgow, which is designed to give 
about 200 small- and medium-sized west of Scotland businesses, including existing 
and new businesses, access to the expertise and knowledge base of the university; 
recognises the opportunity that this welcome initiative provides for pulling together 
key players in economic development, including Scottish Enterprise, local authorities, 
the NHS, the education sector and the private sector, and promoting joined-up 
thinking across the support networks; welcomes the funding support that has been 
made available from the University of Glasgow, Strathclyde European Partnership 
and Glasgow City Council and the collaborative working undertaken by Strathclyde 
University and the NHS on this project; notes the progress made since 1997 in 
translating research knowledge into commercial reality and in finding ways to 
develop innovations and discoveries here, rather than simply seeking opportunities 
overseas; encourages further progress in supporting research activity and commercialisation 
to help Scottish businesses and the business base of our universities grow, and 
believes that the Scottish Executive should give early consideration to securing 
comprehensive baseline data information about the commercial outputs being generated 
from research conducted in Scottish universities and research institutes to enable 
better target setting and performance evaluation and thereby influence future 
commercialisation strategies. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3716 Mr Murray Tosh on behalf 
of the Procedures Committee: Changes to Standing Orders</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament approves the recommendations (a) for changes to the Standing Orders 
of the Scottish Parliament concerning Private Legislation, Temporary Conveners 
and the Journal of the Scottish Parliament contained in the Procedures Committee's 
4th Report 2002, <em>Changes to Standing Orders concerning the Scottish Parliamentary 
Standards Commissioner, European Committee remit, Private Legislation, Temporary 
Conveners and the Journal of the Scottish Parliament </em>(SP Paper 665), (b) of 
the Procedures Committee's 5th Report 2002, <em>Constituting the Conveners' Group 
</em>(SP Paper 682), (c) of the Procedures Committee's 6th Report 2002, <em>Changes 
to Standing Orders concerning Written Parliamentary Questions and the Languages 
of Public Petitions</em> (SP Paper 693) and (d) of the Procedures Committee's 7th 
Report 2002, <em>A Change to Standing Orders concerning the remit of the Audit 
Committee </em>(SP Paper 692)<em> </em>and agrees that those amendments to the Standing 
Orders should come into force on 6 January 2003. </P><P>Supported by: Mr Kenneth 
Macintosh<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3715#</STRONG> <STRONG>Robin Harper: 
Theatre in Scotland</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament regrets the lack of sufficient 
funding for Scottish theatre; notes the cutbacks at Brunton Theatre; notes the 
contribution made over the years by groups such as the TAG Theatre Company, 7:84, 
Borderline, Theatre in Education and TWE Edinburgh; further notes the looming 
funding crisis for repertory theatre, especially the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh; 
notes that unless funding equivalent to the funding available to theatre in England 
and Wales is made available, there will be a drift of talent southwards that will 
result in the ability of professional theatre to survive in Scotland being undermined 
in the near future, and believes that the Scottish Executive should redress this 
imbalance as soon as possible by providing sufficient funds to the Scottish Arts 
Council to accomplish this.<STRONG><em> R</em></STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3714</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Johann Lamont: Glasgow: European City of Sport 2003</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates Glasgow on receiving the title of European City of

decision on the siting of the new national sports stadium.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3713#
