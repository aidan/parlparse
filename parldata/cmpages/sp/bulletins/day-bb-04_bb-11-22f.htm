          <p><strong>*S2M-2045</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Concessions for Senior Citizens at CIS League Cup Final</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the football clubs involved in the forthcoming CIS League Cup semi-final matches should review their pricing position, as set out to the Scottish Football League, of charging all spectators full price to attend these matches; calls for a concession for senior citizens to enable them to see their clubs play in all competitions, and believes, therefore, that all clubs should give greater consideration to those fans who have spent a lifetime supporting their teams.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-2044#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Supported Employment Learning Initiative Funding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the simplification of the process for accessing funds for learning initiatives for organisations such as Remploy that provide supported employment to people with specific needs, removing the need for these individuals or their organisations to apply to, and liaise with, several government departments when making a request for funding, and supports the creation of a central funding budget for this purpose and access to Learn Direct funds via individual learning accounts for supported employment organisations.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2043</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Job Losses in Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the loss of 200 jobs at Richard&rsquo;s Textiles Mill in Aberdeen and calls on the Scottish Executive to support the relevant local agencies, including the city council and Amicus trade union, in working to address the negative impact that this will have on the local economy and in assisting those workers who have lost their jobs in such difficult circumstances to find employment.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2042</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>The Continued Harassment and Abuse of Mordechai Vanunu by the Israeli State</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament strongly condemns the latest detention of Mordechai Vanunu on alleged suspicion of passing on classified information on Israel&rsquo;s nuclear weapons programme to foreign journalists; notes that Mordechai Vanunu has served 18 years in jail in solitary confinement for making public Israel&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal; further notes that, when Mordechai was released earlier this year, his civil and human rights were further restricted and abused by the Israeli authorities refusing to allow him a passport, banning his contact with foreigners except with permission and barring him from meeting the foreign press and broadcast media and from giving media interviews; believes that Mr Vanunu is not a threat to the Israeli State but is a beacon of peace, justice and integrity at a time when world leaders seem intent on war and destruction, and calls on the Scottish Executive to actively campaign and speak out on behalf of Mordechai Vanunu and to make representations to the Israeli Government for the immediate release and cessation of harassment of Mr Vanunu.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2041</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Colombian Green Presidential Candidate, Ingrid Betancourt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with great concern that Ingrid Betancourt, Presidential candidate and Leader of the Colombian Green Party (Partido Verde Oxigeno) has now been held for 1,000 days by FARC (The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) having been abducted on 23 February 2002; recognises that before her abduction, and despite threats to her life, Ingrid Betancourt was a brave champion of peace and democracy in her troubled country, and requests that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government redouble its representations to the Colombian Government to do everything in its power to secure the safe release of Ingrid and her campaign manager Clara Rojas.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2040</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>BAFTA Scotland Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its disappointment that the BAFTA Scotland awards ceremony was not shown on either BBC or any of the commercial TV franchises serving Scotland; regards this as a lost opportunity to showcase the best of Scottish talent and promote the industry, and congratulates Paula Sage for her Best First Time Performance Award for &quot;Afterlife&quot;, demonstrating the wide spectrum of talent within the Scottish film and television industries.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2039</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Fluoride in Public Water Supply</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Scottish Executive for listening to the views expressed in response to its consultation on improving the oral health of Scotland&rsquo;s children; welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s commitment not to change the current legislation on fluoridation of water supplies, and believes that Scotland&rsquo;s poor oral health record can be more effectively tackled by promoting increased action in schools and through the health visitor network than by adding fluoride to the water supply.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Margaret Smith, Jeremy Purvis</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2038#</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Knife Crime in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the unacceptable number of incidents involving knife crime in Scotland and particularly in the east end of Glasgow; believes that the Scottish Executive, Strathclyde police and other key agencies need to work more effectively to tackle this problem; considers that a range of measures to deal with knife crime are required, and believes that the Executive should consider measures such as restricting access to the purchase of knives, ensuring appropriate programmes are in place to educate young people on the dangers and consequences of carrying and using knives, speedier and effective sentencing for those convicted of knife crime and ensuring that the police have effective powers to deal with those who carry and use knives.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2037</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Stop Smoking Message at Football Grounds</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that positive action is necessary to help ease the crisis facing Scottish football clubs due to the withholding of copyright payments by pools companies for the use of fixture lists on their pools coupons at a cost to all clubs of &pound;20,000 per annum and therefore believes that, in order to alleviate this crisis, to promote healthy-living issues and to sustain the future development of youth football, the Scottish Executive should divert some of its extensive budget, which is currently spent on television advertising, to renting from the Scottish Football Association the 20-foot-diameter centre circle at all major Scottish football grounds to exhibit a 314 square feet &quot;No Smoking&quot; logo which will advertise an anti-smoking message, reaching millions of people every week during televised matches and simultaneously sending out an SoS to &quot;Stop our Smoking&quot; and &quot;Save our Soccer&quot;.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2036#</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Help to Stub Out Smoking</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the Scottish Executive proposing to end smoking in enclosed public places; notes the cross-party support for measures to tackle this issue; further notes the scientific consensus on the damage that tobacco smoke does to human health, and considers that the Executive should maintain its commitment to the comprehensive ban, recognise that smoking is an addiction and make an ongoing financial commitment in order that this addiction can be controlled on an continuing basis.</p>
          <p>Supported by: John Swinburne, Eleanor Scott, Rob Gibson, Jackie Baillie, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Chris Ballance, Brian Adam, Mike Pringle, Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Bristow Muldoon<strong>*</strong></p>

          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Dr Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2034</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water's Decision to Sell Rob Roy McGregor's Birthplace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that Scottish Water is set to auction to the highest bidder Glengyle House, where Rob Roy McGregor, the renowned Jacobite and declared outlaw, was born in 1671; notes that this historical building is currently owned by the people of Scotland who have not been consulted on its future, and calls for the house to be withdrawn from the auction which is due to take place on 24 November 2004 to allow a public debate on Glengyle House&rsquo;s future to take place.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Jim Mather<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2033*#*</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Retire into Action - CSV Report on Older Volunteers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Retire into Action</em>, the Community Service Volunteers&rsquo; research into the benefits of volunteering by older people; celebrates the contribution made by older citizens in supporting local community organisations and individuals in Scotland; notes the personal benefits to be gained by volunteers such as improved health and confidence, as well as great social benefits; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s ageing population provides great opportunities as well as challenges; notes the work done by older citizens in Edinburgh Central in supporting homeless people and those with debt problems, assisting in schools and running community centres and the many community groups that would struggle to exist without the generous time, expertise and commitment given by so many older people, and, in particular, notes the contribution of the Parliament&rsquo;s neighbours in the Old Town where organisations such as the Committee of the St Anne&rsquo;s Community Centre and the committees of the Dumbiedykes Neighbourhood Association and the Writers Group have worked over many years to support people and enrich their lives.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2032</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Energy Jobs for Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to lobby Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government for the transfer of all energy civil service jobs to Aberdeen, Europe&rsquo;s energy capital.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2031</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Winter Cold-Related Deaths</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament finds totally unacceptable the figure of 2,900 winter cold-related deaths in 2003, which is an increase of 400 on the 2002 figure; believes that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s free central heating programme should be expanded and its delivery improved to meet the needs of many who are still living in fuel poverty; recommends that more work is done with the energy companies to encourage them to lower their charges and to ensure they do not disconnect vulnerable, elderly customers, and therefore calls on the Executive to pledge to guarantee that there will be a significant reduction in cold-related deaths in 2004 and no such deaths in 2005.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong></p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2026</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Specialist Mountain Search and Rescue Vehicle</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the sterling work undertaken by the Scottish mountain rescue teams that provide an essential service in our mountains and hills in all seasons and weathers; welcomes the grant of &pound;160,000 awarded by the Scottish Executive to mountain rescue teams in Scotland which has assisted in purchasing a &pound;250,000 specialised off-road communications vehicle for use in mountain search and rescue operations in the Highlands and Skye; further welcomes the charitable donations given by the Order of St John and others, and notes that the vehicle is equipped with both digital and analogue radios thus allowing liaison between mountain rescue teams, RAF helicopters and the police which will be of major benefit, not just in large-scale mountain rescues, but also in dealing with incidents such as aeroplanes coming down in the hills.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2025#</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Food Supply Code of Practice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls for a strengthened Supermarket Code of Practice, legally enforced, to ensure fair trade in the food supply chain; recognises that the current Supermarket Code of Practice is ineffective, not enforced and does not cover all parts of the supply chain; notes the Office of Fair Trading&rsquo;s report that fear amongst suppliers of being de-listed by the major supermarkets has prevented anyone complaining under the current code, and recommends that a strengthened code is proactively enforced to ensure fair play for all those in the food supply chain and to safeguard against reprisals.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

          <p>Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Tommy Sheridan, Ms Sandra White, Carolyn Leckie, Frances Curran</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2023#</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Scottish National Anthem</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that there is a need for it to take the lead on the issue of a national anthem for Scotland, as the anthem is within its remit; recognises the importance of this issue to the Scottish public and will consult the people of Scotland while examining the issue of the national anthem; considers it necessary to have a Scottish national anthem that is endorsed by the majority of Scotland and that embodies the rich cultural heritage and strong character of Scotland, and pledges to consider this issue in the future to ensure that the Scottish people have an anthem of which to be proud.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2022#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Scottish History</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the educational and cultural benefits of promoting Scottish history from ancient to modern times in our schools; notes that this will allow pupils a greater understanding of Scotland in European and global contexts and will encourage a balanced perspective; appreciates that this will cultivate greater confidence and self-awareness in pupils, and considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate the level of Scottish history taught in our schools with a view to attaching greater importance to the subject.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Rob Gibson, Stewart Stevenson, Mr Adam Ingram, Roseanna Cunningham, Eleanor Scott, Jim Mather, Mr Kenny MacAskill, John Swinburne, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Campbell Martin, Rosie Kane, Alex Neil, Christine Grahame, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Michael Matheson, Donald Gorrie, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Chris Ballance, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2021</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Fluoride</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes recent reports that the Scottish Executive has decided not to include water fluoridation in the forthcoming Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill; believes that the quality of research into the health impacts of drinking fluoride has been too poor to establish whether it is harmful or not; recognises that the European Convention on Human Rights clearly states that individuals have the right not be medicated without their consent; acknowledges the appalling state of oral health in Glasgow; welcomes the proposals on expanding access to dental services, maintaining good oral hygiene and tackling poor diet contained in NHS Greater Glasgow's Oral Health Strategy; urges NHS Greater Glasgow to rule out introducing fluoride to Glasgow&rsquo;s water supply, and calls on the Executive to categorically rule out fluoridation from all other future legislation.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-2020</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Class Sizes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that class sizes in Scottish schools should be set at a national maximum level of 20 for non-practical classes and 15 or less for practical classes; condemns the Scottish Executive for failing to reach targets for maximum sizes in S1 and S2 Mathematics and English classes; calls on the Scottish Executive to provide a strategy, including a timescale, to implement those commitments already made for S1 and S2 Mathematics and English and the early stages of primary school and produce a longer-term strategy to reduce all class sizes to 20 for non-practical subjects in state schools, and considers that such a strategy should include teacher recruitment and retention in addition to a survey of school capacity.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2019#</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Hollybush House Appeal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should support the mental health charity Combat Stress&rsquo;s funding appeal for new accommodation in Hollybush House, Ayr, Scotland's only centre for combat-related stress, in order to meet the requirements of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001; notes that current Executive funding is only &pound;54,000 over the next three years, and believes that increased funding should be allocated as a mark of support and respect for Scottish troops in active service, in recognition of the anticipated increase in demand for mental health services amongst servicemen and women as a result of the current conflict and in order to demonstrate that the First Minister&rsquo;s support for Scottish troops is more than just words.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Neil, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2017</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Detention of Mordechai Vanunu</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the new detention on 11 November&nbsp;2004 of Mordechai Vanunu on&nbsp;alleged suspicion of passing on classified information on Israel&rsquo;s nuclear weapons programme to foreign journalists; notes that, despite serving 18 years in jail for making public Israel&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal, on being released earlier this year his civil and human rights were further restricted by the Israeli authorities refusing him a passport, refusing him permission to leave Israel for a year, banning his contact with foreigners except with permission, and barring him from visiting foreign embassies, meeting the foreign press and broadcast media and from giving media interviews; believes that, far from being a threat to the Israeli state, Mr Vanunu bravely acted as an independent inspector of Israel&rsquo;s nuclear weapons of mass destruction; agrees with International Atomic Energy Agency director, General Dr El-Baradei, when he told the Sydney Morning Herald on 8 November 2004 that &quot;This is not really sustainable, that you have Israel sitting with nuclear weapons capability there while everyone else is part of the non-proliferation regime&quot;, and calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to make representations to the Israeli Government for the immediate release and cessation of harassment of Mr Vanunu.</p>
