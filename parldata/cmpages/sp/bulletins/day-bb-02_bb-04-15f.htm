          <p><strong>*S1M-2975</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Post Office Privatisation</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament supports the Communication Workers Union campaign against 
            privatisation of the Post Office and their lobby of the Scottish Parliament 
            planned for Thursday 25 April 2002; condemns the privatisation of 
            the Post Office being pursued by the New Labour government resulting 
            in thousands of post offices and depots closures and related job loss 
            threats amounting to 40,000, and resolves to put maximum pressure 
            on Westminster to halt the privatisation of the Post Office and to 
            invest appropriately instead in what is potentially a hugely efficient 
            public service, deserving of protection and promotion within the public 
            sector.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2974#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Labour Against 
            the Euro Campaign</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the launch 
            of the Labour Against the Euro campaign in Westminster on Wednesday 
            10 April 2002 which involved 30 Labour MPs declaring their opposition 
            both to a euro referendum before the next general election and their 
            opposition to joining the euro, should such a referendum be called; 
            further notes the release of a major survey at the meeting illustrating 
            that 75% of Labour voters were opposed to joining the euro and that 
            expenditure on public services was the key preoccupation of Labour 
            voters, and, while welcoming the launch of the Labour Against the 
            Euro campaign, believes it is time for a progressive cross-party and 
            labour movement campaign against the euro to be established in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2973</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: James Sabzali</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament condemns the conviction of Canadian-born businessman 
            James Sabzali in the United States of America for the violation of 
            Washington&#146;s economic blockade against Cuba by selling water 
            purification chemicals to the Cuban government; notes that the water 
            purification chemicals sold to Cuba are used to purify the water which 
            goes to Cuban schools and homes; further notes that James Sabzali 
            could face a sentence of up to 205 years in prison and that he is 
            the only foreign national ever to be prosecuted for alleged violation 
            of the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act; believes that this conviction 
            is yet another reason why the United States of America&#146;s illegal 
            economic blockade of Cuba must be lifted immediately, and recognises 
            that the USA is in breach of international law and opinion by refusing 
            to accept UN resolutions passed over the last decade demanding an 
            end to its destructive and damaging economic blockade of Cuba.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2972#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: SPL-TV and the 
            Financial Future of Football Clubs</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            regrets the uncertain financial future facing the 10 non-Old Firm 
            Scottish Premier League Clubs following the decision by Rangers and 
            Celtic to effectively veto plans for SPL-TV; notes that the 10 clubs 
            whose revenue risks being adversely impacted in a very significant 
            way employ in the region of 1000 full-time staff, thousands more on 
            a casual or part-time basis and contribute significantly to their 
            surrounding local economies, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should intervene so that the clubs can look forward to a degree of 
            financial stability and the public can enjoy watching their teams 
            on television.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2971</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes: National Epilepsy 
            Week, 19-25 May 2002</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            19-25 May 2002 is National Epilepsy Week, recognises the excellent 
            work being done by the Glasgow based Epilepsy Action Scotland in supporting 
            those with epilepsy, notes that there are almost 30,000 people with 
            epilepsy in Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to support 
            those with epilepsy by providing high standards of medical care and 
            easy access to information and by working to end the discrimination 
            and stigma suffered by people with epilepsy. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Karen Whitefield<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2970#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: MS Awareness 
            Week, 14-21 April 2002</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes 
            MS Awareness Week, 14-21 April 2002, which aims to raise the profile 
            of the disease of multiple sclerosis; recognises the role that the 
            health service in Scotland and the MS Society Scotland play in improving 
            the lives of people affected by MS; notes the recent progress which 
            will ensure that beta interferon is made available to all those people 
            with MS who can benefit from it, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should work closely with the MS Society in developing a national standard 
            of care for people with MS.</p>
          <p>Supported by: David Mundell<strong>*</strong>, Karen Whitefield<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2969</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Lockerbie to Leeds 
            Rail Service</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            that the Strategic Rail Authority is establishing a new Northern England 
            franchise which will include the existing Glasgow to Leeds service; 
            notes that this service currently passes through Lockerbie Station 
            without stopping; further notes that Lockerbie Station is a major 
            regional railhead for much of the south of Scotland and that there 
            is no direct service between the station and West Yorkshire, and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to do all that it can to urge the Strategic 
            Rail Authority and the six pre-qualified bidders for the Northern 
            England franchise to agree to stop at Lockerbie Station on the Glasgow 
            to Leeds service as part of the new franchise.</a></p>

            an amendment to motion (S1M-2953) in the name of Alex Fergusson, <a name="AmendmentText">insert 
            at end &quot;; further notes that the largest timber growing area 
            in the UK is the Kielder forest in the Scottish Borders and that the 
            most effective manner of removing dangerous and destructive lorries 
            hauling timber through the small towns and villages of the Southern 
            Borders is to reinstate not just the northern but also the southern 
            half of the Waverley line, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should undertake a fresh and full study into the environmental impact 
            of removing this freight from road to rail.&quot;</a></p>

            and organisations who have contributed to the development of this 
            project, and considers that the Scottish Executive should work in 
            partnership with CHAS, NHS boards, local authorities and the Scottish 
            Partnership Agency for Palliative and Cancer Care to ensure that these
