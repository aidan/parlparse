          <p><strong>*S1M-2574</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Imprisonment 
            of Ngawang Sangdrol</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the 
            plight of Buddhist nun Ngawang Sangdrol who, along with her fellow 
            nuns from the Garu monastery, was arrested and imprisoned in August 
            1990 for attending a pro-independence demonstration in Lhasa; notes 
            reports which indicate that Ngawang Sangdrol is currently due to be 
            released in 2013 by which time she will be only 36 years old and yet 
            will have been imprisoned for 21 years, and expresses its support 
            for Amnesty International&#146;s campaign to have Ngawang Sangdrol 
            released from prison in Tibet.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2571</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: F&egrave;isean 
            nan G&agrave;idheal</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            F&egrave;isean nan G&agrave;idheal, the National Association of Gaelic 
            Arts Youth Tuition Festivals, on its work in the last year in involving 
            over 3,600 young people in Gaelic cultural events, and commends the 
            hard work by all in the organisation in order to involve a new generation 
            of young people in Scotland&#146;s Gaelic heritage despite the present 
            range of difficult circumstances which face Gaelic, not least the 
            fact that the present shortage of Gaelic teachers results in the language 
            relying heavily on the goodwill of volunteers, such as those in F&egrave;isean 
            nan G&agrave;idheal.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2570</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Act of Settlement</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes the resolution of the House 
            of Commons on 19 December 2001 giving leave for the Introduction of 
            a Bill by Kevin McNamara MP, and to be supported by Alex Salmond MP, 
            which would abolish the deeply offensive anti-Catholic provisions 
            of the Act of Settlement; congratulates the sponsors of this proposed 
            Bill and is pleased that they have paid tribute to the Scottish Parliament 
            for its resolution of 16 December 1999 on this matter and to the <i>Guardian</i> 
            and <i>Scotland on Sunday</i> newspapers for actively promoting the 
            cause for repeal; regrets that Her Majesty's Government has taken 
            no action on this matter despite indicating general support, and renews 
            its call for UK legislation at the earliest possible date.</a></p>
