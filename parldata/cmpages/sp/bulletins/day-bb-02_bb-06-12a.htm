            code of practice for the sale of fireworks is frequently disregarded, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should do everything in 
            its power to tighten up on the regulations relating to the sale and 
            use of fireworks and, in particular, should review the powers available 
            to local authorities in respect of vendor licensing. </p>
