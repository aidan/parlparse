<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7814 Ian McKee: European Union Bill and Britain&rsquo;s Constitutional Future</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the UK Government&rsquo;s proposed European Union Bill, which would create a legal requirement for the UK to hold a referendum each time the European Union proposes a new treaty or an amendment to existing treaty provisions of a constitutional nature or makes provisions through ratchet clauses or passerelles; notes that, over the past 50 years, the EU has amended its treaties on a continuous basis; further notes that, if the UK Government decided to opt in to any policy field in the future, such as participating in a Europe-wide prosecuting authority, the proposed Bill would require it to hold a referendum; considers that the Bill has the potential to spark various referenda on issues of minor EU procedural or constitutional importance; observes that the UK Government&rsquo;s justification for the Bill is to allow the British people a say over their constitutional future; considers the Bill to be an exceptional example of Tory Eurosceptic paranoia and yet another act of Liberal Democrat betrayal, and believes that any political party genuinely concerned with giving citizens a say over their constitutional future should support a referendum on Scottish independence.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7813 Bill Kidd: Sick, Tired and Caring</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the report, <em>Sick, tired and caring</em>: <em>The impact of unpaid caring on health and long term conditions</em>, by Carers Scotland, which looks at the health of Scotland&rsquo;s carers, and is appalled at the findings that carers are more than twice as likely to have a long-term illness or disability as the rest of the population, that 96% of respondents said that caring had impacted negatively on their health and that almost half the carers, 42%, reported that their conditions had started after they began caring.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7812 Mary Scanlon: Castle Stuart Golf Links to Stage 2011 Scottish Open</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the European Tour to stage the 2011 Barclays Scottish Open Championship at Castle Stuart Golf Links; notes that Castle Stuart Golf Links will become the seventh Scottish course to host this prestigious tournament since 1972; warmly welcomes the revenue that this event will bring to the Highlands and the north-east coast of Scotland and the host of stars from the golfing world who will compete at the links course before moving on to the 140th Open Championship at Royal St George&rsquo;s in Kent; believes that the decision to hold the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart Golf Links underlines the high regard that the course is held in, having been voted Best New Course in 2009 by <em>Golf Magazine USA,</em> and looks forward to welcoming players and fans to the Highlands for what it considers is sure to be a great golfing occasion.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7811&diams;   Christine Grahame: Gatepost</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and values the work of Gatepost, the Scottish Farming Charity, which offers a confidential listening and support service for the farming and land-based community in Scotland; considers that life in farming, crofting and related industries can be very stressful and isolated with long hours and pressures that are hard to escape as work and home life are often intermingled; notes that the helpline is operated by trained staff who have a good understanding of these particular pressures, and congratulates Dr Maurice Hankey of Lauder on the recognition of his commitment to this service by the Scottish Countryside Alliance at its recent awards ceremony.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7808 Marlyn Glen: Hiroshima-Nagasaki Exhibition Comes to Dundee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the photographic exhibition, <em>Hiroshima-Nagasaki atomic bombings: 65 years on,</em> to the Wellgate Library, Dundee from 31 January 2011; congratulates Nuclear Free Local Authorities (NFLA) on its 30th anniversary and urges other local authorities to join the NFLA, which aims to increase local accountability over national nuclear policy, to identify the impact of national nuclear policy on communities and work to minimise nuclear hazards and increase public safety, and further urges them to display this timely reminder of the full horror and destructive power of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7807 Marilyn Livingstone: West Wemyss Monument to Local Heroes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 70th anniversary of the deaths of four men and a teenage boy who died while attempting to save West Wemyss from a drifting sea mine; understands that, on 23 January 1941, the mine, packed with 320lbs of high explosives, broke free of the moorings that it was anchored to as a defence against U-boats and other enemy shipping; notes that it was drifting toward the village seafront and nearby gas storage tanks; commends the fact that, together, they set off to Lady&rsquo;s Rock to try to protect the village, and, in case the mine drifted back out to sea, shipping that used the nearby harbours of Methil and Kirkcaldy; understands that two of the men and the teenage boy died instantly when it detonated, and commends the fact that, after a &pound;10,000 fundraising campaign, a monument has been unveiled to mark their heroism and that 350 people attended the ceremony and a service in their memory to commemorate their bravery seven decades later.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7806&diams;   Sarah Boyack: Edinburgh Employment Services Face Funding Cut</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with surprise and concern the unexpected decision by the Minister for Housing and Communities to cut support for highly-regarded specialist programmes, valued this year at &pound;2.238 million, to the Capital City Partnership; understands that this support assists 3,500 unemployed people per year; notes that this cut will hit what it sees as the most disadvantaged communities in the city, including unemployed school-leavers and priority groups such as people recovering from addiction and homeless people; notes also that it will impact on the Joined Up For Jobs strategy, which, it considers, has a strong record of partner agencies working together for maximum effectiveness; believes that Edinburgh is the only city in Scotland to have suffered such a cut and that there is no justification for singling out one city for this unfair treatment; would welcome, particularly at a time of recession, responsive local services for the unemployed being sustained, and believes that this funding should continue.</p>
