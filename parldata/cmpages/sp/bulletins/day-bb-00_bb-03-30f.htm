            <strong>HOLYROOD PROJECT</strong><br>
            <br>
            The Scottish Parliament Corporate Body reports to the Parliament as 
            follows:<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
            <br>
            1. This report is intended to help our colleagues in the Parliament 
            reach a view on the future of the Holyrood Project. The Corporate 
            Body was handed full responsibility for the Project on 1 June. But, 
            given the importance of the project to the people of Scotland as well 
            as MSPs and the many people who use a Parliament building, it is only 
            right that the Parliament as a whole takes this crucial decision. 
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            <br>
            Summary</strong><br>
            <br>
            2. The following summarises our views and in doing so responds to 
            the key points in John Spencely&#146;s report (which is attached at 
            <strong><a href="#1">Annexe 1</a></strong>). We take this opportunity to thank 
            him and his team for their hard work over the past 3 weeks.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Our principal conclusion is that, should the Parliament decide 
            to proceed with the Holyrood Project, it can be completed to latest 
            design (plans are attached at <a href="holy-05.htm"><strong>Annexe 2</strong></a> 
            &#150; there will be a full presentation to Members early next week); 
            and delivered within a total budget of £195m. The design and construction 
            teams have advised that the building can be completed, fitted and 
            commissioned by the end of 2002.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            4. Our report is aimed at addressing the concerns identified in the 
            Spencely Report and, perhaps more importantly, advising colleagues 
            on how we might best proceed from here with the Holyrood Project.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            5. In particular we accept the challenge laid down in Section 9 in 
            John Spencely&#146;s report. Specifically, </font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial">the brief for the project should now be finalised. 
              We have attempted since June to respond to the understandable demands 
              from Members, staff and others for appropriate facilities in the 
              new building. We have also had strong representation from Historic 
              Scotland and others on Queensberry House. This has resulted in significant 
              redesign, in particular, in the debating chamber. To meet the cost 
              and programme described above, this process must now be concluded.<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">the budget available is a matter for the Parliament. 
              If it accepts the estimate of £195m then the approved scheme design 
              &#150; which is very close to completion (and on which Members will 
              be briefed before the debate) &#150; will be delivered on the basis 
              of that budget.<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">we have considered very carefully John Spencely&#146;s 
              view that the project cannot be completed by the completion date 
              most recently reported to us ie the end of 2002. This depends entirely 
              on when our construction management team are given the go-ahead 
              to proceed on the basis of an approved scheme and budget. We would 
              aim to do so as quickly as possible after any vote to proceed with 
              Holyrood. And on that basis the clear target would be the end of 
              2002.<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">the management and direction of and communication 
              within the Project can be improved. In particular, we recommend 
              acceptance of John Spencely&#146;s proposal to establish a project 
              progressing committee to provide the time and expertise needed to 
              complete the Holyrood project.<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">we have already received assurances as to the 
              working arrangements between architects, engineers and surveyors 
              and to the arrangements for handling future, detailed design work.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Arial"> <br>
            6. Finally, we advise colleagues that our best estimate, drawing on 
            John Spencely&#146;s advice, is that the cost of cancelling Holyrood 
            would be a minimum of £25m, based on costs incurred of £30m and a 
            net site value of £2-6m. There is however in our view a significant 
            likelihood that this could be higher taking into account, in particular, 
            the risk of legal action to settle claims.<br>
            <br>
            7. It might be helpful to consider the original brief for the project.</font> 
          </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Arial"><br>
              <br>
              <i>&quot;The building the Scottish Parliament occupies must be of 
              such a quality, durability and civic importance as to reflect the 
              Parliament&#146;s status and operational needs; it must be secure 
              but also accessible to all including people with special needs; 
              it must promote modern and efficient ways of working and good environmental 
              practice.<br>
              <br>
              It will be an important symbol for Scotland. It should pay tribute 
              to the country&#146;s past achievement and signal its future aspirations. 
              It must be flexible enough to accommodate changes over time in operational 
              requirements. Quality and value for money are also key considerations. 
              The accommodation must allow Scottish Parliamentarians and their 
              staff to work efficiently harnessing the best of <br>
              modern technology<br>
              <br>
              People must be able to see and meet their elected representatives 
              and watch the Parliament in operation. Provision needs to be made 
              to permit easy reporting and broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings 
              so that people throughout Scotland can be aware of its work and 
              decisions. Historic surroundings should be respected and the design 
              should be integrated with surrounding landscape and urban <br>
              context&#133;&quot;</i></font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial"><br>
            <br>
            8. What is clear from this is the true client is the people of Scotland. 
            We must, above all, aim to meet their aspirations for this hugely 
            symbolic <br>
            project.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Looking back: June 1999 &#150; February 2000</strong><br>
            <br>
            9. As we approach this pivotal moment on the future of our Parliament 
            building, it is helpful to look back at how we have arrived at this 
            point taking into account advice from the project design team and 
            the key points in the Spencely report. On this basis, we will look 
            ahead at how the project should be handled should the Parliament decide 
            to proceed. When we first reported to Members on 9 June 1999, eight 
            days after taking responsibility for the project, the motion to establish 
            Committees had not yet been debated; the Official Report had only 
            reported 7 meetings of the Parliament and Introduction of the first 
            Bill was still almost 3 months away. Our responsibility was to translate 
            the Parliament&#146;s needs into reality. However, in June it was 
            not possible to have a full appreciation of those needs.<br>
            <br>
            10. The Parliament had approved a total budget for the project of 
            £109m. This included £62m plus £6m contingency for construction. It 
            also included a modest allowance for fit-out as well as fees and VAT. 
            We were aware that this budget did not include any risk allowances 
            though we had not established at the time exactly what they amounted 
            to. These are almost £16m which, together with &quot;enhancement&quot; 
            (an allowance for higher quality fixtures which might have been required), 
            gives a potential total construction cost of £89m.<br>
            <br>
            11. It may well have been possible for the project as it then stood 
            to have been completed for a figure in the region of £109m. At the 
            time we accepted the £62m construction component of this as a challenging 
            budget. But clearly it assumed very limited design changes and no 
            delays.<br>
            <br>
            12. Clearly there have been design changes and delays. Indeed we embarked 
            almost immediately after the debate &#150; during which considerable 
            concern was expressed on the subject &#150; on redesigning the Chamber. 
            It was clear to us that significant numbers of colleagues were unhappy 
            with the existing proposal. Given the critical importance of the chamber 
            to the Parliament we felt there was no option but to order a redesign. 
            The revised design reflects the express and practical needs of the 
            Parliament. The other principal issues which had to be addressed - 
            and which rendered the budget inadequate were redesigning the building 
            to meet the emerging needs of the Parliament and the unforeseen problems 
            of Queensberry House. These are all discussed in more detail below:<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            The emerging needs of the Parliament</strong><br>
            <br>
            12.1 It became apparent during the autumn that some elements of our 
            staffing provision were inadequate to meet the needs of MSPs, staff, 
            members of the public and the media. In particular, the workload of 
            Committees; the need to assist in the drafting of Members&#146; Bills; 
            research demands; IT support and the extent of the legislative programme 
            were among the pressures which led the Corporate Body to authorise 
            additional recruitment. At the same time Members and the political 
            parties were assessing the weight of their own duties and recruiting 
            staff accordingly. And the level of public interaction and media activity 
            (whilst, of course, welcome) was higher than anticipated. The design 
            team were consequently asked to consider how best to accommodate the 
            increased numbers. The total area has increased from 23,000 to over 
            30,000 square metres. Despite this, the costs per square metre of 
            the building have however remained relatively static.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            Queensberry House</strong><br>
            <br>
            12.2 Our initial information about the condition of Queensberry House 
            was contained in a report commissioned from Simpson and Brown<strong> <font size="2">(<small><small><small><small>1</small></small></small></small>)</font></strong> 
            <small><small><small><font size="3">For the Secretary of State for 
            Scotland, December 1997</font></small></small></small><font size="3"> 
            which concluded that the House was in a fundamentally sound condition. 
            However, furthermore detailed investigations by the design team revealed 
            that the structural condition was actually not sound. The essential 
            remedial works doubled to £9.4m and an enhanced contingency of £1.4m 
            was required due to the continuing uncertainty on the building condition. 
            It later became clear that the original use envisaged for the House 
            (and in particular the ground floor) would not be acceptable to Historic 
            Scotland and designs required to be re-worked accordingly.</font><br>

            <br>
            <strong><br>
            Cost control</strong><br>
            <br>
            13. Trying to deal with costs has been a constant and consistent issue 
            for the Corporate Body. In total, 11 cost reports have been compiled 
            on the project &#150; 8 of these were for the Scottish Office when 
            it was responsible for the Project. We have had 3 including a major 
            value engineering exercise in the autumn &#150; which produced savings 
            of £13m. The most recent was set in train in February this year. As 
            a result of that report &#150; which projected a possible building 
            cost of £125m &#150; we took the view that Parliament must be alerted 
            to the facts and commissioned the Spencely Report to assist in that 
            process.<br>
            <br>
            14. It is important to stress that &#150; thanks in no small measure 
            to the skill and dedication of those working on the Project - the 
            project has developed considerably &#150; and positively &#150; since 
            June 1999 to the point that it will meet the practical needs of the 
            Parliament and could move forward to the next phase. Some illustrative 
            material associated with the revised design is at <a href="holy-05.htm"><strong>Annexe 
            2</strong></a>.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            The Spencely Report</strong><br>
            <br>
            15. The re-design which had been undertaken took the project outwith 
            the boundaries of the June budget and programme estimate. A 30,000 
            square metre building cannot be delivered for the same cost as a 23,000 
            square metre one without seriously compromising on quality and the 
            time dedicated to re-design clearly diverted the Design Team from 
            their planned programme of work. We therefore sought to draw together 
            the detailed work on costings, (including the results of the most 
            recent cost-reduction exercise) and programme in order to enable us 
            to re-evaluate the required budget and time to completion before presenting 
            these to Parliament.<br>
            <br>
            16. Given that the costs and programme were significantly different 
            from those we were handed in June 1999, we recognised that an independent 
            assessment of these estimates would provide additional reassurance 
            to members and for that reason retained John Spencely to provide independent 
            information about cost and timescale. We are indebted to Mr Spencely 
            and his team for their endeavours to get to grips with the complexities 
            of the project and for delivering their report within what was a very 
            constrained timescale.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            Looking forward: February 2000 onwards</strong><br>
            <br>
            17. We hope it will be most useful to colleagues to address this primarily 
            by reference to the key points in the Spencely report on cost, programme 
            and management. We accept John Spencely&#146;s essential point that 
            the approved budget must relate to the brief and, perhaps more importantly, 
            to the scheme design. Indeed the intention behind taking stock and 
            consulting the Parliament is to enable these to be reconsidered.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            The brief</strong><br>
            <br>
            18. The basic brief is that signed off by the Scottish Office in November 
            1998. Clearly things have moved on a great deal since then and, as 
            reported earlier, the needs of the Parliament have changed significantly 
            since last summer once the Parliament was up and running. Revisions 
            have been produced to the brief to reflect these new demands though 
            in some instances &#150; the debating chamber in particular &#150; 
            the design team was asked to redesign within the terms of the existing 
            brief.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            The scheme design</strong><br>
            <br>
            19. This now fundamentally meets the requirements of the Parliament 
            as described in the original brief and the various amendments produced 
            since 1998. But it has yet formally to be approved, as John Spencely 
            notes. It must be if we are to proceed and complete the project to 
            an agreed cost and timescale. Members will be briefed on the current 
            scheme design before the debate on 5 April. If the Parliament decides 
            to proceed, we will aim to sign off the scheme design as quickly as 
            possible thereafter. The design team have assured us that the remaining 
            detailed working will be completed in time for a scheme design to 
            be submitted by the end of April.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            Approved budget</strong><br>
            <br>
            20. The current approved budget is £109m &#150; which implies a construction 
            cost of £62m (plus contingency of £6m). John Spencely is therefore 
            absolutely correct to say it bears no relation to the brief or current 
            scheme design. The cost report we received in February suggested a 
            construction cost of £125m. In section 4 of his report, John Spencely 
            projects a construction cost of £126m. He translates this into a total 
            cost of £230m. Apart from fees, VAT and contingency &#150; all of 
            which we agree must form part of the total budget &#150; he includes 
            inflation. It is not common practice to include a separate inflation 
            allowance in government building procurement as all calculations are 
            made in cash terms to allow direct comparisons. We believe this is 
            the correct approach in relation to the Parliament building.<br>
            <br>
            21. John Spencely goes on to conclude that savings of the order of 
            15%-20% can be made. This would produce a construction cost of £110-£115m 
            and a total cost of £185 to £196m (assuming VAT on fees is recovered). 
            We had already instigated a parallel exercise, prior to appointing 
            John Spencely, which has separately concluded that a construction 
            cost of £108 is achievable. Depending on the level of contingency, 
            this produces a total cost in the range of £190m to £195m. Included 
            within this total cost is a fit-out budget of £19m. The Spencely Report 
            endorses this figure.<br>
            <br>
            22. Parliament is invited to determine whether it wishes the Holyrood 
            Project to proceed on a revised budget of £195m. <a href="#3"><strong>Annexe 
            3</strong></a> describes how the current approved budget of £109m moved 
            to £195 and gives a breakdown of that estimate. The Parliament must, 
            of course, decide whether it is prepared to proceed on that basis. 
            If it did, brief, design and approved budget would be consistent.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            Programme</strong><br>
            <br>
            23. A great deal has already been achieved on the site. All the permanent 
            piling for the car park is completed; 12,000 cubic metres of concrete 
            has been poured to form the car park floor area and the columns supporting 
            the floor area above the car park. And the superstructure for the 
            MSP block is under construction off-site. <br>
            <br>
            24. Mr Spencely&#146;s reservations as to the expected completion 
            date of the project have been carefully considered. We understand 
            that this view was arrived at on the basis of a number of assumptions, 
            one of which was the cessation of all project activity for a period 
            of 3 months. We have received assurances from the construction manager 
            and the design team that the building will be completed by the end 
            of 2002. We accept the reassurances but we take seriously John Spencely&#146;s 
            views. We cannot in reality give an absolute commitment until we have 
            signed off the scheme. Once we do so, we would report again to colleagues 
            with a firm commitment.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            Quality and Value for money</strong><br>
            <br>
            25. Both are paramount. But it is especially important to deliver 
            on quality in the areas which will be used by the public, in particular 
            the Chamber and Committee rooms and main foyer. Considerable work 
            has been undertaken by our Quantity Surveyor in considering comparisons 
            with similar buildings and we are satisfied that we areworking within 
            reasonable estimates for the quality and size of building which is 
            envisaged. We note Mr Spencely&#146;s comparison with Portcullis House 
            in this context which is costing more than £1,000 per m² more than 
            the MSP block. <br>
            <br>
            26. Conscious of the need to achieve good value for money and in line 
            with EU procurement rules we have sought to source materials on a 
            global basis but wherever possible would hope to contract the manufacturing 
            work to Scottish companies.<br>
            <br>
            27. Throughout this process we have engaged with the Royal Fine Art 
            Commission for Scotland; the City of Edinburgh Council; Historic Scotland 
            and similar organisations with a proper interest in the quality of 
            the building. The project has been well received by all these bodies 
            and we have satisfied them that the building is a fitting design for 
            its location. Any fundamental compromise on quality would not be acceptable 
            to these parties.<br>
            <br>
            28. We note the Spencely Report&#146;s recommendation in relation 
            to Queensberry House and understand and concur with its conclusions 
            on the expense involved. However, mindful of the historic importance 
            of the House and the role it plays in integrating the design with 
            its historic surroundings and urban landscape, as required by the 
            original brief, we believe that it is right to proceed as planned.<br>
            <br>
            29. It is usual, as the design is being finalised, for this stage 
            in the design process to involve the Design Team and construction 
            manager in a rigorous process of simplification, design refinement 
            and improvement. This is now taking place and our own Quantity Surveyors 
            have confirmed that cost reductions consistent with a final cost of 
            £195m can be achieved without reducing the fundamental quality, in 
            line with Mr Spencely&#146;s observations. <br>
            <br>
            Contractual methods<br>
            <br>
            30. The construction management approach &#150; which John Spencely 
            explains in chapter 7 of his report and commends &#150; has enabled 
            significant progress to be made on site notwithstanding the continued 
            development of the final design. We accept that the established method 
            offers us the flexibility to deliver each element of the building 
            at the best possible time and at the best possible price thereby contributing 
            to the achievement of the overall agreed programme and budget. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            Communication and management issues</strong><br>
            <br>
            31. John Spencely notes that all conventional mechanisms for project 
            management are in place. But he criticises some aspects, especially 
            communication and makes suggestions on future management. We accept 
            that these matters should be addressed. Specifically, on management, 
            we accept the case for a group which has the time and expertise available 
            to it in taking forward the project. The SPCB cannot - indeed does 
            not wish &#150; to divest itself of ultimate responsibility for Holyrood. 
            But, we would remit day-to-day responsibility for the project to a 
            progressing group.<br>
            <br>
            32. While we regard working arrangements within the team as a matter 
            for them alone, we understand &#150; in relation to John Spencely&#146;s 
            specific recommendation - that the overwhelming majority of work at 
            the next stage will be undertaken in Edinburgh. On that basis we are 
            satisfied with the manner in which the Design Team (architect, construction 
            manager and Quantity Surveyor) are now functioning.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            Fees</strong><br>
            <br>
            33. As Mr Spencely says, the fee agreement with the design team was 
            entered into on the basis of a £50m project. In line with normal practice, 
            negotiations will be entered into with each commissioned consultant 
            if the building costs increase to the levels now estimated.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            Cancellation costs</strong><br>
            <br>
            34. We note the Spencely report&#146;s comments on the current market 
            value of the Holyrood site based on the valuations of the Chief Valuer 
            for Scotland. These indicate that the market value might be of the 
            order of £2m -£6m (his &quot;Scenario 2&quot;) on the assumption that 
            £11m plus fees etc is spent on Queensberry House. This is in line 
            with our current plans and therefore seems to us most realistic.<br>
            <br>
            35. As Mr Spencely says, it is impossible to quantify the costs of 
            termination with any degree of precision. This is one area in which 
            it is impossible to cap costs and where taking risks can be very costly. 
            We believe therefore that the net cost of cancellation of Holyrood 
            would be upward of £25m. That is the £30m spent or committed to date 
            less, say, £5m site value. If we were budgeting for this cost, it 
            would be significantly more than £25m.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            Remaining in the current &#145;temporary&#146; accommodation</strong><br>
            <br>
            36. The accommodation on the Mound was acquired and fitted out specifically 
            to serve the Parliament for 2-3 years. The Parliament&#146;s temporary 
            accommodation at the Mound and George IV Bridge is on short-term leases 
            from the Church of Scotland and the City of Edinburgh Council. It 
            is clear that longer term occupation &#150; even assuming the owners 
            agreed to extend the leases &#150; would involve significant expenditure.<br>
            <br>
            37. There are significant statutory barriers to long-term occupation 
            (e.g. fire, building control, asbestos, disabled access) and remedial 
            works on these would be costly. Experience has shown that office standards 
            are inadequate and the dispersal of staff across several streets (and 
            7 buildings) is very inefficient.<br>
            <br>
            38. The provision for public participation is particularly poor. We 
            cannot accommodate all those who wish to see Committees in action 
            and there is a similar problem in relation to the media whose attendance 
            is often rationed. Catering facilities are non-existent for visitors 
            and there are very virtually no facilities where Members can hold 
            private conversations with constituents.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            Conclusion</strong><br>
            <br>
            39. It is now a matter for the Parliament&#146;s own judgement and 
            the SPCB has set out the means to complete the project with costs.<br>

            <br>
            1.1 I was appointed by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body on 
            25 February 2000, in accordance with the Terms of Reference 1 - 5 
            as set out in section 2 below, to report by 27 March 2000. Terms of 
            Reference 6 and 7 were added during the course of the Review and I 
            was also asked to make recommendations under all Terms of Reference 
            and to consider options for future action as I thought fit. This is 
            my Report.<br>
            <br>
            1.2 I appointed, with the Corporate Body&#146;s consent, Neil G Thomson 
            Chartered Quantity Surveyor and Robert B Wilson Chartered Architect 
            and Director of Estates of the University of Glasgow as my Advisers. 
            <br>
            <br>
            1.3 My Review has been carried out over a three week period by me 
            and my two Advisers. We have interviewed each member of the Corporate 
            Body, members of the Project Team and the Design Team and representatives 
            of the Construction Manager, all of whom have been very helpful. We 
            have been given access to reports and minutes of some Project and 
            other meetings and have inspected the work in progress in the Architect&#146;s 
            Edinburgh office and on site.<br>
            <br>
            1.4 I am conscious that, in the very short time available, my appreciation 
            of the detail of the Project can only be a fraction of that held by 
            those who have been involved for the past two years or so. Nevertheless 
            my Advisers and I have independently each come to similar conclusions 
            as to the condition of the Project. These conclusions form the basis 
            of my Report. <br>
            <br>
            1.5 The creation of a building to house the Nation&#146;s Parliament 
            is a great enterprise. Those engaged in bringing this Project to fruition 
            are working in a situation and on a building which are unavoidably 
            more complicated than most, if not all, have ever experienced. Little 
            in their previous experience can have prepared them for this task. 
            We found an enthusiasm and dedication to the project at all levels, 
            tempered somewhat by the stresses and strains of recent events. <br>
            <br>
            1.6 Nevertheless my appointment by the Corporate Body indicated that 
            all might not be well with the Project and my Review confirms this. 
            <br>
            <br>
            1.7 It would have been impossible for me to have fulfilled my Terms 
            of Reference without the help of the Valuation Office Agency on whose 
            professional advice I have relied in respect of the site value and 
            the Construction Manager on whose programming skills I have relied 
            on in assessing a likely completion date.<br>
            <br>
            1.8 I owe special thanks to my Advisers without whose skilled assistance 
            my task would have been impossible and to whom I am accordingly greatly 
            indebted. <br>
            <br>
            1.9 In this Report, the &quot;Client&quot; means the Scottish Parliamentary 
            Corporate Body; the &quot;Project Team&quot; means the Client&#146;s 
            Project Sponsor, Project Managers and their team; the &quot;Design 
            Team&quot; means the Architect, the Engineers, the Quantity Surveyor 
            and other design consultants; the &quot;Construction Manager&quot; 
            means Bovis.<br>
            <br>
            1.10 My Report is provided to the Corporate Body to assist with its 
            review of the Holyrood Project. The estimates for the building and 
            fit-out costs have been provided by, or derived from information provided 
            by, the Quantity Surveyor and the Project Team. The expenditure figures 
            have been provided by the Project Team. I have not independently measured 
            the area of the building. I have not made any independent estimates 
            of, nor made market enquiries about, building or fit-out costs. I 
            have not made any independent check of the expenditure figures.<br>
            <br>
            1.11 My views on the scope for potential changes to the costs of the 
            building and fit-out are based on my understanding of the current 
            proposals of the Design Team and the Project Team. <br>
            <br>
            1.12 The actual potential for real and achievable changes is a matter 
            for the Project Team and the Design Team based on their knowledge 
            of the Project. Any confirmation of the budget or establishment of

          <p><font face="Arial"><strong><a name="i3"></a>3 The Chronology of the 
            Project</strong><br>
            <br>
            3.1 The Holyrood site was selected in January 1998.<br>
            <br>
            3.2 The Brief was produced in April 1998.<br>
            <br>
            3.3 The Architect was appointed in July 1998.<br>
            <br>
            3.4 The Architect&#146;s Outline Proposals were presented to the Client 
            in October 1998. <br>
            <br>
            3.5 The Brief was revised by the Client during the Outline Proposals 
            work stage.<br>
            <br>
            3.6 The Architect&#146;s Scheme Design, which accommodated the changes 
            to the Client&#146;s Brief, was presented to the Client in March <br>
            1999. <br>
            <br>
            3.7 Responsibility as Client for the project passed from the Secretary 
            of State of Scotland to the Scottish Parliament on 1 June 1999. <br>
            <br>
            3.8 On 17 June 1999, the Scottish Parliament agreed the following 
            motion:</font></p>
          <blockquote> <font face="Arial"> <i>That the Parliament endorses the 
            decision to provide its permanent home on the Holyrood site and authorises 
            the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to take forward the project 
            in accordance with the plans developed by the EBMT/RMJM design team 
            and within the timescale and costs estimates described in the Presiding 
            Officer&#146;s note to members of 9 June 1999.</i></font></blockquote>
          <font face="Arial"> 3.9 The Scheme Design was never approved by the 
          Client but the Design Team was instructed to proceed with detailed design 
          in July 1999.<br>
          <br>
          3.10 A value engineering (cost reduction) exercise was carried out in 
          the summer and autumn 1999 by the Design Team. In October 1999 the Design 
          Team was instructed by the Client to change the shape of the Debating 
          Chamber and did so.<br>
          <br>
          3.11 In November 1999 the Design Team was instructed by the Client to 
          implement some of the potential design changes identified in the value 
          engineering exercise, and to carry out a feasibility study on accommodating 
          203 additional staff.<br>
          <br>
          3.12 In February 2000 the Design Team reported on the changes to the 
          design necessary to accommodate the additional staff. <br>
          <br>
          3.13 In March 2000, after the commencement of my Review, the Design 
          Team was instructed by the Client to investigate the potential for reducing 
          the size of the building and the quality of the specification in order 
          to reduce the cost of the building.</font>

            <a name="4"></a>4 Review of the current estimates of cost</strong> 
            <br>
            <br>
            4.1 This section reviews the history of cost reporting for the Project 
            and provides, at paragraph 4.5 below, an estimate of the cost of the 
            Project as I believe it actually stood in February 2000. <br>
            <br>
            Costs have been reported throughout this Project under two main headings:</font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial">basic construction cost </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">fit-out and other costs<br>
              <br>
              </font> </li>
          </ul>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The fit-out cost and other costs 
            includes professional fees, VAT, site acquisition costs, demolition 
            and furniture, fittings and other <br>
            equipment not included in the basic construction cost.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            4.2 The basic construction cost</strong><br>
            <br>
            4.2.1 10 separate cost reports, from the original site comparison 
            cost completed in December 1997 to the last feasibility cost check 
            <br>
            on the plans current as at February 2000, have been produced by the 
            Quantity Surveyor. A value engineering exercise carried out in <br>
            the summer and autumn of 1999 by the Design Team culminated in a report 
            submitted to the Project Sponsor in October 1999.<br>
            <br>
            4.2.2 These cost reports have been examined and the level of drawing 
            and specification information available at each stage for <br>
            costing has been established in discussion with the Quantity Surveyor.<br>
            <br>
            4.2.3 The following table has been produced in order to plot the movement 
            of the basic building cost over the last two years. A <br>
            commentary follows.</font></p>

            <br>
            4.3.1 The first cost estimate produced was part of the cost comparison 
            of Holyrood with other sites. It was based on a notional design produced 
            in December 1997. The basic construction cost was estimated at approximately 
            £50 million for a gross building area of 20,070m2. The balance area 
            (for circulation, plant rooms etc) used in the brief calculation was 
            20% of net area; this has proved to be an underestimate.<br>
            <br>
            4.3.2 Once the design team was appointed yardstick costs were produced 
            by the Quantity Surveyor based on average rates for the different 
            types of accommodation and in October 1998 a new cost estimate of 
            £58.9 million was produced.<br>
            <br>
            4.3.3 The winning concept design was developed in more detail over 
            the next 6 months, culminating in the Stage D cost estimate of 25 
            May 1999 of £89.2 million for a gross floor area of 27,081 m2 (including 
            approximately 40% balance area). <br>
            <br>
            4.3.4 An amended budget of £62 million was approved in June 1999 based 
            on this estimate. This excluded the design risk assessment (i.e. design 
            uncertainty) and other costs totalling £27.04 million which had been 
            included in the £89.2 million estimate but which were not identified 
            in cost terms in the report to the Client.<br>
            <br>
            4.3.5 Area and cost estimates produced in August and September 1999 
            showed a substantial increase in gross floor area to 31,121 m2 and 
            a rise in the basic construction cost to £115 million. <br>
            <br>
            4.3.6 The value engineering exercise was conducted with the target 
            of achieving 25% savings. Potential reductions of £20 million in the 
            basic construction cost were identified of which £13.3 million were 
            accepted by the Client. <br>
            <br>
            4.3.7 The area and cost estimates produced by the Quantity Surveyor 
            in February 2000 showed a further rise to a basic construction cost 
            of £138.49 million for 31,310 m2 gross floor area. These estimates 
            were based on the Feasibility Study prepared by the Design Team to 
            show how 203 additional staff could be accommodated. The reliability 
            of the cost estimate is uncertain, in my opinion, due to the short 
            time within which it was made and the limited information on which 
            it was based. Although the total gross area was only up by 200 m2 
            from the September 1999 figure, the (expensive) building area was 
            actually increased by 2,250 m2 partially balanced by <br>
            a reduction of (cheaper) car park area by 2,061 m2.<br>
            <br>
            4.3.8 The effect of the changes to the Brief is that, in my opinion, 
            the Project design is less settled than it was in March 1999 and that 
            the estimate for the basic construction cost is less reliable than 
            it was in May 1999. <br>

            <br>
            4.4.1 In the latest report of February 2000 from the Quantity Surveyor

            into the estimate of total budget requirements in section 4.5 below.<br>
            <br>
            4.4.5 The base date used by the Quantity Surveyor for estimating basic 
            construction costs is March 1998. Cost estimates have to be adjusted 
            for the effects of inflation from then to the tender dates for the 
            various work packages so that the estimates may more closely reflect 
            what may happen to tender prices. Such adjustments have not so far 
            been applied to the cost estimates for this project. This Report does 
            so.<br>
            <br>
            4.4.6 Any prediction for future inflation is naturally uncertain. 
            In the assessment of future costs contained in this Review, the Building 
            Cost Information Service indices <br>
            produced under the auspices of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
            Surveyors have been used. This produces a figure of 5% building inflation 
            from March 1998 to October 2001 which has been applied to the construction 
            cost in the estimate of total budget requirements below. <br>
            <br>
            4.4.7 The site staff and accommodation costs of the Construction Manager 
            for any period beyond January 2002 have not so far been included in 
            any cost report. This Report does so.</font></p>

            5.4 It is clearly imperative that the Brief is frozen now and that 
            the Design Team proceeds immediately to produce a Scheme Design including 
            a cost plan to a Brief and a budget approved by the Client, so that 
            approval may be given to proceed with the Project by 8 June 2000, 
            or earlier if that is possible. Removal of the current uncertainties 
            and a reduction in the overall Project cost could result in an earlier 
            date for delivery and occupation. These are matters for consideration 
            by the Client and the Project Team.<br>

            5.5 The MSP Block is programmed for completion in June-July 2002 and 
            Queensberry House in March-April 2003. I recommend that the Client 
            should consider taking <br>
            occupation of these two buildings in advance of the final project 
            completion date, for three reasons. They would otherwise lie unoccupied 
            which is bad for buildings; current MSPs would be able to occupy their 
            office accommodation before the next election; and the overall capital 
            cost of the project would be reduced by relieving the project of the 
            Construction Manager&#146;s costs for maintaining the buildings unused 
            for up to 18 months. The resulting saving would accrue to the Client. 
            Early occupation would require the current location of the main plant 
            to be reconsidered, but I am advised that this would not be an insurmountable 
            problem.<br>

            It will be noted that the MSP Block is estimated by the Quantity Surveyor 
            at a rate which is twice as expensive as an equivalent Headquarters 
            Building in Edinburgh, but about 75% of the cost of Portcullis House.

            6.2.3 Queensberry House provides office accommodation for the Presiding

            an equivalent project for comparison. It will however be noted that 
            it is the most expensive part of the project, albeit the smallest, 
            and that it is nearly as expensive as Portcullis House. <br>
            <br>
            6.2.4 The Assembly/Debating Chamber provides meeting rooms for the 
            committees of the Parliament, the Debating Chamber and support accommodation. 
            I have not found an exactly equivalent building in the UK and have 
            accordingly chosen to compare it with the newly completed Museum of 
            Scotland, simply because this is also a complex city centre building 
            with demanding structural and servicing requirements.<br>

            6.3.4 The repairs and restoration element is clearly a considerable 
            burden on this part of the project. In my opinion, the rate for the 
            services is unusually high and would be worth reviewing and the design 
            and specification reconsidered.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>6.4 Overall value for money</strong><br>
            <br>
            6.4.1 Value for money is in the eye of the beholder; in this case, 
            the Nation as expressed through the collective voice of Parliament 
            in debate. <br>
            <br>
            6.4.2 If the current estimate of the Project cost, at £230.86 million 
            or thereby (see section 4.5.1 above), is accepted as accurate and 
            affordable, then no more need be said by me.<br>
            <br>
            6.4.3 However, if Parliament were to decide that this is too great 
            a price to pay, but that the Project should proceed, then it may wish 
            to authorise a lesser sum on the Project. <br>
            <br>
            6.4.4 I would counsel against setting cost limits on individual buildings. 
            The current design proposals for many parts of the Project have, I 
            consider, potential for reductions, and to set precise limits would 
            place unhelpful restrictions on the Project Team and disadvantage 
            the Project. I recommend that Parliament should go no further than 
            setting a limit for the Project as a whole and some guidance is given 
            in section 8 below.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><br>
            6.5 Building area and overall quality</strong><br>
            <br>
            6.5.1 Turning now to the building, as opposed to the Project as a 
            whole, I observe that cost is the product of building area and building 
            quality. And that value for money is the perception of what one is 
            getting for one&#146;s money in absolute and relative terms. It is 
            possible to reduce the cost of a building by making it smaller and/or 
            by reducing the quality of materials and the quality and extent of 
            the built-in services and fit-out required for creature comfort and 
            support to the occupants. <br>
            <br>
            6.5.2 Whatever quality is now thought to be appropriate in the light 
            of the reported costs, the Design Team has been working to meet the 
            requirement that &quot;the building which the Scottish Parliament 
            occupies must be of such a quality, durability and civic importance 
            as to reflect the Parliament&#146;s status and operational requirements&quot; 
            and that must clearly be kept in mind if costs are to be reduced. 
            <br>
            <br>
            6.5.3 The area of the building is a consequence of the number of people 
            working in the building and of the functions which they have to perform. 
            This is of course a matter for the Client.<br>
            <br>
            6.5.4 On the assumption that staff displaced by reducing the size 
            of the buildings have to be housed elsewhere, the Client may wish 
            to consider, before taking a decision on size reduction, where they 
            would be housed and at what capital cost, if any.<br>
            <br>
            6.5.5 Furthermore, it is the experience of all organisations, old 
            and new, that moving into a new building usually reveals that more 
            space is needed than had been <br>
            anticipated. It would, in my opinion, be imprudent to reduce the area 
            below the maximum that the site can contain, if this can be afforded. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            6.6 Changing the site</strong><br>
            <br>
            6.6.1 I have considered whether or not a change of site for the Project 
            would be productive of savings in the present design. I have not considered 
            the merits of other sites. <br>
            This was not in my terms of reference. However the present state of 
            the Project has nothing, in my opinion, to do with the location of 
            the site. <br>
            <br>
            6.6.2 Changing the site would mean starting again. A new brief would 
            be required as the precursor to a new design. The present design could 
            not, in my opinion, be <br>
            transplanted unchanged. Time would be lost and this would cost money. 
            The money invested in the Project to date would be largely thrown 
            away. <br>
            <br>
            6.6.3 For these reasons and on the basis of the information currently 
            available to me, I consider that there would be no advantage in moving 
            this design to another site.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            6.7 Queensberry House</strong><br>
            <br>
            6.7.1 In my opinion, the expenditure on Queensberry House, at an estimated 
            £10 - £11 million, is not value for money when compared with the benefit 
            gained. On the <br>
            information available to me, the building is in poor structural and 
            physical condition. In my opinion, the interior contains little of 
            architectural (as opposed to archaelogical) <br>
            value and the interior spaces are neither grand nor memorable. The 
            current design requires removing most of the fabric of the building, 
            and creating a conjectural 17th century <br>
            external appearance built around extensively repaired external walls. 
            The construction will be largely 21st century.<br>
            <br>
            6.7.2 This is, in my opinion, an inappropriate approach to providing 
            Parliamentary accommodation, which can in any case only be achieved 
            at great expense in this building. It would, in my opinion, be more 
            appropriate and cost effective to provide the accommodation within 
            a building clearly of the 21st century.<br>
            <br>
            6.7.3 Nevertheless, the current approach may be considered essential 
            and I appreciate that the design and design approval processes may 
            have reached a stage of finality which to undo might cause real harm 
            to the programme. If this is the case, the same effect could be achieved 
            at lesser cost by building anew from new foundations and I recommend 
            that this be done.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            6.8 The MSP Block</strong><br>
            <br>
            6.8.1 In my opinion, the cost of the facades of the MSP block could 
            be reduced by simplifying the design. This would also make the facades 
            easier to build and reduce the frequency of maintenance, without compromising 
            the integrity of the architectural design. I recommend that this be 
            done. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><br>
            6.9 Other issues</strong><br>
            <br>
            6.9.1 It has not been possible to review the value for money of other 
            elements of the Project within the time available. It will be clear 
            from the tabular comparisons contained in sections 6.2 &#150; 6.3 
            above that there are significant variances from the costs of elements 
            of other comparable buildings and I recommend that these should be 
            borne in mind by the Client and the Design Team. <br>
            <br>
            6.9.2 The terms of the agreements between the various members of the 
            Design Team and the Client and between the Construction Manager and 
            the Client are commercially confidential. I have studied them, but 
            as they are conventional, I do not think it necessary to subject them 
            to analysis in this review. <br>
            <br>
            6.9.3 I do however observe that they were entered into on the basis 
            of a £50 million project. No doubt, had it been appreciated at the 
            time of entering into these contracts that the building costs might 
            increase to the levels now estimated, other terms might have been 
            agreed and the Parties may wish to consider this matter.<br>

            <a name="7"></a>7 Review and comparison of the advantages of alternative contractual 
            methods</strong> <br>
            <br>
            7.1 This section is about alternative contractual arrangements for 
            the building works. It is not about alternative methods of funding 
            the capital required for the Holyrood Project, which I have not been 
            asked to consider and which are, in my opinion, irrelevant to the 
            present situation.<br>
            <br>
            7.2 The current contractual arrangement, which was selected before 
            the Design Team was appointed but confirmed as appropriate by the 
            Design Team, is as follows:</font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial">The building works are divided into a series 
              of individual &quot;works packages&quot;, each for a recognisable 
              element, such as &quot;foundations&quot;, &quot;frame&quot;, &quot;electrical 
              services&quot;, etc.<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">Each is put out to the market at the appropriate 
              moment, for suitable contractors to tender competitively. The most 
              economical is accepted and the work in that package proceeds. A 
              number of work packages will be in progress on site at any one time. 
              Clearly the work of individual work package contractors has to be 
              coordinated. A Construction Manager (Bovis) is employed by the Client 
              to do this.<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">Each work package contractor is contracted 
              to the Client to carry out and complete his package in accordance 
              with the relevant drawings and specification.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <font face="Arial"><br>
          <br>
          7.3 This contractual arrangement may be contrasted with the &quot;single 
          stage lump sum building contract&quot;, by which the carrying out and 
          completion of the entire building works are entrusted by the client 
          to a single &quot;main contractor&quot;. The main contractor may (if 
          he so wishes and as would be normal) subcontract part or most of the 
          works to subcontractors. In this case, the main contractor and not the 
          subcontractor is responsible to the Client for carrying out and completing 
          the works in accordance with the drawings and specification. The main 
          contractor coordinates his own work with that of each of his subcontractors.<br>
          <br>
          7.4 The principal reason for preferring the &quot;construction management&quot; 
          over the &quot;single stage lump sum&quot; contract is that the former 
          does not require the entire work for the whole building to be designed 
          and specified before any one &quot;trade package&quot; is let, whereas 
          the latter does.<br>
          <br>
          7.5 Other things being equal, a building project will be completed earlier 
          by using the &quot;construction management&quot; method because building 
          can start earlier.<br>
          <br>
          7.6 Subsidiary advantages of the &quot;construction management&quot; 
          method are as follows:</font> 
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial">The construction manager is engaged before 
              any building work starts and while design work is still in progress. 
              The Design Team can accordingly use his expertise in building techniques 
              to inform their detailed construction decisions, and his expertise 
              in programming construction operations to inform the selection of 
              appropriate work packages and the timing of design decisions.<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">Because each work package is tendered separately 
              in a logical progression, any variance from the budget for a particular 
              work package can be compensated by increasing or reducing the content 
              of subsequent packages. This can provide a welcome degree of flexibility 
              to the Client and Design Team, albeit that this will diminish with 
              each successive work package.<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">Furthermore, as each work package is tendered 
              separately, advantage of market conditions for each can be obtained 
              at the time it is tendered.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Arial"><br>
            <br>
            7.7 The advantages and disadvantages, by comparison, of the &quot;single 
            stage lump sum contract&quot; are a mirror image. </font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial">In place of a speedier start on site, leading 
              to an earlier completion, the client obtains a greater degree of 
              cost certainty.<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">In place of separate contracts with each trade 
              package contractor, the client obtains a single point of responsibility 
              with the main contractor.<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">In place of the market price for each trade 
              package, the client has to pay the main contractor&#146;s price 
              which is the aggregate of the cost of his own work and whatever 
              price he places on the work of his sub-contractors. The client does 
              not know what the subcontractor is being paid. In a fierce market 
              place, potential subcontractors may be subjected to a dutch auction, 
              forcing down their prices to the advantage of the main contractor. 
              The client will not benefit from the dutch auction but may suffer 
              from a reduced quality of management and workmanship by the subcontractor.</font> 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <font face="Arial"><br>
          <br>
          7.8 There are several contractual variants between the poles of &quot;construction 
          management&quot; and a &quot;single stage lump sum contract&quot; which 
          are not, in my opinion, relevant in the present circumstances. The question 
          which I therefore consider is whether it is advisable to change from 
          the present &quot;construction management&quot; method to a &quot;single 
          stage lump sum contract&quot;.<br>
          <br>
          7.9 A necessary precondition for a &quot;single stage lump sum contract&quot; 
          is a completed set of production information drawings and specification 
          before tenders for the works as a single package are obtained. I consider 
          the consequence of waiting for a completed set would be considerable 
          delay to the start, and therefore to the completion of the works.<br>
          <br>
          7.10 The Project would lose the benefit of the expertise provided by 
          the present construction manager, and the knowledge of the Project which 
          he has accumulated since he was appointed in 1998.<br>
          <br>
          7.11 Accordingly, I recommend that the contractual arrangements should 
          not be changed.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong><a name="8"></a>8 Review of the effect on cost and delivery 
          of a reduced specification </strong><br>
          <br>
          8.1 To reduce the settled specification for a project is to make a change. 
          Any change to a project has the potential to cause confusion (which 
          may lead to design error and/or uncoordinated design), delay and additional 
          cost. Most architects have had the experience of seeing changes instructed 
          to save money turning out unexpectedly to increase costs.<br>
          <br>
          8.2 The timing of change is therefore critical.<br>
          <br>
          8.3 In the Plan of Work adopted for this Project, the design programme 
          is divided into five work stages as follows:<br>
          <br>
          Briefing<br>
          Outline Proposals<br>
          Scheme Design<br>
          Detailed Design<br>
          Production Information<br>
          <br>
          8.4 In my opinion, this Project has not reached the end of Scheme Design. 
          Consequently, a reduced specification of materials should have the effect 
          of reducing cost more than the additional cost which might arise from 
          delay to the Project. Reducing the specification should, if it leads 
          to a simplification of the design of the building (in particular its 
          external appearance), also enable the building to be built more quickly.<br>
          <br>
          8.5 To answer in another way, I suggest that any possible effect on 
          progress should not preclude consideration of a reduction in specification 
          if that were thought to be desirable for other reasons.<br>
          <br>
          8.6 I have considered the scope for reducing the Project cost. This 
          is of course an exercise that can only be done knowedgeably by the Design 
          Team and the Project Team who are familiar with the Project design in 
          all its detail. I am confident from the discussions which have been 
          held with the Design Team and the Project Team that there is scope for 
          doing so and the cost comparisons in this Review support their view 
          that this is possible. <br>
          <br>
          8.7 Such an exercise could, in my view, produce reductions in the order 
          of 15 &#150; 20% from the current (February 2000) estimate of basic 
          construction cost and 10 &#150; 15% from the current estimate of fit-out 
          costs. Achieving such reductions would produce the following results:</font>

            9.1 Conventional management structures and management processes for 
            a government funded project are in place. The Design Team has adopted 
            the industry standard &quot;Plan of Work&quot; for its design work. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>9.2 Management Targets</strong><br>
            <br>
            9.2.1 Nevertheless the Project has acquired three characteristics 
            which these management systems are designed to prevent, as follows:</font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial">The approved budget bears no relation to the 
              current Brief. <br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">The current Scheme Design bears no relation 
              to the approved budget.<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Arial">The Project cannot be completed by the completion 
            date most recently reported to the Client.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            9.2.2 Thus the Client&#146;s expectations for time and cost are not 
            being met. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>9.3 Communications</strong><br>
            <br>
            9.3.1 There is an established route for communications between the 
            Corporate Body as Client and the Project Team. <br>
            <br>
            9.3.2 Nevertheless the messages which are communicated are not always 
            understood and do not always lead to action being taken, when action 
            is clearly required. That the Client&#146;s expectations for time 
            and cost were not being met has been known within the Project Team 
            for nine months at least.<br>
            <br>
            9.3.3 Messages are not always communicated along the established route 
            and line managers are accordingly, on occasion, less well informed 
            about decisions taken further up the line than those whom they are 
            employed to manage. This is clearly destructive of effective management. 
            In particular, messages between the Client and the Design Team do 
            not always pass through the Project Sponsor and Project Manager. This 
            has led to misunderstandings and to instructions not always being 
            acted on. I have observed examples of both of these during my brief 
            acquaintance with the Project.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>9.4 Management recommendations</strong><br>
            <br>
            9.4.1 I do not consider that the characteristics to which I refer 
            above are the consequence of the management structure or the Plan 
            of Work procedures and I do not, accordingly, think that changes to 
            the structure or the procedures are essential. Nevertheless some changes 
            to the manner in which management operates would benefit the Project, 
            as follows:</font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial">Those responsible for communicating a matter 
              on which a decision is required must ensure that the need for the 
              decision is spelt out in the communication. <br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">Those responsible for decision making must 
              allocate sufficient time to make and communicate decisions effectively 
              through the correct channel. <br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">Where matters are to be discussed and decisions 
              made at a meeting, the relevant line manager(s) should be present. 
              Thus, the Project Sponsor and the Project Manager should be present 
              at any meeting between the Client and the Design Team. The Project 
              Sponsor should be present at any meeting between the Client and 
              the Project Manager. </font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Arial"><br>
            <br>
            9.4.2 Although I do not consider it essential that the management 
            structure should be changed, it would nevertheless be prudent for 
            members of the Corporate Body to consider whether it has the time 
            and expertise to perform the Client role on a day-to-day basis. If 
            it does not think that it has, there are two options which could be 
            considered:</font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial">Specialist member<br>
              <br>
              Appoint one member of the Corporate Body as the principal link with 
              the Project Team, spending more time than any member of the Body 
              has yet been able to do and <br>
              becoming in the process better informed and more expert in Project 
              matters. <br>
              <br>
              or<br>
              <br>
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">Project Progressing Committee <br>
              <br>
              Establish a Project Progressing Committee to support the Corporate 
              Body in the delivery of the Project. I leave consideration of who 
              should serve on this to the <br>
              Corporate Body.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <font face="Arial"> <br>
          In either case the responsibilities of the Project Sponsor should, in 
          my opinion, remain unchanged.<br>
          <br>
          9.4.3 I recommend that arrangements are made to facilitate a closer 
          working relationship between the Architect and Engineers and the Quantity 
          Surveyor. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          9.4.4 I recommend that the future design work of the Architects should 
          take place only in one office, rather than being geographically split.<br>

          <strong><a name="10"></a>10 Report on the current market value of the 
          Holyrood site</strong><br>
          <br>
          10.1 The site has been valued by the Chief Valuer for Scotland. His 
          valuations are based on what I consider to be reasonable assumptions, 
          but which have naturally not been market tested nor indeed checked with 
          the local planning authority. The determining factor is the investment 
          required for Queensberry House.<br>
          <br>
          10.2 The Chief Valuer has provided three valuations for a mixed residential, 
          retail, office and hotel development of 25,000 m2, taking into account 
          the benefit of the work done on site and with three different assumptions 
          for Queensberry House, as follows:<br>
          <br>
          Scenario 1: £5 million is spent on Queensberry House plus about £2 million 
          on professional fees, profit/risk, cost of finance and other ancillary 
          costs; no grant aid is available; the result is a £4 million loss on 
          the building, which has to be subsidised by the remaining development.<br>
          <br>
          The current open market value of the entire site is estimated to be 
          between £8 million and £11 million. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Scenario 2: £11 million is spent on Queensberry House plus about £4 
          million on professional fees, profit/risk, cost of finance and other 
          ancillary costs; no grant aid is available; the result is a £12 million 
          loss on the building, which has to be subsidised by the remaining development. 
          (Note: the current Project estimate for <br>
          Queensberry House is £10 - 11 million).<br>
          <br>
          The current open market value of the entire site is estimated to be 
          between £nil and £3 million. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Scenario 3: The full expenditure on Queensberry House is grant aided.<br>
          <br>
          The current open market value of the entire site is estimated to be 
          between £12 million and £15 million. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          10.3 If the local planning authority were to permit a development of 
          30,000 m2, these values are estimated as follows:<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          </font> 
          <div align="left">

          </div>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><br>
            10.4 However, neither the Chief Valuer nor I consider that it would 
            be prudent to assume that this greater area would be permitted by 
            the local planning authority and I recommend that it be discounted.<br>
            <br>
            10.5 If accounting conventions for expenditure by the Parliament meant 
            that grant aid to Queensberry House was effectively a debit against 
            the Project, then Scenario 3 would not be relevant.<br>
            <br>
            10.6 I should emphasise the tentative nature of these valuations. 
            They have had to be made without the normal enquiries and investigations, 
            in a very short space of time.<br>

            11.2 The expenditure for March 2000 is expected to be around £3.5 
            million including VAT. The value of contracts let to and through Bovis 
            is £17,778,286 including VAT. This includes the value of contracts 
            let to or through Bovis for which payments have been made as shown 
            on the spreadsheet. <br>
            <br>
            11.3 The contracts let do not represent committed expenditure. If 
            the Project were to be cancelled, the various construction and professional 
            contracts would, in general terms, entitle the contractors to reimbursement 
            of their earnings to the date of cancellation plus the reasonable 
            costs of closing down their various operations. <br>
            <br>
            11.4 I cannot say what the costs of termination would be with any 
            degree of precision. Much would depend on when this was done and, 
            in my view, the manner in which it was done. However, if the Project 
            were cancelled in early April 2000, a budget for the costs incurred 
            as a result, including expenditure already incurred, would sensibly 
            be in the order of £27-£30 million.<br>
            <br>
            11.5 Relating the site valuations to the predicted cancellation costs 
            shows that there would be a debit in the order of £16 - £30 million.</font></p>

            Thalidomide: 40 Years On&#151;</strong>That the Parliament expresses 
            its deep concern about the increased suffering of, and lack of financial 
            aid to, surviving thalidomide victims in Glasgow, Scotland and the 
            UK; believes that Diageo, as the multi-national company which took 
            over Distillers, which originally marketed the drug thalidomide which 
            caused children to be born without arms or legs or with other severe 
            disabilities, should aid these 456 victims urgently; notes that Diageo 
            made a £2.8 billion profit in 1999, while the Thalidomide Trust had 
            to pay £1 million in tax; believes that the Trust was set up inadequately 
            and that it should not have to pay taxes from its income, and further 
            believes that Diageo should intervene to alleviate this situation, 
            especially given that it owns some of the most profitable companies 
            and brand names in the world, including Guinness, Burger King, Häagen 
            Dazs and various whisky firms.<br>

            notes the concerns of the communities affected; believes that any 
            review of services should take into account all relevant factors, 
            including the wishes of those communities and the effect of such closures 
            on mothers and the local economy, and further believes that all agencies 
            concerned should engage in full consultation with those affected, 
            and take every factor into account when taking such decisions. <br>

            design, specification and cost of its permanent home, instructs the 
            Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to commission a study of alternative
