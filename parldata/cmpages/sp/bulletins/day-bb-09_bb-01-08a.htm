<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3173</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Homecoming and its Potential to Support Sustainable Economic Growth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Scotland&rsquo;s first ever homecoming celebration; recognises that the spectacular calendar of events and activities taking place this year from the weekend around Burns Night to St Andrew&rsquo;s Day will make for a unique year for all those joining the celebrations, including the people living in Scotland, the diaspora Scots and those with an affinity for Scotland who visit in 2009, and further recognises the potential for Homecoming Scotland 2009 to boost international and domestic tourism in support of the Scottish economy at this time. </p>

<p><strong>2.55 pm</strong>&#9;Scottish Government Debate: Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities &ndash; the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Offender Management Plan&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3174</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities - The Scottish Government Offender Management Plan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Scottish Government&rsquo;s plan for delivering a coherent offender management strategy built on a robust regime of community penalties and payback and a strong and proportionate management for offenders sentenced to prison and welcomes the publication, on 17 December 2008, of <em>Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities: Fair, Fast and Flexible Justice,</em> which sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategy to tackle reoffending and enhance public safety through a system that will deliver immediate, visible, effective, high quality, flexible and relevant justice. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3174.1</strong> <strong>Richard Baker: Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities - The Scottish Government Offender Management Plan</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3174) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;expresses concern that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals for the abolition of six-month sentences are unworkable and will not improve community safety; agrees that it is right to seek to expand the provision of tough effective community sentences and payback but that to be effective such measures must be properly resourced and that this is not the case under current national and local funding settlements, and believes that any changes to the sentencing system must put first the delivery of justice and protecting the public.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-3174.2</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities - The Scottish Government Offender Management Plan</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3174) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that in some cases custody is the only appropriate disposal and prison should offer a greater opportunity for rehabilitation; believes that it is vital where community penalties are imposed that there is a much tighter and rigorous control of these orders, including making community penalties more robust and visible to the community and, in particular, to the victims of crime, and notes that only when these measures are in place will the public start to have more confidence in the criminal justice system.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-3174.3</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities - The Scottish Government Offender Management Plan</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3174) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the publication on 17 December 2008 of <em>Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities: Fair, Fast and Flexible Justice, </em>which sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategy to deliver a coherent offender management strategy built on a robust regime of community penalties and payback and proportionate management of offenders sentenced to prison; recognises that community sentences that are completed speedily and enforced with rigour offer greater benefits to communities and individuals than short prison sentences and that their planned expansion must be adequately resourced; calls on the Scottish Government to incorporate in its offender management strategy effective action to tackle the underlying causes of crime and factors and circumstances known to have a link with offending behaviour; reaffirms the importance of judicial independence free from executive direction, and looks forward to constructive engagement with the Scottish Government on the detailed implementation of the programme.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong>&#9;Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#9;Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-2957</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Forensic Science Laboratory</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposals made by the Scottish Police Services Authority for the closure of the forensic science laboratory in Aberdeen; welcomes the direction issued by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to the authority in May 2008 that it should engage in fresh consultation with interested parties; considers, with regret, that the authority&rsquo;s consultation document published in November 2008 amounts to no more than a further case for closure; believes that the authority has thereby appeared to suggest that the conclusion of its consultation has already been determined in favour of closure, and further believes that the continued provision of forensic services to Grampian Police and Northern Constabulary by the forensic laboratory in Aberdeen is one of a number of options worthy of proper consideration in a meaningful consultation process. </p>
