            Mounds</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the protection given 
            to the Darwin Mounds; notes that this unique collection of cold water 
            coral reefs was only discovered in 1998 but has significantly advanced 
            global knowledge of coral formations; further notes that the coral, 
            located 1,000 metres below the surface of the ocean, provides food 
            and shelter to a wide range of marine species, and welcomes the commitment 
            to protecting and sustaining the marine environment upon which our 
            fishing industry depends.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-296#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Funding

            the Parliament notes the terms of the Standards in Scotland&#146;s 
            Schools etc. Act 2000 and, in particular, section 15; welcomes the 
            presumption of mainstreaming of children and young people with special 
            needs; is concerned, however<font color="#0000ff">, </font>that local

            outwith their control, that they lack sufficient funding to comply 
            with these requirements and that children and young people with special 
            needs will therefore be disadvantaged, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should consider rucksack funding, that is the supplementary 
            funding of such children and young people centrally where the funding 
            package for all aspects of their care is above a statutory figure, 
            and further consider putting systems in place for payment of, and 
            application for, central funding and for such applications to be considered

            of the child or young person.</p>

            crime is increasing, anti-social behaviour is rising and our economy 
            is lagging behind that of the rest of the United Kingdom; recognises 
            that it is the poorest and most vulnerable in society that suffer 
            most as they are trapped in failing schools, most likely to suffer 
            from ill health and most likely to be victims of crime, and believes 
            ultimately that only by reforming key public services through offering 
            choice and decentralisation, whilst encouraging economic growth by 
            cutting business rates, removing red tape and mutualising Scottish 
            Water, can we close any opportunity gap and give the people of Scotland

            notes the findings of the recent Rowntree report on poverty and social 
            inclusion which shows that the proportion of the population living 
            in poverty in Scotland has risen to 23% and the proportion of children 
            in poverty to 30%; believes that the problem of poverty will never 
            be solved until there is a fundamental redistribution of income and 
            wealth which requires an independent Scotland, but considers, however, 
            that even with its limited power the Parliament could begin this process 
            by abolishing regressive council tax and introducing a Scottish service 
            tax based on people's ability to pay and, in addition, introduce a
