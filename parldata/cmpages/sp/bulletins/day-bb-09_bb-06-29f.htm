<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4533</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Dementia in Care Homes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes <em>Remember, I&rsquo;m still me,</em> a joint report by the Care Commission and the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland on the provision of care in residential homes for people with dementia; notes that the report found that 70% of people living in the care homes visited had dementia; is concerned that the report found that some care homes fell seriously short of best practice and that people with dementia were not always getting the best possible care to meet their needs; is appalled that the report found that there was often no regular review of medication, even though 75% of people in homes were taking one or more psychoactive medicines, that the majority of care staff were generally unaware of best-practice guidance and that some felt that they did not have enough time to give the care that they wanted and that there was sometimes little activity, with activity coordinators not always trained or supervised, and calls on the Scottish Government to develop a National Dementia Strategy and work with NHS boards, local authorities and others to address urgently the shortcomings detailed in the report.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4532</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Fife Shopmobility Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the new premises of Fife Shopmobility in Kirkcaldy; commends the work of Fife Shopmobility in providing wheelchairs and scooters to enable people with mobility difficulties and visual impairments to access shopping and leisure facilities in the town centre; acknowledges the work and dedication of volunteers who provide a companion shopping service and are trained in customer care and sighted guidance for many of the 1,864 registered users who require assistance while shopping, and recognises that for the past 18 years the charity has helped people to gain independence, self-esteem and choice and that the services are helping to meet the goals of social inclusion and equality in the local community as well as contributing to the town&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4531</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Setting the Standard, Clyde Bergemann Wins important Trade Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the engineering company, Clyde Bergemann Ltd, based in the east end of Glasgow, for receiving the Queen&rsquo;s Award for Enterprise: International Trade 2009; appreciates the award being presented by the Lord Provost of Glasgow and recognises the work done by the company, which specialises in the supply of clean energy technologies designed to improve thermal efficiency and reduce harmful emissions; commends the contribution made by the company that demonstrates the continuing vibrancy of the east end of Glasgow and hopes that the company can develop further links with Clyde Gateway, the largest economic regeneration project in Scotland, and wishes the company well in its continuing role of providing high-level quality products and engineering for international clients.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4530</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>More to Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Govanhill Baths Community Trust (GBCT) on the progress made with its ambitious plans to develop a Health and Wellbeing Centre to reinvigorate the former Calder Street Baths site; welcomes the success of its recent planning application and recognises the continuing fundraising activities of the trust, and calls on all potential large funders, such as the Big Lottery Fund, Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government, to come together to take the Health and Wellbeing Centre plans forward to meet the aspirations and needs of residents in the south side of Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4529</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>End to Cake Ban in Dundee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the end of the ban on home baking at school events in Dundee after the ruling was overturned by the city&rsquo;s new SNP administration after being kept in place by the Labour party for almost a decade; highlights that this half-baked idea was introduced by the Labour administration in 1999 and that it was never removed during its time in office takes the biscuit; notes Dundee&rsquo;s proud home baking tradition, which includes the Dundee cake and Desperate Dan&rsquo;s cow pies; welcomes the fact that attendees at Dundee school events can now enjoy home baking, and looks forward to the host of events over the coming months that can now have cake sales without breaking council rules.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4480</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Jobcentre Plus Failing Job Seekers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the UK Government to address the disturbing conclusions of the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) report, <em>Now It&rsquo;s Personal: Personal advisors and the new public sector workforce</em>, which highlights significant inadequacies in the role of personal advisors and asserts that an upskilling of the advisor workforce is needed to increase service effectiveness; is concerned that soaring levels of unemployment have resulted in more people receiving back-to-work support from personal advisors at Jobcentre Plus than at any point since its creation in 2002; worries that major gaps exist in specialist training, including in relation to childcare, homelessness, drug and alcohol misuse and mental health problems, and that the needs of the most vulnerable groups in society are not being adequately addressed by personal advisors, and is concerned that, despite a &pound;1.7 billion allocation to the Department of Work and Pensions to increase the personal advisor network, evidence continues to suggest that low pay among Jobcentre Plus staff is resulting in a loss of skilled advisors and high levels of staff turnover, which means a lack of continuity in support for job seekers.</p>
