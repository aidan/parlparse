    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-530</b> <strong>Mr John McAllion: Dispersal of Civil Service Jobs to
    Tayside</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the repeated rhetorical commitment by Ministers
    that they will ensure that the Scottish Parliament works for all and not just part of
    Scotland, and in that context calls for serious consideration to be given to the dispersal
    of civil service and quango jobs to Tayside and for an annual review by the Parliament of
    progress achieved in dispersing such jobs across Scotland.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-529#</b> <strong>Dr Winnie Ewing: Sign Language</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes that the British Sign Language is used as an essential communication tool
    by a substantial number of people in Scotland and has a strong historic tradition;
    recognises the pressure on interpreters who are in constant demand particularly in rural
    areas; notes that the British Deaf Association is seeking review of the recognition,
    rights and support applied to the language; expresses the hope that the Scottish Executive
    will assist the process by taking actions to implement the European Parliament&#146;s
    recognition of Sign Language as an official language in each of the member states, and
    recognises the importance and necessity of British Sign Language by integrating signing
    into the plenary sessions of the Parliament.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-528</b> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Lorn and Islands Hospital</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament expresses its concern at the threatened closure of the Nelson Ward at Lorn
    and Islands District General Hospital; commends the local petition initiated by Councillor
    McIntosh; reaffirms its commitment to local provision of health care services for the
