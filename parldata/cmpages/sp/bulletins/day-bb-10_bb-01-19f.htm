                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5552</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Keep Local Area Co-ordinators in Argyll and Bute</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is disappointed to learn that Argyll and Bute Council is proposing to cut the local area co-ordination service; believes that, by doing so, Argyll and Bute Council will, unfortunately, be marking the 10th anniversary of the publication of <em>The same as you? A review of services for people with learning disabilities </em>by rejecting one of the major recommendations made in that report; considers that the service provided by local area co-ordinators is a valued and essential part of learning disability provision at a local level; understands that local area co-ordination models build inclusive communities in which people with learning disabilities and their families can fully participate; further believes that this model is cost effective for local authorities as it saves money by building an individual&rsquo;s capacity and, with early intervention, diverts people from using statutory services, and therefore urges Argyll and Bute Council to abandon this detrimental proposal.</p>

                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5550</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Haiti Earthquake Disaster</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its profound sadness for the victims of the Haitian earthquake, which has seen over 200,000 feared dead while over a million people have been left homeless and in desperate need of basic humanitarian aid; commends the spirit of compassion and generosity that has been shown by the Scottish people in their response to the disaster, and hopes that, through the immense efforts being made by people worldwide, immediate relief can be delivered to the people of Haiti and that lasting reconstruction can begin.</p>
