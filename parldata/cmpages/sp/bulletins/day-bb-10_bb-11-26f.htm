<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#END">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7496 Irene Oldfather on behalf of the European and External Relations Committee: Report on the Inquiry into the Impact of the Treaty of Lisbon on Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the European and External Relations Committee&rsquo;s 4th Report 2010 (Session 3), <em>Inquiry into the Impact of the Treaty of Lisbon on Scotland</em> (SP Paper 469) and agrees to the introduction of a Parliament-wide strategy for European Union engagement and scrutiny, including the introduction on a pilot basis, and, if successful, permanently, of an early warning system for EU legislative proposals, as outlined in Annexe B to the Report.</p>
<p>Supported by: Sandra White<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7495 Marilyn Livingstone: Red Hat Events</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Naomi Anderson on her successful application to Firstport&rsquo;s Social Entrepreneurs Fund, receiving a grant to set up Red Hat Events; notes that Red Hat Events is a social enterprise based in Fife that provides what it considers are high quality social events and opportunities for men and women to make new social connections; understands that the programme of events will appeal to all ages but specifically targets those aged 50 to 70; welcomes the fact that the project aims to reduce social isolation, increase inter-generational activity and build a sense of community, stave off conditions such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s and stress and to increase the fitness levels of those in the target group with a view to reducing healthcare costs; commends Naomi for addressing the demand by this target group for the opportunity to participate in new activities, and wishes her every success with the project.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7494 Joe FitzPatrick: Scotland&rsquo;s Oldest Citizen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Mrs Catherine Masters on reaching the age of 111 years on 23 November 2010; recognises that Mrs Masters is the oldest living Scot and the only Scot now alive who was born in the 19th century; notes that Mrs Masters was born and brought up in Dundee where her father, David Cromb, was the editor of <em>The Courier</em>, and wishes her all the very best on her birthday.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7493 Kenneth Gibson: Arran Aromatics</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the continued success of the Scottish luxury toiletries producer, Arran Aromatics, with forecast sales growth of 20% in the coming year despite the ongoing difficult financial climate and lack of consumer confidence in the wider economy; commends the management of the company who have taken the business from the verge of bankruptcy to being what is considered one of Scotland&rsquo;s most prestigious manufacturing and exporting companies, with annual sales of around &pound;5.6 million; recognises that Arran Aromatics is one of the biggest private employers on the island and considered a pillar of the local economy; further welcomes news that, following the successes of its seven outlets, the award of lucrative contracts from prominent hoteliers, such as Cameron House Hotel in Loch Lomond, and with booming export sales to America and Russia, the company intends to increase manufacturing capacity and expand its ventures south of the border, and wishes Arran Aromatics great success in this project and continued success in future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7492 Iain Smith: Save RAF Leuchars</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its appreciation and admiration for what it considers the essential role in the defence of the United Kingdom played by RAF Leuchars; commends the professionalism and dedication of all the military personnel who serve or are based there; considers that those who have been deployed from Leuchars on active service have given exemplary service in the Falklands, Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere; believes that existing plans to deploy three squadrons of Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft at Leuchars are strategically correct; calls on the Secretary of State for Defence to confirm these plans at the earliest possible date and to recognise that Leuchars is a centre of defence excellence not only for RAF fighter squadrons but also Territorial Army 71 Engineer Regiment, 58 Squadron of the Royal Air Force Regiment, the East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron, the regimental headquarters of the RAF cadets in Scotland, the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and other units; further calls on the Secretary of State for Defence to acknowledge that RAF Leuchars is in the right place at the right time and doing the right job for which it is uniquely qualified by way of experience, expertise, preparation and capability, and invites him to confirm the long-term role of RAF Leuchars in the defence of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7491 Margaret Mitchell: Roots of Empathy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the first Roots for Empathy pilot scheme in Scotland at New Stevenson Primary School, Motherwell; acknowledges that Roots for Empathy is a classroom-based intervention programme that aims to reduce bullying and aggression in schools in the short term and, in the long term, seeks to encourage future generations to be compassionate citizens and good parents; notes that the programme was developed by Mary Gordon in 1996 and is in place in Canada, New Zealand, the USA and on the Isle of Man, and hopes that the pilot scheme, initiated by Action for Children Scotland and North Lanarkshire Council, is a success and that it could soon be rolled out to other schools across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7490 Anne McLaughlin: UKBA&rsquo;s Contempt Agenda for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the UK Border Agency (UKBA) for its actions that, it believes, imply a complete lack of respect for the Parliament and the people of Scotland; deplores what it considers to be the chaotic and unfeeling manner in which hundreds of asylum seekers in Glasgow were informed of the cancellation of UKBA&rsquo;s contract with Glasgow City Council and their subsequent imminent removal to elsewhere in Scotland; condemns, in particular, UKBA&rsquo;s decision, following a review, to continue, in its view, to refuse to engage with members seeking to represent constituents; believes that this policy is unique among all UK and Scottish governmental agencies, and considers that both examples demonstrate contempt for asylum seekers, the Parliament and Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7489&diams;
  Rhona Brankin: Lothian Homeopathy Clinic</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views with concern the proposal made by NHS Lothian to withdraw funding from the Lothian Homeopathy Clinic based at the Dalkeith Medical Centre; considers that many patients from Lothian and the Borders have benefited from the services provided there and would welcome a continuation of the service in order that patients in the east of Scotland are not required to travel to Glasgow for homeopathic treatment on the NHS.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7488 Dr Richard Simpson: Silently Stressed, NUS Scotland&rsquo;s Research on Student Stress</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes NUS Scotland&rsquo;s report on research into student stress, <em>Silently Stressed: a survey into student mental wellbeing</em>, which follows on from NUS Scotland&rsquo;s Think Positive project, which aims to create a mentally healthier student population across Scotland&rsquo;s universities and colleges; considers that the report underpins the Think Positive campaign by showing that the needs of Scotland&rsquo;s students are not only not being met but are increasing; regrets that, despite the growing success of the national anti-stigma mental health campaign, over 80% of those students surveyed felt that the stigma perceived around the issue of mental illness prevented them from asking for support, and calls for discussions with NUS Scotland on how the issue of stigma might be better tackled. <strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7487 Dr Richard Simpson: Dropping of Antidepressant Prescribing Target</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets what it considers the precipitate dropping of the target to reduce antidepressant prescribing by 10% without debate or discussion by the Parliament and considers that, while welcoming the new target to improve access to the so-called talking therapies, the Scottish Government has failed to match the NHS in England by training an equivalent to its 3,000 new therapists, a move that it believes could have contributed to at least stabilising if not reducing prescribing. <strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
