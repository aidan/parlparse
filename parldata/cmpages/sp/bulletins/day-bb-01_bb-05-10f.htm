            <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Cuts Affecting the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders 
            and the Black Watch</strong>—That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            with dismay the proposed cuts to the Scottish Regiments, in particularly 
            the effect such cuts would have on the Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders, 
            with its historic links to Stirling, and the Black Watch, famously 
            based in Perthshire, regiments which have a proud history of defending 
            British interests in many conflicts in the 19th and 20th centuries; 
            believes that plans for further mergers and cuts would seriously undermine 
            the future of these historic frontline regiments which include regular 
            troops, territorial army and cadet forces, and calls upon Her Majesty's 
            Government to reject this unnecessary course of action.</a></font></p>

            <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Urban Regeneration</strong>—As an amendment to motion

            that the construction of a Glasgow light rail scheme would provide 
            enormous benefits to the city in relation to jobs, improving the environment, 
            tackling congestion and related pollution and regenerating the city 
            as a tourist attraction; calls upon the Scottish Executive to reappraise 
            urgently the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive’s private legislation 
            proposal for a light rail scheme, developed in 1994, with a view to 
            incorporating it into the Neighbourhood Renewal statement, and agrees 
            to allow Glasgow City Council to retain all the business rates raised 
            within its boundaries from 2001-02 onwards.</font></p>

            Executive with regard to urban regeneration; congratulates the key 
            agencies, organisations and citizens involved in regenerating urban 
            Scotland; recognises that despite these efforts, levels of poverty, 
            sickness and unemployment remain stubbornly high across much of urban 
            Scotland, and undertakes to carry out a comprehensive review of regeneration 
            policy in our towns and cities with specific regard to infrastructure 
            and employment, examining the successes and failures of the past and 
            including an analysis of thriving models of urban renewal across the

            now&quot; to end and insert &quot;and notes the good progress of the 
            construction of the Holyrood Parliament Building; welcomes the fact 
            that most of the tender packages have come in at prices in line with 
            the cost estimates but recognises the effect of an above-average inflation 
            rate in the construction industry in the Edinburgh area; further notes 
            the identification of possible savings by the Holyrood Progress Group, 
            which has led to unanimous decisions by both the Progress Group and 
            the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to authorise savings of 
            £2.5 million, but endorses their firm commitment not to compromise 
            the quality of Scotland’s new Parliament Building; acknowledges the 
            rigorous work of the Project Team and the Holyrood Progress Group 
            to achieve good value for money, and directs them to continue to work 
            towards the completion of the construction of the building in December 
            2002 as an internationally recognised home for our new democracy which 
            will be a source of pride for people throughout Scotland.&quot; </font></p>

            &quot;; expresses considerable concern that this figure is likely 
            to be exceeded and therefore calls upon the Scottish Parliamentary 
            Corporate Body to ensure that any revised costs above that figure, 
            as well as any changes to quality standards and completion dates that 
            affect that figure, are laid before the Parliament for debate and 
            approval; further calls upon the Conservatives to cease their boycott 
            of the Holyrood Progress Group so that all the principal parties in 
            the Parliament supervise this Parliamentary project together; asks 
            the Scottish Executive to nominate a Minister to the Group, and expresses 
            the wish that the Progress Group should become a sub-committee of 
            the Corporate Body and that, following such a change, the Progress 
            Group itself should report regularly and directly to formal meetings 
            of the Parliament, rather than to informal meetings of members as 
            at present, thus strengthening direct Parliamentary accountability 
            for the project.&quot; </font></p>

            believes that the aims of visitscotland/the Scottish Tourist Board

            a regulatory body; notes the relief package as proposed by the Scottish

            that direct transport links between Scotland and Europe and Scotland
