                  considerable competitive disadvantages in comparison with countries 
                  such as Ireland in respect of the high pound, high levels of 
                  tax on fuel, high business rates and lower resourcing for generic 
                  and other promotion; believes that those involved in the tourism 
                  industry are to be congratulated for their work and the measure 
                  of success achieved despite these disadvantages; further believes 
                  that the tourism strategy launched by the Scottish Executive, 
                  whilst it has certain good elements, cannot in itself meet the 
                  needs of the sector, and calls for (a) an immediate assessment 
                  of the efficacy of the Ossian on-line booking system, (b) targetting 
                  of resources to permit locally based marketing, (c) a review 
                  of the level of landing charges in our airports and (d) a commitment 
                  that the area tourist board structure will be amended in the 
                  light of the conclusions of the local economic forums with the
