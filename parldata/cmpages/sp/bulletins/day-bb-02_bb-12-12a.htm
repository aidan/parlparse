          <p>The Presiding Officer wishes to announce that subject to the Parliament&#146;s 
            approval of Business Motion S1M-3694, set out below, today&#146;s 
            Business will be as follows:</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>9:30 am&#9;Debate on Children&#146;s and Young People&#146;s Services 
              in Scotland&#151; </p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3698</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan:</strong> <strong>Children's 
              And Young People's Services in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
              commends the recent reports into children&#146;s services of the 
              Child Protection Audit and Review, <em>It&#146;s everyone&#146;s 
              job to make sure I&#146;m alright</em>, Audit Scotland, <em>Dealing 
              with offending by young people</em> and the Scottish Committee of 
              the Council on Tribunals, <em>Special Report on the Children&#146;s 
              Hearings System</em>; notes in particular the references to the need 
              to address urgently the crisis in the recruitment and retention 
              of social workers; urges the Scottish Executive to give serious 
              consideration to this matter and to the other recommendations in 
              the reports and to act upon them; agrees that, when implemented, 
              the recommendations would offer substantial improvements to the 
              services for our most vulnerable children and young people; recommends 
              bringing forward legislation to provide a statutory basis for child 
              protection committees thereby ensuring increased status and resources 
              and uniformly high quality services across the country, and recognises 
              the need for the Scottish Executive to tackle once and for all the 
              underlying social problems which disfigure our nation by limiting 
              the chances of Scottish children, too many of whom continue to live 
              in poverty</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S1M-3698.2</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Children 
                and Young People's Services in Scotland</strong>&#151;As an amendment 
                to motion (S1M-3698) in the name of Irene McGugan, leave out from 
                &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the constructive 
                recommendation of the recent reports into children&#146;s services, 
                the Child Protection Review, <em>It&#146;s Everyone&#146;s Job 
                to make Sure I&#146;m Alright</em>, the Audit Scotland report, 
                <em>Dealing with Offending by Young People</em> and the Scottish 
                Committee of the Council on Tribunals&#146; report into Children&#146;s 
                Hearings; notes the need to address recruitment and retention 
                of social workers and welcomes progress in the Executive&#146;s 
                Action Plan for Social Services; notes that the reports highlight 
                a need to continue to focus on delivery which improves outcomes 
                for Scotland&#146;s children, and agrees that the Executive should 
                continue to address the problems of poverty and exclusion and 
                close the opportunity gap.&quot;</p>
              <p><strong>S1M-3698.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Children's and 
                Young People's Services in Scotland</strong>&#151;As an amendment 
                to motion (S1M-3698) in the name of Irene McGugan, leave out from 
                &quot;in particular&quot; to end and insert &quot;the concern 
                expressed within reports about the pressures facing children&#146;s 
                hearings and the inadequate nature of the resources and disposals 
                available; acknowledges that the problems of youth disorder must 
                be given high priority if the right to peace and security at home 
                and in the community is to be protected; calls upon the Scottish 
                Executive to introduce an increased range of disposals for children&#146;s 
                hearings, including weekend and evening detention, restriction 
                of liberty orders and expansion of supervised attendance orders 
                and community service orders along with an increase in secure 
                accommodation and a substantial increase in police officers visible 
                in our communities, and recognises that, while much material poverty 
                has been alleviated, 21st Century forms of vulnerability require 
                policies that create wealth and provide economic opportunity and 
                security for all, which can only happen within a framework of 
                public order in which people have the security of strong families, 
                communities and high quality public services.&quot; </p>

              Rural Development Committee on 10 December 2002 and therefore regrets 
              the exclusion from the boundaries of the Cairngorms National Park 
              of those areas of Highland Perthshire and Drumochter, including 
              the forest of Atholl, Beinn a &#145;Ghlo and Blair Atholl, all of

              Executive, on the proposal for a National Park in the Cairngorms,

                calls on the Executive to propose that viable quotas be set that 
                will allow the fleet to return to sea in the new year, providing 
                the opportunity for states with a direct interest in the North 
                Sea and the Irish Sea to bring forward management plans later 
                in 2003 that promote fisheries conservation and secure a future 
                for our fisheries communities, and further calls on the Minister 
                for Environment and Rural Development to engage directly with 
                other EU states and Norway to achieve this objective.&quot;</a></p>

                for the well-being of the Scottish fishing industry and fishing 
                communities and therefore strongly rejects any advice that would 
                close Scotland&#146;s mixed fishery; believes that more time is 
                required to assess truly the current state of fish stocks and 
                the effects of the conservation measures already taken by Scottish 
                fishermen; believes that elected MEPs should have the opportunity 
                to debate and vote on any new quota cuts before they are implemented; 
                urges fisheries ministers Ross Finnie and Elliot Morley to ensure 
                that they do not preside over the decimation of Scotland&#146;s 
                fishing industry but instead achieve an outcome that is fair and 
                equitable to Scottish fishermen, and ultimately believes that 
                the Common Fisheries Policy of collective management has failed 
                and therefore should be scrapped and replaced by national and 
                local control and management of European waters as the only way 
                to ensure future sustainability of fish stocks and thus the fishing 
                industry.&quot;</p>
