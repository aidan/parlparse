<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8191 Elaine Smith: Hypothyroidism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 17% of women over the age of 60 will experience some form of hypothyroidism; considers that the issue of thyroid disorders is an important gender issue as women are five times more likely to have such a disorder than men; believes that many very ill people with thyroid dysfunction are not being correctly diagnosed by general practitioners; notes that Dr Anthony Toft, a world-renowned and highly respected Scottish endocrinologist, believes that doctors should take a whole-picture approach that takes into consideration all of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and does not rely entirely on test results; believes that this approach is particularly important in patients who have a lack of triiodothyronine as tests can show that their thyroxine levels are satisfactory thus leading to GPs&rsquo; wrongly concluding that a patient&rsquo;s thyroid function is within the normal range; understands that variations in the strength and quality of a drug such as thyroxine can impact negatively on a patient&rsquo;s health thus making it unsuitable for generic prescribing; believes that it is vital that the views of the patient are taken on board in the spirit of partnership in patient care; considers that in many cases it may be more effective to prescribe a combined course of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and calls for more research into the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disorders.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8190 Pauline McNeill: Welcome to the MOBO Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow on securing a three-year deal to host the MOBO awards; considers that this is a testament to the massive success of the awards in 2009; acknowledges the vibrant music scene in Glasgow and that this has secured Glasgow&rsquo;s position as UNESCO City of Music; looks forward to welcoming the awards to the new National Arena in the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC), and further celebrates that the 2015 awards will mark the 20th anniversary of the MOBO organisation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8189 Ian McKee: Cross-Border Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes one of the most successful world-wide investigations on child abuse co-ordinated by Europol, which has uncovered an abuse network of 70,000 people from over 30 countries; notes that the operation has identified 670 suspects and made 184 arrests and that 230 children have been safeguarded; notes that 121 arrests were made in the United Kingdom and 60 British children were protected; further notes that the complex case, known as operation rescue, is the largest investigation of its kind, with numbers expected to rise in the coming weeks as the operation develops; considers that the role played by Europol was key to identifying the members of the child sex abuse network and facilitating action by police authorities in 13 countries in Europe and beyond, and considers this a success of European and international co-operation in fighting cross-border crime and safeguarding vulnerable children.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8188 Sandra White: Glasgow&rsquo;s Mojo Wins the MOBO</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that the MOBO awards will return to Glasgow in 2011 as part of a three-year deal that will see the awards return to Glasgow in 2013 and 2015 also; considers that Glasgow made history in 2009 by being the first city outside London to hold the MOBO awards in what was widely considered to be one of the best award ceremonies; believes that this ringing endorsement is further evidence of Glasgow&rsquo;s international appeal, vibrancy and cultural diversity, and congratulates all those at Glasgow City Marketing Bureau and EventScotland on their success.</p>

<p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><strong>*S3M-8182 Cathy Peattie: International Rescue Corps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its sympathy with the people of Japan who have been affected by earthquakes, tsunami and nuclear leaks; regrets that the team from the Grangemouth-based International Rescue Corps (IRC), despite having permission from Japanese authorities in Tokyo and London, was unable to assist with the humanitarian effort; understands that this was because of the lack of a letter of authorisation stating that IRC is a bona fide organisation from UK officials based in Japan; notes that this would have been the 32nd world disaster that IRC would have attended and that, although it has had problems previously with host governments in China and Afghanistan, this was the first time that the obstacle was with a UK embassy, and considers the efforts of IRC to be unstinting and that these should be recognised by the UK Government and that every effort should be made to facilitate IRC&rsquo;s valuable work.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><strong>*S3M-8181 Robin Harper: Edinburgh Nursery Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision of City of Edinburgh Council on 10 March 2011 to close two Edinburgh nurseries, the High School Yards and the Princess Elizabeth, in order to make an estimated saving of &pound;200,000; condemns this decision as it considers that these nurseries are thriving; notes that in its most recent Care Commission inspection, carried out in 2008, High School Yards received overall grades of very good against four quality themes and excellent against the theme of quality of care and support; further notes that, in 2009, Princess Elizabeth received an overall grading of very good, with excellent grades being awarded against two of the four quality themes; deplores what it sees as the attitude that having three nurseries in close proximity is a luxury; considers that the interests of local Edinburgh children played no part in the decisions reached, and believes that, in order to give children the best range of opportunities and chances when they are in their most formative years, maintaining successful nurseries is not a luxury but a necessity.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><strong>*S3M-8180 Dr Richard Simpson: Purple Day, Raising Awareness of Epilepsy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Purple Day on Saturday 26 March 2011, which aims to raise awareness of epilepsy; notes that over 40,000 Scots have epilepsy; commends the promotion of public awareness of epilepsy by schools and public, voluntary and corporate sector organisations, and hopes that MSPs, parliamentary staff and prospective parliamentary candidates will highlight this neurological condition by wearing something purple on that day in order to support the national charity, Epilepsy Scotland, and all the individuals, families and carers whom they represent.</span></p>

<p> <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><strong>*S3M-8177.2 Alison McInnes: Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-8177) in the name of Charlie Gordon, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the importance of efficient and accessible bus services at a time of high fuel costs and changing travel patterns; welcomes the positive developments in the bus industry in recent years, but believes that more progress can be made in improving access to bus services, encouraging modal shift and reducing congestion; believes that the provision of efficient and affordable bus services must be supported with the necessary infrastructure on both local and trunk roads, including expanded park-and-ride schemes, bus passenger priority measures and accurate and accessible timetable information; supports community transport and demand-responsive transport schemes in areas where public transport availability is limited, and supports the restoration of the Bus Route Development Scheme to aid the development of new and existing registered local bus services that have the potential for growth.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><strong>S3M-8151 Helen Eadie: Parliament Questions Behaviour of Minister</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its disappointment that the Minister for Housing and Communities has made an announcement about funding the Coalfields Regeneration Trust (CRT) for one year only at the current level of expenditure; understands that the minister has called on the CRT to provide three business plans with two predicated on what it considers severe cuts in funding; is concerned to learn of allegations that the minister phoned and berated a worker of a voluntary organisation in the coalmining communities; believes that such behaviour would be inappropriate, and considers that no parliamentarian of any rank should resort to it.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><strong>*S3M-8151.1 Jamie Hepburn: Parliament Questions Behaviour of Minister</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-8151) in the name of Helen Eadie, leave out from &quot;that the Minister for Housing and Communities&quot; to end and insert &quot;at what it sees as the use by the Labour Party of misleading, false and inaccurate information about the funding of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust (CRT) and related matters; notes that the Scottish Government has awarded every penny that the CRT requested for its 2011-12 funding, some &pound;1.6 million; considers that the SNP administration has invested an unprecedented sum of nearly &pound;30 million in former mining communities through the Town Centre Regeneration Fund and other funding streams in recent years; deplores the Tony Blair/Gordon Brown-led Labour government&rsquo;s use of court action against the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) in relation to the entitlement of former miners to compensation for various types of lung disease, which it considers resulted in nearly 2,000 Scottish miners dying before they could receive compensation; also deplores what it sees as the silence of Labour politicians on this matter and their presumed acquiescence on this line of action; further notes the dozens of pits that closed while Labour was in government, and calls on Labour MSPs to apologise to the former mining communities for their behaviour in this matter.&quot;</span></p>
