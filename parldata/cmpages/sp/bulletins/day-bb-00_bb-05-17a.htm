    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></b>10.00 am Time for Reflection &#150; Mr S L Gajree, President of the
    Hindu Mandir, Glasgow</p>
    <i><p ALIGN="left">followed by</i> Debate on Glasgow Regeneration&#151; </p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>S1M-858 Ms Wendy Alexander: Glasgow Regeneration&#151;</strong>That
    the Parliament endorses the wide-ranging action being taken by the Executive to ensure
    that all of the key agencies work together with the citizens of Glasgow to tackle the
    deep-rooted challenges facing the city; recognises the excellent work being done by the
    key players who form the Glasgow Alliance and the role they have to play in tackling these
    challenges; and notes the part the Executive has played in supporting the significant
    developments which will prepare Glasgow&#146;s economy, housing, education provision and
    hospitals for the 21st century. <i></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></i>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments<i></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>S1M-858.1 Mr Kenneth Gibson: Glasgow Regeneration&#151;</strong></i>As
    an amendment to motion (S1M-858) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from
    &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the activities being undertaken by the
    Executive with regard to regeneration in Glasgow; congratulates the key agencies,
    organisations and citizens involved in regenerating the city; recognises that despite
    these efforts levels of poverty, sickness and unemployment far exceed the Scottish and UK
    averages, and agrees that the Executive should undertake a comprehensive review of
    regeneration policy in Glasgow with specific regard to stimulation of employment demand,
    examination of the successes and failures of the past and analysis of thriving models of
    urban renewal elsewhere.&quot; <b><i></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></i></b><strong>S1M-858.2 Bill Aitken: Glasgow Regeneration&#151;</strong>As
    an amendment to motion (S1M-858) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from
    &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes with grave concern the levels of
    unemployment, education failure, serious health problems and population loss affecting the
    city of Glasgow; recognises that these are testament to the failure of the Labour local
    authorities to address these problems over two generations; further notes that the
    response of the Labour Government and the Scottish Executive has to date been inadequate
    to deal with these problems; asks the Executive to address these problems in Glasgow as a
    matter of urgency; requests that the Executive specifically notes the failure of the
    existing local government system to cope adequately with Glasgow&#146;s problems; urges
    the Executive to institute appropriate steps to allow for a democratically and directly
    elected Lord Provost for the city with an executive role; further urges the Executive to
    appoint a Minister, from within its Ministerial team, with specific responsibility for
    Glasgow whose remit would include liaison with departmental ministers, the newly elected
    Provost, the city council and all agencies connected with the regeneration of Glasgow, and
    believes that the Parliament should set up a Committee, comprising all Glasgow Members, to
    oversee the performance of that Minister, thus ensuring that Glasgow&#146;s problems
    receive the attention which they not only deserve but are necessary to ensure the
    city&#146;s future.&quot; <b><i></p>

    level of health care throughout Scotland for people with epilepsy is a matter of priority.<i>
