<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6327 Robert Brown: Legal Status of Strathclyde Police Taser Pilots</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the legal analysis commissioned by Amnesty International indicating that the Strathclyde Taser pilot is unlawful; notes that under this pilot 30 frontline police officers were supplied with Taser weapons following a three-day training course; further notes that this legal analysis concluded that Scottish ministers are required to give written authorisation before any new scheme to arm police officers can take place; understands that no such authorisation has been obtained for the Strathclyde pilot; further notes the legal advice given to Amnesty International that while firearms legislation is reserved to the UK Parliament, control over firearms policy and the delivery of existing legislation has been specifically devolved to the Scottish Ministers; recognises that this is at odds with the assertion by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, made during a debate on the Strathclyde pilot on 25 February 2010, that &quot;Since the matter is a reserved responsibility, this Parliament has no locus to intervene, and the decision about how best to apply the existing legislation is an operational matter for each police force&quot;; recognises that it was the Home Secretary who signed off on issuing Tasers to frontline police officers in England and Wales; believes that extending the use of Tasers beyond firearms officers represents a shift in policy, not an operational decision, which requires ministerial sanction and which has serious human rights implications; further believes that there is need for proper debate on the implications of further arming police officers, and, in light of the doubts about the legal position, calls for the Strathclyde pilot to be halted in order that these issues be resolved.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6326&diams;
  Maureen Watt: Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland&rsquo;s New Directions Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland&rsquo;s New Directions Service in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire on reaching its 10th anniversary; recognises the success of the programme in working with young people between the ages of 12 and 18 involved in persistent and serious offending behaviour to divert them away from care or custody; applauds the 70% of the young people who have completed the programme and reduced their offending behaviour, and further considers that the success of the programme is due to the close collaboration with its partners, Aberdeen City Council, Aberdeenshire Council, Grampian Police and youth justice strategy groups.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6325 Johann Lamont: Honouring Gordon Brown</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament pays tribute to Gordon Brown, a proud and honoured son of Scotland; celebrates his powerful contribution as Prime Minister, as one of the great reforming chancellors and as a key architect of the Scottish Parliament; praises his record, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in securing historic advances for working people, such as the minimum wage; celebrates his legacy as an international statesman in helping to reduce third-world debt and in making real the aims of the Make Poverty History campaign; recognises his central role as Prime Minister, acknowledged across the world, in tackling the global financial crisis, and believes that his leadership in tackling inequality and in protecting families and communities from the impact of recession confirms his commitment to social justice and emphasises the need for government to act on behalf of people in troubled times, not abandon them.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6324 Aileen Campbell: Sunday Times Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by News International Ltd, owned by Rupert Murdoch, that it intends to cut staff and cease publication of <em>The Sunday Times Scotland</em> as a standalone publication; considers that coverage of Scottish news and culture in <em>The Sunday Times </em>will be significantly affected by this decision and that this is an unfortunate example of continued contraction in the Scottish newspaper market, and regrets not only the loss of jobs but the loss of diversity and reader choice that this decision will mean.</p>

<p> <strong>* S3M-6323&diams;
  Margo MacDonald: The Status of Scottish Parliament Elections</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that, in order to preserve the status of the Parliament in Edinburgh and the standards of operational accountability and transparency established by MSPs since 1999 and in view of the Parliament&rsquo;s acceptance of the findings of the Independent Review of the Scottish Parliamentary and Local Government Elections, there is a need for a method of holding any fixed-term Westminster elections that does not coincide with the dates set for the four-year, fixed-term Scottish Parliament elections.</p>

<p> <strong>* S3M-6320 Margaret Mitchell: Best Online Business Nominations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Janet Dunsmuir, a mother of two from Carnbroe, Coatbridge, on her nomination for Best Online Business at the Mumpreneur Conference and Awards for her business, CardsSelect.co.uk; notes that Janet has also been nominated in two other categories, the Best Interactive Business and Inspirational Business Mum, and wishes her well at the event, which will take place in September 2010.</p>

<p> <strong>* S3M-6299# Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell: Employment and Support Allowance, Unfit for Purpose</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the workings of the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA); notes evidence from the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) Service in Scotland that uncovers serious hardship experienced by ESA claimants across Scotland; considers that sickness benefits should support people in finding employment if they are able to work, but must also provide help for those who are not; considers that ESA is failing to find this balance and is putting pressure on sick and disabled people in Scotland; notes in particular claims that the work capability assessment of ESA is making unsuitable decisions on claimants &rsquo; fitness for work and that 70% of CAB appeals against these decisions are being upheld, and *would welcome a review of ESA aimed at making it* work in the interests of the genuinely sick and disabled people of Central Scotland and the rest of the country.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6296.1 Dr Richard Simpson: BMA, Standing up for Doctors, Speaking out for Patients</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6296) in the name of Mary Scanlon, insert at end &quot;and, furthermore, believes that, while it is critical that the style of management and the culture of the NHS should be to encourage all staff and not just doctors but also patients and families to express their concerns if care is less than optimal, all staff must be able to be secure in whistleblowing without retribution when internal approaches are exhausted or ignored.&quot;</p>
