<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7853&diams;   Mary Scanlon: Chronic Pain Services in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that some Scottish patients with chronic pain are being forced to travel to England for treatment, with eight of Scotland&rsquo;s NHS boards sending patients with chronic pain for treatment at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath at a cost of &pound;206,685 in the first six months of 2010-11; understands that since 2008-09 it has cost the NHS over &pound;620,000 to send patients to one hospital in Bath for treatment for chronic pain; understands the difficulties that this extra travel will cause for patients in terms of their own pain through travelling long distances, particularly from the north of Scotland, and also being separated from friends and families, and acknowledges the plight of people with chronic pain in Scotland, where the service across NHS boards is very patchy.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7845 Peter Peacock: University of the Highlands and Islands Becomes Scotland&rsquo;s Newest University</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the achievement of the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) in becoming Scotland&rsquo;s newest university, which has over 8,000 students and more than 100 courses specifically tailored for the needs of the Highlands and Islands region and beyond; notes that this landmark achievement of university title by UHI is the realisation of a long-time ambition for the region to have its own university to support economic development and help sustain rural and island communities; believes that, as a university, UHI will benefit the region by attracting more young people and also recruit students from beyond the Highlands and Islands region; congratulates the staff, students and supporters who have contributed to this achievement, and wishes UHI every success for the future.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7844 Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell: Murder on the West Bank?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the recent attack by Israeli colonists on the villages of Saffa and Beit Ommar in the West Bank; is deeply concerned by the shooting of Yousef Fakhri Ikhlayl, a 17-year-old youth from Beit Ommar, nearby in the southern West Bank, leaving him critically injured; notes that doctors have announced that Yousef is currently brain-dead in a Hebron hospital; believes that there must be a full independent investigation into this shooting, and calls on the government of the occupying force to ensure that the perpetrator is brought to justice.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7843 Jackie Baillie: Congratulations to Eileen McCallum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Eileen McCallum on winning the <em>Evening Times</em> Scotswoman of the Year Award; acknowledges her determination in fighting for better services for her grandsons with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the 6,000 people with muscle disease across Scotland; considers that she has shown commitment and enthusiasm in combining care for her grandsons, a successful acting career, influential parliamentary campaigning work and active fundraising; notes her longstanding support for the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign and the key evidence that she provided for the inquiry into specialist care conducted by the Cross-Party Group in the Scottish Parliament on Muscular Dystrophy, which resulted in the publication of the recommendations in <em>The Mackie Report: Access to specialist neuromuscular care and social care in Scotland</em>, and applauds all the women shortlisted for the Scotswoman of the Year Award.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7842 Liam McArthur: Bill Hogg OBE</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sadness the death of Bill Hogg OBE who played a key role in Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) over many years; recognises the service that he gave to the development of the modern game in Scotland in the various posts that he filled, including treasurer, secretary, and chief executive of the SRU, as the SRU representative on a range of international bodies and as Scotland team secretary; considers also that he never forgot the grassroots of the game, serving George Watson&rsquo;s College and Watsonian FC over many years as a referee of schoolboy and senior matches; believes that he will be greatly missed by Scotland&rsquo;s rugby community, and offers its condolences to his family on their loss.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7841 Mike Rumbles: Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that nothing further be done under the Non-Domestic Rates (Levying) (Scotland) (No.3) Regulations 2010 (SSI 2010/441).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7840 John Swinney: The Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2011 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7839 Kenneth Gibson: Financial Threat to Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled by those Westminster MPs who want to slash the Scottish block grant; is of the view that some MPs see the Scotland Bill as an opportunity to cut Scottish expenditure and public services; opposes such opportunism and considers that the Scotland Bill is broken and a tax trap that needs to be fixed; considers that the Bill, in its present form, will merely deliver budget cuts in disguise and that full fiscal autonomy for Scotland is the minimum that Parliament should demand, and believes that Scotland will only be respected in London as an equal partner when it is once again an independent sovereign state.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7838 George Foulkes: The Conduct of Charity Street Workers in Scotland&rsquo;s Great Cities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that the majority of charity street workers conduct themselves in a courteous and dignified manner; believes that their work helps to raise awareness of the charities that they represent to the benefit of those in need; is of the view, however, that a significant minority of charity street workers subject citizens in Scotland&rsquo;s cities to undue pressure to donate to charity; considers that a number of the methods employed by charity street workers, including what might be seen as harassment and blocking peoples&rsquo; paths, are discourteous; deems this behaviour to be completely unacceptable; sees this as an intrusion on one&rsquo;s right to walk down a street freely; believes that people should be encouraged to give to charity but should not be harassed into donating; believes that there is a danger that people will associate all charities with such methods and that this could have a detrimental impact on the sector with fewer people making contributions, and acknowledges that the charity sector at large has done much for those in need, but accepts that regulations are required to bring an end to what it considers the discourteous methods employed by a significant minority of charity street workers and to protect the right of the individual to walk a street freely without harassment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7837 Bob Doris: A Tribute to Donovan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Maryhill-born Donovan, considered a legendary folk-pop troubadour, on winning  the BBC Radio 2 Lifetime Achievement Award; considers remarkable his career as an itinerant folk musician, creating acoustic hits in 1965 with <em>Catch the Wind</em> and <em>Colours</em> and his version of Buffy Sainte-Marie&rsquo;s protest anthem, <em>Universal Soldier</em>; notes that he worked with the Beatles, and understands that he influenced Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison in their guitar styles and that, in his enduring career, he has played with folk music greats including Pete Seeger, Joan Baez and Bob Dylan.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7836 Stuart McMillan: Public Money Wasted on Sports Centre U-turn</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement that Inverclyde Council has decided to scrap its plan to build a &pound;10 million sports centre at Rankin Park, Greenock; notes that an estimated &pound;338,000 of public money has already been spent on preparatory work for this project; further notes the local authority&rsquo;s decision to instead go ahead with a number of smaller proposals; believes that such proposals should include a place for Belleaire Football Club, which has been established for over half a century and has made the grass pitch at Rankin Park its home ground; considers that, in the current economic climate, to have what it sees as such a vast outlay of public money on work on a project only for it to be scaled back is unacceptable, and hopes that the local authority will be more prudent in its future decision making.</p>
