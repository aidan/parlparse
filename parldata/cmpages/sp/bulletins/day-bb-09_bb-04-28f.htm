<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3994</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the steps being taken by the Scottish Government to accelerate and increase the supply of affordable housing in response to the current economic downturn; recognises the record investment being made this year; further notes that housing associations still have to secure through borrowing a significant proportion of the money required to build new housing and are facing challenges from the financial sector; also notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s initiative to kick-start a new generation of council house building and the increasing contribution that this is enabling local authorities to make in meeting housing need, which complements the high level of social housing built by housing associations over the last 10 years, and supports proposals in the consultation on the draft Housing (Scotland) Bill to reform the right to buy to encourage council house building and to safeguard Scotland&rsquo;s stock of social housing for the benefit of future generations of tenants.</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3993</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>4th North Glasgow 5K</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the success of the 4th annual North Glasgow 5k and praises the organisers for all their hard work and effort; congratulates the 2,600 men, women and children who ran, walked and pushed buggies and wheelchairs around the course; notes the substantial amounts raised for a wide range of charities by the participants, and applauds the focus on health and fitness that the event generates.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3991</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Ashbrook Homeless Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ashbrook Homeless Project for winning the Community Award and coming highly commended in the Housing Award at the Hostel Plus ceremony held during the Annual Salvation Army Social Services Conference 2009; notes that the Leith-based project offers residence for single homeless people as well as advice and support; further notes the strong community links that the project has with the local community, regularly informing Leith residents through leaflets of recent news, successes and events, and acknowledges that the Salvation Army&rsquo;s Hostel Plus scheme, now in its second year, offers opportunities for people to move on with their lives by learning new skills, getting work and having fun.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3990</strong> <strong>Paul Martin:</strong> <strong>Milnbank Sustainable Community Nursery Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the funding of &pound;892,124 from the Big Lottery Fund to Milnbank Housing Association as part of the Milnbank Sustainable Community Nursery project, which will meet local need for affordable childcare provision by creating a sustainable new-build nursery facility in the Dennistoun area of Glasgow; notes that the nursery will offer 75 childcare places, including 19 subsidised places to lone parents and low-income families, and that this five-year project will directly benefit 500 people and 10 organisations and partially fund 16 new full-time and six new part-time nursery worker posts plus 17 HNC-level training opportunities in childcare for people from low-income families; further notes that a total of 28 jobs will be created by this project, including full-time posts for a nursery manager, depute manager, cook and part-time posts for a driver and two cleaners, and congratulates the work done locally by all those involved to help bring the project to this stage.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3989&diams; </strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>HBOS, Lloyds TSB Merger</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that there would be merit in a public inquiry to look into the information that persuaded the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to set aside the usual procedures that apply to company mergers and takeovers when HBOS and Lloyds TSB were given government support to do so, with a subsequent significant impact on the finance sector and employment in Edinburgh and in spite of the likelihood of the proposed merged bank being in breach of competition law and the cost to the taxpayer, before the shareholders and employees of both banks had been made aware of the full facts of the financial situation of both and before any alternatives had been explored.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3988</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>A New Vision for the Devil&rsquo;s Beef Tub</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Borders Forest Trust&rsquo;s plans to purchase the iconic landscape feature, the Devil&rsquo;s Beef Tub, and the surrounding land at Corehead in the spectacular Southern upland hills near Moffat; notes that once the land is purchased the trust plans to manage the area ecologically, integrating the restoration of natural habitats with traditional low intensity farming and local community-based food production; recognises that the project will see significant increases in biodiversity and the return of many native species to the hills and valleys of Corehead; congratulates the trust on raising &pound;462,000 in private and charitable donations, and wishes the trust well in raising a further &pound;238,000 to complete this special purchase.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3987</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Burntisland Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the efforts of the headteacher, staff and pupils of primary 5/6 and primary 6 at Burntisland Primary School in their recent project work on environmental sustainability, China and Malawi; commends their hard work in producing an animated DVD that explores Chinese traditions; encourages the learning by doing approach demonstrated by the pupils and its use in other primary schools to teach children about Scotland&rsquo;s links with other countries; recognises the importance of teaching pupils about other countries and cultures to promote international citizenship, and recognises the urgent need for the promised &pound;3 million investment in Burntisland Primary School to create a learning environment fit for purpose.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3986#</strong> <strong>Angela Constance:</strong> <strong>Forgotten in Life and Forgotten in Death</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses it deepest sympathy and its support for the memorial to those former patients of Bangour Village Hospital who were buried in unmarked graves in the Livingston parliamentary constituency; commends and applauds the dedication shown by Mrs Catherine Ferguson in discovering and researching this tragedy in the constituency thereby producing a significant piece of social and historical research; endorses and supports the sympathetic response by West Lothian Council in assisting Mrs Ferguson with her research and in erecting memorial stones at Ecclesmachen Cemetery, Uphall Old Cemetery and Loaninghill Cemetery in Uphall, and acknowledges the memory of all patients buried in unmarked graves across Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3983</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Falkirk Football Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Falkirk Football Club on reaching the final of the Homecoming Scottish Cup and pays tribute to John Hughes and his players on a magnificent result against Dunfermline Athletic, which not only takes them to the final against Rangers but also takes Falkirk Football Club into European football for the first time in its history.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3982</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Scottish Parliament Banking Investigation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that an inquiry into the situation surrounding the recent banking crisis in Scotland, which is having particularly serious consequences for Scotland&rsquo;s traditional banking centre in Edinburgh, should be established as a matter of urgency through the mechanisms available to the Scottish Parliament, such as the creation of a special parliamentary committee, to look into the demise of RBS, HBOS and the Dunfermline Building Society in order to take evidence from the relevant bodies involved, restore confidence in the Scottish banking sector and ensure that lessons are learned.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3981</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Family Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the Family Fund, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s largest provider of charitable grants to disabled children; notes that last year the Family Fund gave over &pound;29 million in grants to 48,000 families across the United Kingdom for goods and services to improve the quality of their lives; further notes the recent launch of Family Fund extra, the Family Fund&rsquo;s new online shopping service, which allows any family with a disabled child a discount of up to 25% from several major retailers; also notes that anyone shopping online can help disabled children, at no extra cost to themselves, by buying through Family Fund extra from nearly 100 different retailers, and encourages people to use this excellent new service to support the Family Fund&rsquo;s valuable contribution in helping disabled children and their families.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3978&diams; </strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Dementia Awareness Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that Dementia Awareness Week 2009 takes place from 31 May to 7 June; is aware that Alzheimer Scotland estimates that in 2009 there are 67,000 people with dementia in Scotland, including 1,640 people under the age of 65; notes that this number is expected to rise to 114,000 by 2031; acknowledges that it is disappointing to note that Dementia Awareness Week follows a year in which a number of highly critical reports have highlighted the inefficiencies and failures in the quality of care of people with dementia in the community, in care homes and in long-term hospital care; notes the recent Care Commission report,<em> Better care, every step of the way</em>, which reflects the findings of 1,036 inspections and three investigations that found that 43% of homes did not realise that they were to deliver palliative and end-of-life care for people with life-limiting illnesses such as dementia; further notes the recent Care Commission report,<em> Gradings So Far</em>, which has shown significant variations in the quality of care received by elderly people in care homes when compared to other groups; considers that the poor quality of care at home services revealed in a recent Panorama investigation is simply unacceptable and particularly harmful to those people with dementia who may not be able to speak out for themselves; therefore supports the work of the Cross Party Group on Alzheimer&rsquo;s, which calls for a Charter of Rights for people with dementia; further welcomes the decision by Alzheimer Scotland, in supporting this initiative, to host a series of roadshows across Scotland in June 2009, starting in Irvine on Friday 5 June, to consult people with dementia, their carers and other stakeholders on the content of a Charter of Rights; notes that the Charter of Rights seeks to ensure that individuals and their families have a clear set of rights from diagnosis through to end of life, and therefore considers that a fundamental culture change in care services would help ensure the highest quality of service provision to people with dementia.</p>
