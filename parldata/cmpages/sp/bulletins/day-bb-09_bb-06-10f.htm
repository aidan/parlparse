<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4348</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>National Waste Strategy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Scotland&rsquo;s achievement of its share of the 2010 landfill diversion target 18 months early; encourages the Scottish Government to continue working with stakeholders to further improve recycling rates, increase reuse and do more on waste prevention, and looks forward to the forthcoming consultation on the new National Waste Management Plan, which will help Scotland further along the path to becoming a zero waste society.</p>
<p>Supported by: Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4347</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>BNP Does Not Speak for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Government to put measures in place to ensure that Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and any other relevant organisations outwith Scotland are made aware that the British National Party MEPs do not speak for Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4346</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>European Parliament Elections in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scotland&rsquo;s elected Members of the European Parliament who will serve a term of five years representing Scotland in Europe; considers that, while in parts of the United Kingdom the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and the British National Party (BNP) won numerous seats, in Scotland they completely failed to make ground with their campaigns, widely considered to be eurosceptic and racist, and were humiliated by coming in the bottom end of the list, with UKIP&rsquo;s share of the vote falling since the 2004 European elections; considers that this poll demonstrates a clear diversity of political attitude and culture, and believes that Scotland, unlike other parts of the UK, remains predominantly a pro-European nation that rejects extremist views and agendas and recognises the importance of EU membership.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Bill Wilson<strong>*</strong>, Anne McLaughlin<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4345</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>No Platform for the BNP,  Working Together to Combat Racism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with extreme concern the election of two members of the BNP to the European Parliament; welcomes the Not in my Name petition at: http://action.hopenothate.org.uk/page/s/notinmyname, which will be presented to the two BNP MEPs when they take their seats, and believes that all of the forces of anti-racism in Scotland, including political parties, trades unions and civil society, should combine their efforts to expose the policies of the BNP and to ensure that it makes no further progress in the United Kingdom or in Scotland and that in the long run it is not afforded any platforms nor means to promote racist polices or to incite racism.</p>
<p>Supported by: Margaret Curran<strong>*</strong>, Mr Frank McAveety<strong>*</strong>, John Park<strong>*</strong>, Trish Godman<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Bill Wilson<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4344</strong> <strong>Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>Scotland Needs a General Election</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the interests of Scotland and the United Kingdom would be best served by holding a general election for a new House of Commons as soon as possible.</p>

<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Scotland Needs a General Election</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4338</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that &quot;8:45&quot; be substituted for &quot;9:15&quot; in Rule 2.2.3 for the purpose of allowing the meeting of the Parliament on Thursday 11 June 2009 to begin at 8.45 am.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4337</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Maryhill Housing Association&rsquo;s Campbell Street Development</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the official opening of Maryhill Housing Association&rsquo;s new-build development in Campbell Street on 18 June 2009; welcomes this latest phase of the association&rsquo;s regeneration programme in Maryhill, which previously included the completion of the 1,000th home built under a programme to provide homes across the city of Glasgow; congratulates Maryhill Housing Association and its partners on their achievements to date, and recognises their ongoing commitment to play a key role in the regeneration of Maryhill and Ruchill by providing quality affordable homes for local people.</p>
<p>Supported by: Pauline McNeill<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4336</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>No to Wild Animals in Circuses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the plight of Anne, a 56-year-old elephant currently touring Scotland with a travelling circus despite being unable to perform tricks due to her advancing age and infirmity after decades in captivity; notes the recent publication of research in the scientific journal, <em>Animal Welfare,</em> that describes the unsuitability of wild animals such as elephants for circus life, which involves constant travelling and long spells in inadequate temporary housing; urges the Scottish Government to use its powers under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 to ban wild animal circuses in Scotland, as has already been done by Austria, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Croatia, Israel and Singapore, with similar bans pending in Brazil, Bolivia and Peru, and, until such legislation is passed, calls on landlords such as local authorities and other landowners to refuse to let sites to circuses using wild animals for an outdated form of entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4335</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Sustainable Apprenticeships</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the National Park Business/Apprentice Support Project for providing places for 13 apprentices in construction businesses in the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park; believes that this contributes to the aim of the park to promote the sustainable economic and social development of the area&rsquo;s communities; further believes that the project provides a welcome opportunity for young people from rural areas to learn skills and gain employment in local businesses, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that there is continuing support for the project.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4334</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>European Pipe Band Championships Come to Greenock</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the European Pipe Band Championships back to Battery Park in Greenock on 25 July 2009; recognises that Greenock was the place where many people emigrated from Scotland for a new life abroad so it is therefore fitting that this major event should be held in Inverclyde during the Year of Homecoming; notes that it is hoped that over 130 pipe bands from around the world will be coming to Greenock for the championships; further notes that the event will see a spectacular display by the Golden Lion Parachute Display Team as well as other family activities during the day, and wishes all taking part in the dancing, drum and piping competitions on the day well and the event great success.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4333</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Citizens Advice Scotland Report on Debt Levels among CAB Clients</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of <em>Drowning in Debt - Scottish CAB Clients and Debt</em> by Citizens Advice Scotland; is concerned that the average debt levels for Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) debt clients seeking advice from their local CAB is &pound;20,193, a 50% rise since 2003; further notes that the report highlights the bleak reality for low-income households in debt, including the finding that debt has had a negative impact on health for nine out of 10 debt clients; is also concerned at the increasingly ruthless behaviour adopted by creditors in seeking debt repayment, which at times has been unlawful; applauds Citizens Advice Bureaux in Scotland for the free, confidential and impartial frontline advice that they have provided to the people of Scotland for the last 70 years; recognizes their successes in advocating for improvements in public policy, and urges the UK and Scottish governments to assist indebted households throughout Scotland by pursuing the report&rsquo;s recommendations to curb unreasonable creditor behaviour, increase access to affordable credit, increase the number of debt solutions for those on low income and ensure that advice services are appropriately resourced.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4332</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Refugee Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 15 to 21 June is Refugee Week 2009; congratulates the Scottish Refugee Council, which has organised this important week of events, and the many communities and organisations that have worked tirelessly to deliver over 100 events across Scotland to mark the valuable contribution that asylum seekers and refugees make; deplores the human rights abuses around the world that compel people to seek sanctuary; recognises that it is our humanitarian duty to grant asylum to those fleeing persecution and that Scotland should continue to be a haven for people seeking protection; condemns those who would poison our democracy by spreading hatred, and affirms the role of the Parliament in making Scotland a place of safety where people can rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Wendy Alexander<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4331</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Amber Nectar Goes Green</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scotch Whisky industry on its ambitious new environmental strategy, the first industry strategy of its kind in Scotland; understands that the targets include cutting the use of fossil fuels by 80% by 2050, saving over 750,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, the equivalent of taking 235,000 cars off Scotland&rsquo;s roads; believes that the new strategy builds on more than &pound;100 million of investment across the industry in environment-related improvements over the last 18 months, and praises the industry for understanding that a clean and healthy environment is a crucial ingredient in the production of Scotland&rsquo;s national drink.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4313</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Argyll Arcade</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision to allow the historic term Argyll Arcade to be registered as a trademark and welcomes the Early Day Motion, *EDM 1605*, lodged in the House of Commons on the issue; believes that the people of Glasgow and its visitors have an affection for the Argyll Arcade, which is world renowned for its concentration of jewellers and has become a landmark in the city; objects to the notion that one owner can register the term Argyll Arcade in order to charge other proprietors for the use of the name; further believes that the landmark of the Argyll Arcade belongs to the people of Glasgow and the many visitors that the arcade continually welcomes, and calls on the Intellectual Property Office to review and reverse this decision.</p>
<p>Supported by: Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell<strong>*</strong>, Jamie Hepburn<strong>*</strong>, Trish Godman<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-4260</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Piping Live!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Piping Live!, Glasgow&rsquo;s International Piping Festival; notes that the festival *runs between 10 and 16 August 2009;* further notes that Piping Live! is this year part of the Homecoming Scotland 2009 celebrations and will feature some of the best names in traditional music, with everything from pipes to fiddles and rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll as well as traditional Scottish dancing, and wishes the festival well in 2009 and years to come.</p>
