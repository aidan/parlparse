          <p><strong>S2M-604#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>South 
            Lanarkshire Secondary Schools PPP Proposal</strong>-That the Parliament 
            shares the concerns of parents and pupils in East Kilbride with regard 
            to South Lanarkshire Council's public private partnership proposal 
            for secondary schools which, if implemented, will result in 50% of 
            secondary schools in East Kilbride being closed and school rolls amongst 
            the highest in Scotland; notes that, as the locations of the proposed 
            schools are all in the north of the town, this will lead to considerably 
            longer school journey times for pupils; further notes that St Andrews 
            School, which is earmarked for closure, currently operates at over 
            80% capacity and has a healthy mix of denominational and non-denominational 
            pupils thus contributing to the Scottish Executive's stated policy 
            of combating sectarianism, and considers that the Executive should 
            fully investigate this situation and the concerns of parents and pupils 
            prior to agreeing the closure of St Andrews school and giving approval 
            to South Lanarkshire Council's secondary school provision proposal.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-603</strong> <strong>Iain Smith on behalf of the Procedures 
            Committee:</strong> <strong>The Founding Principles of the Parliament</strong>-That 
            the Parliament takes note of the previous Procedures Committee's 3rd 
            Report, 2003 (Session 1), <em>The Founding Principles of the Scottish 
            Parliament</em> (SP Paper 818); continues to endorse the four principles 
            of access and participation, equal opportunities, accountability and 
            power sharing as the guiding principles for the Parliament, and encourages 
            all members to play a part in applying these principles throughout 
            the range of their Parliamentary work.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-602#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Belford 
            Hospital, Lochaber</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 
            people of Lochaber for their massive attendance at the public meeting 
            on Tuesday, 11 November 2003 to express their support for the future 
            of the Belford Hospital, Fort William; notes that around 2,500 people 
            attended the Nevis Centre, representing about one fifth of the population 
            of Lochaber; recognises that the Belford Hospital has established 
            a very high reputation for the standard of its work, particularly 
            in relation to acute trauma; considers that the Belford Hospital must 
            continue to be recognised as a medical training centre in order to 
            retain its nine junior medical, surgical and casualty staff; believes 
            that consultant-led services must be retained locally to ensure that 
            high quality acute emergency services continue to be provided at the 
            Belford Hospital; notes that the Lochaber Medical Community Option 
            (the &quot;Lochaber option&quot;) has the support of a substantial 
            majority of doctors working in Lochaber, as well as the unanimous 
            support of the Belford Hospital staff, including nurses, physiotherapists, 
            domestic staff, porters, secretaries, radiographers, laboratory staff 
            and midwives as well as that of the full Highland Council; believes 
            that the &quot;Lochaber option&quot; has, thus far, not been properly 
            considered nor fully evaluated; further believes that the &quot;Lochaber 
            option&quot; must be included as one of the options in the formal 
            consultation process which is to be launched by the Highland Health 
            Board early next year, and considers that members from all political 
            parties should express their support for the &quot;Lochaber option&quot; 
            being included in the formal consultation process.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-601</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Water 
            and Sewerage Charges</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the 
            Scottish Executive's current water and sewerage charges reduction 
            scheme should be extended in scale, scope and time and that the gap 
            between the Income Support Allowance for water and sewerage and the 
            actual level of charges should be progressively closed.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-600#</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Laurencekirk 
            Railway Station</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement 
            made by Aberdeenshire Council and Scotrail on the possibility of reopening 
            Laurencekirk Station; recognises the support in Laurencekirk and the 
            north east as a whole for the station's reopening; notes the Scottish 
            Executive's commitment to encouraging the increased use of rail transport 
            as an alternative to the car, and encourages Aberdeenshire Council, 
            Scotrail and the Scottish Executive to continue to make progress towards 
            the station's reopening.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-599</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>Bonnington 
            and Stonebyres Power Stations</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            all those who have been involved in the Lanark hydros at Bonnington 
            and Stonebyres Power Stations over the last 75 years; acknowledges 
            that this was the first hydro-electric scheme in Scotland to serve 
            the public supply, and welcomes recent investment which will see the 
            stations continuing to deliver clean, green energy to homes and businesses 
            in years to come.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-598#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Co-operative 
            Group Fair Trade Coffee</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Co-operative Group on the launch of its fair trade coffee; notes 
            that all Co-op brand coffee is now from fair-traded sources; recognises 
            that no other retailer in the UK has taken this important step; acknowledges 
            the longstanding, pioneering and courageous role of the Co-op and 
            the Co-operative movement in promoting fair trade; applauds the decision 
            of the Co-op to extend its fair trade range and continue to put its 
            founding principles and values into practice, and considers that other 
            retailers should reflect and act upon the lead taken by the Co-op.<strong><em>

          <p> <strong>S2M-597</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Compulsory

          <p> <strong>S2M-596</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Fairtrade 
            Initiative at the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the plight of coffee-growing communities across the world, largely 
            caused by a collapse of global coffee prices; notes that the Fairtrade 
            contract guarantees a high, stable price to grower co-operatives in 
            return for high standards of quality and environmental care and pays 
            growers a social premium on top of the basic price to be used democratically 
            for community projects; welcomes initiatives to promote Fairtrade 
            coffee and other Fairtrade products, and encourages MSPs to attend 
            the coffee morning organised by the Scottish Co-op in conjunction 
            with the Fairtrade Foundation and Oxfam at the Friends Meeting House 
            in Edinburgh on Thursday 13 November 2003 from 10.00 to 11.30 am at 
            which a major new Fairtrade initiative will be announced.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-595#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>MMR 
            Vaccine</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned that the number 
            of children who have been immunised against measles, mumps and rubella 
            is too low; acknowledges that the weight of current scientific evidence 
            does not establish a link between the MMR vaccination and autism but 
            recognises that many parents are still concerned about the safety 
            of the vaccine, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make 
            the single vaccine available to those parents who request it in order 
            to ensure that the level of immunisation against measles, mumps and 
            rubella is maintained at a level which protects children against these 
            dangerous diseases.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Shona Robison, Jim Mather, Rob Gibson, Brian Adam,

          <p> <strong>S2M-592</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>South 
            Lanarkshire Council's School Closures</strong>-That the Parliament 
            is concerned by the decisions taken by South Lanarkshire Council with 
            regard to secondary school provision; believes that these decisions 
            were based on a flawed consultation process and flawed information, 
            including inaccurate demographic information; further believes that 
            the council did not take full cognisance of the community's view and, 
            indeed, misinterpreted the nature of substantial opposition; considers 
            that the council has not proven the benefits of such large schools 
            as planned in East Kilbride, which are much bigger than anywhere else 
            in South Lanarkshire; is concerned that the council has not taken 
            sufficient cognisance of the travel problems that will ensue and has 
            left the south of East Kilbride, which has a population on the lowest 
            incomes in East Kilbride and the greatest housing expansion, with 
            no secondary provision whatsoever, and considers that the Minister 
            for Education and Young People should not approve any of South Lanarkshire's 
            proposed closures but should recommend that the council re-opens the 
            consultation process.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-585</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Ghost 
            Ships</strong>-That the Parliament supports the stance taken by Hartlepool 
            Council in refusing to allow the break-up of American ghost ships, 
            which contain toxic chemicals, in their community; recognises that 
            these ships contain a massive amount of asbestos, a hazard to any 
            community, and believes that these ships are not in a good condition 
            and should be sent back immediately and not stored in a port over 
            the winter.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-584#</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Maternity 
            Services in the Scottish Borders</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the establishment of the Short Life Expert Group on Acute Maternity 
            Services (EGAMS); is aware of the context of falling birth rates in 
            the regions of Scotland against which EGAMS was established; congratulates 
            all staff who provide maternity services within NHS Borders on their 
            work, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that 
            consultant-led maternity services at Borders General Hospital are 
            retained.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-583</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Parentline 
            Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament commends the excellent work 
            of the volunteers and staff of Parentline Scotland; congratulates 
            them on dealing with over 40,000 calls since inception in 1999; recognises 
            the value of the advice that they give, and wishes them every success 
            as they enter their fifth year in operation.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-582#</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Natural Heritage Vote Against Relocation</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that 70% of the staff balloted by the Public and Commercial 
            Services Union at Scottish Natural Heritage's (SNH) headquarters in 
            Edinburgh expressed their opposition to the forced relocation to Inverness 
            and will not transfer when their jobs move; notes that the remaining 
            30% will only move with improved and enhanced conditions; further 
            notes that this lack of staff support will impose a serious threat 
            to the long-term effectiveness and efficiency of SNH to carry out 
            its core function of protecting Scotland's natural heritage, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should stop this move before it brings 
            the Executive's worthwhile relocation policy further into disrepute.</P>

            organising the Edinburgh and Lothians Primary School Crystal Growing

            &quot;Science and the Parliament&quot; event on Wednesday 12 November

          <p><strong>S2M-578#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Unity 
            Enterprise Glasgow Airport</strong>-That the Parliament commends Unity 
            Enterprise, a registered charity, which provides education, training, 
            work experience and other assistance to young people and adults who 
            have disabilities and disadvantages of one kind or another; notes 
            in particular the helpful and practical assistance given by a group 
            of such young people and adults to passengers at Glasgow Airport, 
            especially the help shown to those individuals who have to use wheelchairs, 
            in relation to shopping requirements, visits to cafes and toilets 
            and the company offered to passengers in allocated areas; believes 
            that this is both a comfort to travellers and offers a useful introduction 
            to the workplace for those who are themselves disadvantaged, and therefore 
            considers that the Scottish Executive and other appropriate agencies 
            should do what they can in order to extend similar services to other 
            airports, bus terminals and railway stations.</P>

            the Centre for Scottish Public Policy for its recent report and discussion 
            paper <em>Working Together for a Sustainable Scotland</em>; recognises 
            the need to improve both the Scottish Executive's and the Parliament's 
            handling of sustainable development; calls on the Executive to produce 
            a comprehensive sustainable development strategy and to create a sustainable 
            development unit within the First Minister's office; considers that 
            a sustainable development committee of the Parliament should be established 
            to monitor progress and audit the impact of policies, legislation 
            and processes upon sustainable development, and calls upon the Executive 
            to apply strategic environmental assessment to Scottish Enterprise 
            and local enterprise networks as an early priority.</P>

            closure of the Queen Mother's Hospital and subsequently services at 
            the Royal Hospital for Sick Children and the adverse effect that this 
            will have on maternity and children's services throughout Scotland, 
            and considers that the Minister for Health and Community Care, Malcolm
