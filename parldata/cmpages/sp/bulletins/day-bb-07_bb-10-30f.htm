          <p><strong>*S3M-722</strong> <strong>Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Early Years and Early Intervention</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of early years policy in delivering improved outcomes for children and young people; believes that early intervention has a crucial role to play in reducing inequalities, particularly in health and education, but also more widely;  welcomes the intention to develop a long-term early years strategy; agrees that parenting, support for families and community capacity-building are areas which require a strong focus; believes that services must work more closely together to support children and families, and highlights the importance of a highly skilled and collaborative workforce in delivering a new strategic approach to early years policy.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-721</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Social Work Cuts Force Frail Fife Pensioners to Stay in Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses profound concern that frail and vulnerable patients in Fife who have been clinically assessed as being suitable for return to their own homes or to a residential home are being denied the right to do so as a consequence of the policy change of the SNP and Liberal Democrat-led Fife Council, where a package of &pound;600,000 cuts has been made to the social work budget; further notes that these cuts have resulted in at least one patient dying while in hospital against his will and that despite clinicians saying that he could go home he died before he could do so because of the policy decisions of the council; observes that there has been a dramatic increase since July 2007 in the number of beds being blocked for patients waiting for vital surgery, with the outcome that savings made by Fife Council are being transferred to NHS Fife, resulting in no overall saving for taxpayers who instead now have to cope with the personal tragedies that are impacting on patients, with the additional  possibility that the beds being blocked will reduce capacity as clinicians seek to prepare plans for winter when increases in flu and chest infections can rise to very high levels, depending on a variety of circumstances, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to intervene in the outrageous situation where the savings by the SNP and Liberal Democrat-controlled council has not resulted in net savings to the taxpayer but has instead caused unnecessary misery and anxiety to the patients and relatives concerned.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-720</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>First Minister&rsquo;s Letters to Burman, Iranian and Zimbabwean Leaders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its most profound condemnation of the First Minister, Alex Salmond MSP, who chose to write letters to the governments of some of the most despotic, repressive, undemocratic, villainous regimes in the world: Iran, Burma and Zimbabwe; notes that the First Minister wrote each letter in personal terms, also stating &quot;I would hope we would be able to count on your government&rsquo;s support...Please do not hesitate to contact me if you or your government wish to discuss these issues further&quot; and signed &quot;Best wishes, Alex&quot;; further censures the First Minister for having written at all to these governments which are the most vilified and dangerous regimes in the world; applauds the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, who has led the calls for there to be a coalition of countries mounting stricter international sanctions with a complete economic boycott against Zimbabwe, highlighting the BBC Newsnight report from Zimbabwe that exposed drastic food shortages with empty food shelves, inflation above 7,500%, infant mortality, average life expectancies in the mid-30s and poor living conditions in townships, lack of power supplies and shocking poverty; congratulates Prime Minister Gordon Brown for saying that he will ensure that he and all of his ministers will boycott the EU International  Governmental Conference to be held on 18 December 2007 if President Mugabe is invited to attend, and hopes that folks across Scotland from all walks of life, especially churches, trade unionists and students, will demonstrate solidarity with innocent victims in the regimes of Burma, Iran and Zimbabwe and light a candle on 18 December 2007 for our friends in these countries, especially Father Robert in Zimbabwe who visited and cared for the Parish of Lochgelly in the summer of 2006 for whom we now pray, as we pray for all the innocent victims in these countries.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-719</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Date for Removal of Forth Road Bridge Tolls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is gravely concerned that for thousands of drivers heading north into Fife and further destinations queuing for up to two hours has become a fact of life during weekend road works on the Forth Road Bridge; is mindful that, although a Bill is proceeding through the Parliament, no date has been set for removal of the bridge tolls, and expresses deep regret that, despite the SNP having been in government for six months, drivers continue to experience on a weekly basis a situation of longer and longer delays with all the consequences to the social and economic lives of our people.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-718</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>British Heart Foundation Scotland&rsquo;s Heart 2 Heart Appeal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the ongoing British Heart Foundation (BHF) Scotland&rsquo;s Heart 2 Heart appeal to raise &pound;500,000 to provide specialist heart failure nurses for the Highlands and encourages MSPs and the public to do all they can to support it; is aware that heart failure is a serious and debilitating condition, for which there is no cure, affecting around 100,000 people across Scotland; notes that SIGN guideline 95 on the management of chronic heart failure recommends the provision of home-based specialist nurse-led services, which have been shown to reduce unnecessary rehospitalisation for seriously ill patients, as well as cutting premature mortality; believes that every patient experiencing heart failure who requires access to a community-based specialist heart failure nursing service should receive it, and urges NHS boards, the Scottish Government and charities like BHF Scotland to continue to work together on its provision, especially on ensuring that sustainable and viable funding for this crucial service in every part of the country is secured for the future.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-717</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Libraries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hamilton Central Library on its centenary; notes the continued contribution made by it and the numerous libraries founded by Andrew Carnegie in his homeland; believes that the public library system remains indispensable to this day to improving literacy and in extending access to factual information and the arts to all Scots, and notes the boost given by more recent advances in library provision such as the Bookstart initiative and the People&rsquo;s Network.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-716</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Organic Food</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent findings of the EU-funded Quality Low Input Food study that organic food contains fewer of the compounds that are harmful and more of those that are beneficial to health than conventionally cultivated produce; notes that the four-year, &pound;12 million project involved growing fruit and vegetables and rearing cattle on adjacent organic and non-organic sites across Europe and concluded, for example, that 40% more antioxidants could be found in organic fruit and vegetables than in non-organic varieties, while organic milk can contain up to 60% more antioxidants and desirable fatty acids than conventionally produced milk; further notes that the findings of such a large-scale study call into question the current position of the Food Standards Agency that the balance of current scientific evidence does not support the view that organically produced food is more nutritious than other food, and believes that the Scottish Government should step up its support for organic produce in light of this new EU-funded research.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-715</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>School Placements</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the recent ruling by the Court of Session that there is no provision in the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 for school placement requests in respect of children with additional support needs and believes that the Parliament must undertake a review of the Act to ensure that placement requests for all such children are treated equally under the law and that, if appropriate, the law is amended to ensure that this happens.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-714</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Reverse Auctions on Social Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the practice of reverse auctions, whereby a ceiling price is put on a commodity and bidders are invited to tender for goods or services at a lower price; notes that this is being used by some of Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities, including South Lanarkshire Council, as a method of obtaining services in relation to social and personal care for people requiring such services, and believes that such a methodology is completely inappropriate for securing services directly impacting on vulnerable people in Scotland&rsquo;s communities, that such tendering methods should not be used and that it is morally repugnant for such a system to be used for the provision of social care services in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-713</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Freedom of the City of Glasgow for Aung San Suu Kyi</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of Glasgow&rsquo;s Lord Provost, Councillor Robert Winter, to recommend Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratically elected leader of Burma who has been under house arrest since 1990, for the Freedom of the City of Glasgow in recognition of her achievements in the service of democracy, as a further signal of Scotland&rsquo;s support for her immediate release and restoration of Burmese democracy; congratulates Glasgow Women&rsquo;s Library and Amnesty International Scotland for their successful campaign; calls on all parties and civic organisations in Glasgow to support the Lord Provost&rsquo;s initiative, and further calls on the Scottish Government to work with the UK Government to highlight the situation in Burma and campaign for an end to oppression.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-712</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Disappointment at Labour Group Voting Against Rescue Package for Scotland&rsquo;s Farmers and Crofters</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave disappointment at the disgraceful actions of the Labour group in voting against the motion on 24 October 2007 supporting a &pound;25 million rescue package for Scottish farmers and crofters affected by the foot-and-mouth outbreak; notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s aid package is twice the size of that of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for England while Scotland&rsquo;s industry is half the size; condemns Hilary Benn MP, the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for snubbing NFU Scotland, and believes that the betrayal of London Labour and Scottish Labour alike will not be forgiven by Scotland&rsquo;s farming and crofting communities.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-711#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>The St Margaret of Scotland Hospice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the outstanding care provided for terminally ill and frail elderly patients by the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice in the 57 years since its foundation; notes with concern the uncertainty faced by Scotland&rsquo;s largest hospice as a result of proposals to remove places for the care of frail elderly people with complex needs, and believes that NHS Greater Glasgow and Scottish ministers should be made aware of the very strong support that exists for St Margaret&rsquo;s in Clydebank and throughout the west of Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-710</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Peace in the Middle East</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that peace in the Middle East can only be achieved through the establishment of a viable Palestinian state which recognises Israel&rsquo;s right to exist within secure borders; is aware that significant difficulties would remain, partly due to the continuing ramifications of the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement which aligned middle-eastern boundaries to suit the perceived interests of the British and French empires, taking no account whatsoever of the ethnic, linguistic and religious differences on the ground; notes that one of the most pressing issues is the statelessness of the Kurdish people; accepts that stability is not possible while 25 to 30 million Kurds are denied the right to self determination; believes that the claims made by the &quot;Coalition of the Willing&quot; regarding its aim of establishing democracy in Iraq are hollow unless Iraqi Kurds, of whom 99% plus support independence for Iraqi Kurdistan, are allowed to determine their own future and recover the lands from which they were ethnically cleansed by Saddam Hussein; considers that those regions of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey where Kurds form a majority of the population should be allowed, under UN auspices, to vote for the establishment of an independent, unified and democratic Kurdistan; agrees that forcing Iraqi Sunni and Shia Arabs to live together in one state against their wishes is futile, and accepts that allowing Arab Iraq to partition along sectarian lines might be the surest road to securing long-term peace in that tormented country.</p>
