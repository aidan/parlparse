<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7016 Bill Kidd: Imminent Trident Decision Still Pending</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that, although it has been reported that the main gate decision on replacing the Trident system will be put back beyond the next UK general election, from 2014 to 2015, another decision, the initial gate, is due to be made by the end of 2010; notes that this decision could authorise the spending of billions of pounds over the next four to five years, and considers that such a decision would effectively cut billions of spending from public services and the non-nuclear defence sector.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7015 Christine Grahame on behalf of the Health and Sport Committee: Report on clinical portal and telehealth development in NHS Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Health and Sport Committee&rsquo;s 3rd Report, 2010 (Session 3): <em>Clinical portal and telehealth development in NHS Scotland (SP Paper 399)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7014 Richard Baker: Solicitor of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Frank Maguire of Thompsons Solicitors on being named Solicitor of the Year at the Law Awards of Scotland 2010; recognises that he has received the award in light of his legal expertise and political commitment; notes that he has worked with members of Parliament from across all parties particularly to improve and protect the rights of workers with asbestos-related disease, and congratulates all the winners at this year&rsquo;s awards and the organisers on the success of the event.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7013 Liam McArthur: The Closure of Orkney Today</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with disappointment the news that the Orkney Media Group is to close the award-winning <em>Orkney Today</em> newspaper, which is the current Highlands and Islands Newspaper of the Year; believes that the newspaper has become an important feature of Orkney life and its distinctive style and coverage of local events will be missed by Orcadians; hopes that those affected by the closure will be able to find other employment opportunities in Orkney, and commends the editors, journalists and their support staff for the service that they have given to the Orkney community over the lifetime of the newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7012 Stewart Maxwell: Increasing Participation in Scottish Youth Football</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Scottish Youth Football Association (SYFA) in its move to allow teams participating in all of the age groups that it administers to use more than three substitutions per match; shares the concerns expressed by the SYFA and, it believes, most senior youth football clubs that the current rule means that there are fewer opportunities for young players to get involved on match days; agrees with the SYFA&rsquo;s concerns that the current position makes young people less likely to stay involved in the sport and that this makes it more difficult for local teams to maintain the large squad of players that they require, including at times, such as exam periods, when a large number of players are likely to be absent; considers that youth football should be primarily about maximising participation, not only to aid the development of players, but also to encourage young people to stay active through sport, and calls on the Scottish Football Association to back the SYFA&rsquo;s move to allow up to five rolling substitutions per match for youth teams up to the age of 21.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7005 Kenneth Gibson: Impact of Changes to the UK Benefit System</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the publication of a recent report by the Scottish Local Government Forum Against Poverty regarding the impact on people, local authorities and the economy of the proposed changes to the UK benefits system; is alarmed that official government sources show that Scotland stands to lose up to &pound;614 million from its economy over the next few years, which could result in the loss of as many as 14,220 jobs; considers that such job losses would place an enormous strain on local authorities as the demand for social work, housing and advice services increases at a time when they are expected to cut current spending levels by up to 25%; is deeply concerned that, in an effort to meet the demand for the aforementioned services, other valuable services such as education, leisure and cleaning will inevitably suffer; further considers that the impending changes will place a huge financial strain on some of the poorest and most vulnerable in society at a time when unemployment is high, higher education places are scarce and living costs are rising as a result of higher than anticipated inflation and the forthcoming VAT increase; is perturbed by the scale and severity of proposed benefit cuts, which are likely to see Scots lose a total of over &pound;27 million in Local Housing Allowance, &pound;260 million in Disability Living Allowance and &pound;235 million in Incapacity Benefit over four years, &pound;48 million in Child Benefit annually, while over-65-year-olds face losing a total of &pound;28 million per year in Attendance Allowance; believes, in light of the economic climate, that the UK Government should look more closely at the implications of such drastic cuts and should instead seek to grow the economy by furnishing the Scottish Parliament with full fiscal autonomy.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7003 Kenneth Gibson: NHS Ayrshire and Arran Street Nurse Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates NHS Ayrshire and Arran on its Street Nurse initiative, developed as part of the Healthy North Ayrshire programme;  applauds this initiative for its work on improving health awareness by allowing the people of North Ayrshire to share their concerns with a Street Nurse who is able to give health information and advice on the spot and can also provide onward referral to community services if appropriate; recognises the value of what it considers this innovative approach to community engagement and health improvement, which deploys the Healthy North Ayrshire nursing team to work in local regeneration communities and directly with groups that are known to experience poorer health and wellbeing to carry out rapid lifestyle assessments, and is supportive of this scheme and its delivery of key health information to those who may be at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7002 Ken Macintosh: Lack of Support</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Government to reconcile the First Minister&rsquo;s programme for government, in which he talked of continuing to support the armed forces and veterans&rsquo; community, with the actions of SNP backbencher Christine Grahame MSP; considers that Ms Grahame displayed insensitivity and unfairness in trying to use the example of a visit by a Royal Navy officer and parent in East Renfrewshire to his local nursery as an example of the armed forces allegedly recruiting three and four-year-olds; further asks ministers to explain how this behaviour displays support for the armed services, and calls on Ms Grahame to apologise to the officer concerned and to the people of Neilston for the offence that it considers that she has caused.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7001 Liam McArthur: Orkney Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the recent study by Save the Children into the gap in the educational success between children from low-income homes and their peers found that Orkney had the second lowest gap in Scotland, with its 20% under a third of the Scottish average; considers that, while this still leaves a gap to be closed, the lower figure reflects the successful way that Orkney&rsquo;s education service tackles the challenge of overcoming the disadvantages that pupils from low-income homes all too often suffer - through quality pupil support, engagement and support of parents and committed teaching that involves and inspires children; believes that that is one of the reasons that 94% of Orkney pupils go on to positive destinations such as higher and further education, vocational training or work and is one of the best rates in Scotland, and considers that, while Save the Children is to be commended for highlighting this issue, its recycling of a generic headline when regionalising its press campaign, so that it claims that Orkney has a &quot;scandalous&quot; education gap, undermines the credibility of its work and is yet another unfortunate example of central belt-based bodies taking a one-size-fits-all approach, an approach that all too often discriminates against Scotland&rsquo;s islands.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-6732# Linda Fabiani: Richard Demarco, 80 Years Young</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes and celebrates the 80th birthday of Richard Demarco, one of Scotland&rsquo;s leading figures in art promotion and an advocate for contemporary art for decades; further notes that he has promoted cross-cultural links, taking Scottish artists abroad and bringing other European artists here, making a particular contribution to the understanding of Eastern European art between 1968 and 1989 with his journeys behind the Iron Curtain, that he was a co-founder of the Traverse Theatre in 1963 before going on to found his own gallery and the Demarco European Art Foundation, that he has been involved with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in one way or another since its inception and that he has made a contribution to the academic understanding of Scottish and European culture through his lecture work, including his professorship at Kingston University in London; also notes that his drawings, paintings and prints are held in more than 1,200 collections and that his 80th birthday will be marked by a major exhibition in the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA) from 28 November 2010 to 17 January 2011, highlighting Mr Demarco&rsquo;s collaboration with other artists and featuring works from Magdalena Abakanowicz, Marina Abramovicz, David Mach, Alistair Maclennan, Gunther Uecker, Ainslie Yule, Joseph Beuys, Tadeusz Kantor, Mario Merz and Paul Neagu; further notes that this honour afforded by the RSA comes on top of other honours bestowed on Richard Demarco, including the Polish Gold Order of Merit, the Cavaliere della Republica d&rsquo;Italia, the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres de France and a CBE; congratulates him on his achievements to date; looks forward to more to come, and wishes him many happy returns on his 80th birthday.</p>
