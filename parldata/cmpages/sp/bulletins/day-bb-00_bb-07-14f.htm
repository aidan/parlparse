          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1104</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: Failings of New 
            Deal</strong>-That the Parliament notes the findings by the National Institute 
            for Economic and Social Research that 80% of the jobs filled by the 
            New Deal would have been there if the New Deal did not exist; notes 
            with concern that only one fifth of the Scottish New Deal budget has 
            been spent so far; seeks an assurance that what is left of the money 
            will be applied effectively, and calls for responsibility for the 
            New Deal and the remainder of its budget in Scotland to be transferred 
            to the Scottish Parliament.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1103#</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Skye Bridge 
            Toll Regime</strong>-That the Parliament notes the opinion of Professor 
            Robert Black QC that the Assignation Statement in respect of the Skye 
            Bridge is not signed and not dated, and that it therefore may not 
            be a lawful document; notes that a lack of valid authority could mean 
            that tolls have been demanded illegally and people wrongly prosecuted 
            and convicted for not paying their tolls, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should undertake an urgent review of the legal status of 
            the Skye Bridge toll regime in the interests of justice.</font></p>

            Bridge</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the A95 bridge over the 
            South Esk at Montrose is nearing the end of its life span; supports 
            Angus Council in its efforts to replace this vital lifeline, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should provide funding or extra capital 
            borrowing consent for this project.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1101#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Richard

            Richard Demarco on the opening of his exhibition The Road to Meikle 
            Seggie, celebrating the achievements of his career as an artist, impresario, 
            teacher and philosopher, as an inspiration to many other artists and 
            art lovers, as a champion of human rights through the transformational 
            power of art in society and as an ambassador for Edinburgh and Scotland, 
            and urges the Scottish Executive to initiate discussions between the 
            Scottish Arts Council and the City of Edinburgh Council to ensure 
            that suitable premises are found in Edinburgh for the storage, study 
            and display of his extensive archives.</font></p>

            Games, July 2000</strong>-That the Parliament notes Aberdeen's success 
            in attracting the 13<sup>th</sup> annual World Corporate Games, in 
            terms of health by encouraging the &quot;Fit for Work, Fit for Life&quot; 
            ethos amongst employees and by promoting the profile and economy of 
            the North East; further notes that the 10,000 competitors are expected 
            to contribute approximately &#163;6 million to the local economy, 
            and hopes that the competitors, who originate from up to 40 different 
            countries around the world, return to visit this beautiful city and
