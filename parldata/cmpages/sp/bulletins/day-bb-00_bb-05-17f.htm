    Caring City International Relief Aid&quot; on raising the remarkable sum of £2 million
    worth of aid for Kosovo and conveys its admiration for the heartening manner in which
    three faiths have worked together in this humanitarian project, namely the Church of
    Scotland, centred on Cathcart Old Church, the congregation of the Mosque in Glasgow and

    of unemployment, education failure, serious health problems and population loss affecting
    the city of Glasgow; recognises that these are testament to the failure of the Labour
    local authorities to address these problems over two generations; further notes that the
    response of the Labour Government and the Scottish Executive has to date been inadequate
    to deal with these problems; asks the Executive to address these problems in Glasgow as a
    matter of urgency; requests that the Executive specifically notes the failure of the
    existing local government system to cope adequately with Glasgow&#146;s problems; urges
    the Executive to institute appropriate steps to allow for a democratically and directly
    elected Lord Provost for the city with an executive role; further urges the Executive to
    appoint a Minister, from within its Ministerial team, with specific responsibility for
    Glasgow whose remit would include liaison with departmental ministers, the newly elected
    Provost, the city council and all agencies connected with the regeneration of Glasgow, and
    believes that the Parliament should set up a Committee, comprising all Glasgow Members, to
    oversee the performance of that Minister, thus ensuring that Glasgow&#146;s problems
    receive the attention which they not only deserve but are necessary to ensure the
