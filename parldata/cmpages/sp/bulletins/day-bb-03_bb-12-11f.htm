          <p><strong>*S2M-725#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Danger 
            Faced By Iraqi Trade Unionists</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned 
            to hear of the appeal by the Iraqi Federation of Workers Trade Unions 
            (IFTU), which tells of a raid by dozens of US troops in 10 armoured 
            cars on the IFTU temporary headquarters in Baghdad on Saturday 6 December 
            2003, where windows were smashed, documents seized, posters and banners 
            condemning terrorism torn down, eight IFTU leaders arrested but subsequently 
            released and no reason or explanation given for the raid, and supports 
            the call of the IFTU for President Bush to conduct a full investigation 
            into the raid and to ensure that it will not be repeated and for the 
            United States of America to respect the right of workers under international 
            law to form free and independent trade unions.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-724</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>Supreme 
            Court</strong>-That the Parliament calls upon Her Majesty's Government, 
            in the event of a United Kingdom Supreme Court being created, to ensure 
            that both Scottish judges are appointed to sit in all civil appeals 
            from Scotland and that decisions of the Supreme Court in non-Scottish 
            cases are not binding in Scots law except in so far as the law determining 
            such cases is applicable on a United Kingdom basis.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-723</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Banks, 
            Credit Companies and Loan Sharks</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the recently announced measures designed to (a) control the unseemly 
            practices of banks and other agencies that encourage people to take 
            on financial burdens that they can ill afford and (b) pursue the loan 
            sharks, who batten upon poor people, whom the banks ignore, and inflict 
            upon them scandalously high levels of interest; believes that there 
            is no place for such activities in Scotland in the 21st century, and 
            supports the Scottish Executive, Her Majesty's Government and local 
            authorities who are introducing measures that will drive these loan 
            sharks from the streets whilst at the same time encouraging those 
            in debt to approach the appropriate agencies for help in dealing with 
            this serious problem.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-722</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>The 
            Commonwealth and Zimbabwe</strong>-That the Parliament commends those 
            Commonwealth leaders who stood firmly against the lifting of the suspension 
            of Zimbabwe from the organisation; is of the view that that stance 
            will hearten Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition and currently 
            on trial in that country, and will also send a message of hope to 
            Mr Tsvangirai's colleagues, trade unionists, journalists and others 
            who have been brave enough to oppose President Mugabe's oppressive 
            regime, but believes, at the same time, that more affluent Commonwealth 
            nations have to do much, much more in order to help eradicate the 
            grinding poverty that blights the lives of so many Commonwealth citizens 
            and, if there is a failure of political will in this regard, then 
            those suffering people will inevitably question the value, or the 
            point, of membership of the organisation.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-721</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Smoking 
            Ban in Shopping Centre Concourse</strong>-That the Parliament applauds 
            the decision by the Avenue Shopping Centre in Newton Mearns to ban 
            smoking from the common areas of the centre; appreciates the rights 
            of units within the centre to make their own decision, but points 
            out that this decision is based on public demand, and encourages other 
            shopping centres and the units within the Avenue Shopping Centre to 
            follow the example set.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-718.1</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Reform 
            of Public Services</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-718) in 
            the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;rejects the proposals by the Conservative 
            Party to privatise our public services and deplores the continued 
            use of PPP/PFI to fund our public services by the current Labour/Liberal 
            Democrat Scottish Executive; believes that the developing crisis in 
            the NHS will only be addressed by increasing the capacity of the NHS 
            to treat more patients and reduce waiting times through effective 
            policies to recruit and retain staff within the NHS in Scotland, and 
            calls for a national debate on the way forward for the health service 
            in Scotland.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-718.2</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Reform 
            of Public Services</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-718) in 
            the name of David McLetchie, leave out from second &quot;the&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;the crucial role played by low-paid public 
            sector workers in delivering high quality services in often stressful 
            situations; notes however, that they are poorly rewarded for their 
            efforts; recognises that the time has come for radical reform of public 
            services so that they can play a fuller role in eradicating poverty 
            and social exclusion; believes, therefore, that the Scottish Executive 
            should reverse the privatisation of public services involved in PFI 
            and PPP and ensure that all public services are directing their main 
            efforts into reducing the inequalities caused by poverty and discrimination, 
            and further believes that the Executive should introduce a £7.50 an 
            hour minimum pay level for all public sector workers in Scotland, 
            call a moratorium on the centralisation of hospital services which 
            reduces access to maternity, accident and emergency and other health 
            services for those living in our most deprived and isolated communities 
            and instigate a full, democratic and inclusive public debate to establish 
            the real health needs of communities and the resources and measures 
            required to meet those needs.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-718.3</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Reform 
            of Public Services</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-718) in 
            the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;supports the radical, demanding and relevant 
            agenda set out in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> including 
            the delivery of excellent public services that put patients, pupils 
            and victims first, ensure equality of access across urban and rural 
            Scotland, devolve decision-making to front-line staff, establish national 
            standards on which local excellence can be built, backed by inspection, 
            and share best practice and action to tackle and turn around poor 
            performance.&quot;</P>
