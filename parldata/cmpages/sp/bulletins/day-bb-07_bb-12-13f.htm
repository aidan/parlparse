<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1033&diams; </strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Regional Transport Strategies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the early successes of regional transport partnerships (RTPs) in planning and delivering effective transport infrastructure and services to meet the needs of people and business across Scotland, such as the bus improvement initiatives delivered in the north east under Nestrans; recognises that RTPs can play a unique role in delivering cohesive transport strategies across local authority boundaries by working in partnership with local authorities, the Scottish Government and the wider transport industry; welcomes the view of the SNP in opposition that RTPs must be given &quot;the maximum possible powers&quot; and secure funding; notes that seven regional transport strategies were submitted to the government by 31 March 2007, due to be approved or returned within the three month period stated in <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Transport Future: Guidance on Regional Transport Strategies</em>; regrets that the Scottish Government has failed to approve or return any of the strategies; further regrets that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget shows that the levels of capital and revenue that have either been allocated to transport or rolled up in the local authority settlement from previous transport budgets falls far short of that required to make significant improvements to transport, and therefore considers that the uncertainty over the future of regional transport in Scotland can be ended&nbsp;by approval or return of the regional transport strategies, with adequate explanation being given if strategies are returned, and provision to RTPs of sufficient capital and revenue funding to deliver transport improvements effectively.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1032</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Wi-Fi on Public Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by National Express that free wi-fi connection will be available to all passengers on the east coast rail passenger service; further welcomes the earlier announcement by Scottish Citylink regarding free wi-fi on its route between Edinburgh and Glasgow; recognises that such initiatives have a vital role to play in enabling flexible working, increased productivity and in reducing traffic congestion by encouraging modal shift, and, in light of these benefits, calls on the Scottish Executive to examine ways of encouraging other transport operators to consider the introduction of wi-fi on their services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1031</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>MS Society&rsquo;s Putting the Pieces Together Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland&rsquo;s &quot;Putting the Pieces Together&quot; campaign to raise awareness of the impact of multiple sclerosis on people&rsquo;s lives; notes that it is estimated that around 10,500 people in Scotland have MS, the highest incidence anywhere in the world, and that women between the ages of 20 and 40 are most likely to be diagnosed with the condition; further notes that, despite being the most commonly diagnosed neurological condition among young adults in Scotland, MS remains a largely unknown or misunderstood condition, and calls on the Scottish Government to develop its support for people with MS and, in particular, to ensure that the MS Register is established as soon as possible in order to provide a fuller picture of the condition in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1030</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>The Big Lottery Giveaway - Victory for Connect2</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the outcome of the vote for the People&rsquo;s &pound;50 million Lottery Giveaway from the Big Lottery Fund which has been won by the Connect2 project proposed by Sustrans to revitalise walking and cycling in 79 communities across the United Kingdom by creating new routes for everyday journeys, with crossings and bridges to be created over busy roads, railway lines and rivers, linking into new networks of local paths to get people where they want to go; notes that the project will benefit 79 different communities across the UK, including a pedestrian and cycle bridge over the Tay linking Muirton in Perth with Quarrymill Woodland Park in Scone, the Bridge to Nowhere in Glasgow, cycle links between Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse and connecting two railway paths in Dumfries via the Nith Viaduct; believes that, as a result of Connect2&rsquo;s victory, millions will be able to travel in a healthy and environmentally friendly way to shops, school, work and leisure, bringing people closer together, making journeys quicker, more convenient and better for the environment, and congratulates everyone involved in developing these great projects and securing the funding needed to bring them into being.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1029</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Councillors&rsquo; Freedom to Vote without Reprisals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the differing views over the proposed development of a golf resort by the Trump Organisation; regardless of opinions on the development itself, considers that local councillors who exercise a role in the planning system must be free to vote as they see fit in the circumstances; therefore considers that the removal of Councillor Martin Ford from his role on Aberdeenshire Council&rsquo;s Infrastructure Services Committee represents a dangerous precedent for the planning system as a whole, and calls on the Scottish Government to consider what steps can be taken to ensure that local councillors are able in future to exercise their planning functions with independence and without fear of reprisals.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1028</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Scottish Wheelchair Users and their Human Rights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends <em>The Herald</em> for alerting the public to the ofttimes severe distress and denial of human rights inflicted upon Scottish wheelchair users by the insensitive, penny-pinching and uncaring approach by those in authority to their legitimate expectations and requirements anent the design of wheelchairs and their manufacture, adaptability to individual needs and maintenance programmes; notes that the charity, Quarriers, has stated that, of 105 wheelchair users recently interviewed, over 50 said that their wheelchairs were unfit for purpose and is firmly of the view that this state of affairs is unacceptable in modern Scotland; believes that our wheelchair users should be provided with wheelchairs that equal the best provided elsewhere in Europe; calls on NHS Scotland, supported by the Scottish Executive, to implement forthwith the recommendations contained in the document <em>Moving Forward: Review of NHS Wheelchair and Seating Services in Scotland</em>, and reminds all such strategic decision-makers involved in these matters that the goal should be to offer the best services attainable so that Scottish wheelchair users can lead tolerable lives in their communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1027#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Tackling Homelessness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Glasgow Rent Deposit and Support Scheme (GRDSS), which enables homeless people to gain access to quality private rented accommodation by acting as an independent third party providing landlords with a bond guarantee on tenants&rsquo; behalf and providing support for clients to enable them to remain in their tenancies; welcomes the GRDSS befriending service aimed at supporting previously homeless people to integrate into the community by way of providing access to social activities and regular contact with volunteers, and acknowledges that these services are essential if we are to eradicate homelessness and offer those taken off the streets hope for the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1026#</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Lady Victoria Colliery - Our Most Treasured Place</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the public poll organised by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland to find Scotland&rsquo;s most treasured place from its archive of images as a prelude to its centenary celebrations in 2008; welcomes the funding support for the initiative from the Heritage Lottery Fund; commends the engagement with the public which this competition represents; congratulates the former Lady Victoria Colliery in Newtongrange, now the home of the Scottish Mining Museum, on coming first in the public vote; notes that the colliery is Europe&rsquo;s best preserved 19th century pit complex, has been awarded VisitScotland&rsquo;s Five Star Excellence Award for four consecutive years and is denoted as being of national or international significance by Historic Scotland; considers the colliery to be a hugely important part of Scotland&rsquo;s industrial heritage; notes that a report from a structural engineer has identified that the buildings are increasingly fragile and require &pound;2.5 million to preserve them, and believes that the necessary steps should be taken to ensure that the fabric of the colliery buildings is secured for the enjoyment and education of future generations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1025</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Healthy and Sustainable Food for the 2014 Commonwealth Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the new report, <em>Feeding the Olympics</em>, jointly published by the Soil Association, Sustain and the New Economics Foundation, which calls on London to deliver the promise to be the greenest and healthiest games in terms of the food that it provides and sets out how this can be done; recognises that food plays a vital role in climate change, since a sizeable contribution to Scotland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions is made by unsustainable systems of food production and distribution; believes that these emissions can be significantly reduced if we shift towards eating organic, local, fresh, and seasonal food and less meat and dairy products, moves which would also help to ensure a healthy future for the young people across Scotland who grow up inspired by the games; further believes that the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Scotland provide an excellent opportunity to promote healthy and sustainable food, and calls on the Scottish Government, therefore, to ensure that the Soil Association&rsquo;s food for life targets of 75% unprocessed, 50% local and 30% organic food should be set as a minimum standard for catering contracts at the games, alongside the promotion of sustainable fish consumption and a guarantee that any imported food at the games meets fairtrade standards.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1023</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Climate Change Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the principle of introducing for the United Kingdom as a whole statutory targets and a related framework for action to mitigate climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions as set out in the Climate Change Bill, introduced in the House of Lords on 14 November 2007, and agrees that the provisions in the Bill which fall within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1022#</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Save the Children Report, &quot;Robbing Peter to Pay Paul&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by Save the Children of <em>Robbing Peter to Pay Paul</em>, an assessment of how limited access to affordable credit hurts families and children living in poverty, many of whom live in Central Scotland; notes the findings of this assessment that amongst those in poverty 42% have been seriously behind with repaying bills or credit commitments in the past year, compared with just 4% of those not in poverty, while 36% of low-income credit card users have been exposed to penalty charges; further notes that nearly 60% of low-income families have no savings and that many of those in poverty are using doorstep lenders who charge a typical 183% interest each year; notes that the assessment finds that the impact on families unable to source affordable credit is severe, with large numbers reporting an inability to make even modest savings or replace worn-out furniture or send children on school trips; further notes that the findings also conclude that the social impact of this poverty is severe, with significant numbers reporting ill effects on physical and mental health and relationships between partners and with children; commends Save the Children for its work in this area; commits itself to the eradication of poverty and improving access to affordable credit for all of Scotland&rsquo;s citizens, and believes that serious active consideration should be given to the recommendations made by Save the Children for tackling these problems, as set out in <em>Robbing Peter to Pay Paul</em>.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1021</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>University of the West of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Principal Seamus McDaid, the staff and students of the University of the West of Scotland on the university&rsquo;s successful launch which will build on the work of Bell College and Paisley University and looks forward to seeing the University continue to develop in Ayr, Dumfries, Hamilton and Paisley.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1020</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent Greenpeace report, <em>Cooking the Climate; </em>condemns the rapid destruction of Indonesia&rsquo;s tropical forests for the sake of palm oil; understands that the rate of Indonesia&rsquo;s deforestation, 2% a year, is the highest in the world; notes that using biofuels such as palm oil, whose production is associated with peatland destruction, will be worse for the climate than continuing to rely on fossil fuels; demands reconsideration of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) which stipulates that a proportion of fuel sales must come from biofuels by April 2008, without requiring any guarantee of sustainability; believes, therefore, that the RTFO does nothing to prevent the kind of environmental devastation taking place in Indonesia; calls on the Scottish Government and the UK Government to postpone the implementation of the RTFO until sustainability standards are in place, and believes that the fact that there is currently no internationally agreed definition of a sustainable biofuel is no justification for ongoing deforestation.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1017.2</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Civil Liberties</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1017) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave out from &quot;are secure&quot; to &quot;accountable to the Parliament&quot; and insert &quot;comply with the principles of data protection, namely that personal information must be fairly and lawfully processed, processed for limited purposes, adequate, relevant and not excessive, accurate and up to date, not kept for longer than necessary, processed in line with individuals&rsquo; rights, secure and not transmitted to other countries without adequate protection, and that audit of data under its jurisdiction is independent of government and accountable to the Parliament; further calls on the Scottish Government to review plans for Scottish Citizens Accounts on the basis of these principles&quot;.</p>
