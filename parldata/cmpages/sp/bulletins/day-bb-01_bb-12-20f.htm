          <p><strong>*S1M-2568</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: International 
            Year of Mountains</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 2002 is 
            the International Year of Mountains; supports the event's aim of raising 
            public awareness of the high ecological value and wider socio-economic 
            significance of mountains; recognises the global importance of Scotland's 
            mountainous areas, particularly their role in shaping the nation's 
            image and culture, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to support 
            the year's celebrations by fostering debate between local communities, 
            farming interests, rural businesses, public bodies, and non-governmental 
            organisations on how to maximise the mutual benefit from activities 
            aimed at safeguarding, enhancing and promoting enjoyment of Scotland's 
            mountain heritage.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2567</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie: Death of Stuart

            Adamson; acknowledges the invaluable contribution he made to contemporary 
            popular music in Scotland, particularly as lead singer with Big Country 
            and guitarist with The Skids; recognises the part he played in promoting 
            his home town of Dunfermline, and sends its condolences to his family.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2566 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Business Motion</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that for

            3 of the School Education (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill, debate on each 
            part of the proceedings, if not previously brought to a conclusion, 
            shall be brought to a conclusion at the following times (calculated

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2565 Margaret Smith on behalf of the Health and Community 
            Care Committee: Report on Hepatitis C</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to act upon, the recommendations 
            contained within the 17th Report 2001 of the Health and Community 
            Care Committee<i>, Report on Hepatitis C</i> (SP Paper 398). </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2564</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Citizens of a Multilingual 
            World</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the findings in the report 
            by the Action Group on Languages<i>, Citizens of a Multilingual World 
            </i>and the supportive statements made by Jack McConnell MSP when 
            Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs; notes however 
            the concerns of the Scottish Association of Language Teaching and 
            others regarding the delay in making the revised 5-14 curriculum guidance 
            available, which has hindered progress and much needed development 
            in modern languages in both the primary and secondary school sectors; 
            recognises that this regrettable delay in responding to the Group's 
            report, and the publication of Circular 3/2001<i>, Guidance on Flexibility 
            in the Curriculum</i>,<i> </i>in advance of this response, have led 
            to widespread speculation and misinterpretation of the principle of 
            "entitlement" as it is described in the Group's report, and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to end this uncertainty and pursue the 
            proposals in the report by means of a strategic implementation plan 
            without further delay and to provide local authorities and schools 
            with the responsibility and opportunity to improve language learning 
            throughout Scotland, so that each pupil and student is enabled to 
            fulfil his or her potential as a citizen of this multilingual world.</p>
