<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5094 Christina McKelvie: Better Value for Public Purse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Mail on securing a &pound;17 million contract with the Scottish Government for postal services; notes that this is a contract across 89 Scottish public sector organisations, thus guaranteeing the Royal Mail the custom from this wide range of bodies for the first time; considers that the delivery of this contract by Procurement Scotland will save the public purse nearly &pound;3 million per year, and further considers that the contract may help to protect the Royal Mail in the face of the hostility shown to it by the UK Government, including the deregulation of postal services nearly four years ago and epitomised by the comments of Pat McFadden MP in the House of Commons on 20 October 2009 that &quot;Competition exists in the postal service, and it will not go away and cannot be wished away. I want a Royal Mail that is fit to win in that market, rather than one that simply wishes competition to go away. The most fundamental challenge to Royal Mail is not competition from other mail companies but competition from other communications technologies. That must lie at the heart of the response to the threatened dispute.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5093&diams;   Brian Adam: Tax Incentives Needed for Oil and Gas Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by TAQA Bratani that it has started production on its first new North Sea oil well in the Cormorant field and also welcomes the announcement of a discovery of light oil in the West of Shetland by Hurricane Exploration PLC, the first time that a basement reservoir has been planned and drilled in the UK continental shelf as an exploration target; believes that these excellent examples show that further investment in the UK continental shelf can produce rewards; however notes with concern recent comments from Oil and Gas UK that 50,000 jobs could be put at risk if tax incentives are not created to increase investment and that offshore platforms, pipelines and infrastructure would fall into disrepair, and would therefore welcomefurther tax incentives for the oil and gas industry to protect investment and jobs in the north east and help drive the economy out of this recession.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5092 Bill Wilson: Ethical Procurement in the NHS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency publication, <em>Ethical Procurement for Health: Guidance</em>, a document for use by the NHS in England to promote stronger, fairer and more ethical trade in the health sector; considers that the need for such a publication was underlined by the findings of a recent delegation of the British Medical Association&rsquo;s Medical Fair and Ethical Trade Group to Pakistan, which found, amongst other things, that, in a single street in Sialkot, 10 children were at work making surgical instruments, including some as young as seven, and calls on NHS Scotland to use <em>Ethical Procurement for Health: Guidance</em> as the basis for developing similar guidance in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5091 Johann Lamont: Living Wage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow City Council on the success of the Glasgow Living Wage campaign; notes that already more than 100 companies have followed the lead of Scotland&rsquo;s largest local authority and signed up to a policy guaranteeing all employees a wage of at least &pound;7 per hour,&nbsp;and&nbsp;urges all local authorities to consider launching living wage campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5090 Bill Wilson: Support for the UN Goldstone Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes reports that the UN General Assembly will debate, from 4 November 2009, the UN report, <em>Human Rights In Palestine And Other Occupied Arab Territories</em>, <em>Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict</em>, which found both Israeli and Palestinian forces guilty of human rights violations; deplores the fact that the Government of Israel refused to cooperate with the UN mission; notes that Israeli violations listed in the report include the destruction of industrial infrastructure, food production, water installations, sewage treatment plants and housing, the use of white phosphorus, the use of civilians as human shields, reprisals against civilians, the collective punishment of civilians in Gaza for the detention of Gilad Shalit, the repression of dissent in Israel, including the restriction of access to information and the ill-treatment of human rights defenders, and also notes that the mission was &quot;of the view that the Israeli system overall presents inherently discriminatory features that make the pursuit of justice for Palestinian victims very difficult&quot; and that &quot;the current constitutional structure and legislation in Israel leaves very little room, if any, for Palestinians to seek compensation&quot;; further notes that Palestinian violations listed include not according Gilad Shalit his rights as a prisoner of war, internal violence and targeting of Fatah affiliates by security services under the control of the Gaza authorities and reprisals against civilians in the form of rocket attacks that have, among other things, adversely affected the right to education of children and adults living in southern Israel; calls on all member governments to support this comprehensive report, produced by a team headed by internationally respected Justice Richard Goldstone, and hopes that the Uniting for Peace Resolution (UNGA 377A) will be invoked, thus giving the General Assembly the same enforcement powers as those normally exercised by the Security Council where it can be said that US vetoes have consistently shielded Israel, and calls on all parties to cease human rights violations and make reparations for their past actions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5089 Iain Smith: Warm Homes, Green Jobs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Warm Homes, Green Jobs: The economic impacts of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act in the residential sector</em>, a report by the Association for the Conservation of Energy and commissioned by eaga Scotland, which concludes that achieving a 42% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from Scotland&rsquo;s homes by 2020 could create or safeguard over 10,000 jobs, deliver an additional value to the Scottish economy of over &pound;4 billion and contribute to lifting many Scots out of fuel poverty; notes however the report&rsquo;s conclusion that these benefits will not be realised unless investment in sustainable energy rises sharply, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that Scotland does not miss out on the benefits that achieving a 42% cut in climate change pollution from our homes can deliver.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5088 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Babies on Buses Campaign Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Babies on Buses campaigning mums on winning the Campaign of the Year Award at the 2009 Herald Society Awards in association with the Big Lottery Fund; recalls that the Babies on Buses campaign group was established when Lothian Buses refused access to anyone attempting to travel with an unfoldable pram or travel system; considers that the campaign has wide public, political, organisational and charity support and notes that it has been considered by the Public Petitions Committee; welcomes the move by Lothian Buses to trial pink-top buses that have a dedicated wheelchair space as well as a dedicated buggy or pram space, and calls on Lothian Buses to extend the pink-top pram-accessible buses to all services as soon as practicable, thus ensuring that it offers equal access for all.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-5087 Jim Tolson: Allotments, Community Gardens and Grow-your-own Projects</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society in its role supporting allotment holders and community gardens in Scotland, encouraging the development of new sites, enhancing biodiversity and preserving skills in gardening; acknowledges the valuable work carried out by other organisations in the promotion of community gardens and grow-your-own projects; recognises the links between green space, activity and good health and the social, financial, environmental and health benefits of gardening and growing one&rsquo;s own food; highlights the need to protect and enhance green spaces, particularly in urban and deprived areas; notes that Crossford Community Council, in conjunction with Crossford Allotment Association and the Carnegie Trust, is investigating the provision of land for allotments, community gardens and social enterprise, and hopes that local authorities and other public bodies examine ways of transferring land to local communities to be used for such projects.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5086 Liam McArthur: Impact on Fishermen of New Net-measuring Gauge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the problems that fishermen are encountering when the mesh sizes of their nets are found to be undersized when measured with the new electronic net-measuring gauge despite being measured as legal with the hand-held wedge-shaped device previously used by fisheries officers and that were in use when the nets were purchased; is further concerned that this can lead to expensive nets having to be discarded or to boats being arrested, resulting in a loss of valuable fishing time; believes that this is an unnecessary addition to the economic pressure on Scotland&rsquo;s fishermen who are already severely handicapped by the tight restrictions on their fishing opportunities; further believes that it is unacceptable for a formerly legal net to be deemed to be illegal because of a change in measuring device, and calls on the Scottish Government to introduce a transition period, during which fishermen can choose to have their old nets measured with the device in use when they were purchased, that will be long enough to allow fishermen to get the full use out of their old nets before discarding them.</p>
<p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong>, Ross Finnie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-5085 Bill Kidd: Most Vulnerable at Risk</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the UK Government to reconsider the proposed reform of attendance allowance and is concerned that the consequences of the changes to attendance allowance, which helps severely disabled pensioners pay for the additional costs of disability, would adversely effect the most vulnerable disabled recipients of the benefit, resulting in a loss of over &pound;70 per week, something that will potentially push thousands of pensioners into poverty or worse.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5084 Stuart McMillan: Recommendation for Princes Gate, Bishopbriggs to Remain with East Dunbartonshire Local Authority</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the revised recommendations published for public consultation on 29 October 2009 by the Local Government Boundary Commission, proposing that the Princes Gate area of Bishopbriggs remain with the East Dunbartonshire local authority area; considers that the residents of Princes Gate specifically chose to live in this area and have maintained and developed their community links with the rest of Bishopbriggs over the years, links that would have been dislocated under the commission&rsquo;s provisional proposals, with significant financial loss for existing residents; welcomes also the proposed retention of a much-needed affordable housing site in East Dunbartonshire, and congratulates the local residents who have worked tirelessly with the local council to overturn the commission&rsquo;s provisional proposals.</p>
<p>Supported by: Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Jackson Carlaw<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-5083 Christopher Harvie: Imprisonment of Baha&rsquo;i Leaders in Iran</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the continued imprisonment in Iran of Baha&rsquo;i leaders Fariba Kamalabadi, Jamaloddin Khanjani, Afif Naemi, Saeid Rezaie, Mahvash Sabet, Behrouz Tavakkoli, and Vahid Tizfahm, six of whom were arrested on 14 May 2008 and one detained since 5 March 2008, reportedly because of their Baha&rsquo;i faith, and later charged with insulting religious sanctities, propaganda against the Islamic Republic, spying for Israel and spreading corruption on earth, the latter two charges carrying the death penalty; deplores that their trial has been postponed three times since their arrest, most recently on 18 October 2009 without a new date being set, and that internationally recognised protocols with regard to proper legal representation do not appear to have been followed nor any evidence brought forward to support the allegations, and urges the government in Tehran to facilitate the immediate release of the imprisoned Baha&rsquo;i leaders and all co-religionists currently detained solely on the grounds of their religious beliefs and to end its active persecution and discrimination of adherents to the Baha&rsquo;i faith, in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it ratified in 1975.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5082 Dr Richard Simpson: International Brain Tumour Awareness Week and World Walk</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 1 to 7 November 2009 is International Brain Tumour Awareness Week; recognises the work in Scotland in developing the managed care network; congratulates the record number of 176 brain tumour and cancer-related organisations that have supported the International Brain Tumour Alliance&rsquo;s week and walk this year, and also notes that, with dozens of events planned and a combined total of 150,598 walking kilometres achieved to date, they are in sight of the World Walk target of 200,000 kilometres, equivalent to going round the world at the equator five times.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5081&diams;   Jackie Baillie: Citizens Advice Scotland Debt Findings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the new research findings by Citizens Advice Scotland that set out the barriers and problems faced by vulnerable groups such as lone parents, older people, young people and sick and disabled people in Scotland in relation to debt as well as creditor behaviour; notes that the findings show that four in 10 clients have gone without essentials in order to try to cope with their debt, while one in four clients has borrowed further credit to pay existing debt; notes that two fifths of debt clients reported being pressurised or harassed by their creditors; further notes that two thirds of debt clients said that they would consider going bankrupt in order to manage their debt; believes that schemes such as the Low Income Low Asset (LILA) scheme and the Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS) should be made fully accessible to debtors who are stuck in a cycle of debt and that the &pound;100 fee for accessing the LILA route into bankruptcy should be abolished as only one in five clients said they could unconditionally afford it; further believes that more affordable mainstream credit should be made available to low-income groups; commends the work of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Dumbarton and bureaux across Scotland in providing free, impartial and confidential frontline advice to all who need it, and would welcome the provision of sustained funding for agencies such as the Citizens Advice Bureaux in order to address the growing demand for such advice.</p>
