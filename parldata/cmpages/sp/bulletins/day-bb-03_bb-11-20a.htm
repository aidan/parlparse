          <P>9.30 am&#9;Scottish Socialist Party Debate on Poverty in Scotland-</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-625</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Poverty 
            in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that only in an 
            independent socialist Scotland will the obscene poverty and inequality 
            that scars our nation be permanently tackled; recognises, however, 
            that the limited powers available to it currently must be utilised 
            fully to tackle the root causes of poverty as effectively as possible; 
            accepts that it has complete power over pay and conditions in the 
            public sector which involves almost 500,000 workers; resolves, in 
            order to eradicate low pay and improve working conditions, to introduce 
            a public sector minimum wage set at the internationally recognised 
            European decency threshold and a maximum working week of 35 hours 
            to tackle the socially destructive long hours culture which currently 
            pervades too many Scottish workplaces; believes that a £7.50 per hour 
            minimum wage and 35 hours a week policy funded by the abolition of 
            Scottish Enterprise and full utilisation of existing block grant will 
            eradicate low pay in the public sector and help increase wages in 
            the private sector, and resolves to continue collectively the push 
            for full independence and democratic control over Scotland's vast 
            wealth and resources to improve the standard and quality of life of 
            all Scotland's citizens. </P>
          <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-625.3</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran: Poverty in 
            Scotland</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-625) in the name 
            of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from first &quot;recognises&quot; to 
            end and insert &quot;welcomes the Scottish Executive's commitment 
            to tackling poverty and disadvantage; notes the Executive's work towards 
            increasing opportunities through growing the economy including delivering 
            on <em>Smart, Successful Scotland</em>, delivering excellent public 
            services, particularly in education and health, and through supporting 
            strong communities through community regeneration and focusing on 
            the interests of the individual.&quot; </P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-625.2</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Poverty in 
            Scotland</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-625) in the name 
            of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from first &quot;recognises&quot; to 
            end and insert &quot;believes that the implementation of many of the 
            proposals in the Scottish Socialist Party manifesto would only ensure 
            that the unacceptable poverty of the poorest in our society would 
            come to be shared by more of our citizens than at present.&quot; </P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-625.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Poverty in Scotland</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-625) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave 
            out from first &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes 
            that socialism has caused more poverty and human misery than any other 
            political ideology in modern history; further notes that socialist 
            policies, where implemented, have singularly failed to remedy the 
            lack of economic growth that is the root cause of poverty; believes 
            that the best way to tackle poverty is to create a strong, dynamic, 
            free enterprise economy with opportunity for all, and therefore calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to reduce business rates and ease the 
            burden of water charges on Scottish business thereby taking the first 
            steps towards improving the Scottish economy.&quot; </P>
            <P><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Socialist Party Debate on World 
            Peace-</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-618</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>World 
            Peace</strong>-That the Parliament opposes the State visit to the 
            UK by George W Bush; deplores the complicity and subservience of the 
            Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who now shares the responsibility for 
            the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqis and dozens of British service 
            personnel; considers that the UK Parliament and the Scottish Parliament 
            were deceived into backing an illegal, immoral and unjustified war; 
            believes that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have turned the world 
            into a more dangerous and unstable place than ever before; agrees 
            to send messages of support to the many thousands of protestors participating 
            in the &quot;Stop Bush&quot; UK national demonstrations in London, 
            Edinburgh and Glasgow, and recommends that the International Court 
            of Justice should place George W Bush and Tony Blair on trial for 
            war crimes. </P>
          <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-618.3</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson: World 
            Peace</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-618) in the name of 
            Tommy Sheridan, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;supports all those who are working for world peace and the extension 
            of democracy; reasserts its support for the route map to peace in 
            the Middle East; believes that the contribution of UK service personnel, 
            including those from Scotland, should be commended, and expresses 
            its sympathy to the families of those members of the armed forces 
            who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country 
            and in the pursuit of world peace.&quot; </P>
          <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-618.3.1</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles: World Peace</strong>-As
            an amendment to amendment (S2M-618.3) in the name of Mr John Home
            Robertson,
            leave out from &quot;reasserts&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges 
            the deep feeling aroused by the State visit of the US President George 
            W Bush; believes that initiating military action in Iraq without a 
            clear UN mandate was wrong, and recognises the opportunity presented 
            by the visit to make clear the public's wish that those who initiated 
            the war have a duty, under the supervision of the UN, to make Iraq 
            safe and give its people the opportunity of a democratic future, that 
            the British citizens in Guantanamo Bay are either charged and receive 
            a fair trial or are sent home to face justice within the UK, and that 
            the promise to continue the unremitting search for peace in the Middle 
            East with security for Israel and justice for the Palestinians must 
            be honoured.&quot; </P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-618.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: World Peace</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-618) in the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave 
            out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets the State 
            visit to the UK by George W Bush at a time when civilian and military 
            casualties in Iraq continue to rise; condemns the decision by George 
            W Bush and Tony Blair to pursue an illegal war in Iraq on the basis 
            of false and misleading information; considers that US military command 
            in Iraq should be passed to the United Nations and that the process 
            of handing over control of the country to a democratic government 
            should be accelerated in the interests of the Iraqi people rather 
            than the re-election prospects of George W Bush; believes that the 
            total disregard of the current US administration for the views of 
            the international community, as illustrated by its stance on Iraq, 
            the Kyoto Treaty, the International Criminal Court and its abuse of 
            human rights at Guantanamo Bay, poses a threat to world peace, and 
            calls on Tony Blair to raise these issues in the strongest possible 
            terms with George W Bush during his visit to the UK.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-618.1</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie: World Peace</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-618) in the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave 
            out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the 
            State visit to the UK of the democratically elected President of the 
            United States of America, recognises the close ties that have existed 
            between governments and peoples of the UK and USA in times of world 
            war, cold war and peace, and believes that without that level of co-operation 
            there would be no free world as we know it today.&quot; </P>

            welcomes the new fuel poverty figures from the Scottish House Condition 
            Survey 2002 as good news for Scotland; endorses the Scottish Executive's 
            current fuel poverty programmes, and reaffirms the commitment to eradicate

            in order to help meet the Scottish Executive's commitment to eradicate 
            fuel poverty by 2016, the central heating programme should be extended 
            to families with young children, people with disabilities and pensioners 
            with inadequate heating.&quot; </P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-627.2</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Progress in Respect

            that the single biggest contributor to a reduction in fuel poverty 
            was the privatisation of the utilities by Conservative governments 
            at Westminster.&quot; </P>

            Legislation - Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill</strong>-That

            and Compulsory Purchase Bill provisions to remove Crown immunity from 
            planning controls for development and agrees that the relevant provisions 
            to achieve this end should be considered by the UK Parliament. </P>
          <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</P>

            contained in the Bill, namely those relating to national security, 
            urgency and enforcement; believes that these provisions could face 
            objectors with a greater disadvantage in Crown planning cases than 
            they are faced with in private planning cases, and considers that 
            the UK Parliament should address these issues during its consideration 
            of the Bill.&quot; </P>
