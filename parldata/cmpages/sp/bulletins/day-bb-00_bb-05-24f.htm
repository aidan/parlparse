    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-903#</b> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Carrick - City of Adelaide</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the proposed demolition of the Carrick &#150; City of Adelaide, the
    world&#146;s oldest clipper ship and the only vessel in Scotland to be an &quot;A&quot;
    listed structure; regrets that such an important part of Scotland, Sunderland and South
    Australia&#146;s national and international maritime heritage should be in such a
    position, and believes that every effort should be made to secure a future for the vessel.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-902</b> <strong>Robin Harper: Accidental Release of GM Oil Seed Rape</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament invites the Scottish Executive, as a matter of urgency, to guarantee full
    compensation for farmers who have accidentally planted the genetically modified oil seed
    rape from Advanta Seeds, thus allowing them to immediately destroy these crops in order to
    limit the spread of GM pollen and seeds into the countryside.<b><i> R</p>
    </i><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-901</b> <strong>Maureen Macmillan: Closure of Kinlochleven Aluminium
    Smelter</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement that Kinlochleven
    Aluminium Smelter is to close on June 15, after almost 100 years of providing work in the
    area, with the loss of 51 jobs, and urges the Scottish Executive to work with relevant
    groups to ensure that all support is given to the workers and people of Kinlochleven.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-900#</b> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Lottery Funds for Glasgow Zoo and
    other Tourist Attractions</strong>&#151;That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to
    make representations to the Millennium Commission to immediately provide funding to save
    Glasgow Zoo from closure; further invites it to assist other major Scottish tourist
    attractions, including the paddle steamer, Waverley; believes that such attractions are
    highly deserving of aid in comparison with the unsuccessful Millennium Dome in London, and
    expresses dissatisfaction at the additional £29 million of funding given by the
    Millennium Commission to the Millennium Dome, which has already received £509 million in
    lottery funding. </p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-899</b> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Millennium Dome Bail Out</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes yesterday&#146;s announcement that £29 million in lottery money is
    to be given to support the beleaguered Millennium Dome; expresses its grave disapproval
    that more money is to be spent on this misguided and ill-fated endeavour, and questions
    the priorities of Her Majesty&#146;s Government for choosing to spend this money on a
    failed visitor attraction when this same bail-out money could be used either to build 580
    new council houses, to increase the Highlands education capital budget by three and a half
    times, or fund all of the NHS accident and emergency modernisation projects which had to
    be turned down due to lack of funds.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-898#</b> <strong>Christine Grahame: Scottish Tomato Industry</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the crisis in the Scottish tomato industry due to the failure of
    leading Scottish supermarkets to stock its produce; recognises that Scottish produce is
    renowned for its high quality; further recognises that the fresh produce industry supports
    thousands of Scottish jobs, and recommends to Scotland&#146;s major food retailers that
    Scottish produce be promoted in their stores.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-897</b> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Baby Care Unit at Queen Mother
    Hospital, Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the Parliament sends warm congratulations to
    Glasgow&#146;s Lady Provost, Mrs Mosson, on the success of her first Lady Provost&#146;s
    fundraiser on Sunday 21 May 2000 for the under-equipped Special Care Baby Unit at the
    Queen Mother&#146;s Hospital, Glasgow; pays tribute to the innovative work of her
    predecessor, Mrs Lally, and acknowledges the debt Glasgow owes to the caring voluntary
    efforts of successive Ladies Provost and Lords Provost.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-896</b> <strong>Ross Finnie: Rural Scotland: A New Approach</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Scottish Executive of the document <i>Rural
    Scotland: A New Approach;</i> notes the progress which the Executive has already made in
    placing rural Scots in the mainstream of its policies and activities, and endorses the
    vision for rural Scotland presented in the document and the approach which will be taken,
    working together with others, to put and keep rural Scotland at the heart of
    Scotland&#146;s future.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-895#</b> <strong>Christine Grahame: Expansion of Signum Circuits</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament commends the management and the workforce of the electronics firm of Signum
    Circuits of Selkirk in the Scottish Borders on its expansion; recognises the contribution
    that Signum Circuits is making to the Borders economy; notes that Signum Circuits has
    succeeded despite the strong pound and high interest rates; further notes that the firm
    has additionally employed over 100 people in the last 18 months, many of them former
    Viasystems workers, and recognises that the closure of Viasystems with the loss of 1,000
    Borders&#146; jobs was not as a consequence of global pressures on its production there,
    but in the interests of complying with the conditions attached to their £25 million
    Regional Selective Assistance which was to create 1,000 jobs at the North Tyneside plant. </p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Dorothy-Grace Elder<strong>*</strong>, Michael Russell<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-894#</b> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil: Greenock Morton Football Club</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises that football plays an important part in our social culture and
    sporting life; recognises the important contribution made by local football clubs to the
    communities in which they are based; expresses concern over recent reports of developments
    at Greenock Morton Football Club; acknowledges that to lose a community asset such as
    Greenock Morton would be detrimental, not only to its supporters, but also to the
    community as a whole, and recognises that proposals such as community ownership and
    increased rights for supporters in the running of their teams offer the best opportunity
    for securing the long-term future of local clubs and promoting links between them and the
    communities they serve. </p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Hugh Henry<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-893</b> <strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: Mike Tyson</strong>&#151;That the Education,
    Culture and Sport Committee calls upon the Scottish Football Association to reconsider its
    proposal to host the boxing contest involving Mike Tyson, considers that it is
    inappropriate to allow the use of Scotland&#146;s National Stadium by an individual who
    has been convicted of the crime of rape and further considers that he represents an image
    of sport and boxing in particular which is unacceptable in this country and which, if the
    bout goes ahead, will encourage young people to believe that violence, particularly
    violence against women, is to be tolerated.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-893.1</b> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Mike Tyson</strong>&#151;As an amendment
    to motion (S1M-893) in the name of Mrs Mary Mulligan, insert at end &quot;and calls upon
    the Scottish Executive to ensure by whatever means possible and, if necessary, by
    arranging for a judicial review to be sought, that the boxing match scheduled for 24 June
    2000 at Hampden Stadium does not go ahead.&quot;</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-893.2</b> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Mike Tyson</strong>&#151;As an
    amendment to motion (S1M-893) in the name of Mrs Mary Mulligan, leave out from &quot;calls
    upon&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that it is for the commercial managers of
    Scotland&#146;s national stadium to determine what events should be held at that venue so
    long as the promoters and participants of any such event meet with the local and national
    licensing and legislative requirements.&quot;</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">S1M-890 Mike Tyson</b> (lodged on 22 May 2000) Shona Robison<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-890.1</b> <strong>David McLetchie: Mike Tyson</strong>&#151;As an amendment to
    motion (S1M-890) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from first
    &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets the determination of the SNP to promote
    an agenda designed to wreck rather than address the issues for which the Parliament is
    responsible; recognises and supports the current constitutional settlement, which was
    endorsed by a referendum of the Scottish people and which leaves immigration policy in the
    hands of the Home Secretary, and accordingly notes that the Home Secretary is the proper
    person to take the decision on whether Mike Tyson should be allowed into this
    country.&quot;<i><b> </p>
    </b></i><p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-890.1.1</b> <strong>Angus MacKay: Mike Tyson</strong>&#151;As an amendment to
    amendment to motion (S1M-890.1) in the name of David McLetchie, insert at end &quot;and,
    whilst recognising the widespread concerns, in this Parliament and elsewhere, about the
    proposed visit, believes that this Parliament should use its time to discuss and to take
    decisions on matters within its competence and so help to build a Scotland true to the
    values of fairness, equality and justice, and supports the work of the Scottish Executive
    in tackling domestic abuse and supporting its victims, in particular in developing
    effective intervention and service provision to prevent male violence against women and
    their children&quot;.</p>

    Shona Robison<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-888.1</b> <strong>Susan Deacon: Scottish Heart Transplant Unit</strong>&#151;As
    an amendment to motion (S1M-888.1) in the name of Kay Ullrich, leave out from
    &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the arrangements which are being put
    in place to secure the long-term future of heart transplantation service in Scotland;
    notes the efforts being made to minimise the effect of change on patients; welcomes the
    commitment of staff at the North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust to continue with
    high quality support, assessment and follow-up of transplant patients in the interim
    period; notes the effective co-operation with the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle and
    arrangements for transplant patients, and notes the importance of patients and the public
    being reassured that interim arrangements are in place and that steps are being taken for
    the long-term.&quot; </p>
