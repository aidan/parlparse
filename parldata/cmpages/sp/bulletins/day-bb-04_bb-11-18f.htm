          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2027#</strong> <strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing:</strong> <strong>Excess Winter Deaths</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with growing concern that, despite various efforts to reduce fuel poverty, excess winter deaths still continue to rise; believes that additional measures must be implemented to reverse this trend and eradicate this blight in an energy-rich nation, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should review the effectiveness of existing schemes.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2026</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Specialist Mountain Search and Rescue Vehicle</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the sterling work undertaken by the Scottish mountain rescue teams that provide an essential service in our mountains and hills in all seasons and weathers; welcomes the grant of &pound;160,000 awarded by the Scottish Executive to mountain rescue teams in Scotland which has assisted in purchasing a &pound;250,000 specialised off-road communications vehicle for use in mountain search and rescue operations in the Highlands and Skye; further welcomes the charitable donations given by the Order of St John and others, and notes that the vehicle is equipped with both digital and analogue radios thus allowing liaison between mountain rescue teams, RAF helicopters and the police which will be of major benefit, not just in large-scale mountain rescues, but also in dealing with incidents such as aeroplanes coming down in the hills.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2025#</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Food Supply Code of Practice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls for a strengthened Supermarket Code of Practice, legally enforced, to ensure fair trade in the food supply chain; recognises that the current Supermarket Code of Practice is ineffective, not enforced and does not cover all parts of the supply chain; notes the Office of Fair Trading&rsquo;s report that fear amongst suppliers of being de-listed by the major supermarkets has prevented anyone complaining under the current code, and recommends that a strengthened code is proactively enforced to ensure fair play for all those in the food supply chain and to safeguard against reprisals.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2023#</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Scottish National Anthem</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that there is a need for it to take the lead on the issue of a national anthem for Scotland, as the anthem is within its remit; recognises the importance of this issue to the Scottish public and will consult the people of Scotland while examining the issue of the national anthem; considers it necessary to have a Scottish national anthem that is endorsed by the majority of Scotland and that embodies the rich cultural heritage and strong character of Scotland, and pledges to consider this issue in the future to ensure that the Scottish people have an anthem of which to be proud.</p>
