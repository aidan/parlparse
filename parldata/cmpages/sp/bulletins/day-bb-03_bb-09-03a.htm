            the need to create a spirit of entrepreneurship, promote innovations 
            and encourage sensible risk taking; believes this can be achieved 
            by building on the strength of our education system and research and 
            development capability and through development of specific initiatives 
            such as Enterprise in Education and the Green Jobs Strategy; reaffirms 
            the Scottish Executive's commitment to remain focused on the delivery 
            of this strategy while being responsive to ways in which it can be 
            enhanced and refined, and looks forward to delivering increased prosperity 
            as the basis for first-class service and a socially just Scotland.

                name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; to 
                end and insert &quot;recognises the enormous potential of the 
                Scottish people; accepts that Westminster control of Scotland&#146;s 
                economic policy has been disastrous for Scottish living standards, 
                population and national self-esteem; notes that, to reverse that 
                trend, the Scottish government must create the maximum competitive 
                advantage for the Scottish economy, and therefore calls on all 
                parties to work together to win for the Parliament the full powers 
                that all independent countries enjoy, in order to create a competitive 
                advantage and the conditions for a prosperous and just Scotland.&quot;

              <p> <strong>S2M-287.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: The Scottish

                economy with levels of growth lower than the rest of the United 
                Kingdom, falling levels of business start-ups, rising levels of 
                business failure and job losses in the private sector; recognises 
                that the objective of long-term, sustainable growth is currently 
                being hindered by high non-domestic rates, increased business 
                water charges and a heavy burden of corporate regulation, and 
                calls on the Scottish Executive to use its existing powers to 
                reduce the business rate poundage to levels at least equal to 
                those in England, to ease the burden of increased water charges 
                that are stifling business growth and to work proactively to free 
                businesses from undue regulation, thereby eliminating the competitive 
                disadvantage at which many Scottish businesses find themselves 
                relative to their English counterparts and allowing the Scottish 
                economy to grow to its full potential.&quot; </p>

                the Scottish economy; supports the use of the terms &quot;sustainable&quot; 
                and &quot;sustainability&quot; in accordance with the generally-accepted 
                definition of &quot;meeting the needs of the present without compromising 
                the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&quot;; 
                endorses the Scottish Executive&#146;s establishment of a Sustainable 
                Development Forum and Sustainable Development Indicators as initial 
                steps in the direction of sustainability; recognises the need
