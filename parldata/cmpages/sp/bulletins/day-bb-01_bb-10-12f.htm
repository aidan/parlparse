          <p><strong>*S1M-2321#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: Winter Roads 
            Maintenance Programme in the Highlands</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the continuing reduction in the winter roads maintenance 
            programme in remote parts of the Highlands and asks the Scottish Executive 
            to look into this issue as a matter of urgency before the onset of 
            winter.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2320</strong> <strong>Mr Murray Tosh: Water Charges 
            Relief Scheme</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the unanimous recommendations 
            of the Transport and the Environment Committee <i>Report on Inquiry 
            into Water and the Water Industry,</i> that "a new more targeted relief 
            scheme" from water charges should be established for defined voluntary 
            organisations and charities, that the existing relief scheme should 
            be continued until a new scheme has been put in place and that the 
            proposed Water Services (Scotland) Bill offers an opportunity to introduce 
            the necessary legislation and urges the Scottish Executive to introduce 
            such legislation, extending the existing scheme as an interim measure 
            in order to ensure a permanent Scotland-wide relief scheme at appropriate 
            and uniform levels for charities and voluntary organisations, including 
            churches.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2319#</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant: Future of Highland 
            Air Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
            support for a public service obligation on the Inverness to Gatwick 
            air route; recognises the importance of this route for many businesses 
            and communities in the Highlands, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should continue to pursue this issue at both UK and European levels 
            to ensure that a direct link between the Highlands and London is maintained. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2318#</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell: The First Scottish 
            Ecumenical Assembly</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the 
            first Scottish Ecumenical Assembly on the themed statement that it 
            agreed in Edinburgh in September 2001 and endorses their intention 
            to work towards a world based on compassion, fairness and justice.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2317#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Funding for 
            Grampian Police</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the concern 
            held throughout the north east of Scotland in respect of the funding 
            formula for police services that leaves Grampian Police with considerably 
            less than its fair share of the national allocation; believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should make public any comparative studies 
            carried out in relation to police resources, and further believes 
            that appropriate steps should be taken to increase the level of resources 
            available to the force in light of the high crime rate, escalating 
            drug misuse and additional responsibilities that have an impact on 
            policing in the region.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2316#</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Reversal of 
            Her Majesty's Government's Decision on Mixed Oxide Fuel Plant at Sellafield, 
            Cumbria</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the demand of the Irish 
            Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern, that Her Majesty&#146;s Government abandon 
            its proposals to allow for the operation of a new mixed oxide fuel 
            (MOX) plant at Sellafield in Cumbria; further supports Mr Ahern&#146;s 
            wish to rid the waters surrounding both Ireland and Scotland of nuclear 
            contamination; notes the intention of the Irish Government to fight 
            the decision &quot;on every front&quot; both legally and politically 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should use every means at 
            its disposal to persuade Her Majesty&#146;s Government to reverse 
            this dangerous and irresponsible decision. </p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2315#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler: First Anniversary 
            of the Death of Donald Dewar</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            first anniversary of the death of Donald Dewar, Scotland&#146;s first 
            First Minister, on 11 October 2000 and places on record its admiration 
            for his life and work, in particular his central role in the long 
            campaign for the establishment of a devolved Scottish legislature, 
            which assumed its full legislative powers on 1 July 1999; recognises 
            Donald Dewar&#146;s contribution to Scottish public life, not only 
            as one who held high ministerial office, but also as a wholehearted 
            advocate for the people he represented &#150; firstly as MP for Aberdeen 
            South (1966-70), then as MP for Glasgow Garscadden (1978-1997) and 
            finally for Glasgow Anniesland, as both MP (1997-2000) and MSP (1999-2000); 
            acknowledges that Donald Dewar&#146;s central political objective 
            was to champion the cause of those most in need and to do so unequivocally, 
            without fear of favour, and remembers with affection the life of a 
            man who was devoted to the creation not only of the Parliament itself 
            but of a more just and equal Scotland. </p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2314#</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Prevention 
            of the Sell Off of Glasgow Council Housing</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            deplores the fact that Glasgow&#146;s council house tenants have never 
            been offered any costed alternative to a sell-off of their homes to 
            a scheme dependent on private financiers; regrets that all the propaganda 
            from Glasgow City Council has concentrated on only one proposal; demands 
            that the council presents full and truthful projections for the alternative, 
            namely housing redevelopment remaining with the public authority, 
            with all the financial benefits plus protection for tenants and of 
            council jobs, and questions many aspects of the information being 
            presented to councillors and the public, including the production 
            of two documents which, within days of each other, appeared to remove 
            major problems, including funding and job security, which are still 
            outstanding in the housing stock transfer proposal. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2313</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson: Falkirk 2008 
            European Football Championship Bid</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            with disappointment the decision of the Scottish Football Association 
            (SFA) to exclude from its consideration the joint application submitted 
            by Falkirk Football Club and Falkirk Council for the SFA&#146;s bid 
            for the European Football Championship in 2008; congratulates both 
            the club and the council for their vision in pursuing this application; 
            further notes their continued determination to provide a community 
            football stadium within Falkirk, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to support the club and the council in securing the necessary funding 
            for a community football stadium.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2311</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro: Freedom 
            of Information Bill - Skye Bridge Contract</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the introduction of the Freedom of Information Bill and believes 
            that in order to restore faith in public administration, the Scottish 
            Executive should give full disclosure of the Skye Bridge contract 
            to demonstrate the spirit of openness which the Bill sets out to achieve.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2310</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro: Concessionary 
            Tolls on the Skye Bridge</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the 
            proposed introduction of concessionary bus fares for pensioners across 
            Scotland; recognises that the high cost of crossing the Skye Bridge 
            places a heavy burden on pensioners living on limited incomes, and 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to investigate the introduction 
            of concessionary tolls on the Skye Bridge to run until the tolls are 
            scrapped altogether.</p>

            the work of the International Rescue Corps based in Grangemouth and 
            applauds its ability and willingness to assist in rescue efforts following

          <p><strong>S1M-2308 New Reactor at Chapelcross, Nuclear Power 
            Station</strong> (lodged on 4 October 2001) Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2308.1</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: New Reactor 
            at Chapelcross Nuclear Power Plant</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
            (S1M-2308) in the name of John Scott, <a name="AmendmentText">leave 
            out from &quot;British&quot; to end and insert &quot;the output of 
            Chapelcross Nuclear Power station is insignificant with regard to 
            energy production in Scotland, being 196MW of power which is only 
            2% of Scotland&#146;s normal capacity of 9654MW and consequently, 
            believes there is no business case for substantial investment in the 
            station in order to support it beyond its current expected lifespan, 
            and further notes with concern that nuclear electricity production 
            at Chapelcross is a mere by-product of the process of the station&#146;s 
            primary role in the production of weapons-grade tritium to support 
            the Trident weapons system, a system of mass destruction which has 
            no place in a civilised nation. </a> </p>
