          <p><strong>*S1M-3974</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie: Staff of the Parliament</strong>-That 
            the Parliament records its appreciation of the staff of the directorates 
            of clerking and reporting, corporate affairs, legal services, and 
            communications technologies, the staff of the Clerk/Chief Executive's 
            group, the Holyrood Project Team, catering and domestic staff, the 
            Royal Mail and the police; recognises that they all provide support 
            vital to the functioning of the Parliament; admires their professionalism 
            and dedication, and, as this first session of the Parliament enters 
            its final month, thanks them. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3973</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Regulation of Private 
            Security Industry</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the continuing 
            anxiety of local communities caused by the unregulated activities 
            of some private security firms; believes that an unregulated private 
            security industry poses a threat to local communities and to the peace 
            of local neighbourhoods, and urges the Scottish Executive to take 
            action to regulate the sector and to ensure that it cannot be used 
            to support criminal activity and that its activities are open to public 
            scrutiny.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3972#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Jack Vettriano 
            - Award of Honorary Doctorate by St Andrew's University</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the decision of St Andrew's University to 
            award an honorary doctorate to Jack Vettriano; recognises the contribution 
            he has made to the arts in Scotland, and considers that the directors 
            of the National Galleries of Scotland should<strong> </strong>acquire 
            some of Jack Vettriano's paintings to ensure that the works of one 
            of the foremost artists in Scotland are displayed for the benefit 
            of the people of Scotland and for the many thousands of overseas visitors 
            who visit Scotland every year. </p>
