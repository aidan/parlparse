<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6922 Johann Lamont: Congratulations to the Bullwood Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Bullwood Project on the official opening of its workshop in the Glasgow Pollok constituency; notes that the Bullwood Project is a woodturning and woodworking charity open to everyone; considers that it offers important support through training, skills development and the supervising of community service placements; in particular applauds its role in offering a place of comfort and welcome to those who may be vulnerable and isolated; celebrates the creativity, imagination, tenacity and determination of all those who have brought the project to this stage; considers that the project has an important environmental role in recycling trees from Glasgow&rsquo;s parks and beyond, and believes that this project is an inspiring example of the potential of voluntary sector organisations to meet needs in a sustainable, practical way.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6921 Ian McKee: Sexual Health Week 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Family Planning Association&rsquo;s (FPA) Sexual Health Week, to be held this year between 13 and 19 September; notes that the 2010 campaign will focus on raising awareness about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in people over 50; further notes that the campaign was prompted by rising levels of STIs among over 50s considered in part to be a result of an increasing number of people starting new relationships later in life, and fully supports the FPA campaign to promote safer sex regardless of age.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6920&diams;   David Stewart: The Importance of RAF Kinloss and RAF Lossiemouth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that RAF Kinloss and RAF Lossiemouth make a substantial contribution to the Moray economy; notes that the two bases collectively support 5,711 full-time equivalent jobs in the local economy, which equates to 16% of all full-time equivalent employment in Moray; further notes that direct on-site employment has been identified as 4,037 full-time equivalents and gross income as &pound;158.3 million; considers that the wider impact on population is significant, with the families of RAF personnel accounting for 1,457 spouses and 1,919 children up to 16 years of age, which is 7% of the total population of Moray and 8% of its working-age population; believes that the economy and population of Moray are heavily dependent on the RAF and that the two bases make a highly significant contribution to the population and economic prosperity of the area, and considers that any decisions about the future of RAF Kinloss and RAF Lossiemouth should take into consideration the social and economic role played by both bases in the Moray area.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6919 Pauline McNeill: Call for an Edwin Morgan Memorial</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the proposal to erect a statue of Edwin Morgan on Byres Road in Glasgow&rsquo;s west end; notes his success as the author of over 50 published books; believes that his reputation is world renowned and recognises his achievements as Glasgow&rsquo;s first poet laureate and as Scotland&rsquo;s first Makar; further notes that Morgan studied and taught at the University of Glasgow, and considers that it would be fitting to have a memorial in this area.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-6879 Bill Kidd: The UK June 2010 Budget and Equality Assessments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern, following remarks by the Equality and Human Rights Commission that the UK Government must consider the effect of budget cuts on vulnerable groups and that &quot;Under equality legislation, the Treasury, like all public bodies, has a legal duty to pay &quot;due regard&quot; to equality and consider any disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups when making decisions, including decisions about the budget&quot;, at the apparent failure by the UK Government to carry out assessments of the effects of the June 2010 Budget on vulnerable groups and considers in particular that the severe cut-backs on disability living allowance, expressly to save money rather than based on the principle of fairness, would appear to fall disproportionably heavily on disabled people as a vulnerable group.</p>
