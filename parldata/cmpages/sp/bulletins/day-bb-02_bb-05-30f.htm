          <p><strong>*S1M-3167#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: Congratulations to 
            The Robert Gordon University for Scrapping Archaic Academic Contracts</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates The Robert Gordon University and the 
            Association of University Teachers for reaching an agreement that 
            will see academics currently classed as contract research staff put 
            on open-ended permanent contracts and hopes that other universities 
            will follow The Robert Gordon's example; recognises that around 4,700 
            academics in Scotland, Scotland's brightest and best, are still stuck 
            on fixed-term contracts and are faced with insecurity, poor promotion 
            prospects and low pay, and considers that the Minister for Enterprise, 
            Transport and Lifelong Learning should use the example set by The 
            Robert Gordon University as an opportunity to give the higher education 
            sector clear guidance and leadership on this issue.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3166 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Designation of Lead Committees</strong>-That the Parliament 
            <a name="MotionText">agrees that the Local Government Committee is 
            designated as Lead Committee in consideration of the Local Government 
            in Scotland Bill and that the Transport and the Environment Committee 
            and the Education, Culture and Sport Committee be secondary committees.</a> 
          </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3160.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Implementing 
            the Cancer Strategy</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3160) 
            in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out 
            from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;considers that the 
            staff shortages in cancer services, highlighted in the recent Clinical 
            Standards Board for Scotland reports, restrict the ability of front-line 
            staff to decide investment priorities, lead service change and deliver 
            a first class service for patients, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to introduce specific initiatives to tackle these shortages.&quot;
