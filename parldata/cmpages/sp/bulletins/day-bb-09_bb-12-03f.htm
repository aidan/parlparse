<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5346</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>ProjectScotland Voscars 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all of the winners of the 2009 Voscars, ProjectScotland&rsquo;s annual awards ceremony that showcases and celebrates young volunteers who have made a real contribution to their communities across Scotland; congratulates Ryan Glen on becoming ProjectScotland Volunteer of the Year, Kimby Tosh for her ProjectScotland Outstanding Achievement Award and Elizabeth Baillie, Jason Douglas, Zoe Jones, Jenna MacGregor, Laura Meikle, Euan Reid, Andy Sloss, James Wallace and Toni Walton on their respective awards and commendations, as well as Frank Miller on becoming ProjectScotland Mentor of the Year and Denise Millan for being a Commended Mentor; believes that it is important that our young people have the opportunity to volunteer and develop real skills through their experience as well as giving something back to the community; commends ProjectScotland on its work to connect young people with volunteer organisations, and praises the organisation for holding the Voscars awards to highlight the good work that young volunteers carry out in Scotland&rsquo;s communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5345</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Carers Rights Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes and welcomes Carers Rights Day, which falls on Friday 4 December, and acknowledges and values the substantial contribution made by over 600,000 unpaid carers and young carers across Scotland; welcomes the practical and emotional support provided by the Falkirk Carers Centre and the network of Princess Royal Trust for Carers Centres across Scotland that have worked with over 50,000 carers in 2008-09; notes that the Carers Centres are critical to the implementation of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s carers strategy, but are facing significant funding challenges; is concerned that there is no commitment to additional resources to support the implementation of the new carers strategy; believes that the work being done to develop the new strategy should take forward the action highlighted in the Care 21 report relating to respite and short breaks, training for carers, access to information for carers and the specific needs of young carers, and believes that the strategy should lead to real action that benefits Scotland&rsquo;s unpaid carers, ensuring clear accountability for service delivery and improvements that enable carers to continue caring with confidence and to have a quality life outside of that caring role.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5344</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Landowners Preventing the Crofters&rsquo; Right to Buy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern increasing reports of landowners preventing crofters from buying their land by escalating the cost of the legal process through the Scottish Land Court and asks the Scottish Government to investigate this as a matter of urgency with a view to introducing measures to stop this practice by simplifying the right-to-buy process in the upcoming crofting legislation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5343</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Landowners Forcing Unreasonable Rent Demands on Tenant Farmers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the high cost of the legal process that has to be followed to challenge large rent increases imposed by landowners and land agents is forcing agricultural tenants to accept intolerable rent increases that they can ill afford and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate changing the law to provide an affordable and practical system that allows rent disputes to be handled without excessive legal costs.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5342</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Landowners Preventing Tenant Farmers&rsquo; Right to Buy:</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern reports that landowners and land agents are using protracted and expensive legal devices to make it very difficult for agricultural tenants to exercise their right to buy their farms; believes that in doing so landowners and land agents are subverting the will of the Parliament as expressed in the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003, and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate the possibility of introducing measures to stop the use of protracted devices by landowners and land agents to hamper tenants&rsquo; rights to buy their farms.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5341</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Protest at Celtic Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is shocked and appalled by the actions of the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) in calling on Celtic supporters attending the match against Hapoel Tel Aviv at Celtic Park on 2 December 2009 to wave Palestinian flags; welcomes the comments of Celtic Football Club that the safety of supporters may be compromised and that &quot;a crowded football match is not the place for a public demonstration&quot;; condemns the STUC for attempting to politicise a sporting event in this way, which is likely to fuel division, sectarianism and, potentially, violence, and calls on the STUC to issue an apology to Celtic Football Club and Hapoel Tel Aviv for its disgraceful behaviour.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ted Brocklebank<strong>*</strong>, David McLetchie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-5340</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>International Day for the Abolition of Slavery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery on 2 December 2009, which recalls the date of the adoption in 1949 by the United Nations General Assembly of the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others; notes with sadness that, on the 60th anniversary of the convention, women and children are still being trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation across the world; welcomes the ratification by the United Kingdom of the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Beings but regrets that there is still only limited involvement of key voluntary sector agencies in identification and support of such women; further notes the potential conflict between the UK Border Agency asylum processes and the 45-day reflection period, and urges the Scottish Government to work with all relevant agencies to identify, support and safeguard those who are trafficked into Scotland for commercial sexual exploitation, particularly given the potential increase in demand for prostitution that could occur in the lead-up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5339</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>The Draft Census (Scotland) Order 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee recommends that the draft Census (Scotland) Order 2010 be approved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5337</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>East Fife Mail and Glenrothes Gazette Shoebox Appeal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates both the <em>East Fife Mail </em>and <em>Glenrothes Gazette</em> on their Shoebox Appeal; notes that, between them, the two newspapers have received more than 1,500 shoeboxes filled with treats for soldiers currently serving in Afghanistan, and praises the people of Glenrothes and Levenmouth for their generosity in supporting such an initiative.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5336#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>St Margaret of Scotland Hospice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to remove the funding for 30 continuing care beds from the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice in Clydebank by 2013, which will impact adversely on the service model provided by the hospice&rsquo;s dedicated staff as well as on the hospice&rsquo;s finances; notes that this decision came immediately after an inspection by the Care Commission that rated provision at the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice as being excellent on every indicator, and believes that the approach adopted by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde in its dealings with the hospice is unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5335.1</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Getting it Right for Every Child</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5335) in the name of Adam Ingram, insert at end &quot;; recognises the scale of the challenge described in the HMIe report, How well do we protect Scotland&rsquo;s children?, which states that almost half of the 30 councils inspected were assessed as weak or unsatisfactory in relation to the assessment of risks and needs; further acknowledges that the report highlights the need for improved information sharing in relation to child protection, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that sufficient resources are available for the effective delivery of the Early Years Framework, Achieving our Potential and Equally Well.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5334.1</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5334) in the name of Margaret Smith, insert at end &quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to introduce a properly planned and resourced scheme for early retirement and more flexible winding down arrangements for older teachers, linked to guarantees that teachers released from the classroom will be replaced by post-probationary teachers.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5334.2</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5334) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave outfrom &quot;regrets&quot;to end and insert,&quot;recognises the progress of Scottish education under successive devolved administrations; further recognises the need to ensure effective delivery in every education sector in order to continue such progress; believes that the full and active participation of all stakeholders, particularly teachers, parents and pupils, and, of course, local authorities, is essential to achieving the best outcome including smaller class sizes, and agrees to continue to take such issues forward in pursuit of national educational excellence.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5334.3</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5334) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave out from &quot;regrets&quot; and insert &quot;welcomes the appointment of Michael Russell to the post of Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning; believes, like the Cabinet Secretary, that &lsquo;choice and diversity are the hallmarks of a mature and confident society&rsquo; in the provision of state-funded education and that Scotland can learn from successful models in other European countries such as Sweden; trusts that such creative thinking will not be stifled by the Cabinet Secretary&rsquo;s promotion to higher Ministerial Office, and calls upon him to  implement the terms of motion S3M-3164 as passed unanimously by the Parliament on 7 January 2009 affirming the need to ensure that pupils in Scotland are properly schooled and tested in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy by the end of primary 7.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5332&diams; </strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Big Lottery Fund, Tackling Need in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement by the Big Lottery Fund that it will spend &pound;400 million in Scotland in the next five years; welcomes the fact that the Big Lottery Fund will now have &pound;50 million more to commit to projects next year than expected; recognises that this increased resource, directed to tackle need and disadvantage in the Glasgow Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and throughout Scotland, represents a great opportunity to challenge inequality, and would welcome a clear link between spending decisions on this lottery windfall and the commitment given by Scottish Ministers in <em>Scottish Policy Directions for 2009-2015</em> to the Big Lottery Fund &quot;to address the priorities of tackling disadvantage, the advancement of well-being and addressing inequalities&quot;.</p>
