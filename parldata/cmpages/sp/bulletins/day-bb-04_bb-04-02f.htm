          <p><strong>*S2M-1147</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Threat 
            to TransBus Plants at Larbert and Camelon</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the financial problems that the Mayflower Corporation 
            is facing; acknowledges the work done by Falkirk Council, Scottish 
            Enterprise and Mayflower in their proposal to secure 1,000 jobs at 
            the Glenbervie site, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to assist 
            Falkirk Council in protecting the TransBus operation in Falkirk, in 
            order that these highly skilled jobs can be secured and that the long 
            standing manufacture of buses continues in the Falkirk area.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1146</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>EOC 
            &quot;It's Time to Get Even&quot; Campaign</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the &quot;It's Time to Get Even&quot; campaign by the Equal 
            Opportunities Commission (EOC) Scotland to highlight pay inequalities 
            between men and women; further notes that the average pay gap between 
            men and women is £482 per month, and congratulates EOC Scotland for 
            bringing forward this high profile campaign and drawing attention 
            to this extremely serious issue.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1145#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Threat 
            to Jobs at TransBus International</strong>-That the Parliament is 
            gravely concerned about the fact that the Mayflower Corporation has 
            entered administration with a resultant threat to 1,000 jobs at TransBus 
            International in Falkirk and Larbert and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should contact the employees' trade union representatives, 
            the administrator and any prospective buyers to offer assistance and 
            advice so that everything possible is done to try to save the jobs 
            of the TransBus workers, who make a very important contribution to 
            the Scottish economy.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1144#</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Chiropody 
            Care</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance of regular 
            chiropody and foot care in keeping Scotland's elderly population mobile, 
            pain free and independent; considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            specify who is eligible for NHS chiropody and podiatry care, noting 
            that local access policies differ throughout Scotland and promote 
            variances in the provision of foot care, and further considers that 
            NHS boards should ensure that access to foot health services are maintained 
            in a fair and equitable manner to all patient groups, including the 
            elderly and schoolchildren.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1132.2</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> 
            <strong>Chardon LL Maize</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1132) 
            in the name of Nora Radcliffe, leave out from the first &quot;this&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;Bayer took the UK government decision, supported 
            by the Scottish Executive, to give agreement in principle to the commercialisation 
            of Chardon LL as confirmation that the product was &quot;both safe 
            and effective&quot;; believes that decisions on the commercialisation 
            of GM crops should be based on issues of public health and environmental 
            safety rather than being left to the vagaries of the market, and regrets 
            the failure of the Scottish Executive to use its legal powers to take 
            a firmer stand against the commercialisation of Chardon LL maize.&quot;</P>
