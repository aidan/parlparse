<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5187</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>City of Edinburgh Council Care Package Tendering Process</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s decision to change the care packages of 800 vulnerable people across the city; expresses its concerns at reports that some of the successful bidders for the provision of care packages lack the specialist skills and experience of their predecessors; further expresses concern at the council&rsquo;s decision to suspend until March 2010 direct payments to individuals who wish to arrange their own care despite issuing letters to those in receipt of care informing them that staff would be on hand to deal with increased applications before the contract changes took effect; further expresses concern at proposals in the council&rsquo;s report into the tendering process that recommend that direct payments be cut by 20%, a move that impacts on all service users and limits choice, particularly for those who require a substantial amount of support; recognises that the relationship between a carer and cared-for individual is built on trust that is gained over time and that a change in care provider can cause significant disruption and anxiety, and urges the council to fully consider the implications of the report at its meeting on 19 November 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5186</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Living Wage Outrage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns SNP-controlled West Dunbartonshire Council for voting down a motion that would have introduced a living wage of &pound;7 an hour for its poorest workers; understands that the motion proposed by Labour councillors called on West Dunbartonshire Council to follow the example of Glasgow City Council and implement a living wage of &pound;7 an hour for the 200 staff who earn less than this amount; notes that the cost of implementing this policy would be approximately &pound;140,000 per year, less than half of the cost that the council was reported to be considering paying its outgoing chief executive earlier this year, and calls on Scottish ministers to support the Scottish Living Wage campaign, unlike their SNP colleagues in West Dunbartonshire.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5185</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Cruising to Victory</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Cruise Loch Lomond, which picked up a 2009 Scottish Thistle Award in the Innovation, Celebrating Scottish Tourism Excellence category; understands that the business was recognised for its West Highland Way Rambler Cruise, which combines a cruise on Loch Lomond with a walk along the most scenic parts of the West Highland Way; notes that the company has been operating cruises on the bonnie banks for 23 years, and considers it to be an excellent example of how a local business can use the natural beauty of Loch Lomond to create new tourism opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5184</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Scottish Coastal Rowing Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the initiative of the Scottish Coastal Rowing Project, launched on 31 October 2009; notes that the aim of the project is to restart local regattas in Fife and throughout Scotland and to promote friendly intercommunal competition through racing; recognises that the project connects with the histories of coastal communities such as Dysart and East Wemyss and provides an opportunity to encourage craft skills by using a team of apprentices from Adam Smith College; commends the guiding principle that boats should be available at a low cost, consistent with safety, for use by community groups, including youth groups, as a means of constructive competition, and acknowledges the benefits that this project will bring to Fife and Scotland as a place to live and an important tourist destination.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5183</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Borders Curling Development Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Borders Curling Development Group on being shortlisted for the Big Lottery Fund&rsquo;s The People&rsquo;s Millions programme; notes that the group is bidding for &pound;47,686 to help deliver the Eight to Eighty Plus project, an inclusive project that aims to introduce local people to the sport of curling regardless of age, gender, ability or experience; further notes that the project seeks to deliver significant health and social benefits to participants as well as teaching valuable team-building skills; commends the members of the group for their hard work thus far, and wishes them good luck in the vote on 24 November 2009.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5182</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Scottish Borders Council and Bookdonors</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Borders Council and Selkirk-based social enterprise, Bookdonors, on scooping an award from the Local Authority Advisory Committee in recognition of their combined efforts towards increasing recycling; notes that, from its headquarters in Selkirk, Bookdonors sells unwanted books, donates books to community groups to support literacy development and ensures that any books that are not wanted are recycled; further notes that Bookdonors is on target to process 600 tonnes of books this year and has raised over &pound;140,000 for local and national charities since 2005; commends Bookdonors for its inclusive employment practices, and wishes it a successful future as it seeks to continue its work in the Borders.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5181&diams;</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>National Youth Orchestras of Scotland at 30</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the National Youth Orchestras of Scotland (NYOS) as it celebrates its 30th anniversary; recognises the outstanding work that NYOS does in encouraging young musicians, not only those who play in one of its eight orchestras, but also through organising workshops in schools around Scotland; notes that in this year alone the orchestras have performed to over 10,000 people in 14 cities across six countries, and sends its very best wishes that NYOS continues to go from strength to strength over the next 30 years and more.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5180#</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Future of Mid Argyll Community Swimming Pool</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the threat of closure facing the Mid Argyll Swimming Pool in Lochgilphead due to a financial shortfall; believes that this community-owned social enterprise, owned and operated by Mid Argyll Community Enterprise Ltd, plays a vital role in providing the communities of Lochgilphead and Mid Argyll with a first-class public swimming pool and all the associated benefits to mental and physical health that come from the activity of swimming; considers that the pool is well used by pupils from many local primary schools and by local recreation clubs and many of the tourists and visitors who come to Mid Argyll; notes further that the new Lochgilphead High School does not have a swimming pool and that closure of this pool would mean that the nearest public swimming pools were many miles away in Oban, Rothesay, Dunoon or Campbeltown; is aware that the funding shortfall facing the pool amounts to around &pound;10,000 in this financial year and &pound;30,000 in subsequent years, and believes that all available funding options should be explored in order to secure the future of this well-used and much-loved community asset.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5178</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Architecture and Outreach</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that the three directly government-funded architecture and outreach programmes, ACCESS to Architecture, SUST and Senses of Place, carried out to date by the Lighthouse Trust will be retained; welcomes that these programmes will now be carried out by the Scottish design champion, Architecture and Design Scotland, and further welcomes that the staff currently operating these programmes will be retained in Glasgow.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5173.2</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Central Scotland Green Network</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5173) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, insert at end &quot;; notes the view of Forestry Commission Scotland that, without additional resources to invest in the Central Scotland Green Network, it will be difficult to deliver transformational change on the ground, and calls on the Scottish Government to clarify within the next six weeks its funding and delivery intentions for all the national developments in the National Planning Framework for Scotland 2 and how they link to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s current expenditure proposals.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5172.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>The Future of Community Fire Safety in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5172) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish fire and rescue authorities to consider the benefits of joint working.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4840 *#*</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>National Eligibility Criteria for Adult Social Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the contents of the draft guidelines, <em>National Eligibility for Adult Social Care and Waiting Times for Personal and Nursing Care</em>, which it considers will have an adverse impact on preventative services for disabled adults; notes the problems that have been experienced by disabled adults in accessing support services in Edinburgh; is concerned that the guidelines are based on the current working practices of many local authorities across Scotland, which were themselves based on the UK Government&rsquo;s<em> Fair Access to Care Services</em>; notes that <em>Fair Access to Care Services</em> was originally devised to decide the eligibility for support of older people with progressive age-related incapacity and loss of independence and not for disabled adults for whom it considers access to care is about the right to independence, and believes that the needs of adults requiring social care would be better served if there was guidance on free personal and nursing care and new guidance dealing with the community care services provided under different legislation.</p>
