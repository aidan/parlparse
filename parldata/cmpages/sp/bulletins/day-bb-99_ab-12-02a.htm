    <p ALIGN="left">
      <strong>S1M-327 Mr John Swinney: </strong>The Plight of Scotland's Pensioners&#151;That
      the Parliament recognises the plight of our pensioners, many of whom are living on or near
      the poverty line; condemns the lack of action by both the Scottish Executive and Her
      Majesty&#146;s Government to bring about a significant increase in the standard and
      quality of living of pensioners, and calls upon both the Scottish Executive and Her
      Majesty&#146;s Government to implement a comprehensive action plan to rectify this
      situation, the top priority of which should be a substantial increase in the basic state
      retirement pension and the re-establishment of the link with earnings for future pension
      increases. </p>

          &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the Executive&#146;s vision of a
          Scotland in which every older person matters and every person beyond working age has a
          decent quality of life, and welcomes the measures the Executive has already taken and has
          planned to support older people in line with its Programme for Government commitment to
          deliver person centred health and community care. </p><p ALIGN="left">
          <strong><i></i>S1M-327.2</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: The Plight of Scotland's
          Pensioners</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-327) in the name of Mr John Swinney,
          leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert: &quot;regards care and concern
          for Scotland&#146;s elderly as a major priority; recognises that the measures necessary to
          achieve this must include a reversal of Her Majesty's Government&#146;s decision to tax
          pension funds, which will cut retirement incomes, healthcare provision without fear of
          discrimination on the grounds of age and the introduction of an integrated concessionary
          fares system enabling the elderly to maintain contact with friends and family on an
          affordable basis; further recognises that the transfer of council housing stock would
          enable better housing provision to be made for the elderly, particularly those in need of
          sheltered accommodation, and that the rising crime rate has resulted in an increased
          number of elderly people, particularly those living alone, being afraid for their personal
          safety and the security of their homes, and undertakes to take the appropriate steps to
          provide reassurance and improve the quality of life for our elderly population.&quot; </p>

    European Freight and Passenger Terminal in Fife</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that
    the EU is the destination for over half of Scottish exports and that Scotland has no
    direct ferry connection with Europe; believes that Scotland, being on the geographical
    periphery of the EU, has an urgent need for good transport links with continental Europe
    and that it is uneconomic, environmentally unsound and irrational that the majority of
    Scottish goods and freight traffic should have to pass through Hull or other southern
    ports to reach destinations in Europe, as this increases the volume of freight traffic on
    roads and impedes Scottish economic growth; recognises the need to develop a multimodal
    freight and passenger terminal to serve Scotland, and agrees the need to promote a freight
    and passenger ferry terminal at Rosyth, assist Fife Council, Fife Enterprise, Scottish
    industry and the Scottish Tourist Board in their efforts to secure this facility,
    encourage the fast tracking of all planning applications to allow the proposed facility to
    be established without delay, encourage the development of road and rail infrastructure
    links to ensure easy and safe passage for passengers and freight through the proposed
    terminal at Rosyth and ensure the availability of an appropriate level of freight
    facilities grant for the proposed ferry terminal at Rosyth.<i><strong> </strong></i></font></td>
