          <p><strong>*S1M-3711</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: The Draft Extended 
            Sentences for Violent Offenders (Scotland) Order 2003</strong>-That 
            the Justice 2 Committee, in consideration of the draft Extended Sentences 
            for Violent Offenders (Scotland) Order 2003, recommends that the Order 
            be approved.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3710#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Digital Hearing 
            Aids</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent announcement by 
            the Northern Ireland Executive that it will have in place by March 
            2004 a service to supply digital hearing aids to those who would benefit 
            from them; further notes with concern that Scotland, which once led 
            the UK in audiology services, will now be the only part of the UK 
            without any commitment to fully modernised audiology services, and 
            therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should take, as a 
            matter of urgency, measures and make resources available for the provision 
            of digital hearing aids to all those who require them.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3709</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Westfield Public 
            Inquiry</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to hold a full public inquiry into the planning application lodged 
            by Alba Resource Recovery Ltd with Fife Council for their site at 
            Westfield, Fife, which is now subject to an appeal to the Executive 
            by Alba, given the application's strategic importance for Scotland 
            and the potential detrimental environmental effects on the communities 
            of Ballingry, Benarty, Kinglassie and surrounding villages. </p>

            Finance Committe - Stage 2 of the 2003-04 Budget Process</strong>-That

            <em>Stage 2 of the 2003-04 Budget Process (SP Paper 709)</em>. </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3704</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: The Draft Scottish 
            Local Government Elections Regulations 2002</strong>-That the Local 
            Government Committee,in consideration of the draft Scottish Local 
            Government Elections Regulations 2002, recommends that the regulations 
            be approved.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3699</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Scrap Scottish 
            Enterprise and Increase Minimum Wage in the Public Sector</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the research conducted by the Scottish Parliament 
            Research Service, revealing that the cost of imposing a £7.32 per 
            hour minimum wage and a 35-hour maximum working week across the public 
            sector in Scotland would be £450 million per annum and would create 
            an additional 24,000 public sector jobs; further notes that the Scottish 
            Enterprise (SE) budgets for 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 are £446 
            million, £453 million and £454 million respectively; believes that 
            SE should be scrapped and its budget used instead to eradicate low 
            pay in Scotland's hospitals and town halls, modernise working conditions 
            and create 24,000 new jobs on a minimum hourly rate of £7.32, as recommended 
            by the Low Pay Unit, and further believes that such a public investment 
            package would end low pay in the public sector, raise hundreds of 
            thousands out of poverty and set good employment practices which the 
            private sector would be compelled to match and that, instead of talking 
            about tackling poverty, the Scottish Executive should act. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3697 Mr Murray Tosh on behalf of the Procedures Committee: 
            Changes to Standing Orders</strong>-That the Parliament approves the

            concerning the remit of the European Committee, private legislation, 
            temporary conveners and the Journal of the Parliament contained in

          <p><strong>S1M-3693</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Chilingirian 
            String Quartet</strong>-That the Parliament applauds the hard work 
            and commitment of all concerned at the Scottish Music Information 
            Centre and the University of Glasgow in securing the visit of the 
            Chilingirian String Quartet and its performance in tribute to one 
            of the major benefactors of Scottish music in the twentieth century, 
            Sir John Blackwood McEwen (1868-1948); notes that John McEwen was 
            a renowned supporter of composers and young musicians, ultimately 
            setting up the McEwen Bequest at the University of Glasgow, and that 
            his fund encourages the performance of music by Scottish composers 
            and has included works commissioned <em>inter alia</em> from Thea 
            Musgrave, Martin Dalby, Robert Crawford and William Sweeney, and sends 
            its congratulations to the quartet on its special concert at the University 
            of Glasgow Concert Hall on 10 December 2002 to celebrate Sir John 
            McEwen's own music with a programme evidencing the quartet's reputation 
            for pioneering British music through its unearthing of the music of 
            Sir John McEwen in collaboration with the Scottish Music Information 
            Centre and the University of Glasgow, where all the published and 
            unpublished works of the composer are held.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3692</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Fire in the Old Town, 
            Edinburgh</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its regret over the 
            fire in the heart of the historic Old Town in Edinburgh; commends 
            the work of all the firefighters from brigades across the south-east 
            of Scotland that were involved in tackling the blaze and the commitment 
            of council staff and the police who worked to protect lives and provide 
            emergency accommodation for residents; notes the need for a swift 
            outcome to the full investigation into the causes of the fire; acknowledges 
            that the incident has left a &quot;gaping wound in the heart of Edinburgh's 
            Old Town&quot;; encourages swift establishment of ownership of the 
            thirteen buildings in the devastated area and safe demolition where 
            required on safety grounds, and calls for consultation with the local 
            community about the future of the site and for a sympathetic reconstruction 
            which complements the character of this internationally acknowledged 
            historic site.</p>

            in the name of Sarah Boyack, insert at end &quot;, and further believes 
            that tragic incidents like these illustrate clearly the justice of

            money to the nuclear energy company, British Energy; believes that 
            this is a misuse of public funds and only serves to highlight the 
            fact that nuclear power is unsafe, unreliable and uneconomic, and 
            agrees to communicate to Her Majesty's Government the Parliament's 
            belief that British Energy should be put into administration, nuclear 
            power should be phased out and investments in renewable power and

            out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;the deep 
            concern of the residents of the Island of Barra about the future of 
            the vital air link between the island and Glasgow; recognises the 
            strength of feeling expressed at a public meeting held on the island 
            on Monday 9 December 2002 where the clear view was expressed that 
            any loss of the service would result in damage to the local economy 
            and tourism and create hardship for those attending hospital and receiving 
            life-saving treatment in Glasgow and beyond; considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should conduct its review of the air service with urgency 
            and, following this review, put procedures in place to tender the 
            service for an additional two years, and believes that, once this 
            current contract period ends, the Executive should seek to tender 
            the service for a period of three years in the future, bringing it 
            into line with the provision for Campbeltown and Tiree.&quot;</a>

            Abuse</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the work of the O'Brien

            acknowledges the very real threat to young lives posed by solvent 
            abuse; believes that new practical preventative measures are required 
            to control sales of lighter refill gas; notes the support of 18 local 
            authorities for the actions of the LOST campaign and the thousands 
            of individuals who have signed the LOST campaign petition, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should take measures to increase protection 
            from solvent abuse through education and, where necessary, legislation.</p>
