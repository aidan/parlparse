              <p><EM>&#9;</em><STRONG><a name="iraqmotion"></a>S2M-2132</STRONG> <STRONG>Carolyn Leckie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Iraq</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern that Iraqi civilians have reported the use of napalm and/or phosphorous cluster bombs by US forces in their attack on the city of Fallujah, that the use of such weapons is banned by United Nations international treaty to which the United Kingdom is a signatory and therefore utterly condemns any failure of the United States to abide by international treaties and the use of such weapons of mass destruction; notes the International Committee of the Red Cross&rsquo;s recent call to both parties to the conflict in Iraq which stated that it is prohibited to torture participants or to subject them to any form of inhuman, humiliating or degrading treatment and that both sides must do everything possible to help civilians caught up in the fighting obtain the basics of survival such as food, water and health care, notes that there were reliable reports of US forces cutting off water supplies to Fallujah prior to the assault and therefore, along with the Red Cross, believes that &quot;for the parties to this conflict, complying with international humanitarian law is an obligation, not an option&quot;; believes that the war in Iraq was based on deceit and lies and that far from ending terrorism &quot;American actions have instead elevated the authority of the jihadi insurgents and tended to ratify their legitimacy among Muslims&quot; and that most Muslims think that &quot;the occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq has not led to democracy there, but only more chaos and suffering&quot;, as stated by the Defence Science Board, notes that the war has resulted in a humanitarian disaster with as many as 100,000 Iraqis having lost their lives and malnutrition amongst Iraqi children having almost doubled and that British and US troops are seen by most Iraqis as occupiers rather than liberators and therefore believes that it is in the best interests of all for all troops to be brought home for Christmas. </p>

              <p> <STRONG>S2M-2132.3</strong> <STRONG>Phil Gallie: Iraq</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2132) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from first &quot;Iraqi&quot; to end and insert &quot;after the cessation of the Iraq war, deaths as a consequence of conflict continue albeit at a much reduced rate from that of proceeding years; deplores the continuing violence; trusts the Iraqi people to take a giant step towards democracy and peace in the forthcoming elections; pays tribute to the courageous, professional and effective manner in which British forces are responding to the serious security situation in Iraq; welcomes the return of soldiers from the Black Watch regiment and, in doing so, thanks them for their service to this country and the people of Iraq; wishes the Scots Guards well on their current tour of duty, and believes that at a time of international turbulence our regiments should be strengthened not disbanded.&quot; </p>
              <p> <STRONG>S2M-2132.5</strong> <STRONG>Mr Keith Raffan: Iraq</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2132) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;deeply regrets that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government took the United Kingdom into an unjustified war in Iraq; believes that it would be irresponsible to withdraw British troops until a fully democratically elected Parliament has been established in Iraq and that then a phased withdrawal of troops should begin; believes that the continued presence of multinational forces is essential in order to maintain stability and security prior to the January elections and to avoid even greater loss of life among the civilian population; believes that concerted action must be taken to improve the security situation and to ensure that Iraqi security forces are fully trained and equipped; recognises the bravery and professionalism of our armed forces serving in Iraq, not least those from the Black Watch, who operate in difficult and dangerous circumstances, but believes that no further troops should be committed to Iraq unless requested by United Kingdom commanders for force protection purposes or to fulfil our international obligations towards the people of Iraq; believes that all British forces should serve under British command, and believes that greater United Nations involvement is essential,&nbsp;particularly in the urgently-required humanitarian effort to provide clean water, food and adequate health care and also in economic reconstruction and stabilisation.&quot; </p>
              <p> <STRONG>S2M-2132.4</strong> <STRONG>Chris Ballance: Iraq</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2132) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;it is in the best interests&quot; to end and insert &quot;the only way forward for peace and justice in Iraq is for the British and US governments to request the United Nations to bring in a peacekeeping force made up of soldiers from countries which did not support the invasion to replace British and US troops immediately, in order to allow civic society to re-establish itself in Iraq, and calls on the Scottish Executive to launch an inquiry into the physical and mental health of Scottish soldiers returning from Iraq and to prepare for an anticipated increase in combat stress-related conditions by increasing its support for the charity, Combat Stress, and its Hollybush House appeal.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
