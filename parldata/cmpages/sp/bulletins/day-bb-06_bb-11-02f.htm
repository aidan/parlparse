<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5077</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Maggie&rsquo;s Fife</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of Scotland&rsquo;s newest Maggie&rsquo;s Centre in Kirkcaldy on 3 November 2006; notes that Maggie&rsquo;s Fife is the fifth centre to open and that this marks the 10th anniversary of the opening of the first centre in Edinburgh on 7 November 1996; recognises that Maggie&rsquo;s Centres provide free-of-charge practical information, emotional and psychological support for anybody affected by cancer; acknowledges that the centre was designed by Zahia Hadid, the first and only woman to win the much-coveted Pritzker Prize, and congratulates the people of Kirkcaldy constituency and the wider Fife community for their tremendous generosity and amazing sustained support for the Fife Free Press-led fundraising campaign which promoted large numbers of local fundraising events.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5076</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Happy First Anniversary to the National Theatre of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the National Theatre of Scotland (NTS) on its first anniversary; applauds the high quality of its productions and the popularity of the theatre since its inception; recognises the success of its production of &quot;Black Watch&quot; which was such a hit at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and won the 2006 Stage Award for Best Ensemble; acknowledges the important role that NTS plays in the cultural and educational life of Scotland through projects such as NTS Learn, and pledges to continue to strongly support NTS to ensure that it has a long and successful future.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5075</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Threat to Less Favoured Area Support for Scottish Farmers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with considerable concern that the Scottish Executive cannot submit its Rural Development Plan (RDP) for 2007 to 2013 until agreement is reached between EU member states on the mechanism for administering voluntary modulation, the top slicing of farmers&rsquo; support payments to fund other schemes; further notes that, as the United Kingdom is the only member state wishing to implement voluntary modulation, agreement is unlikely to be reached in the foreseeable future; considers it unacceptable that payment of the &pound;61 million of Less Favoured Area (LFA) support normally received by those Scottish farmers who make their living in the 85% of Scotland that is designated as &quot;less favoured&quot; cannot be paid until the RDP is submitted and agreed; further considers that the solution proposed by the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to make an interim payment of &pound;10 million in the spring of 2007, with a full LFA support scheme payment in the autumn of 2007, will effectively bring about a reduction of &pound;51 million in agricultural support during the 2006-07 financial year, and therefore calls on the Executive urgently to consider submitting a limited RDP leaving the subject of voluntary modulation to be agreed at a later date, thereby allowing existing schemes to be fully funded and LFA support to be paid in the spring when it is of critical importance to the farmers who receive it.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5074</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Closure of Solectron, Dunfermline</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by Solectron to close its Dunfermline facility with the loss of 480 jobs; considers Solectron to be a company which, on the one hand commends the workforce for its excellent performance, efficiency and profitability but then on the other hand effectively delivers a slap in the face to that workforce just before Christmas; believes that this is another blow to Fife&rsquo;s manufacturing base, and further believes that, rather than finding them alternative employment and retraining, the Scottish Executive should support the staff of Solectron by keeping this profitable factory open and retain this asset to the Scottish economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5073</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>WHSmith</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the evidence that WHSmith&rsquo;s highly centralised buying system has, in recent years, produced a clear and unequivocal bias against Scottish interest material, which is very damaging to Scottish publishers and writers; calls on WHSmith and other national and major book retailers to sign up to a code of conduct on Scottish cultural material, and invites the Scottish Executive to become partners with the Parliament in promoting and monitoring such a code.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5072</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Wear the White Poppy for a Culture of Peace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Peace Pledge Union and its project to encourage people to wear white poppies this Remembrance Day to support a culture of peace without violence; notes that over 100 million people have been killed in wars since the Great War, the &quot;war to end all wars&quot;; notes that hundreds of millions have been maimed and displaced, and notes that in the history of warfare the 20th century stands out as the bloodiest and most brutal, with three times more people being killed in wars in the last 90 years than the previous 500 years, and that the white poppy symbolises the belief that there are better ways to resolve conflicts than killing strangers.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5070</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Citizens Advice Direct</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the essential work of Citizens Advice Direct, now approaching its second anniversary providing a helpline of particular use to those who are unable to access their local Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) for a variety of reasons, such as lack of mobility, being housebound, unaffordable transport or childcare costs or because they work during traditional CAB opening hours; notes that more than 85% of client inquiries are resolved by this service in the initial contact while more complex issues are referred to the CABx or other advice services and that, to date, some 20,000 clients have had their issues resolved; further notes that Citizens Advice Direct provides advice on best practice to other organisations using helplines, and urges the Scottish government to support this service through appropriate funding.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5069</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Lung Cancer Awareness Month</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Global Lung Cancer Awareness Month 2006; notes that lung cancer is Scotland&rsquo;s biggest cancer killer for men and women; welcomes news that rates of lung cancer in men have dropped by 27% in the last decade but notes with concern that rates among women continue to rise; further notes that survival rates for lung cancer remain poor, partly as a result of most patients being diagnosed at an advanced stage; congratulates Macmillan Cancer Support and the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation on their campaign &quot;Finding Lung Cancer Early Saves Lives&quot;, and supports the need for improved promotion of the early diagnosis message.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5068</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Justice for the Kurdish People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Cypriot government to deport Kurds living in Cyprus to Syria; notes that these Kurds played an instrumental role in the refugee protests in Cyprus last May; further notes that the Kurds who participated in the protest successfully gained their legal rights as asylum seekers through this struggle, were given medical cards and valid residence permits, temporary housing for all in need, an emergency lump sum of money and work permits complying with existing collective agreements; recognises that the Kurdish people are an oppressed nation, that their territory is occupied by Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria, all of which refuse to recognise the Kurds as a nation, that they are denied their national rights, such as being taught and participating in public life using their own language, that they also face general forms of discrimination and that they are refused access to high schools and universities and experience difficulties finding employment and receiving ID papers and passports; further notes that the Syrian government is extremely repressive of Kurdish protests against their own oppression, that many of the 100 Kurdish refugees in Cyprus who participated in the May protests were also activists in Syria and are wanted by that government and that during the May demonstrations the families of those who participated were visited by the Syrian secret police to be informed that the authorities knew about the activities of their family members in Cyprus; expresses its complete opposition to the Cypriot government&rsquo;s present treatment of the Kurdish refugees, and calls on the Cypriot government to offer asylum and a policy of tolerance and hospitality to the Kurdish refugees.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5063.1</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Executive Budget Review</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5063) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that preparation for the 2007 Spending Review, including the provision of advice to Scottish Ministers by the Budget Review Group, is ongoing and further notes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s intention to publish a comprehensive suite of documents including the completed Howat review as part of the Spending Review package.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5055.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>The Financial Powers of the Parliament</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5055) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;powers&quot; to end and insert &quot;and non-financial powers that it requires to have in order to maximise accountability, efficient government, economic growth, public services, infrastructure development and good social outcomes in Scotland and further encourages the business community, the trade unions, the public sector, the voluntary sector, academia and wider civic Scotland to participate in this debate, the objective of which must be to make Scotland a more prosperous country, able to deliver social justice to its people, and notes that a more effective and accountable devolved Scottish Parliament would strengthen the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5055.2</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>The Financial Powers of the Parliament</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5055) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Parliament needs significant new powers that follow federal principles; calls for a significant increase in the taxation powers of the Parliament in order to improve competitiveness and accountability, increase transparency, encourage more efficient allocation of resources and allow the Parliament to have greater fiscal levers to influence the direction of the Scottish economy; notes that full fiscal autonomy does not exist in any developed economy in the world and rejects the argument for such autonomy as a cloak for independence which would damage Scotland and our economy; calls for the establishment of a second constitutional convention during the next session of the Parliament to improve the home rule settlement in order to deliver real benefits to the people of Scotland; calls on all political parties and civic Scotland to participate in the new convention; believes that the new convention should also consider the case for additional legislative powers for Scotland and new procedures to improve joint working between the Scottish and UK Parliaments, and calls for the new legislative and fiscal powers of the Scottish Parliament to be enshrined in a written constitution for the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5055.3</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>The Financial Powers of the Parliament</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5055) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the arguments for further fiscal autonomy are being used as a cover for the debate on independence; calls on those MSPs who support a separate Scotland to give an honest explanation of what a separate Scotland would mean for our economy, and further believes that we should continue to use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to deliver better health, education, lower crime and economic growth.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4920.1</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Scottish Commissioner for Human Rights Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4920) in the name of Robert Brown, insert at end &quot;but, in doing so, directs the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to restrict the annual funding it provides under paragraph 13 of schedule 1 to the Bill to &pound;100,000 for the first financial year and &pound;225,000 for the subsequent three financial years (the financial years being as defined in that paragraph) for functional costs, and only to authorise funding for staff costs and office costs on the basis of a robust business case being made.&quot;</p>
