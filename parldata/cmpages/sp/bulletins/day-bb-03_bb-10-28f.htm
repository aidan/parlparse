          <p><strong>*S2M-514#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Call 
            for Public Local Inquiry into Park of Keir Planning Application</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that Stirling Council has granted permission 
            to a planning application to build a golf course and hotel at Park 
            of Keir on greenbelt land between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan, contrary 
            to the existing development plan, and as such the application will 
            now go before Scottish ministers, and believes that there is sufficient 
            public concern and confusion over the decision-making process in this 
            particular case to warrant the holding of a public local inquiry by 
            the Executive's Reporter so that future decisions on the merits of 
            this application are seen to be open and transparent and so that confidence 
            in the planning process can be restored.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-513#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>A80 
            Public Inquiry</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should delay the orders for the upgrading of the existing 
            A80 road and instead hold a public inquiry with the remit to undertake 
            a full-scale, comprehensive and objective assessment of the costs 
            and benefits of both the A80 upgrade and the alternative Kelvin Valley 
            route for a new motorway, including a comparison between the economic 
            and environmental impacts of both options.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-512</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Extension 
            of Scottish Passenger Rail Franchise</strong>-That the Parliament 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to extend the closing date for bids 
            for the Scottish passenger rail franchise by three months in light 
            of the current changes in the rail industry and thus allow for a period 
            of adjustment.</P>
