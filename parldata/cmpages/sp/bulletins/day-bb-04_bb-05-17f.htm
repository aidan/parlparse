          <p><strong>*S2M-1320</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Atrocities 
            in Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the brutal murder of 
            Nick Berg and the torture and degrading treatment of prisoners in 
            Iraq and calls for the replacement of American and British forces 
            in Iraq by United Nations forces until such time as the people of 
            Iraq are able to elect a democratic government.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1319</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Renfrewshire 
            Council Nursery Nurses</strong>-That the Parliament is appalled at 
            the recent offer from Renfrewshire Council made to nursery nurses 
            that would mean that some nursery nurses, with years of experience, 
            would be working for 18 pence less per hour than currently and considers 
            that it should be made clear that pre-five education is highly valued 
            and that local authorities should not insult those who deliver pre-five 
            education with such derisory offers.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1318#</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Hospital 
            Catering</strong>-That the Parliament notes the Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; 
            programme of 13 May 2004 and the revelations of the appalling standards 
            and conditions that exist in the Tillery Valley Foods factory which 
            produces food for Scottish hospitals, in particular the Royal Infirmary 
            of Edinburgh, and believes that the Minister for Health and Community 
            Care should carry out an urgent inquiry into the facts and, in the 
            short term, suspend the contract and make alternative arrangements 
            for the patients in the Royal Infirmary to receive a better standard 
            of service.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1317</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Dalai 
            Lama's Visit to the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the great honour and importance of the visit of the Dalai Lama to 
            Edinburgh and the Scottish Parliament and calls on the Presiding Officer 
            to put aside the normal protocol with regard to flying national flags 
            on parliamentary buildings and follow the admirable example and lead 
            of the City of Edinburgh Council in flying the Tibetan flag during 
            this historic visit.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1316</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>East 
            Kilbride Superwomen</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates East 
            Kilbride Ladies Hockey Team on winning six out of seven tournaments 
            this season, Glasgow High/Kelvinside Annual Sevens Tournament, West 
            District Indoor League, West District Indoor Cup, West District League 
            Division 1 Championship, Scottish Hockey Union District League Championship 
            and the West District League Cup; further congratulates retiring team 
            captain Elaine Goldie on such an achievement in the final year of 
            her stewardship, and sends best wishes to the team for all future 
            success.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1315</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Archives and the Freedom of Information Act</strong>-That the Parliament 
            is concerned at the lack of investment in local authority and other 
            local archives, resulting in the loss of parts of Scottish recorded 
            heritage, and the resulting inability of some archives to respond 
            as they would wish to requests under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) 
            Act 2002.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1314</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>A 
            Fair Trade Coffee Shop for the Scottish Parliament Building</strong>-That 
            the Parliament considers that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
            Body should discuss with Oxfam the possibility of siting one of its 
            new fair trade coffee shops in or near the Parliament building to 
            serve MSPs, staff and visitors.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1313#</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Screening 
            for Teenage Killer</strong>-That the Parliament notes that cardiomyopathy, 
            a thickening of the heart muscles, without screening grows undetected 
            at the body's fastest growing time, the teenage years, that apparently 
            healthy teenagers can suffer from this condition and that the condition 
            kills a large number of teenagers annually; further notes that Scottish 
            H.A.R.T, a registered charity, researches all forms of heart disease, 
            raises funds for mobile screening of young people and families at 
            risk and has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to put monitoring 
            equipment into sports centres, swimming pools and youth facilities 
            across Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            ensure provision of sufficient funding to make sure that monitoring 
            equipment is provided in sports centres, swimming pools and youth 
            facilities in line with recent funding allocations in England and 
            Wales.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1312</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Dunino Primary School</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Dunino Primary School in Fife on being awarded Permanent Eco School 
            Status for its work on environmental issues; recognises that the school 
            has been working on green issues since 1994, with its first award 
            in 1998, and is now the first school on mainland Scotland to have 
            gained this prestigious status, and sends the school best wishes for 
            its celebrations on 27 May 2004.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1311</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Proposed 
            Post Office Closures in the North East</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the proposed closures of post offices in north-east Scotland 
            and, in particular, in Aberdeen where 14 post offices face closure; 
            is concerned at the impact this may have on the communities that will 
            be affected by the closures; recognises that post offices play a key 
            role in delivering vital services in communities, and congratulates 
            Aberdeen's Members of Parliament and other local elected representatives 
            on their campaign to maintain an adequate level of post office services 
            in the city.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1310#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Redeployment 
            of the Black Watch to Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament notes reports 
            that the Black Watch has been put on standby to serve again in Iraq, 
            having returned only 10 months ago, as a result of the departure of 
            Spanish troops and considers that Her Majesty's Government should 
            seek a handover of control in Iraq to the United Nations and a UN-mandated 
            international security force rather than supporting the increasingly 
            discredited existing coalition.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1309#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Adult 
            Learners' Week</strong>-That the Parliament supports this year's Adult 
            Learners' Week from 15 to 21 May 2004; commends the efforts of Anniesland 
            College which will be working alongside partner learning organisations 
            to provide a range of 'taster' courses to promote lifelong learning 
            and encourage adults to undertake further training and education; 
            endorses the efforts of further and higher education institutions 
            across Scotland and the work of trade unions to promote lifelong learning; 
            recognises the importance of lifelong learning in improving individual 
            self-confidence and ensuring that Scotland has an appropriately-trained 
            and motivated workforce, and notes the significance of Adult Learners' 
            Week in helping people to enjoy the experience of gaining knowledge 
            and developing new skills.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1308</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>The 
            City of Edinburgh Council, Housing Stock Transfer</strong>-That the 
            Parliament has serious concerns about plans announced by the City 
            of Edinburgh Council to transfer its entire housing stock out of local 
            authority control; notes that since 1993 more than 300,000 council 
            houses have been transferred into private ownership and a further 
            46,000 demolished, whilst only 48,000 have been built in the socially-rented 
            sector; believes that the restrictions placed on council housebuilding 
            programmes should be lifted immediately; notes that the City of Edinburgh 
            Council's plan includes a commitment by the Scottish Executive to 
            write off £300 million of debt and believes that this debt should 
            not be used as inducement in this way but instead be written off now; 
            believes that the Executive must make a clear commitment to high quality, 
            affordable, public housing for rent in Scotland and is disappointed 
            that only 51 council houses were built in Scotland last year; urges 
            the City of Edinburgh Council to ensure that the views of its tenants 
            are fully consulted and that the referendum planned for 2006 is thoroughly 
            democratic and fair, and calls on the council to ensure that both 
            sides in this debate are provided with equal amounts of council resources 
            to be able to put their case forward.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1307</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Love

            on its Frontline Scotland programme, &quot;Love is the Drug&quot;, 
            concerning grandparents caring for the children of drug-using parents; 
            notes the sensitive manner in which this emotive issue was handled; 
            notes that the problems of grandparents caring for grandchildren remain 
            largely hidden; notes the forthcoming legal action of some grandparents 
            who are seeking financial assistance for their admirable actions, 
            and hopes that the Scottish Executive recognises the role played by 
            grandparents and will implement measures to give financial and social 
            support to such carers as a matter of urgency.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1306#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Children 
            of Drug Abusers</strong>-That the Parliament notes the widespread 
            incidence in Scotland of children whose parents misuse drugs and who, 
            as a result, suffer diminished lives in all kinds of ways; believes 
            that such children, many of whom are infants, require comprehensive 
            care by those concerned with the protection of vulnerable families, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive, social work departments 
            and other interested parties should adopt healthcare programmes that 
            will ensure that such young citizens escape the blighting of their 
            lives brought about by parents who are themselves in need of treatment 
            and support.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1305#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Employee 
            Equal Opportunities within the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that staff employed by MSPs are a valuable resource of the 
            Parliament, provide essential services and are at the forefront of 
            representing the public image of the Parliament in their dealings 
            with constituents, institutions, members of the public and the wider 
            community in Scotland and help MSPs to develop policy ideas and respond 
            rapidly to events; recognises that they should be entitled to the 
            same personal and career development opportunities funded by the Scottish 
            Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) as staff employed directly by 
            the SPCB, and considers that a staff training and development budget 
            should be provided to MSPs in order that their directly employed staff 
            have equal career and personal development opportunities.</P>

            pioneering work carried out at the in-patient unit of the Centre for 
            Integrative Care at Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital in Glasgow Anniesland; 
            notes that this service offers treatment for people with difficult 
            chronic problems and is based on a multi-disciplinary &quot;whole 
            person care&quot; model; recognises the excellent results achieved 
            and the cost-effectiveness of this approach; welcomes research that 
            clearly shows the substantial relief of suffering effected; believes 
            that this unique example of patient-centred care, education and research 
            deserves to be imitated; views with dismay reports that this service 
            is to be closed by Greater Glasgow NHS Board in order to achieve cost 
            savings; opposes any such proposal, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should support the continuation of appropriate homeopathic 
            care within the NHS.</P>

            given by all members of staff at Erskine Hospital to the veterans 
            who reside at the hospital, some of whom were actively engaged in 
            the victorious campaign against fascism some 60 years ago; believes 
            that we all owe a debt of honour to these former members of the armed 
            services, and readily acknowledges that, at the &quot;Erskine&quot;,

            nations, turned the tide and destroyed the evil of Nazism and fascism 
            in Europe and, in bringing an end to that terrible war, assisted with 
            the new accord within Europe that has eventually, and not without 
            struggle of a different kind, led to the European Union of 25 nations, 
            based upon equality and fraternity that has, as one of its major aims,

            effective mix of prevention, detection and intervention measures aimed

            prevalence of abuse of old, vulnerable and frail people being cared 
            for in Scottish society, most recently highlighted by the investigative 
            reports by the <em>Daily Record</em>; acknowledges that this problem 
            stems from the poor perceptions held about older people in society 
            and agrees with Action on Elder Abuse that older people should not 
            have to face the humiliation and degradation that they suffer from 
            such abuse simply because they have become old and dependent in today's 
            Scotland; believes that elder abuse should receive the same recognition, 
            attention and action by the Scottish Executive as child abuse and 
            domestic abuse, and therefore considers that the Executive should 
            begin to recognise the prevalence of elder abuse by commissioning 
            a cross-party inquiry into the effectiveness of current systems of 
            care, as was recently carried out by the House of Commons Health Committee, 
            in order to identify the types and settings of elder abuse and the 
            reasons for its prevalence and suggest recommendations for action 
            in order to eradicate this unacceptable problem from society.</P>

            and Rural Affairs Department and the Crofters Commission of increasing 
            the quality of the Scottish beef herd, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should improve the efficiency of the current scheme rather
