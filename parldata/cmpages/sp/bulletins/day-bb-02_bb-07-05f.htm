          <p><strong>*S1M-3273</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Amnesty International</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament commends the work of Amnesty International in fighting 
            for human rights across the world and, in particular, in Israel and 
            Palestine; welcomes the independent perspective brought to the Middle 
            East conflict by Amnesty International; recognises that human rights 
            must be at the centre of any peace process in the region, and urges 
            Her Majesty&#146;s Government to use all efforts to work for a peace 
            settlement based on full recognition of human rights and the rights 
            of both Israelis and Palestinians to live within their own independent 
            and secure borders.</p>

            the terrible accident in France involving a coach carrying pupils 
            and staff from Largs Academy, which resulted in injury to passengers

            sympathy to the family of Miss Fish, her friends and those who were 
            injured; further notes the current position of the Scottish Executive 
            in relation to routes and mode of travel for school trips abroad, 
            as defined in the answer to Parliamentary Question S1W-26630 on 24 
            June 2002, and asks the Executive to reconsider its position and to 
            encourage directors of education to explore other modes of travel 
            for school trips abroad, including air and rail travel and, where 
            coaches are used, to consider using the ferry route from Rosyth in 
            order to minimise driving hours.</p>
