          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2136</strong> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan:</STRONG> <STRONG>Verification of the Number of Civilian Deaths in the Iraqi Conflict</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the open letter sent to the Prime Minister by 46 high-profile individuals representing the army, church and legal establishment, following a study published in <EM>The Lancet</EM> in October which estimated the number of excess deaths in Iraq since the beginning of the war in March 2003 as 98,000, most of them being women and children; notes that the letter was signed, amongst others, by Lord Garden, former assistant chief of defence staff, retired General Sir Hugh Beech, Sir Stephen Egerton, ex-ambassador to Iraq, Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, Colin Bennetts, Bishop of Coventry and Richard Harries, Bishop of Oxford; supports the signatories&rsquo; call for an independent inquiry to establish in detail the numbers killed or injured in Iraq, along with the reasons, so that the true extent of the human suffering caused by the invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq is publicly documented and recognised by the UK Government, and, in addition, calls on the UK Government to put pressure on the US administration to publish the Pentagon&rsquo;s records which do document the number of civilian deaths in the conflict.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Frances Curran<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Carolyn Leckie<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Rosie Kane<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Colin Fox<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2135</strong> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan:</STRONG> <STRONG>Zero Tolerance to Drink-Driving</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that over one-in-four fatal road accidents in Scotland last year were caused by drivers with alcohol levels above the legal minimum, while 560 people were killed and 2,600 seriously injured across Britain in drink-driving related accidents; further notes that the legal amount of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood is greater than the maximum 50mg per 100ml in most other European Union countries; believes that a consistent, all-year message has to be communicated that drink-driving is unsafe and unacceptable; calls on the UK Government to remove the current and confusing legal limit and replace it with a zero tolerance approach, making driving while having consumed any alcohol illegal, and believes that such an approach could save lives and make drink-driving even less socially acceptable than is currently the case.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2134#</strong> <STRONG>Carolyn Leckie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Freedom of Expression for Politics, Posters and Art</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB), without consultation, to ban political posters and other expressive materials from the walls and windows of MSPs&rsquo; offices; believes in itself as a parliament, not an ornament, and that without expression of politics in various forms the Parliament has no business calling itself a parliament; further believes that the diversity of the politics of the parties represented in the Parliament is of interest to visitors and adds vitality to Scotland&rsquo;s limited democratic autonomy; believes, in terms of the ethos and principles that were enshrined in the establishment of the Parliament, which include a commitment to be more open, more democratic, more diverse, more pluralistic and of the people, for the people and by the people, that the SPCB has no right to censor the political expression of legitimately elected representatives; recognises that no damage has been, or will be, caused to the fabric of the building by posters; considers that Sr Miralles would have agreed that an artwork should not be stagnant and preserved in formaldehyde, especially the parliament building as an art form, which is supposed to have grown from Scotland&rsquo;s earth and Scotland&rsquo;s people, and that Scotland and its people should not stand still within a sedentary edifice; believes that any suppression of such expression is surely regressive in a parliament and an art work that claims to be progressive, and therefore considers that the SPCB should reverse its recent decision and withdraw the edict.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2133</strong> <STRONG>Irene Oldfather:</STRONG> <STRONG>Road Safety for the Elderly</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the increased vulnerability of elderly pedestrians on the roads; notes that, in the last four years, an average of 1,103 people aged over 60 and 1,189 people aged over 70 were involved in road accidents; recognises that some elderly pedestrians can be at a greater risk of involvement in accidents due to sight, mobility and hearing impairment; acknowledges the Scottish Executive's continued investment in road safety programmes such as the foolsspeed and Christmas drink driving campaigns, but calls on the Executive to consider running a road safety awareness campaign to encourage drivers to recognise the specific difficulties that elderly and disabled pedestrians face.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2132.1</strong> <STRONG>Alex Neil:</STRONG> <STRONG>Iraq</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2132) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;all for all&quot; to end and insert &quot;both Iraq and the international community that the United States of America, United Kingdom and other western forces be replaced as a matter of urgency by a force assembled under the auspices of the League of Arab States, with other appropriate international support.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2132.2</strong> <STRONG>John Swinburne:</STRONG> <STRONG>Iraq</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2132) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the Westminster Parliament was misled by the threat of imminent danger to the United Kingdom from attacks of nuclear and biological weapons of mass destruction which could be launched in 45 minutes by Saddam Hussein and, as a consequence, voted to &quot;liberate&quot; the Iraqi people from the tyranny of Saddam&rsquo;s oppressive regime, action which has now escalated into a war of attrition against the people of Iraq who have suffered unspeakably due to what has widely been considered an illegal invasion of their country by the forces of President Bush and Prime Minister Blair; notes that this action has resulted in the deaths of around 100,000 civilians and the complete destruction of much of the infrastructure of Iraq, and therefore calls upon the UK Government to take action to end this carnage immediately by withdrawing all troops and to hand over primary responsibility for peacekeeping and security to the United Nations along with an undertaking to pay reparations to the Iraqi people for any illegal actions which the coalition undertook.&quot;</p>
          <p>Supported by: Campbell Martin<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Dennis Canavan<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Dr Jean Turner<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Margo MacDonald<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2132.3</strong> <STRONG>Phil Gallie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Iraq</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2132) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from first &quot;Iraqi&quot; to end and insert &quot;after the cessation of the Iraq war, deaths as a consequence of conflict continue albeit at a much reduced rate from that of proceeding years; deplores the continuing violence; trusts the Iraqi people to take a giant step towards democracy and peace in the forthcoming elections; pays tribute to the courageous, professional and effective manner in which British forces are responding to the serious security situation in Iraq; welcomes the return of soldiers from the Black Watch regiment and, in doing so, thanks them for their service to this country and the people of Iraq; wishes the Scots Guards well on their current tour of duty, and believes that at a time of international turbulence our regiments should be strengthened not disbanded.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2132.4</strong> <STRONG>Chris Ballance:</STRONG> <STRONG>Iraq</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2132) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;it is in the best interests&quot; to end and insert &quot;the only way forward for peace and justice in Iraq is for the British and US governments to request the United Nations to bring in a peacekeeping force made up of soldiers from countries which did not support the invasion to replace British and US troops immediately, in order to allow civic society to re-establish itself in Iraq, and calls on the Scottish Executive to launch an inquiry into the physical and mental health of Scottish soldiers returning from Iraq and to prepare for an anticipated increase in combat stress-related conditions by increasing its support for the charity, Combat Stress, and its Hollybush House appeal.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mark Ballard<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2132.5</strong> <STRONG>Mr Keith Raffan:</STRONG> <STRONG>Iraq</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2132) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;deeply regrets that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government took the United Kingdom into an unjustified war in Iraq; believes that it would be irresponsible to withdraw British troops until a fully democratically elected Parliament has been established in Iraq and that then a phased withdrawal of troops should begin; believes that the continued presence of multinational forces is essential in order to maintain stability and security prior to the January elections and to avoid even greater loss of life among the civilian population; believes that concerted action must be taken to improve the security situation and to ensure that Iraqi security forces are fully trained and equipped; recognises the bravery and professionalism of our armed forces serving in Iraq, not least those from the Black Watch, who operate in difficult and dangerous circumstances, but believes that no further troops should be committed to Iraq unless requested by United Kingdom commanders for force protection purposes or to fulfil our international obligations towards the people of Iraq; believes that all British forces should serve under British command, and believes that greater United Nations involvement is essential,&nbsp;particularly in the urgently-required humanitarian effort to provide clean water, food and adequate health care and also in economic reconstruction and stabilisation.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2132.6</strong> <STRONG>Mr Duncan McNeil:</STRONG> <STRONG>Iraq</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2132) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that there should be a peaceful and democratic Iraq and supports all those who are working for world peace and the extension of democracy; recognises the importance of international support for the people of Iraq in their efforts to achieve stability and democracy; reaffirms its support for a route map to peace in the Middle East which delivers a free and viable Palestinian state and security for Israel; affirms the importance of the principles of the rule of law, including respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and of democracy, including free and fair elections; believes that the planned withdrawal of British forces should only occur at the first practicable opportunity after the establishment of a democratic government in Iraq; acknowledges that the United Nations should play the leading role in assisting the Iraqi people, in particular in the formation of institutions for representative government; continues to express its gratitude to UK service personnel and their families including those from Scotland, and offers its sincere sympathy to the families of those members of the armed forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country.&quot;</p>
          <p>Supported by: Scott Barrie<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>S2M-2131</strong> <STRONG>Fire Safety</STRONG> (lodged on 7 December 2004) Alex Neil<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2129.1</strong> <STRONG>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</STRONG> <STRONG>Fisheries</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2129) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;an outcome&quot; to end and insert &quot;urges the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to secure higher quotas and more days at sea to secure a future for our fishermen and their coastal communities, accompanied by an end to the discredited haddock permit scheme with no new restrictions for the nephrops sector, and calls on the Executive to support the view of the vast majority of Scottish fishermen that it is time to end the discredited Common Fisheries Policy and to regain national control of UK waters&quot;.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2129.2</strong> <STRONG>Richard Lochhead:</STRONG> <STRONG>Fisheries</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2129) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;; recognises the healthy abundance of many stocks vitally important to Scotland, including nephrops, monkfish and the record haddock stocks, and calls for a management regime that provides adequate fishing opportunities for the fleet in light of this encouraging situation; notes that the general state of stocks in Scottish waters demands proper examination in light of up-to-date science and the views of the fishing industry before any further drastic and unworkable management measures are foisted on the fleet; believes that recent events further illustrate the flaws in a Common Fisheries Policy in which many Scots who support sustainable fishing policies have lost faith, and therefore calls for control over our fishing grounds to be returned to Scotland.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2129.3</strong> <STRONG>Mr Mark Ruskell:</STRONG> <STRONG>Fisheries</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2129) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;based&quot; to end and insert &quot;; notes the North Sea Regional Advisory Council&rsquo;s opinion that &quot;the concept of a partially closed or restricted access area in the North Sea is not ruled out in principle&quot;, and calls on the Executive to make proportionate use of closed areas, on-board observers and bycatch quotas in addition to existing management controls in furtherance of its aim to maintain the sustainability of fish stocks at the heart of the strategic agenda for fisheries, as stated in the Strategic Framework for the Scottish Sea Fishing Industry and, with UK and European counterparts, to seek the necessary resources and investment required to support these measures and fishery-dependent communities while fish stocks recover.&quot;</p>
