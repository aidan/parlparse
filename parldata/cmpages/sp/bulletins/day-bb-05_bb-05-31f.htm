          <p><strong> * S2M-2884 Mark Ballard:Cycling in Edinburgh&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the recent report by Spokes, the Lothian cycle campaign group, showing that Edinburgh is no longer on course to meet its cycle transport targets for 2010; further notes that after 2005 no new major cycle infrastructure projects are planned in Edinburgh and that such schemes often require a two to three-year lead-in; is concerned that Edinburgh&rsquo;s own transport budget for bicycle projects has fallen; believes that cycling is an important part of any transport strategy because of benefits to health and reductions in CO2 emissions and congestion, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council to prioritise cycling in its transport portfolio.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2883# Fergus Ewing:The Future of BBC Highland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that BBC Scotland management have decided to close down Radio Scotland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gary Robertson&rdquo; show from June 2005; expresses concern that the loss of this &ldquo;strand&rdquo; (fixed item) on the weekday BBC Radio Scotland programme may result both in the loss of jobs at BBC Highland and also loss of its status within Scottish broadcasting; believes that this will result in the downgrading of the status of BBC Highland at a time when the BBC Scotland management should be encouraging decentralisation and consolidation of programming furth of Glasgow, and considers that BBC Scotland&rsquo;s management should enter into negotiation on these issues with representatives of the BBC Highland staff.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2882 Colin Fox:Circus Ban&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament condemns the use of performing wild animals in circuses; notes with concern the arrival of the Bobby Roberts Circus in West Lothian complete with a selection of captive animals; calls on the owners and management of the circus to stop using captive animals in their circus and to retire all circus animals to animal sanctuaries immediately, and further calls on the Scottish Executive to ban the practice of allowing animal acts.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2881 Mr Frank McAveety:Support for the London Olympic 2012 Bid&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament sends its best wishes to the London Olympic 2012 bid; believes that the legacy of a successful London Olympics bid will benefit the United Kingdom as a whole; hopes that the bid team will maximise opportunities for competitions and events to be held throughout the United Kingdom; notes that the Olympic Games would provide an excellent opportunity to showcase Scotland&rsquo;s arts and culture to a global audience; recognises that Australia is still benefiting from the boost in tourism brought about from the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and believes that the Scottish tourism industry could benefit similarly; further believes that a successful bid would undoubtedly increase interest and boost participation in sport, both in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, and would strengthen Scotland&rsquo;s ambition to host the Commonwealth Games, and calls on all parties within the Scottish Parliament to offer their full support to the British Olympics bid.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2880 Patrick Harvie:Rising Cost of ID Cards&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the Home Office figures showing that the estimated charge to individuals for identity cards has increased to &pound;93 per card and expects this to be the first of many increases in cost to both the individual and the taxpayer; further notes that the annual running costs for the scheme are currently estimated at more than a half a billion pounds; further notes that the success rate for the biometric technology used with the proposed ID card scheme was shown to be worryingly low at 69% during recent tests, and restates its view that the ID card scheme proposed by the UK Government is flawed on political, technical and financial grounds.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2879 Fiona Hyslop:Welsh Decision on Tuition Fees&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates Plaid Cymru &ndash; the Party of Wales, the Welsh Liberal Democrats and the Welsh Conservatives on seeking to ensure that there will be no top-up fees in Welsh universities; notes that the resolution of the Welsh Assembly, &ldquo;that the Assembly</p>
          <p> 1. believes that education is a right and not a privilege and condemns the Labour Government in Westminster for introducing measures which will drastically increase the amount of debt a graduate leaves higher education with; </p>
          <p> 2. instructs the Welsh Assembly Government not to introduce top-up fees for Welsh domiciled students and to ensure parity of funding with higher education institutions in England ;</p>
          <p> 3. calls on the Welsh Assembly Government to ensure that higher education institutions are funded to a level equitable to comparable institutions in England, and to bring forward a funding framework for higher education institutions in Wales for the next 10 years by June 2005;</p>
          <p> 4. condemns the New Labour Government in the National Assembly for failing to instruct Professor Teresa Rees to consider a no-fees solution for Wales;</p>
          <p> 5. believes that the level of student debt acts as a deterrent to entering higher education for many young people; and</p>
          <p> 6. calls on the Welsh Assembly Government to present funding options for the National Assembly to consider&rdquo;</p>
          <p> sends out a most appropriate message to Welsh students about the value of higher education, and calls on all of Scotland&rsquo;s politicians to make a similar commitment to the future of higher education here.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2878 Christine Grahame:Tax Credits and Debts&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the concerns of Citizens Advice Scotland anent the recovery of debts by the Inland Revenue directly from tax credit entitlement; further notes that such action can undermine a repayment plan negotiated with other creditors leading to financial instability and undermining what can be months or years of careful financial planning, including protected trust deeds, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to liaise with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to ensure that the Inland Revenue uses its discretion not to recover overpayments of tax credits when to do so would prevent a creditor from participating in one of these schemes.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2877 Patrick Harvie:Environmental Injustice in Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern the publication of <em>Investigating environmental justice in Scotland: links between measures of environmental quality and social deprivation </em>by the Scotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research (SNIFFER); further notes the report&rsquo;s findings that Scotland&rsquo;s poorest communities are more likely to experience poor air quality and be living near to industrial pollution, derelict land or rivers with poor water quality and that in rural areas opencast mines and quarries are more likely to be located closer to poorer communities; believes that the report clearly demonstrates that Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived communities bear the burden of living in the worst environments and that this demonstrates the lack of progress in securing environmental justice for Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to renew its commitment to environmental justice and to explain what steps it will take to remedy the situation; considers the recent decision by ministers to approve the M74 Northern Extension to be a step in the wrong direction, and believes that the Executive should demonstrate its commitment to environmental justice by heeding calls for a planning system which is fair at all stages, including the appeal stage.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2874 Rhona Brankin:The Draft Mental Health (Safeguards for Certain Informal Patients) (Scotland) Regulations 2005&mdash;</strong>That the Health Committee recommends that the draft Mental Health (Safeguards for Certain Informal Patients) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 be approved.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2873 Rosie Kane:School Pupils&rsquo; Evidence to the Public Petitions Committee&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament thanks the pupils from St Ronan&rsquo;s Primary School, Innerleithen, and Clyde Valley High School, Wishaw, who gave evidence on separate issues to the Public Petitions Committee on Wednesday 25 May 2005 and the pupils from Bowmore Primary School, Islay, who gave a video presentation on their petition to committee members; considers that all the pupils concerned exhibited knowledge, confidence and authority in presenting their particular petitions; notes that the fact that young people feel able to interact with politicians in this way is an indicator of how accessible the Parliament and politics can be, and considers that it is essential that the Parliament works to ensure that openness and accessibility continues and develops to encourage the widest possible interaction between the Parliament and the people. </p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2872 Brian Adam:Haste Ye Back&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Rugby team on its 38 - 7 victory over the Barbarians at Pittodrie Stadium in Aberdeen; welcomes the support given by Aberdeen City Council, Scottish Enterprise Grampian and Aberdeen Football Club to make the game possible; notes that that this was the first rugby international to be held in Aberdeen for 70 years, and hopes that the win and the tremendous support will persuade Scottish Rugby to hold another international match in Aberdeen in the very near future.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2871 Dr Jean Turner: Medical Student Debt&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern the ever-increasing debt levels of medical students in Scotland with an average debt of &pound;11,406 and one in five more than &pound;20,000 in debt; further notes that 59% of applicants to medicine in 2003 came from managerial and professional backgrounds and that inadequate financial support currently available to medical students may act as a significant obstacle to those from poorer backgrounds which made up only 10% of such students; notes that students from less affluent backgrounds are likely to incur far higher levels of debt because of their parents&rsquo; inability to contribute to the costs of maintenance, and believes that rising levels of debt have a serious impact on student well-being and that consideration should be given to replacing the student loan system with a grant system for all students. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2870 Carolyn Leckie:Low Pay Continues to Blight Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the publication of the Scottish Low Pay Unit report, <em>Low Pay in Scotland</em>, which shows that there is still a chronic problem with low pay in Scotland; notes that the report says that at least 421,000 workers, over a quarter of the Scottish workforce, earn less than the low pay threshold&nbsp;which currently stands at &pound;7.44 per hour; notes that the report also shows that the gender pay gap continues, with women in Scotland earning just 63% of male gross median earnings; believes that an &pound;8 per hour minimum wage would immediately lift hundreds of thousands of Scots out of poverty; urges the Scottish Executive to direct local authorities to implement an &pound;8 an hour minimum wage, and believes that the Executive should enforce equal pay legislation in the public sector.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2867 Mark Ballard:Brazilian Government&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that, after 28 months collaborating with the government, the Brazilian Green Party has decided to abandon its support for President Lula and that the Brazilian Green Party Culture Minister, world-famous singer Gilberto Gil, has resigned his seat in government because of &ldquo;a clear retreat in Brazilian environmental policies&rdquo;; supports the Brazilian Green Party in its concern at the death of 38 undernourished children belonging to the Guarani tribe in one of the country&rsquo;s Indian reservations and at new record figures on Amazon rainforest destruction; notes that the Brazilian environment ministry has said that 26,000 square kilometres of forest were chopped down in the 12 months prior to August 2004; further notes that this figure is the second highest on record, 6% higher than the previous 12 months; congratulates the Brazilian Green Party on its strong stance; recognises how Green parties from across the world work together on such important issues, and welcomes the fact that the Brazilian Green Party is willing to stand up for the rights of indigenous people and for the Amazon rainforest, even if this means sacrificing a seat in government.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2865 Frances Curran:Scottish Power&rsquo;s Obscene Profits&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes Scottish Power&rsquo;s reporting of pre-tax profits of over &pound;1 billion; notes that 134,000 single pensioners, 39% of the total, and 83,000 Scottish pensioner couples, 26% of the total, live in fuel poverty, meaning that they must spend 10% or more of their income to heat their homes adequately; notes that, between 1997 and 2002, Scotland registered 16,600 more deaths of over-65s between December and March than in the rest of the year; further notes that premature deaths are highest among pensioners in Glasgow with one in 36 of those aged over 65 dying during the winter months, and believes therefore that, in order to end the obscenity of a private company getting fat on the backs of pensioners living in poverty, Scottish Power should be taken back into public ownership and Scotland&rsquo;s pensioners should receive gas and electricity free of charge.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2860 Brian Adam:2011 Census - Additional Question on Closure of Records&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament regrets the current unwillingness of the Scottish Executive to open the 1911 and 1921 Scottish census records; believes that this policy is mistaken, and invites the Executive to reconsider by including a new question in the 2011 census which would allow individuals to retain the 100-year closure by opting in, but otherwise opening the census records for perusal at a much earlier point, and also by consulting over what the standard closure period should be.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2858 # Mr Brian Monteith:Parental Responsibility&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern remarks attributed by <em>BBC News online</em> to Julie Atkins, whose daughters each gave birth to babies last year when aged 12, 14 and 16, that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what people say about me, I blame the schools&rdquo;; believes that the passing of responsibility on to schools is symptomatic of many of the problems facing communities in Scotland and across Britain whereby parents refuse to take the necessary responsibility for their children&rsquo;s actions; congratulates Prime Minister, Tony Blair, for acknowledging that &ldquo;what I cannot do is raise someone&rsquo;s children for them&rdquo;; believes that centrally directed sexual health strategies, such as the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s own sexual health and relationships strategy, will have a limited reach; and, in light of Scotland&rsquo;s high rates of youth crime, antisocial behaviour, school indiscipline and under-age pregnancy, and considers that the Scottish Executive should publicly affirm the primary responsibility of parents in ensuring that their children are brought up with respect for themselves and others.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2856 Mr Stewart Maxwell:World No Tobacco Day&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that 31 May 2005 is World No Tobacco Day; congratulates Scottish health professionals on their efforts to help the estimated 70% of smokers who wish to quit, and believes that the introduction of a ban on smoking in enclosed premises in Scotland will support the efforts of health professionals to make Scotland a smoke-free country.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2841 # John Swinburne:Powers of the Scottish Parliament&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the increased focus afforded specific groups within Scotland following the creation of the Parliament as a result of devolution; also notes the Parliament&rsquo;s inability to fully address the needs of groups such as senior citizens, and therefore believes that the time is now right to explore options for increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament to properly address the needs of all Scottish citizens.</p>
