<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4769#</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Airdrie to Bathgate Rail Line</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the progress of the Airdrie-Bathgate Railway and Linked Improvements Bill; recognises the benefits which the project will bring to the towns of Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate and Livingston as well as the surrounding communities; further recognises the importance of the Bill in enabling improved educational, employment and recreational opportunities to people within these communities, and looks forward to the successful completion of the Bill and the building of the rail line.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4768</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>Long Walk for Peace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the participants in Scotland&rsquo;s Long Walk for Peace on their efforts to draw both public and parliamentary attention to the costly and unnecessary replacement of the Trident weapons system; notes that the walkers will arrive at the Parliament on 19 September 2006 after covering the 85 miles from Faslane on foot in six days; considers that they should receive commendation from the Parliament for their hard work and dedication to this worthwhile cause; welcomes the walkers, and wishes them every success in their campaign.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4767</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>What People Think of Scotland&rsquo;s CAB Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the results of the recent Ipsos MORI survey on public perceptions of Scotland&rsquo;s Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) service, which found that 98% of clients trust the confidential service, 97% appreciate the professionalism, competency and efficiency of staff and 96% believe that the CAB helps people get fair treatment; further notes that among the general public 86% believe that the CAB provides advice, assistance and support across a range of issues, 84% feel it helps people to get fair treatment and 84% believe that the CAB can be trusted; congratulates the staff and thousands of volunteers in Scotland&rsquo;s 76 citizens advice bureaux on the highly positive findings; believes that the high level of trust which the people of Scotland have in the CAB service is a precious commodity that deserves greater recognition both locally and nationally; further notes that 11 to 17 September 2006 is Advice Week, and encourages MSPs of all parties to sign the congratulations cards to their local bureaux, available at the CAB stand in the Parliament&rsquo;s garden lobby on 13 September.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4766<> </strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Common Fisheries Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that Walmart-ASDA has joined calls for Britain&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Common Fisheries Policy in order to protect and preserve fish stocks in the North Sea and the livelihoods of local Scottish fishermen, such as those in the Kingdom of Fife; notes that the Common Fisheries Policy has failed to deliver sustainability of fish supplies and calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government and the European Union to introduce a new management regime, devised by local fishermen, which would give them a stake in enhancing and managing the stocks on which their livelihoods, often the sole income of communities, depend; believes that the North Sea should be declared a marine conservation zone, and considers that Members should put party politics aside and recognise that this approach is in the interests of Scotland, the fishing communities, the fish and the ecology of the North Sea.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4765</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>An Ethical Policy for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament asks the Scottish Executive to acknowledge that, as Scotland increasingly becomes an actor on the world stage, it has a moral responsibility to engage ethically with other countries and to defend human rights abroad as well as at home.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4763</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Meter Madness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that the practice of collecting back charges from customers who have not had their token prepayment meters recalibrated following a rise in energy prices threatens 250,000 households with increasing levels of debt, with some households facing a 138% rise in their weekly energy bill; notes that four companies: Scottish Gas, Scottish Power, npower and Powergen pursue this practice, while Scottish and Southern Energy (Scottish Hydro) and EDF Energy do not charge customers until their meters have been recalibrated, and calls on those companies which continue to collect back charges to follow the lead of Scottish and Southern and EDF and apply price rises only after a meter has been recalibrated.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4762#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Millennium Cup Winners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow&rsquo;s Universal Football Club on its achievement in winning the 2006 Millennium Cup and its involvement in the Scottish Unity League, a football league set up in Glasgow to create an atmosphere free from prejudice and discrimination by bringing together players from different racial and religious backgrounds and acknowledges the success which these initiatives have in promoting a true multicultural Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4761</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Pay the Workers More</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Office for National Statistics&rsquo; (ONS) report which reveals that rewards in the form of bonus payments in the exclusive world of Britain&rsquo;s boardrooms and City dealing rooms have reached record levels and show a 16% increase, to the unprecedented amount of &pound;19 billion, this year; further notes that the ONS report shows such boardroom and City bonuses increased by &pound;2.5 billion this year, following a rise of &pound;1.5 billion last year, and believes that such obscene and unjustified bonus payments should be borne in mind when public and private sector unions submit their annual pay rise demands, in recognition of the fact that the real creators of wealth are far from properly rewarded for the fruits of their labours.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4760</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Choose Life - Suicide Prevention in North Ayrshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that International Suicide Prevention Awareness Week runs from 4 to 10 September 2006; recognises that the theme of this year&rsquo;s week is &quot;Talking About Suicide Can Save Lives&quot;, acknowledges that a great deal of suicides can be prevented by encouraging people to talk about their problems; is aware that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s national Choose Life Strategy aims to reduce suicides by 20% by the year 2013 and that, since 2003, all Community Planning Partnership areas have produced and implemented a local Choose Life action plan; congratulates the North Ayrshire Choose Life Implementation Team for their work in tackling suicide awareness by producing leaflets, setting up a website and supporting suicide prevention projects throughout North Ayrshire, where 62 people have committed suicide since 2003, and supports any action to reduce Scotland&rsquo;s suicide rate, which is currently higher than the rest of the United Kingdom, and offer support to people at risk.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4759</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Castle Tioram</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament encourages all those involved in advising or making decisions about Castle Tioram, the owner, the local community, the Highland Council, Historic Scotland and the Clanranald Castle Tioram Trust, to meet to discuss together constructively to produce a solution which provides as complete consolidation and repair as possible, as much public access as is reasonable and a nearby interpretation centre, as well as funding for these, and welcomes the initiative to convene such a meeting by the Vice Convener of Highland Council.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4759.1</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Castle Tioram</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4759) in the name of Donald Gorrie, leave out from &quot;encourages&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that Historic Scotland should recognise that it is in the best interest of the maintenance and restoration of Scotland&rsquo;s built heritage that the owners of its abandoned ruins, piles of boulders and desolate rubble that were once great houses, keeps, towers and castles of ancient Scotland be allowed to develop them for use as domestic homes or for commercial use; notes that many historic buildings were in fact constructed from the ruins and plundered rubble of older buildings, that a cultural icon such as Eilean Donan Castle, restored in 1912, is in fact far more modern than many people realise and believes that if Historic Scotland had existed then the castle would still remain in ruins; welcomes the large-scale investment in, and commitment to, the use of authentic materials and traditional methods of building construction by owners of ruins such as Castle Tioram, and urges Historic Scotland to encourage such investment, rather than to obstruct it, by suggesting workable and sympathetic architectural treatment so that ruins may be revived, boulders liberated from the moss and rubble reassembled into attractive homes and buildings of interest.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4757</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Organic Food Fortnight 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Organic Food Fortnight 2006 from 2 to 17 September as an opportunity to celebrate the 30% growth in UK organic food sales during 2005; looks forward to the first Organic Food Festival for Scotland in the Old Fruit Market in Glasgow on 4 and 5 November 2006 as an opportunity to show the best Scottish organic produce; recognises that organic farming delivers a wide range of public benefits, notably in biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, food and water quality, animal welfare and rural employment, and calls on the Scottish Executive to step up its support of Scotland&rsquo;s organic movement to ensure that these public benefits are replicated further.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4754</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Solidarity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern with reference to&nbsp;the remarks made by Jack McConnell MSP about&nbsp;relocation of public sector jobs from Edinburgh; agrees with Eddie&nbsp;Reilly, Scottish&nbsp;Secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), when he states&nbsp;that the relocation cannot work if it is based on reducing the complement of civil and public servants; believes that co-operation on relocation will not be achieved by redundancies and undermining job security; further believes that workers in one area of Scotland should not&nbsp;suffer because of the policy of establishing new jobs in another area; considers that the Scottish&nbsp;Executive should commit to trying to achieve job relocation&nbsp;only with the agreement of the workforce and unions and without redundancies,&nbsp;and offers full support and solidarity to the workers and the PCS.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4749</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Thomson&rsquo;s Closure of Glasgow Call Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announced closure of its Glasgow call centre by Thomson Holidays, owned by German multi-national TUI; condemns the devastating impact which this has on the lives and livelihoods of 450 workers and their families; condemns the total lack of consultation by the company with the workforce or trade unions, a reminder of the appalling lack of legal protection for Scottish workers, making them among the easiest sacked in Europe; considers this to be an outrageous theft of taxpayers&rsquo; money, including &pound;1.4 million in Regional Selective Assistance funding from the Scottish Executive, and condemns it accordingly; offers full solidarity to the Thomson workers in any action they take against closure; demands that Thomson&rsquo;s assets be confiscated, including the return of the full &pound;1.4 million in public funding for their private profiteering, and supports calls for legislation that would defend the rights of workers against such instant dismissal without the right of full prior negotiations with elected trade union representatives.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4745</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>School Meals - Free and Healthy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the comments of Westminster education secretary Alan Johnson, reported in the breakfast news on 4 September 2006, when he highlighted the success of Hull City Council in promoting and increasing the uptake of healthy meals in schools; agrees that Hull City Council&rsquo;s initiative has indeed been a huge success but notes the failure of the education secretary to mention that the crucial factor in this success was the introduction of free healthy school meals for all primary children across the city, and believes that the only way to achieve healthy eating in schools is to provide free healthy school meals for all pupils and that the statistics coming from Hull prove that this works.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4744</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>End the Handcuffing of Pregnant Prisoners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the number of women prisoners being handcuffed during pregnancy has been reduced but believes that no woman should be handcuffed while in labour and calls on the Scottish Executive to put a halt to this situation, which puts women in an undignified, uncomfortable and inhumane position during an extremely difficult time.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4742#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Withdrawal of Alimta for Mesothelioma Patients</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&rsquo;s (NICE) final appraisal determination on Alimta does not recommend Alimta for the treatment of mesothelioma except as part of ongoing or new clinical trials; is concerned that the drug could potentially be withdrawn if NICE repeats that opinion in its final report due to be published in October 2006; realises that, in practice, NICE&rsquo;s decisions ordinarily supersede Scottish advice which could lead to the withdrawal of this drug for Scottish sufferers; recognises that such a move would have a devastating effect on mesothelioma sufferers here in Scotland given that Alimta has been shown to be effective in increasing life expectancy and improving the quality of life of patients; is aware that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) will be reviewing its decision to offer the drug in Scotland in light of the NICE recommendation; therefore urges NHS QIS to recognise the contextual differences in Scotland, such as in epidemiology, with a large concentration of mesothelioma cases in Dundee and other post-industrial areas of Scotland; furthermore recognises the existing advice from the Scottish Medicines Consortium that Alimta should be freely available in Scotland, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should guarantee the availability of Alimta to existing and future sufferers of mesothelioma in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4419#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Leisure Facilities in Penicuik</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed closure of Ladywood Leisure Centre, Queensway Leisure Centre and the Jackson Street Centre and the threat to Penicuik Town Hall, all valuable resources for Penicuik&rsquo;s people; notes that the consultation by Midlothian Council was initiated after the decision to make the closures and is only directed at the transition of provision to the Penicuik High School development; considers that, while the facilities being provided adjacent to Penicuik High School are to be welcomed, these will not meet the requirement for those facilities which are to be closed nor will have the capacity to accommodate all activities; further considers that these closures will impact on the community&rsquo;s health and well-being, will remove the provision of services to the young in keeping them off the streets and to mothers and elderly people in providing a point of social contact, and considers that the Scottish government should enter into discussions with local community groups, including the community council, to assist in identifying options to ensure that these facilities remain open.</p>
