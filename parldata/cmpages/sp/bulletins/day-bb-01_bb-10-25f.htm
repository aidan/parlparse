          <p><strong>*S1M-2360</strong> <strong>Gordon Jackson: The Pearce Institute in Govan</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the importance of the Pearce Institute since 
            its foundation in 1902 as a community resource at the heart of Govan; 
            understands that a number of city-wide and national groups, such as 
            Glasgow Braendam Link and the Iona Community, also use the building 
            for meetings and as offices; notes that the Institute's trustees have 
            accepted the recommendation of the management committee to close the 
            Institute within weeks after mounting financial crisis; welcomes the 
            efforts of the local community, elected representatives and public 
            agencies in exhausting every possibility to safeguard the Pearce Institute 
            as a resource for the people of Govan; acknowledges the commitment 
            of the Scottish Executive to building partnerships for social inclusion 
            in areas such as Govan, and calls on the Executive to make every effort 
            in supporting moves to save the Pearce Institute.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2359</strong> <strong>Mr Murray Tosh: Sue Ryder Care Home, Marchmont 
            House, Greenlaw</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the current 
            financial crisis at the Sue Ryder Care home, Marchmont House, Greenlaw, 
            Berwickshire, which provides intensive residential support and respite 
            care for sufferers of degenerative illnesses such as multiple sclerosis 
            and Huntington's Disease, as well as severely disabled victims of 
            accidents, and calls on the Scottish Executive and the relevant health 
            boards and local authorities which use the facility to co-operate 
            with Sue Ryder Care in seeking to avert the threatened closure of 
            the home. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2358</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Deportation of Ulla Roder</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with grave concern that Ulla Roder, a Danish 
            peace campaigner, is currently threatened with deportation, finds 
            it particularly inappropriate that the threat of deportation is raised 
            against a peaceful activist within the borders of the European Union, 
            especially when the European Convention on Human Rights, which normally 
            underpins that Union so strongly, defends the right to protest, and 
            asks the Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government 
            to reject any requests to deport this peace activist who has consistently 
            campaigned for a nuclear-free Scotland. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2357</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Scottish National Theatre 
            Company</strong>-That the Parliament notes the support for the establishment 
            of a Scottish National Theatre Company by the Education, Culture and 
            Sport Committee and the subsequent announcement of funding of an initial 
            £2 million by the Scottish Executive; believes that such a commissioning 
            company as proposed by the Federation of Scottish Theatres, supported 
            by the Scottish Arts Council and developed by its working group, would 
            provide a great opportunity to present the best drama from Scotland, 
            stimulating audiences at home and abroad and attracting tourists to 
            this country; recognises that the Scottish Arts Council has applied 
            for an additional increase in funding of existing theatres of £1.2 
            million per annum, and urges that any such increase should not be 
            at the expense of the budget earmarked for the National Theatre Company.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Alex 
            Johnstone<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2356</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: International Criminal Court</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">believes that it is now necessary 
            to create a new International Court comparable to those sitting at 
            the Hague and Arusha specifically charged with the judicial processes 
            intended to lead to the trial of Osama Bin Laden and any others against 
            whom evidence is established linking them to the atrocities against 
            the United States of America on 11 September 2001 and that the composition 
            of the court should reflect international jurisprudence including 
            Islamic judges, and further believes that the creation of such a court 
            by the Security Council will clearly signal to the international community 
            that the pursuit of those responsible for these atrocities is an international 
            endeavour on a judicial basis and that the atrocities committed on 
            11 September were criminal in nature and should not be dignified as 
            an act of war. </a></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2354.1</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: National Cultural Strategy 
            - One Year On</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2354) in the name 
            of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;regrets that the report is not available to MSPs or the public 
            until 25 October 2001; notes that of the 64 strategic objectives, 
            key priorities and supporting actions in the National Cultural Strategy 
            document <i>Creating our Future, Minding our Past</i>, very few appear 
            to have been progressed significantly; continues to express concern 
            that the Scottish Executive's present cultural policy, as expressed 
            in its National Cultural Strategy, lacks coherence and vision, has 
            failed to engage the support and enthusiasm of the Scottish community 
            in general, and the arts communities in particular, and is unlikely 
            to help fulfil the potential of Scotland at home and abroad or to 
            widen opportunities or assist in delivering social justice; observes 
            that funding crises and other operational difficulties continue to 
            be the daily norm for most publicly subsidised arts bodies, museums 
            and others within the arts and heritage sector, despite the Scottish 
            Executive's relentless self-congratulation about its own actions, 
            and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to reconsider its 
            policy and to begin to deliver on some of its promises, including 
            a properly funded National Theatre within a clear and reasonable time-frame 
            based upon a better supported theatre sector in Scotland.&quot; </p>

            of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;but regrets that the Strategy has failed to evoke any substantial 
            response from the people of Scotland who are the ultimate and only 
            source of Scottish culture; notes that the most recent achievements 
            of Scottish culture such as the dramas &quot;Gagarin Way&quot; and 
            &quot;Wiping My Mother's Arse&quot; owed nothing whatsoever to the 
            Cultural Strategy, and expresses confidence that Scots culture will 
            continue to flourish without the intervention of the state as it has 
            since 1707.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2347 Scotland and the Current International Situation</strong> 
            (lodged on 23 October 2001) Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2347.1</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Scotland and the Current International 
            Situation</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2347) in the name of 
            Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;and agrees&quot; to end and 
            insert &quot;but agrees that any measure to that effect must be based 
            on the role of international law and respect for human rights, particularly 
            innocent people's right to life, and therefore calls for an end to 
            the current military action in Afghanistan and for an effective humanitarian 
            operation to meet the desperate needs of the innocent Afghan population.&quot; 
          </p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Mr John 
            McAllion<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2347.2</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: Scotland and the Current 
            International Situation</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2347) in 
            the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;the international&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;Her Majesty's Government in its aim of building 
            the widest possible international coalition, with maximum United Nations 
            support; welcomes NATO's decision to invoke Article 5 of the North 
            Atlantic Treaty and its role in the international effort; agrees that 
            the immediate objectives of the campaign should be to prevent Osama 
            bin Laden and the Al Qa'ida network from posing a continuing terrorist 
            threat and, to this end, to ensure that the Taliban regime in Afghanistan 
            ceases to harbour and sustain international terrorism and is replaced 
            by a broadly-based government which is representative of all groups 
            in the country; acknowledges that the attainment of these objectives 
            requires the development of all available means, including taking 
            steps to deal with the humanitarian crisis confronting Afghanistan, 
            and believes that halting the military action in Afghanistan at this 
            time would hinder the achievement of these objectives and would simply 
            prolong the suffering of people in Afghanistan.&quot;</p>

            has been a difficult time for the railway industry since the tragedy 
            at Hatfield a year ago and welcomes the steps that the Executive is 
            taking to meet the needs of Scotland's rail users; calls upon the 
            Executive to continue its programme of record investment in the railways 
            and its work to make sure that projects for enhancements to the rail 
            network go ahead, building on the good partnership that exist across 
            the railway industry in Scotland; also notes the recent placing into 
            administration of Railtrack plc and the opportunity that this presents 
            to re-examine the organisation of rail services across the UK; welcomes 
            the Executive's commitment to work closely with Her Majesty's Government 
            to ensure that Scotland has a full and proper input into the restructuring 
            of the UK rail industry, and calls upon all concerned to develop an
