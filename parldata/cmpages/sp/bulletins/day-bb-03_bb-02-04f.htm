          <p><strong>*S1M-3841</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: Chernobyl Children's 
            Life Line</strong>-That the Parliament commends the work of the Chernobyl 
            Children Life Line in bringing children that are suffering as a result 
            of the Chernobyl legacy from Belarus to Scotland; recognises the benefits, 
            in terms of both health and experience, that the children can gain 
            from these visits; endorses the work of the organisation and its host 
            families, which benefits the children and fosters better links between 
            Scotland and Belarus, and calls on the Scottish Executive to consider 
            whether it can offer any assistance.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3840#</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe: Young People in 
            Sport</strong>-That the Parliament commends Hamilton International 
            Sports Trust, which seeks to aid young amateur sports people in competition 
            at the highest levels, for their support given to young people in 
            South Lanarkshire; congratulates the young people supported by the 
            trust on the success they have achieved; notes the work of <strong>sport</strong>Scotland 
            in this area, working to ensure that sport is more widely available 
            to all with investment of £8.1 million per year; believes that such 
            initiatives and investment promote confidence and community spirit 
            among our young people; further believes that this type of community-based 
            support from the local community would benefit other communities across 
            Scotland, and believes that such initiatives, promoting access to 
            sport and promotion of sporting excellence among young people, are 
            worthy of suitable support from the Scottish Executive.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3839</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: The Madrid Declaration</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">commends the active involvement 
            of Scottish members of the European Disability Forum in publishing 
            the Madrid Declaration in this European Year of Disabled People; agrees 
            with its authors that disability is a human rights issue, that people 
            with disabilities seek equal opportunity, not charity, and that people 
            in Scotland with disabilities are invisible citizens; supports their 
            view that local authorities, employers, trade unions, educationalists 
            and national authorities should be doing much more to ensure that 
            people with disabilities enter the labour market as equals and that 
            their employment should be based on equality in relation to terms, 
            conditions and opportunities for promotion; endorses the Madrid Declaration, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to pledge its support for the 
            declaration.</a></p>
