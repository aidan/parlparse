<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2182</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Fixing the Graduate Endowment Problems</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of measures by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to bring the operation of the deferment of graduate endowment payments by continuing students within the law and appreciates the swift action taken by the Scottish Government to address this issue; notes with concern that the previous administration had been allowing this system to operate outwith the scope of the law, and urges the Scottish Government to remain vigilant in order to find and address any other areas in which the previous administration&rsquo;s competence fell short of what should be expected.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2181</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Smoking Prevention</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement of the Smoking Prevention Action Plan which proposes a range of measures to discourage young people from taking up smoking; recognises that these measures, among others, include (a) restricting the display of tobacco at points of sale, (b) introducing licensing and sanctions on those who illegally sell tobacco to those under age, (c) the possible banning of sales of cigarettes in packs of 10 and (d) reducing underage sales from vending machines; acknowledges research which shows that the younger someone begins smoking, the less likely they are to give up; notes with concern that over 13,000 people per year die from tobacco use in Scotland, and believes that time should be allocated after the summer recess to debate smoking prevention, with particular reference to young people, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2180</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Scottish Education Awards 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the winners of the Scottish Education Awards, including the achievements of David Miller from St Ninian&rsquo;s High School in Bishopbriggs, who was named Teacher of the Year; notes the achievements of St Ninian&rsquo;s High in collecting the International Schools Award, having established links with schools and projects around the globe, and further notes that Merkland School in East Dunbartonshire won the Most Enterprising Special School Award.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2175</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Stepping Out</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the theme of Stepping Out on &nbsp;National Falls Awareness Day UK,&nbsp;being launched by Help the Aged in Scotland on 24 June 2008; acknowledges the important work being done at national and local levels to prevent falls; notes the serious physical and psychological impact that falls can have, especially on older people, and that falls represent the most frequent and serious type of accident for&nbsp;adults aged over 65 years, as well as a high cost to the NHS with hospital stays related to hip fractures costing around &pound;5,000 per fracture; expresses concern that following a fall an older person has a 50% probability of having their mobility seriously impaired and a 10% probability of dying within a year, and urges all local authorities as a priority to identify and repair dangerous pavements to reduce the risk of falls.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2174</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Kirsty McWilliam</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kirsty McWilliam, a 17-year-old from Kilsyth, who won the Under 20&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s category in the Triathlon World Championships recently held in Vancouver; acknowledges this great achievement and the hard work and training that Kirsty and the rest of the Great British team put in; applauds the dedication and talent that Kirsty has shown and hopes that she will inspire other young people to take up the sport and engage in healthy lifestyles, and wishes Kirsty all the success for the future and looks forward to following her career with interest.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2173</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>North Lanarkshire Children&rsquo;s Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes and supports the North Lanarkshire Children&rsquo;s Games, which took place on 12 and 13 June 2008 in Wishaw Sports Centre and involved over 3,000 school pupils from across the whole of North Lanarkshire; congratulates North Lanarkshire Council for providing opportunities for young people to participate in an Olympic-style sporting event involving a range of sports including athletics, badminton, basketball, football, rugby and netball and hopes that this will encourage active lifestyles, increase interest in the 2014 Commonwealth Games and inspire young people to take up sporting activities and perhaps become Scotland&rsquo;s future athletes.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2172</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Funding Cuts by Scottish Government to Glasgow Science Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled at the decision of the Scottish Government to cut the funding of the Glasgow Science Centre (GSC) from &pound;1.7 million in 2007-08 to &pound;1.4 million in 2008-09 and to &pound;1.08 million in 2009-10; notes the international standing of GSC which is one of only three science centres in the United Kingdom to be a full member of the Association of Science-Technology Centres (ASTC) and that GSC has been awarded five star status by VisitScotland; notes further that GSC serves schools and communities through inreach and outreach in every local authority area in Scotland; is concerned that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s new funding method takes no account of the breadth or quality of the experience offered at GSC; contrasts the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning&rsquo;s bold statement that the Scottish Government will tackle poor levels of science achievement in Scotland with the reality of SNP Government cuts in the funding of Scotland&rsquo;s only international standard science centre; is concerned at the lengthy lack of engagement with GSC over the proposals, and calls on Scottish Ministers to reinstate the previous levels of funding to GSC to enable it to continue to bring a rich experience and interest in science to young people across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2171</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Age of Alcohol Purchase</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the 2006 Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey that 84% of 15-year-olds reported ever having drunk alcohol, while 36% had had a drink in the previous week, that in 2006-07 there were 41,651 discharges from general hospitals with an alcohol-related diagnosis, or 762 per 100,000 population, an increase of 7% from 710 per 100,000 population in 2002-03, that the number of alcohol-related deaths went from less than one-in-100 in 1980 to one-in-30 in 2005, including contributing to one-in-three adult pedestrian fatalities and 50% of deaths caused by fire; notes that, in the Scottish Health Survey 2003, 27% of Scottish men and approximately 13% of Scottish women reported usual alcohol consumption in excess of the recommended weekly limit; notes that alcohol misuse costs Scottish society at least &pound;1,071 million per year; commends the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Plan for Action on Alcohol Problems</em> and its recognition of the fact that &quot;in Scotland we face a substantial challenge in readjusting our attitudes and behaviours in relation to alcohol, and in particular, educating our young people to adopt a sensible approach to alcohol consumption&quot;; notes that many studies show that in the United States of America raising the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) from 18 to 21 years showed significant decreases in traffic crashes and traffic fatalities as well as a decrease in the proportion of 17 to 18-year-old students reported drinking in the last month from 72% in 1980 to 51% in 1999, the period immediately following widespread adoption of the rise in MLDA; recognises the dangers of alcohol misuse by those of all age groups and the pressing need to create a culture of responsible, rather than binge, drinking, and believes that the Scottish Government should limit the sale of alcohol in off-sales and supermarkets to people aged 21 and over, not only to help reduce accidents and encourage a more sensible approach to drinking but also to reduce the incidence of alcohol-fuelled youth disorder.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2170</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Thank You!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes to thank the staff who have kept the first year of Session 3 running, including catering, cleaning, SPICe, Chamber Office, Committee Office, Visitor Services, Post Office, mail room, Allowances, BIT, Events, Facilities Management, Personnel and Security; notes the hard work and dedication of the Parliament&rsquo;s staff as we come to summer recess, and hopes that the working relationships continue to be successful between MSPs, their staff and the Parliament&rsquo;s staff.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2169</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Christine Fulton on being nominated for an MBE in The Queen&rsquo;s Birthday Honours List; notes the work that Christine has carried out in campaigning for protective vests/jackets to prevent knife wounds for police officers as well as the setting up of Care of Police Survivors, a charity which helps survivors come to terms with their loss, and recognises that out of her own personal tragedy she has achieved so much to help others.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2168</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Parliament Celebrates Independence...Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Sodexho to celebrate independence by producing a menu in the Parliament for American Independence Day on 4 July; notes that the occasion is marked in the United States with a national holiday; hopes when Scotland becomes independent that similar celebrations and festivities will take place on an annual basis, and also notes that this year America celebrates 232 years of independence.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2167</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>UK Referendum on Alternative Provisions to Treaty of Lisbon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the citizens of the Republic of Ireland for its principled and determined opposition to the Treaty of Lisbon; agrees with the &quot;NO&quot; campaign&rsquo;s rejection of a centralised bureaucracy in Brussels, and, so that this may be shown to be a pan-European objection to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, and not a rejection of the EU itself, calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to allow UK citizens the same opportunity to take part in the democratic development of the EU by holding a referendum on any future alternative proposals to provisions in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2166</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Avoidance of Illegal Action on Lisbon Treaty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Lisbon Treaty requires ratification by all EU member states before any of its provisions can be enacted legally, including the appointment of a President and Foreign Minister, and calls on the Scottish Government to make clear to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government its opposition to any action or agreement to act with ministers of other EU states on the part of UK ministers, to illegally bring into being any of the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty and to give notice that Scottish Ministers will abstain from any such illegal action, while continuing to observe their legal obligations under existing EU treaties.</p>
