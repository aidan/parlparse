<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5696#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Glasgow Save Our Homes Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow Save Our Homes (GSOH) campaign on its ongoing support for those owner-occupiers of houses factored by Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) who have been under the burden of imposed one-year time limits for the payment of bills of &pound;6,000 to &pound;8,000 and who through their own unity and the considerable support of GSOH have won recent court victories that have allowed the extension of payment times to between two and four years, and believes that for these ordinary families, pensioners and low-paid Glasgow citizens this has been a rightful and well-deserved movement on the road to sanity in the dealings of GHA with these owner-occupiers.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5695</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robert Brown<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5694</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Save Ferguson&rsquo;s Shipyard</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 99 workers at Ferguson&rsquo;s in Port Glasgow face imminent redundancy unless a new order for work is found and urges the Scottish Executive to meet the workers&rsquo; trade unions in order to reach agreement that an order for a fisheries protection vessel be urgently placed with the yard, thus safeguarding these vital skilled jobs.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5693</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Disability Payments by Glasgow City Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the decision of Glasgow City Council to withdraw the &pound;4.00 per month payments to adults with learning disabilities who attend the council&rsquo;s day centres; believes that this small payment represented a wage and added much-needed self-esteem to some of the most disadvantaged people in our society and was a means of providing a small degree of independence for users of the service; calls on the council to reconsider its decision, and notes that the financial savings of approximately &pound;42,000 to the council will not even cover the cost of the retirement party which the city is hosting for its departing councillors.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5692</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Tackling Alcohol Misuse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent alcohol statistics published by the Office for National Statistics which show that men and women in Scotland are twice as likely to die an alcohol-related death as people in the United Kingdom as a whole; recognises the huge cost of alcohol abuse to the health service and the economy and its impact on families; further recognises the clear links between alcohol abuse and crime and antisocial behaviour; further notes that youth disorder and violence in many communities throughout Scotland are often fuelled by cheap and easily available alcohol; welcomes measures such as test purchasing and calls for the strict enforcement of existing licensing legislation to prevent the sale or supply of alcohol to those under age, and calls for the powers contained within the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 to be extended to off-sales premises, thus stopping irresponsible drink promotions in off-sales premises and the practice of deep discounting of alcohol by supermarkets.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5691</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Rural Postcodes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Parcelforce imposes a separate regime of charges for the Highlands and Islands which it classifies as Zone 2, while England, Wales and other parts of Scotland are in Zone 1; further notes that these charges are considerably higher in Zone 2 than in Zone 1; notes with concern that, in response to Aviemore and Vicinity Community Council pursuing this issue, Jim Fitzpatrick MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Employment Relations and Postal Services at the  Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has indicated that he approves of these extra charges; considers that the UK Government therefore acquiesces in the higher charges imposed for one area of the United Kingdom, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Parcelforce and to the DTI to end this discriminatory treatment.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5690</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Economy and Small Business</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the need to make the Scottish economy and hence Scottish businesses increasingly competitive and therefore welcomes the SNP&rsquo;s Small Business Bonus Scheme, which will remove 120,000 small businesses from eligibility to pay business rates and reduce the rates burden on a further 30,000 small businesses by either 25% or 50%, thereby increasing small business viability and bringing increased vibrancy and job opportunity to cities, towns, villages and rural Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5689</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>North Edinburgh Social Action Research Project on Employment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the successful North Edinburgh Social Action Research Project on Employment; notes the project&rsquo;s conclusion that people in north Edinburgh want opportunities to gain the skills, training and experience they need to get jobs that have genuine career prospects, decent pay and better reflect their interests and goals, and supports the project&rsquo;s recommendations, particularly those calling for new approaches to local employment strategies and apprenticeship schemes.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5688&diams; </strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>A Review of Scotland&rsquo;s Response to Flooding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the devastation experienced by communities in Moray and throughout Scotland as a result of flooding in recent years; recognises the increasing threat to the nation of flooding as a result of climate change; believes that it is time for a thorough review of flood management and policy to ensure that Scotland is equipped to respond effectively to flood risks in the 21st century, and notes that the review should include the modernisation of legislation, the roles of engineering and sustainable management approaches in managing flood risk, the relevant funding mechanisms given that small local authorities such as Moray Council must carry an enormous and disproportionate financial burden as a result of nature, and the role of local and national authorities in the delivery of flood management.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5686&diams; </strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Executive to Deliver on Hospital Car Parking Charges Pledge?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, while welcoming the comments regarding hospital car park charges made by the First Minister at his latest &quot;Ask Jack&quot; event in Glasgow where he recognised the problem and stated that &quot;If the health boards don&rsquo;t sort it out, we will intervene&quot;, holds serious reservations as to whether this statement is a firm pledge of action rather than of electioneering; believes that the Scottish Executive has had ample time to address this situation which is of great concern to users and staff alike in hospitals such as at Yorkhill in Glasgow as, when questioned in September 2006 as to whether or not the Executive would consider legislating on this issue rather than simply issuing non-enforceable guidelines or, at the very least, admit that a problem existed, the Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care offered a rather curt &quot;No&quot;, and further believes that the Executive should allay the fears of many NHS users and staff that the First Minister&rsquo;s comments are little more than electioneering by informing the Parliament what measures it intends taking and when.</p>
