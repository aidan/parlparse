            strongly supports the university&#8217;s Fair Trade policy; notes 
            that the Fair Trade coffee brand, Caf&#233;direct, is now the fourth

            GM Ban</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament considers that the proposal 
            for a voluntary GM ban across East Lothian and the Borders is unworkable 
            and condemns the decision to proceed with GM maize crops as showing 
            a breathtaking disdain for the public, the Parliament, and science.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1029</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Remember 
            Dunblane - Conservative&#8217;s Insensitive Remarks</strong>&#8212;That 
            the Parliament believes that, with the devastating outcome of the 
            Dunblane tragedy still etched on the minds of the Scottish public, 
            the comments in relation to the slackening of the handgun regulations 
            attributed to Patrick Mercer MP, Conservative spokesman on homeland 
            security, are entirely inappropriate and offensive, and further believes, 
            following Mr Mercer&#8217;s comments, that David McLetchie MSP, leader 
            of the Scottish Conservatives, should unreservedly condemn these insensitive 
            comments and should ensure that Mr Mercer is removed from his Tory 
            spokesman responsibility by Michael Howard MP, leader of the opposition 
            party at Westminster, with immediate effect.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1028</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Protection 
            of Aucheninnes Moss</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament recognises 
            that Aucheninnes Moss in Dumfries and Galloway is one of the few examples 
            of active raised bog habitat that survives in the lowlands and as 
            such has significant conservation value at local, regional and even 
            international level; is concerned about the decision to destroy the 
            habitat at Aucheninnes Moss and replace it with a landfill site; is 
            further concerned that this action threatens the extinction of two 
            species of insect in Scotland, the bog bush-cricket <em>(Metrioptera 
            brachyptera)</em> and the Sorrel pygmy moth (<em>Enteucha acetosae</em>) 
            and that it will also destroy a population of the endangered large 
            heath butterfly (<em>Coenonympha tullia</em>) and a foraging area 
            for vulnerable nightjars (<em>Caprimulgus europaeus</em>); welcomes 
            the report by Buglife, The Invertebrate Conservation Trust<em>,</em> 
            showing that Aucheninnes Moss fits the EU Habitats Directive category 
            of an &quot;active raised bog&quot; habitat and also the category 
            &quot;degraded raised bog capable of regeneration&quot;, and, therefore, 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to request that Scottish Natural Heritage 
            afford Aucheninnes Moss protection by designating it a Special Area 
            of Conservation.</p>

            Memorial Hall Closure</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament condemns 
            the proposed closure and possible demolition of the Campsie Memorial 
            Hall in Milton of Campsie; recognises that the closure of this hall 
            will represent a significant loss to members of the community, both 
            young and old; acknowledges that its variety of use extends from sports 
            to baby clinics, and deplores the destruction of a building dedicated 
            to the war dead.</p>

            Rape as a Crime in Scotland</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament recognises 
            that non-gender-specific rape is currently not a crime in Scotland; 
            supports the stance of the Scottish Youth Parliament on this issue, 
            and supports a change in legislation to include non-gender-specific 
            rape as a crime.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-1015#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Support 
            Service for Victims of Trafficking</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            utterly condemns the international organised criminal gangs involved 
            in the trafficking of women for sexual exploitation; opposes the deception 
            of women <strong></strong>from poor backgrounds into believing that 
            they are coming to the UK for legitimate work and their coercion; 
            is extremely concerned at the increasing numbers of trafficked women 
            held as sex slaves in flats, saunas and massage parlours in towns 
            and cities throughout Scotland; recognises the plight of trafficking 
            victims who are often beaten, bound, blackmailed and forced into prostitution, 
            are given no money and have their passports taken by the traffickers; 
            notes with concern that women fleeing from traffickers fear death 
            threats, violence and repercussions to both themselves and their families 
            back home; further notes that in a raid on a <strong></strong>Glasgow 
            sauna in 2002 nine foreign women were believed to be working as sex 
            slaves and that another Glasgow sauna advertised on the internet that 
            all its women were bonded; considers that the immigration system must 
            recognise the specific experience of trafficked women, who when returned 
            as illegal immigrants are often met at the destination airport by 
            traffickers to return to the same miserable trafficked life, and therefore 
            welcomes the Scottish Executive International Women&#8217;s Day announcement 
            of &#163;100,000 to Glasgow City Council for a pilot support service 
            for victims of trafficking that will assess the needs of trafficked 
            women, provide support services and collate information on trafficking.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1014</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Trolley 
            Waits</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament deplores the increased trolley 
            waits in certain Glasgow hospitals which resulted in a significant 
            number of patients sleeping overnight on trolleys in Accident and 
            Emergency units; further deplores the fact that severity of pressure 
            on certain hospitals has resulted in them being regularly forced to 
            divert GP referrals and 999 ambulances to other hospitals; considers 
            that this places NHS trusts in an impossible position, and further 
            considers that the failure of the Scottish Executive to engage with 
            trusts to adequately resource acute receiving facilities will result 
            in further deterioration in standards of patient care, clinical safety 
            and staff morale.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-1013</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Threat 
            to Call Centre Jobs in Scotland</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            notes the proposed closure of the long-established British Airways 
            Glasgow call centre announced on 17 February 2004, which puts 400 
            Contact BA jobs <strong></strong>under threat; believes that this 
            is only the latest in a string of threatened closures affecting Scotland&#8217;s 
            56,000 call centre jobs; expresses grave concern over the outflow 
            of both jobs and investment from Scotland, as identified in the Scottish 
            Economic Policy Network report, <em>Call Centres in Scotland and Outsourced 
            Competition from India,</em> and welcomes the commissioning of an

            will address this issue, believes that a fully-resourced Children&#8217;s 
            Hearing system represents the best way of dealing with young offenders; 
            does not believe that extending the use of Antisocial Behaviour Orders 
            to under-16s is appropriate, and considers that, rather than creating 
            extra legal powers such as dispersal, the police should be provided 
            with extra resources.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-532.3</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Antisocial 
            Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#8212;As an amendment to motion 
            (S2M-532) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot; does not agree to the general principles 
            of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill because, whilst welcoming 
            the seriousness with which the Scottish Executive takes the issue 
            of antisocial behaviour, it regrets that the Antisocial Behaviour 
            etc. (Scotland) Bill fails to address the causes of antisocial behaviour 
            or to put enforcement measures in context, and believes, therefore, 
            that the Bill will not deliver the solution to antisocial behaviour 
            that it promises.&quot;</p>
