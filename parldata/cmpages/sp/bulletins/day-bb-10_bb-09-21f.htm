<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7029 Dave Thompson: Congratulations to Plockton High School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Plockton High School on being awarded the Highlands and Islands Young Engineers and Science Club of the Year award at the Scottish Council for Development and Industry awards in Inverness on Friday 17 September 2010; considers that this is down to the hard work and dedication of the headteacher, Mr Duncan Ferguson, the teacher, Mr James Kean, and the other staff as well as the pupils of the school, and encourages everyone involved to continue their excellent work for the greater good of their school and future young engineers and scientists.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7028 Robin Harper: BlindCraft Closure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the decision by the administration of City of Edinburgh Council to start a period of 90 days&rsquo; statutory consultation with staff of BlindCraft about closure of the business; considers that BlindCraft is a valuable and reputable company, established in 1793, which makes quality beds and provides employment opportunities particularly for those who are disabled or have a visual impairment; believes that closure will have a severe impact on its 70 workers, particularly the two-thirds who have a visual impairment, and on the public purse, to support redundant workers; notes that in 2008 the company won a contract with John Lewis to the tune of &pound;2 million and understands that its projected sales for 2010-11 were &pound;1.58 million; welcomes the campaign and petition by workers and supporters to save BlindCraft, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene to prevent the closure.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7027 Maureen Watt: Unight Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the success of the Unight scheme in Aberdeen in driving down drink-related antisocial behaviour in Aberdeen city centre; welcomes the joint approach between the pubs and clubs involved, which means that a ban from one venue for antisocial behaviour is a ban from them all; notes that drug detection rates have doubled since the scheme was introduced while serious assaults in pubs and clubs have fallen by 20%, and believes that the full involvement of licensed premises is vital in making pubs and nightclubs safer for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>Supported by: Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Aileen Campbell<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7026 Joe FitzPatrick: Suicide Prevention Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Samaritans on what is seen as its successful 2010 Suicide Prevention Week campaign in conjunction with many partners, including Health Scotland, local authorities and Network Rail; notes that rates of suicide remain highest in young men across Scotland, and applauds the efforts of groups such as the Samaritans on tackling this across the nation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7025 Joe FitzPatrick: Discovery Award Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates what it considers the continued success of the Discovery Award Scheme in allowing people over 50 to discover new talents, strengths and interests, allowing them to find new and interesting people as well as the satisfaction of helping others; notes the expansion of the scheme from Dundee in 1987 to dozens of nations around the world, and wishes the scheme and everyone involved all the very best wishes for their future endeavours.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7017&diams;   Ian McKee: Self Management Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Scotland&rsquo;s first Self Management Week, taking place between 4 and 8 October 2010;considers the Self Management Fund administered by the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland (LTCAS) on behalf of the Scottish Government to be successful; congratulates the work ofthe 81 diverse voluntary sector-led projects, which it considers are making a difference to the lives of people with long-term conditions across Scotland; notes in particular the Lothian Centre for Inclusive Living that is currently developing a national telephone counselling service run by trained councillors who are living with long-term conditions; considersthat, with around 40% of Scotland&rsquo;s population living with at least one long-term condition, this group is likely to be among the worst affected by falling public spending; welcomes LTCAS&rsquo;s new self-management awareness-raising campaign, to be launched on 29 September, and believes that the self-management agenda is now more vital than ever to ensure a high quality, person-centred and cost-effective approach.</p>
