          <p><strong>*S2M-1540</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Equestrian Performance Centre</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            excellent work of Oatridge College, Broxburn, in its endeavours to 
            establish a Scottish Equestrian Performance Centre; supports its bids 
            for funding allocations, and calls on the Scottish Executive to undertake 
            a review of the equine industry in Scotland with a view to initiating 
            a support strategy for the industry.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1539</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Death 
            Sentences Imposed on Medical Staff in Libya</strong>-That the Parliament 
            expresses great sympathy and support for the children affected by 
            the tragic HIV infection at al-Fateh Children's Hospital, Benghazi, 
            Libya; urges the Libyan authorities to recognize the evidence and 
            address the possibility that the children were infected with HIV because 
            of poor health care resources and practices at the above hospital 
            and not by intentional transmission by the accused Bulgarian and Palestinian 
            health workers; notes that the Benghazi Criminal Court ignored testimonies 
            of expert witnesses such as Professor Luc Montagnier, who stated that 
            the epidemic was caused by the poor hygiene at the hospital and had 
            begun before any of the accused had started work there; further notes 
            the deeply disturbing reports that the health workers were tortured 
            into false confessions, and condemns the death sentences imposed on 
            the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1538</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Byron 
            Square Shop Shutters Regeneration Project</strong>-That the Parliament 
            commends the Byron Square Shop Shutters Regeneration Project in Aberdeen; 
            congratulates the young people involved for the excellent and innovative 
            artwork on the shutters; notes the invaluable contribution of those 
            responsible for running the project in making it a success, and further 
            notes the importance of projects such as this that involve young people 
            more fully in their communities.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1537#</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Physiotherapy 
            Week 2004</strong>-That the Parliament commends the work of the Chartered 
            Society of Physiotherapy; welcomes this year's Physiotherapy Week 
            2004 from 5 to 9 July; recognises the important work done by physiotherapists 
            across Scotland in the treatment of a wide range of injuries and medical 
            conditions, as well as in promoting healthy living, restoring function 
            movement and independence and prevention of injury and illness through 
            activity, information and advice, and further recognises the important 
            role of physiotherapists in communities and in assisting many to be 
            able to continue to live normal and active lives.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1536#</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> 
            <strong>Better Access to Small Claims and Summary Cause Procedures</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the significant cross-party support previously 
            expressed for an increase to the threshold for access to small claims 
            and summary cause proceedings; believes that the case for updating 
            the limits has been made and that limits of £5,000 and £15,000 for 
            small claims and summary cause respectively should be urgently considered; 
            further notes that as a consequence the privative limit should be 
            increased to £5,000, and considers that such changes are required 
            to improve affordable access to justice.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1535</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>New 
            Ownership of the Telegraph Group</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay on their acquisition of the Telegraph 
            group; celebrates their success as another example of Scottish entrepreneurial 
            spirit thriving within the United Kingdom, and looks forward to continued 
            journalistic excellence in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> and <em>Sunday 
            Telegraph</em> and the <em>Spectator</em> and <em>Apollo</em> magazines.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1534</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh 
            People's Festival</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the 3rd annual 
            Edinburgh People's Festival and its programme for 2004; notes that 
            the aim of the People's Festival is to include those communities not 
            normally involved in celebrating the world's greatest arts festival; 
            notes that this year's Edinburgh People's Festival celebration runs 
            from 7 to 14 August 2004 and will take place in Craigmillar, Leith, 
            Newcraighall, Saughton, Wester Hailes, Gorgie, Gilmerton, Inch and 
            Portobello and will present a wide range of attractions including 
            rock, folk and classical music, comedy, theatre, debates, puppet shows, 
            visual arts, storytelling and special surprise events, and wishes 
            the artists, organisers and participants in the Edinburgh People's 
            Festival every continued success.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1533</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Stop 
            the Unfair Taxing of Our Troops</strong>-That the Parliament deplores 
            the fact that Scottish troops are still required to pay council tax 
            whilst serving abroad in places such as Iraq; considers it unfair 
            that persons in prison, diplomats and members of visiting defence 
            organisations, among others, are exempt from paying council tax within 
            Scotland but members of our own armed forces when serving abroad are 
            not, and further considers that members should support immediate legislation 
            to ensure that our troops are no longer forced to pay this tax while 
            not even domiciled within Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1532#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>National 
            Respect for Shopworkers Week</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            National Respect for Shopworkers Week, 5 to 11 July 2004, as part 
            of the Freedom from Fear campaign that seeks to highlight the unacceptable 
            level of abuse and violence suffered by shopworkers; congratulates 
            the shopworkers' union, USDAW, on its campaign to promote respect 
            for shopworkers and improve workplace safety; notes the report from 
            the Co-operative Group last year, which showed a 39% increase in violent 
            crime against staff in Co-op convenience stores and which highlighted 
            the scale of the problem; recognises the importance of a close partnership 
            between police, retailers, shopworkers and communities, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive, local authorities, retailers and other 
            relevant agencies should work together to secure safer workplaces 
            in safer communities.</P>
