MacKay: 20th Anniversary of the Recognition of HIV/AIDS</STRONG>-That the Parliament 
notes that 2003 marks the 20th anniversary of the discovery of HIV as being the 
virus that leads to AIDS; further notes that at the end of 2002 the United Nations 
estimated that over 40 million people had been infected with the virus and many 
millions more affected by it; acknowledges that Scotland, and Edinburgh in particular, 
were seen as being at the forefront of the epidemic in the early 1980s; recognises 
the achievements of voluntary and statutory organisations involved in limiting 
the impact of HIV/AIDS in Scotland; further recognises that the current epidemic 
is particularly virulent in sub-Saharan Africa where over 25 million people are 
infected with the virus, and encourages Scottish organisations and institutions 
working on HIV/AIDS to develop partnerships with similar organisations in southern 
Africa to share expertise and encourage mutual understanding of how best to care 
for people with HIV and to maximise our efforts at preventing further transmissions 
of HIV.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3968#</STRONG> <STRONG>Shona Robison: Broughty Ferry 
Beach</STRONG>-That the Parliament notes that Broughty Ferry beach has not been 
recognised as a designated bathing beach by the Scottish Executive; recognises 
that the lack of such a designation has resulted in the beach being omitted from 
the European Commission's bathing waters website; notes that this has a detrimental 
impact on tourism as well as on the environment, and congratulates the local community 
for its hard work in organising beach clean-ups.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3967</STRONG>
