<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: The NHS and the Independent Sector&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3796</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>The NHS and the Independent Sector</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the success of the Scottish Regional Treatment Centre at Stracathro and pays tribute to the previous Scottish administration for piloting the scheme; notes that the Stracathro pilot was rated as excellent by its patients and has reduced waiting times, that the centre has no reported healthcare associated infections and that it has saved several million pounds of taxpayers&rsquo; money in the process of successfully treating NHS patients; further notes that since 1999 successive Scottish administrations have recognised the contribution that can be made by the independent sector to treating NHS patients, with a record 4,409 treatments performed in 2008, more than double the level in 1999 and a 38% increase since 2007, and accordingly urges the Scottish Government to continue to work with the independent sector in order to deliver the best possible healthcare for the people of Scotland. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3796.3</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: The NHS and the Independent Sector</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3796) in the name of Mary Scanlon, leave out from &quot;success&quot; to end and insert &quot;Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to a mutual NHS in Scotland and its decision only to use the private sector for health provision at the margins where necessary; further welcomes the fact that there has been a 37% drop in private sector acute activity, excluding Stracathro, between 2006 and 2008 and congratulates NHS staff for achieving this reduction; notes the role of the private treatment centre pilot at Stracathro, established by the last administration, and awaits the final evaluation of this pilot, and commends the Scottish Government policy to direct investment into the NHS rather than divert scarce resources into private sector health provision.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3796.1</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson: The NHS and the Independent Sector</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3796) in the name of Mary Scanlon, leave out from &quot;and pays&quot; to end and insert &quot;with its high level of patient approval and welcomes the Scottish Regional Treatment Centre&rsquo;s contribution to maintaining Stracathro Hospital as both a local and regional resource; notes the success of the nationalisation of the HCI hospital in Clydebank, now the Golden Jubilee National Hospital, and recognises the contribution of both these units and their staff in achieving the continuing reduction in waiting times.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-3796.2</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: The NHS and the Independent Sector</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3796) in the name of Mary Scanlon, insert at end&nbsp;&quot;, while ensuring that the use of the private sector does not destabilise local NHS provision or undermine the recruitment and retention of NHS staff.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Alcohol Strategy&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3778</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Alcohol Strategy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Scottish Government to incorporate its proposals for reform of the law relating to the sale of alcohol into a new health Bill, which will facilitate democratic accountability and greater parliamentary and public scrutiny of its proposals; calls on the Scottish Government to place greater emphasis on a much more rigorous application of the existing licensing laws and to recognise that any changes can be introduced only on the basis of a wider and meaningful consultation with the licensed trade and Scotland&rsquo;s communities, and believes that any measures taken to tackle binge drinking and underage drinking must be properly targeted and effective so that the responsible, sensible majority of moderate drinkers do not have to pay more or suffer as a result of the excesses of a small minority. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3778.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Alcohol Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3778) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from &quot;binge drinking&quot; to end and insert &quot;harmful drinking and under-age drinking must be workable and properly targeted so that, while the responsible, sensible majority of moderate drinkers are not unnecessarily penalised, wider issues of excess consumption contributing to huge costs to Scottish society are effectively addressed.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3778.1</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Alcohol Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3778) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from &quot;any changes&quot; to end and insert &quot;tackling Scotland&rsquo;s complex relationship with alcohol will require significant and long-term cultural change, and believes that any proposals for reform of the law should be targeted and evidence-based, introduced on the basis of strong public support and following meaningful consultation with all relevant interests and stakeholders to ensure that measures to address problematic alcohol consumption do not unfairly penalise the majority of individuals who enjoy alcohol responsibly.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>11.40 am</strong>&#9;General Question Time&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>1. Stuart McMillan:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assistance it is providing to people looking for employment in Scotland in light of recent figures showing that an average of 10 people apply for each job centre vacancy. (S3O-6434)</p>
