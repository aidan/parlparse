          <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#endsec">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-571</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Calls for Restraint in Myanmar Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the growing tension in Myanmar, previously known as Burma, with thousands of protestors facing an increasing threat of violence from the country&rsquo;s military rulers; remembers that the peaceful democracy protests in 1998 were met with violent repression and many deaths; respects the basic human right of all people to freedom of expression and protection from oppression, and therefore hopes that the calls from the international community for restraint will be heeded by the generals who rule Myanmar.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-570</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Ditch the Discrimination</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of ScottishPower to write off the debt, accrued through no fault of their own, of those token prepayment meter customers outside its former monopoly area; expresses concern that 13,000 customers in southern Scotland and Liverpool, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will continue to be exposed to debt that they have accrued because of ScottishPower&rsquo;s failure to reset antiquated token meters in a timely fashion following price rises; notes that, along with Npower and Powergen, it is one of the six major suppliers who adopt a policy of backcharging low-income customers, and calls on ScottishPower to go even further than Npower and Powergen by writing off the debts of all of its token meter customers and effectively ending the policy of backcharging.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-569</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Sikh Rights in Ireland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses disappointment at the recent Irish Government backing for the An Guarda Siochana, the Irish police force, ruling stating that a trainee Sikh police officer would not be given permission to wear his turban on duty; acknowledges the fact that the turban is a mandatory article of the Sikh faith and that this ruling effectively excludes the whole Sikh community from joining the An Guarda Siochana; believes that this position is directly opposed to comments by the Minister for Integration in his inaugural speech in July 2007 that &quot;I&rsquo;m open to all of your ideas and all of your contributions, because when I look down through this room today I see the citizens for the future. I see the tax payers of the future. I see the people who are going to bring Ireland into a new and very much brighter century, a century that will be more affluent, more open, more tolerant than the one that I was born into here in Ireland&quot; and Ireland&rsquo;s own social blueprint for the future, <em>Towards 2016, Ten-Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015</em>, which states as one of its main aims for the future that &quot;Every person, irrespective of background or gender, would enjoy equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination&quot;, and expresses the hope that through due process this decision will be overturned.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-568&diams;</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Crown Estate Taxation on Harbour Developments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the vital importance to island and coastal communities of their ports and harbours which serve lifeline transport links and, by supporting such industries as fishing, aquaculture, offshore oil, tourism and renewable energy, provide major employment opportunities; further notes that ports and harbours in the Highlands and Islands are largely owned by local authorities, trusts or other public bodies that operate for the benefit of the communities they serve and reinvest any profits in these communities; views with concern the charges such ports and harbour owners have to pay to the Crown Estate for the rental of areas of seabed; further views with concern the royalty charges imposed by the Crown Estate when material dredged from the seabed to assist navigation is used productively by harbour owners for land reclamation rather than being wastefully dumped at sea, and believes that serious consideration should be given as to how the Parliament&rsquo;s powers to legislate over the property rights of the Crown in Scotland, as outlined in the December 2006 report of the Crown Estate Review Working Group, could be used to lift this unjustifiable burden of Crown Estate taxation from ports and harbour operators.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-567</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Orkney Schools Lead Scotland on Standard Grades</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 90% of S4 pupils in Orkney attained five or more standard grades; further notes that this is a higher percentage than in any other Scottish local authority area and is well above the Scottish average of 75%, and congratulates the Orcadian pupils and their teachers for these excellent results which must be the result of both first-rate teaching and sustained hard work by the pupils.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-566</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Congratulation to Forres in Bloom</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Forres in Bloom following the award by the judges of Beautiful Scotland of the medium town trophy for the fourth year in succession; commends the efforts of the committee of Forres in Bloom, the people of Forres and Moray Council for the eye-catching floral displays that impressed the judges with stunning flowers in the Grant Park and the planting on the market green that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scout movement, and further commends the pupils of Pilmuir and Applegrove primary schools for their contribution and interest.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-565</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Scottish Enterprise Restructure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Government&rsquo;s changes to the Scottish Enterprise network and the potentially negative impact on the south of Scotland economy; considers that, by removing the current 21 local enterprise companies and local boards, each with local decision-making powers, and replacing them with only six regional operations, only one of which will be situated in the south of Scotland which is the second largest region in Scotland, the invaluable resource of having very localised advice, support and investment will be lost and regrets in particular that the local decision-making powers with the inclusion of private sector board members with real business experience and knowledge will be removed; further considers that the loss of the expertise and experience of their local economy gained by local enterprise companies&rsquo; staff will be detrimental to all local economies and Scotland as a whole, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses; further notes with concern that there is no clear indication of how the new set-up will be funded both in terms of the functions transferred to local authorities and the way in which funding will be made available to the new tourism structures; recognises the integral role played by local enterprise companies in nurturing their local areas, particularly in the Scottish Borders where the economy has grown at twice the rate of the national Scottish average; questions how the south of Scotland&rsquo;s competitiveness strategy will now be delivered, and recognises with great sadness that the changes will result in job losses across the south of Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-564</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Parents Have a Right to Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that parents caring for a child with cancer often struggle to balance their commitment to work with caring for their sick child; acknowledges that 49% of parents end up using their own sick leave or holiday allowance to care for their children with cancer; notes that families experience financial stress when their child is diagnosed with cancer and that 43% of families suffer a higher level of debt as a result; highlights the benefits to employers of looking after employees with caring responsibilities; recognises that parents now have the right to request flexible working arrangements but agrees with the children&rsquo;s cancer charity, CLIC Sargent, that parents have a right to care, and urges the Scottish Government to work with the UK Government in the development of a carers&rsquo; strategy that provides the paid leave and career breaks, as well as the support, advice and information, that parents caring for children with cancer desperately need.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-563</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Congratulating Britain&rsquo;s Best Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Pollok Country Park for being named Britain&rsquo;s Best Park; notes that the park has been pivotal in hosting many of Scotland&rsquo;s flagship outdoor events, recently attracting 60,000 people to its family fun day, and believes that the people of Pollok, Glasgow and Scotland will continue to make the best use of such an excellent facility.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-562</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Pipes and Partners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the third annual Pipes and Partners concert at Keppoch Campus in Possilpark; notes the contribution made to the event by the pupils of Abercorn Secondary School, Cleveden Secondary School, Saracen Primary School and St Teresa&rsquo;s Primary School and also by the Strathclyde Police pipe band; acknowledges the enjoyment brought to the local community by the event and the sizeable charitable donations that have accrued over the past three years, and congratulates all those involved in making this annual event such a success.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-561</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Alcohol and Pregnancy: A Dangerous Cocktail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is aware of the dangerous impact of alcohol on pregnancy, with miscarriage, stillbirth and pre-term delivery among many possible effects; welcomes the recent publication of the British Medical Association (BMA) report, <em>Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, A Guide for Healthcare Professionals</em>; notes that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a severe condition which impairs brain functions and can lead to physical abnormalities among children; supports BMA recommendations for further research into FASD; believes that the Scottish Government should consider the implementation of guidance and training of healthcare professionals on the prevention, diagnosis and management of FASD at the earliest practical opportunity; is aware that six out of 10 mothers drink alcohol while pregnant, many of whom are unaware of the danger to their unborn child, and therefore asks the Scottish Government to raise public awareness of this issue and to provide clear health advice that alcohol should not be consumed during pregnancy, while ensuring that any revision of guidance on alcohol consumption should contain specific advice on the risk of FASD and other side effects in pregnancy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-560</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>Dispute at Edinburgh&rsquo;s Telford College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the current dispute resulting from Edinburgh&rsquo;s Telford College enlisting a private agency to contract temporary and fixed-term lecturers, instructors and learning assistants at lower rates of pay than those of permanent staff and without pension rights; considers that introducing a two-tier system of pay and employment rights can only have a negative impact on staff morale and inevitably will affect the standards and quality of education available; believes that such a situation is unacceptable in Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive to support the introduction of the EU agency workers directive and the introduction of legislation at UK level to establish the principle of pay and conditions for agency workers being equal to those of workers who are permanently employed.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-557</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>National Autistic Society in Scotland - Daldorch House School Senior Campus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament appreciates the difficulties that many young people with autism face in making the transition from school to adulthood; congratulates the National Autistic Society Scotland and Principal, Shona Pinkerton, and all the staff at Daldorch House School, Catrine, East Ayrshire on the official opening of its new senior campus on Friday 21 September 2007; notes that this is the first facility of its kind in Scotland to provide continuing education opportunities and supported living arrangements for children and young people between 16 and 21 years old with autism; recognises the enormous difference that the intensive and specialised support provided for young people attending Daldorch House makes in preparing them for adult life; wishes the staff and pupils of Daldorch House well in the future, and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that all young people with autism have access to early and effective support during the transition to adulthood to enable them to realise their potential.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-556</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Burmese Democracy Movement Must Succeed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the actions of the massive peaceful demonstrations to bring an end to the forty-year old military dictatorship in Burma and rescue the people of Burma from enforced poverty, oppression and economic stagnation; calls on the military junta to pave the way to democracy, liberate Aung San Suu Kyi and restore Burmese social, environmental and political freedoms, and calls on the United Nations and trading partners and neighbouring states to come to the aid of the Burmese people.</p>
