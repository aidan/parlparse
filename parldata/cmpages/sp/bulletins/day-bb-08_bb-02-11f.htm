<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1341</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Scottish Tourism Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of tourism for the Scottish economy; welcomes Scottish Tourism Week from 4 to 11 March 2008 and endorses the efforts of the Scottish Tourism Forum; notes the importance of long-distance footpaths such as the West Highland Way which are attracting increasing numbers of walkers keen to enjoy the unique landscape between Milngavie and Fort William, and warmly welcomes the commitment of East Dunbartonshire Council to upgrading facilities and signage in Milngavie town centre, the starting point for most visitors embarking on the West Highland Way.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1340</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Dental School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the widespread support among communities in the north east of Scotland for the establishment of a dental school in Aberdeen; endorses the call by the<em> Aberdeen Evening Express </em>for the facility to be a full dental school; believes that Aberdeen and the north east of Scotland require a full dental school as a matter of urgency; is concerned that Scottish-domiciled students applying to study dentistry at the new Aberdeen Dental School will be liable to pay their own tuition fees; recognises that this will cost Scottish-domiciled students approximately &pound;7,000 in fees; notes that students wishing to study dentistry in Dundee and Glasgow do not pay tuition fees and believes that the decision to charge tuition fees to dental students in Aberdeen is unfair and will act as a block on the number of students wishing to pursue a career in dentistry in the north east; believes that students wishing to study dentistry in Aberdeen should not be penalised in this way, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that Scottish-domiciled students studying at the Aberdeen Dental School are not required to pay tuition fees and continue to have access to the bursary support available to students studying in Dundee and Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1339</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Resettlement and Support Initiative, South Lanarkshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes and supports the renaming of South Lanarkshire&rsquo;s Rough Sleepers Initiative as the Resettlement and Support Initiative (RSI) to reflect the changing nature of the service which celebrates its 10th anniversary in March 2008; notes that the RSI is a partnership involving Barnardo&rsquo;s, YMCA Glasgow, South Lanarkshire Council and the Jubilee Key Scheme; recognises the range of person-centred services offered by the RSI for homeless, roofless and vulnerable individuals by adopting a flexible, holistic approach towards the issues affecting service-user groups, and welcomes the continued success of the RSI in developing a range of innovative services in partnership with service users and others including rent deposit schemes, Nightstop, the Tenancy Support Service and the Rural Outreach scheme in an aim to reduce and prevent rough sleeping.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1337</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>There is No Such Creature as British Law</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern that, in the context of comments made by the Archbishop of Canterbury anent adopting some aspects of Sharia law into English law, the media, both UK and Scottish, the Prime Minister and other London political figures have referred to &quot;British&quot; law, reflecting an appalling ignorance of the distinctiveness of Scots law both substantively and in its procedures; further notes that there is no such legal creature as British law as opposed to UK legislation and legal processes; affirms again the proud tradition of the independence of Scots Law, both civil and criminal, and considers that all parties concerned should apologise to the Scottish people for once again equating &quot;English&quot; with &quot;British&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1335</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Minority Government and the Budget Process</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the contents of <em>Choices for a Purpose: Review of Scottish Executive Budgets</em>, also known as the Howat report, published in 2007; notes that the review commented on the view that any coalition partnership agreement, regardless of the political parties involved, would be &quot;a mixed bag of commitments, ranging from very general, strategic statements to some very specific policy commitments&quot; and stated that this could be seen as &quot;an inevitable consequence of conflating two political manifestos&quot;; recognises that the dynamics of minority government were not explicitly covered by the Howat report; recognises that any minority government will need to engage in ongoing negotiations throughout its term to secure a majority for its spending plans; further notes that the Howat report suggested that &quot;the current arrangements need to be reviewed to allow the parties forming an administration to develop clearer statements of desired outcomes that can lead to better costed programmes for the new administration&quot;; considers that this analysis has further implications in a period of minority government and that new arrangements must be in place to take account of inter-party dynamics throughout a Parliamentary session rather than merely forming part of any post-election negotiation, and calls on the Scottish Government and all political parties in the Parliament to begin an open-minded discussion about changes that could be made to the budget process making it more appropriate for a Parliament composed of minority parties.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1333</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Wilson Doctrine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the public debate on surveillance which has been sparked by revelations of the bugging of Sadiq Khan MP; further notes the existence of the Wilson Doctrine which affords MPs some protection from surveillance while carrying out their duties; believes that there are inherent weaknesses in the doctrine and that its application has not been consistent; recognises that debate on these issues seems likely to lead to new rules defining the limits of surveillance in politics; believes that any such rules must include an absolute ban on the political use of information gained from surveillance activity and must also protect the right of members of the public to consult confidentially their elected representatives at all levels, in particular those who have responsibility for aspects of the justice system; further believes that the same restrictions should also apply to confidential access to legal advice, and calls on the Scottish Government to initiate discussions with the UK Government to ensure that the role of MSPs is recognised as equivalent to that of MPs for these purposes and respected in the rules governing the use of surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1332</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>No to Go Ape Development in Pollok Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament opposes the proposed Go Ape private adventure course proposals for Pollok Park in Glasgow; is concerned at the inevitable disruption which it considers will result from any such development to the beauty and tranquillity of this public resource which is used by both locals and visitors to the city; is aware that this parkland was gifted to the citizenry of Glasgow on the proviso that such developments should not be sanctioned, and is conscious of and supports the large and growing local opposition to this form of private development in Pollok Park on the basis that such costly private entertainment has no place in any public park in Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1331</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Anorexia and Bulimia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with unease that it is estimated that more than 80,000 people in Scotland suffer from anorexia, with 4,700 suffering from bulimia, and that the number of people diagnosed with eating disorders has increased by more than 15% since 1999, according to NHS Scotland; is aware that, despite guidelines issued by the health service watchdog in November 2006, Scotland still trails behind the rest of the western world in the treatment of eating disorders; is aware that the foremost expert on anorexia and bulimia in the United Kingdom, Bryan Lask, Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of London, has voiced concern that the system for treating those with eating disorders in Scotland is &quot;positively dangerous&quot;; regrets that there is still no specific advice for GPs, despite every practice having patients suffering from eating disorders, and that only two private clinics in Edinburgh and Glasgow provide specialist care at a cost of around &pound;3,000 per patient per week; asks the Scottish Government to examine why there is not one consultant specialising in eating disorders employed by the NHS in Scotland and to consider how best to tackle this problem which can prove fatal and is deeply distressing both for patients and their families, and understands the need for ongoing research into eating disorders and their treatment.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1330</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Proposed Go Ape High Wire Adventure Facility in Pollok Country Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament accepts the idea of a Go Ape high wire adventure facility in an appropriate location but, given that Pollok Country Park is environmentally, socially and culturally unique, is extremely concerned by Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s decision in February 2007 to grant a 21-year lease of sites in the North Wood, a natural unspoilt forest within the park, to Adventure Forest Ltd without consulting Pollok Country Park users or the local councillor at the time; questions the validity of the public consultation subsequently carried out by the council&rsquo;s Land and Environmental Services in the summer of 2007 in which local residents considered that they were denied their proper right to have a say on the proposal; believes with dismay that Glasgow City Council politicians and officials have shown a complete disregard for the overwhelming opposition to this proposal from the local community and residents across Greater Glasgow, and urges Glasgow City Council to reconsider these ill-thought-out plans by going back to the drawing board and conducting a fresh consultation which would allow a new site to be considered as more appropriate for Go Ape, thus ensuring that the people of Greater Glasgow and the many visitors from elsewhere across the country can continue to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the North Wood of Pollok Country Park, one of the greatest gifts given to the people of Glasgow, the west of Scotland and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1329</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Rights of Children of Prisoners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of <em>Not Seen. Not Heard. Not Guilty: The Rights and Status of the Children of Prisoners in Scotland</em> by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland; notes that the report finds that an estimated 13,500 children in Scotland are affected at any one time by the imprisonment of a parent and that when sentencing options are being considered the impact on the child is rarely taken into account; believes that the rights of children must be taken into account when sentencing and offender policy is considered, and welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s moves to reduce the number of custodial sentences for minor offences, especially where mothers with children are concerned.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1328</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Bring Berwick Back</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the referendum campaign in Berwick-upon-Tweed, 990 years after the town was ceded to Scotland following the Battle of Carham, to gauge support for the town being returned to the fold of Scottish nationhood; notes that Berwickers are once again considering the benefits of being part of Scotland; recognises the strong levels of support in the town for such a move, which sees the benefits that Scotland has derived from slowly removing the barriers to progress and prosperity by becoming increasingly independent of London control; agrees that we would warmly welcome Berwick-upon-Tweed back into the nation of Scotland as we move to regaining our full independence, and urges Scottish ministers to begin negotiations with HM Government to secure Berwick-upon-Tweed&rsquo;s restoration as part of the nation of Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1327</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Scottish Science Funding Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the funding crisis at&nbsp;the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), the effects of which, as well as reductions in new physics grants for Scotland&rsquo;s universities, will see reductions in funding for the United Kingdom Astronomy Technology Centre (UKATC) by 50% over the next three years; recognises that this funding has been vital to the continued existence of these organisations which have been responsible for many world-leading instruments for the world&rsquo;s astronomers, have pioneered the successful Dark Sky Scotland scheme and have provided support to hundreds of science teachers to encourage young people in Scotland into science; deplores the actions of the STFC in disproportionately reducing the funding in Scotland, and calls on MPs at Westminster to reassess the funding for science in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1323</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Increasing Access to Insulin Pumps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the considerable benefits that insulin pumps have for diabetics to help them to manage their condition; notes with concern the current restrictive criteria for eligibility for use of insulin pumps which have contributed to insulin pump usage in Scotland being among the lowest in Western Europe, with only around 0.75% of people with Type 1 diabetes using pumps in Scotland compared with 15 to 20% in the United States of America and Germany; is concerned at the extreme regional disparity in uptake of insulin pumps across NHS boards, with only two patients receiving insulin pump therapy in NHS Ayrshire and Arran compared with 42 in NHS Tayside in the most recent figures, despite all NHS boards having received funding for access to insulin pumps; supports the campaign of Diabetes UK to increase access to insulin pumps and welcomes the review being undertaken currently by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the eligibility for use of pumps in the NHS, and calls for immediate action to be taken by the Scottish Government to ensure that new NICE guidance that seeks to relax access criteria is adopted swiftly in Scotland, to support all NHS boards to increase access to insulin pumps for patients with diabetes and to enable more training for health practitioners to support patients in moving to the use of pumps where it is clearly of benefit in the management of their diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1297#</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Upper Forth Crossing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the progress being made in constructing the Upper Forth crossing; looks forward to its planned opening in 2008; recognises that when both crossings are operational this will greatly improve the road infrastructure and cut journey times around Kincardine; is concerned that increasingly the Forth Road Bridge is closed to high-sided vehicles, placing a burden on the A985, A907 and A997; accepts that the existing Kincardine crossing is planned to close for a maintenance period following the opening of the Upper Forth crossing; is concerned that Kincardine will suffer severe traffic congestion as vehicles are diverted through and around the village to the new crossing, and is further concerned that the villages situated on the A907, such as Oakley, Blairhall, Carnock, Saline and Gowkhall will also be subjected to unprecedented levels of traffic congestion.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1289</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>I Love My Smoke-Free Childhood</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the International Union Against Cancer&rsquo;s campaign, launched on World Cancer Day, 4 February 2008, to highlight the chronic health risks to children of passive smoking; notes that the year-long &quot;I love my smoke-free childhood&quot; campaign will also encourage mothers not to smoke while pregnant and warn their children of the dangers of passive smoking; is aware that passive smoking increases the risk of cot death, low birth weight in babies and childhood illness; is concerned that globally an estimated 700 million children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke, and therefore supports the efforts of the International Union Against Cancer, the World Health Organisation and all those involved in highlighting this issue, educating parents and ultimately reducing children&rsquo;s exposure to tobacco smoke.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1288</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Why Do We Feel So Broke?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the report, <em>Why Do We Feel So Broke?</em>, published on 4 February 2008, which shows that average UK disposable family income, after tax and housing costs, having declined from &pound;16,544 in 2003 to &pound;16,305 in 2006, plummeted to &pound;15,231 in 2007; believes that this Gordon Brown-inspired squeeze is likely to worsen in coming months and years, placing ever-increasing burdens on already hard-pressed families; realises that the inability of the UK Government to prevent living standards from falling belies the myth of Labour&rsquo;s economic competence; considers that such ineptitude at a time of strong growth in the world economy over recent years raises obvious worries about the impact of a global slowdown; acknowledges that both the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research are of the view that substantial tax rises may be necessary for the UK Government to balance the books; regrets the fact that the Scottish Government does not have the fiscal powers to mitigate the impact of Scotland being thirled to the United Kingdom and therefore welcomes the small measures that it can take to ease the burden on taxpayers by, for example, encouraging local authorities to freeze the council tax, and agrees that Scotland could best serve the economic interests of our people if it were an independent nation with all the fiscal powers that would entail.</p>
