            competitiveness of Scotland's economy, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to restore as a matter of urgency a business rate poundage 
            uniform with the rest of the UK as part of a sustained effort to reduce 
            burdens of tax and regulation, which are hindering the creation of 
            jobs and prosperity in Scotland, and demonstrate to the business community 
            a commitment to restoring growth and competitiveness to the Scottish

            under its aegis or preferably as a distinct part of a full UK inquiry, 
            into the impact of, preparations for and handling of the foot-and-mouth

              to end and insert &quot;, recognising the need for independent scrutiny 
              of the handling of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, supports 
              the participation of the Scottish Executive in the Royal Society 
              Inquiry, the Anderson &quot;Lessons Learnt&quot; Inquiry and the 
              Royal Society of Edinburgh Inquiry and believes that these inquiries

              the policy adopted in Scotland to eradicate the foot-and-mouth disease 
              epidemic, but believes that it is essential that all lessons are 
              learned by means of a full, open and independently convened public 
              inquiry in Scotland and that it is important to monitor closely 
              the impact of the crisis upon the whole Scottish economy and, in 
              particular, upon those regions of Scotland most affected by the

          <p><strong>S1M-2404</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Strategic 
            Planning in Fife</strong>-That the Parliament notes the strong opposition 
            from Fife Council, residents and community councils in Fife to the 
            proposals contained in the Scottish Executive's consultation document 
            Review of Strategic Planning which would split Fife for strategic 
            planning purposes between the cities of Dundee and Edinburgh; further 
            notes that Fife Council is the only local authority area proposed 
            to be split for strategic planning purposes; recognises that Fife 
            Council shares boundaries with other major public sector agencies 
            such as Scottish Enterprise Fife, NHS Fife and Fife Tourist board 
            which, together with its unique geography, make Fife ideally suited 
            for strategic planing as a single unit, and therefore considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should review its proposals in the light of 
            the consultation and retain Fife as a single strategic planning area.
