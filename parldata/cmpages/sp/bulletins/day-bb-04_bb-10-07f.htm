          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1835</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Karen Whitefield be appointed to replace Johann Lamont on the Communities Committee.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1834</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Bill Butler be appointed to replace Karen Whitefield on the Justice 2 Committee.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1833</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Mrs Mary Mulligan be appointed to replace Bill Butler on the Justice 1 Committee.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1832#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Supporting People Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that 19 local authorities will receive standstill or reduced funding from the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Supporting People initiative, including Dumfries and Galloway Council which will lose &pound;2.4m from its budget in the next financial year; considers that this will lead to a reduction in support services to some of the most vulnerable people in these local authority areas, and believes that the Executive should consider increasing the funding available to this initiative to maintain at least the current level of support to those local authorities that stand to lose funds from April 2005.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1831.1</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s International Image</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1831) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from &quot;shares&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Executive should aspire to build relationships across national and regional boundaries to deliver social, economic and environmentally sustainable development; notes that the First Minister&rsquo;s forthcoming visit to China and next year&rsquo;s hosting of the G8 summit offer ideal platforms for Scotland to improve its international image by showing leadership on issues of justice and sustainable development; further notes that these events offer the opportunity to take forward the First Minister&rsquo;s statements at the World Summit on Sustainable Development that &quot;We cannot continue to plunder the world&rsquo;s resources without giving something back and wealthy countries must help poorer nations to plan for their future too&quot; and that &quot;some will feel that the only contribution the developed world can make to this summit is to hang our heads in shame&quot;, and calls on the Executive urgently to address Scotland&rsquo;s lack of consistent action on sustainable development since the world summit in 2002.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1831.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s International Image</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1831) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from &quot;shares&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Executive has so far failed to fully exploit the enormous international goodwill that exists towards Scotland; calls on the Executive to use the Parliament&rsquo;s limited powers to implement a far more ambitious, strategic and consistent external relations policy and for such a policy to include the establishment of a distinctive presence overseas to promote Scotland, given that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government will always be unable and unwilling to promote Scotland with the same degree of enthusiasm and effectiveness that we ourselves could do, and further believes that Scotland will only reap the full benefits of our distinctive international image and be able to play our full part in the world when we acquire the powers of independent statehood enjoyed by our many, internationally-successful neighbours.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1831.3</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s International Image</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1831) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from second &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that Scotland&rsquo;s historic reputation abroad was built on solid achievement, and believes that the successful promotion of Scotland depends primarily on substance rather than image.&quot;</p>
