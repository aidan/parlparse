            of Education and Skills on 8 January 2004 will have an adverse effect

                its belated adoption of longstanding SNP policies on the principle 
                of class size reduction, tackling the bureaucratic problems associated 
                with national tests and the damaging impact of the national publication 
                of school league tables; looks forward to the Parliament's involvement 
                in the review and reform of the curriculum, in the opportunities 
                available around the transition period of pupils into primary, 
                secondary and post-14 education and in additional support for 
                learning, and calls on the Executive to ensure that resources, 
                in particular sufficient properly trained and qualified teachers, 
                are in place to meet these demands.&quot; </P>
              <p> <strong>S2M-806.2</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: 
                Comprehensive Programme of Education Reforms</strong>-As an amendment 
                to motion (S2M-806) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from 
                first &quot;and&quot; to end and insert &quot;for school education, 
                but believes that the Scottish Executive's reform programme for 
                school education is insufficient to deal with the inherent problems 
                thrown up by Scotland's comprehensive system and that the Scottish 
                educational system needs radical reform, and would therefore support 
                any visit by the Minister for Education and Young People to New 
                Zealand in order that he can be inspired by New Zealand's devolved 
                and diverse system, where, for the last 16 years under Labour 
                and Conservative governments, schools have been managed by local 
                school boards and parents have chosen the schools that their children 
                attend, similar to the schools passport policy advocated by Scottish 
                Conservatives.&quot; </P>

          <p><strong>S2M-792</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Recognition 
            of Kinship Care</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that many 
            grandparents have become the new foster care parents of children whose 
            mothers and fathers have become disconnected from mainstream society; 
            acknowledges that such care arrangements are usually more stable and 
            result in a positive impact on the young person, as a consequence 
            of grandparents' strong sense of commitment to provide care; further 
            acknowledges that current legislation enables local authorities to 
            contribute to the maintenance of a young person in kinship care; recognises 
            that not all kinship carers will wish to undergo formal scrutiny, 
            but shares concerns about the financial consequences experienced by 
            kinship carers who have satisfied the relevant scrutiny requirements 
            to provide this care, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            ensure that local authorities make the appropriate contribution to 
            these carers. </P>
