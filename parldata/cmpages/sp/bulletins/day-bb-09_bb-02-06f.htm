<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3396</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>The Importance of Robert Burns to Irvine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the strong connection between Irvine and Robert Burns; agrees that the continued strengthening of these ties is vital to the local area in the coming years; recognises Homecoming Scotland 2009 as a way of highlighting Ayrshire to the wider global community; congratulates the Irvine Burns Club for having the highest number of consecutive Burns suppers in the world; acknowledges the wide-ranging membership of the club, including all former First Ministers, and applauds the issue of an invitation by the club to the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama; notes the commitment of the club to making the works of Robert Burns appeal today; welcomes the fact that this year saw the celebrated local writer and presenter of the BBC Four documentary, Robert Burns: The People&rsquo;s Poet, Andrew O&rsquo;Hagan, attend the supper as well as Welsh singer Cerys Matthews, and therefore applauds the members of Irvine Burns Club for another successful year and hopes that through their various endeavours a permanent legacy can be put in place that will assist the club to continue its traditions into the next century.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3395</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Report of Services to Protect Children and Young People in Inverclyde</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) report on services to protect children and young people in the Inverclyde Council area; notes that the report indicates that there is joint working within and across services, including the voluntary sector, and involvement of children and families in reviewing and developing services; further notes that, of the 18 quality indicators, the Inverclyde Council area achieved 15 very good, two excellent and one good evaluation, and acknowledges the hard work and dedication of all the staff who have helped achieve such a positive report.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3394</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Renfrewshire Officially a Fairtrade Zone</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Renfrewshire on officially becoming a Fairtrade Zone; notes that it achieved Fairtrade Zone status in just over one year of campaigning, and further congratulates Renfrewshire on winning the Fairtrade Foundation&rsquo;s Outstanding Achievement Award at the 2008 Fairtrade Fortnight Awards during its campaign.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3393</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Support for People with Coal Miners&rsquo; Knee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the UK Government to provide support for those unable to work due to contracting osteoarthritis in the knee, also known as coal miners&rsquo; knee, while working in mines; notes that mining provided a livelihood for many in Scotland who have previously supported Labour, and considers that the UK Labour Party is failing to support those with coal miners&rsquo; knee in their time of need.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3392</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Aviation and Scotland&rsquo;s Climate Change Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the recent report from the World Development Movement, which found that airport expansion in Scotland could create 20,000 climate refugees worldwide by 2050 due to the damage caused by increased climate change emissions; welcomes the plea from some 21,000 people that Scotland&rsquo;s share of international aviation emissions should be counted in a Climate Change (Scotland) Bill from the start; notes that campaigners will bring this message to the Parliament on Thursday 5 February 2009 in order to highlight the case for the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill to explicitly commit to action on international aviation emissions from the outset; further notes the views of those campaigners that MSPs must not allow the second National Planning Framework for Scotland to support aviation expansion without full and proper public and environmental scrutiny, and believes that aviation expansion remains economically unjustified, especially given that the majority of businesses in the United Kingdom plan to reduce their flying in the next 10 years.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3391</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Public Supports Pollution-linked Parking Charges in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that a scheme proposed by Green councillors in Edinburgh to link parking permit charges to car pollution has won overwhelming, three to one, public support after a three-month consultation; also notes that the initiative is designed to encourage the use of more climate-friendly vehicles and discourage gas guzzlers by creating a sliding scale of permit charges according to vehicle carbon dioxide emission ratings in place of the current fixed charge; further notes that the City of Edinburgh Council will not raise any extra revenue from the proposed scheme; notes that, under the proposal, charges for 80% of vehicles will be reduced or remain the same, including family-sized vehicles, with only the most polluting, or luxury, vehicles in band G paying more; considers that the result of the consultation sends an important message that public appetite for action on climate change needs a response from politicians to achieve cuts in carbon emissions, and hopes that the groundbreaking initiative is introduced in Edinburgh and other areas of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3351</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive Opt-out</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the vote by the European Parliament on 17 December 2008 in favour of removing Britain&rsquo;s working time directive opt-out; also notes with serious concern the effect that the removal of the opt-out will have on retained firefighters across Scotland and the consequences that it may have for public health and safety; further notes that of 391 fire stations across Scotland 321 are staffed by 3,429 retained firefighters; notes the valuable service that these volunteer firefighters provide to their communities and that the Retained Firefighters Union opposes the removal of the opt-out; considers that, if the opt-out is removed and Retained Duty System (RDS) fire stations are proven unviable under the working time directive, 91% of the United Kingdom will lose valuable emergency fire cover, and notes the serious and potentially fatal consequences that the removal will have on communities across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3351.1</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive Opt-out</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3351) in the name of Liam McArthur, insert at end &quot;notes with surprise that the sole Scottish Liberal Democrat Member of the European Parliament voted to end the UK opt-out as opposed to the SNP, Conservative and, indeed, English Liberal Democrat MEPs who voted to support the Scottish and UK governments&rsquo; shared position for retention of an opt-out; nonetheless welcomes the change of heart on the part of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, which may help to clarify their position to the retained firefighters of Scotland; commends the mature and responsible joint efforts by the Scottish and UK governments to resolve this potentially confused legal situation in a calm and rational manner as opposed to resorting to scaremongering with hypothetical situations; looks forward to a sensible resolution of this dispute, and considers that the actions of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have confused the issue and have been ultimately unhelpful.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3311*#*</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Support for Computer Games Development</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the comments of Colin Macdonald, Studio Manager for Dundee-based computer games developer Realtime Worlds, who recently expressed concern for the future of the industry; recognises that despite the current economic situation the computer games industry is continuing to grow, however that in terms of games development the United Kingdom is falling behind; notes that UK firms must pay tax on research and development, while in countries such as Canada and France rebates are given; further notes the importance to the economy of Dundee and Scotland of computer games developers who have produced award winning titles such as Crackdown, which recently sold over 1.5 million units, and believes that games development in Scotland will suffer under the current tax regime.</p>
