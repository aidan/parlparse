          <p><strong>*S2M-1504</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Bear 
            Necessities</strong>-That the Parliament condemns BEAR Scotland for 
            failing to maintain the central reservations and verges of Aberdeen's 
            trunk roads to an acceptable standard; commends Aberdeen City Council 
            officials and elected members for endeavouring to resolve this intolerable 
            situation, and furthermore calls on the Scottish Executive to review 
            the current contract with BEAR Scotland to ensure that these landscape 
            maintenance works are carried out to a satisfactory standard.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1503</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> 
            <strong>GM Oilseed Rape GT73</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the vote at the EU Regulatory Committee on the release of GM organisms 
            into the environment held on Wednesday 16 June 2004 which blocked 
            approval of the application to import Monsanto's GM oilseed rape (GT73) 
            into Europe; notes that there were 57 votes against approval, 43 votes 
            for and 24 abstentions; recognises that this was the first occasion 
            since expansion in which the enlarged European Union's approach to 
            GM crops has been tested; registers its serious concern that a confidential 
            Monsanto feeding study on rats showed that those fed the GM oilseed 
            rape had a 15 per cent increase in liver weights; further notes that 
            the European Commission must now formally adopt a proposal to be sent 
            to the Council of Ministers, and expresses the hope that the view 
            expressed by the regulatory committee will be upheld.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1502</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Ayrshire 
            Cattle Society</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            proposed relocation of the Ayrshire Cattle Society to England; acknowledges 
            that currently only one-third of its membership is located in Scotland 
            and also notes that technological advances in communications enable 
            the headquarters to be situated anywhere; further notes, however, 
            that, given the huge agricultural benefits and goodwill that the society 
            generates, the relocation of the society out of Scotland would be 
            an irreparable loss to Ayrshire and the entire Scottish farming community, 
            and urges the society to reconsider its relocation proposals.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1501</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Environmental 
            Hazards to Children</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the World Health Organization's report that one-third of all deaths 
            of children and adolescents in the European region are attributed 
            to environmental factors; notes that 100,000 deaths and 6 million 
            years of healthy lives are lost each year of children and adolescents 
            from birth to 19 years in 52 countries in the European region; further 
            notes the forthcoming Fourth Ministerial Conference on Environment 
            and Health on 23 to 25 June 2004, and urges the Scottish Executive 
            to attend this conference and report back to the Parliament as a matter 
            of urgency to decide what action can be taken to address this problem.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1500</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>ENABLE's 
            50th Anniversary</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 21 June 2004 
            marks the beginning of Learning Disability Week; recognises the work 
            of all organisations that are marking this week by promoting the rights 
            of children and adults with learning disabilities across the United 
            Kingdom and, in particular, warmly congratulates ENABLE, Scotland's 
            leading charity for children and adults with learning disabilities, 
            in this, its 50th anniversary year; notes that this once small, self-help 
            organisation has grown into a major force advancing the cause of children 
            and adults with learning disabilities in Scotland; acknowledges that, 
            whilst much work still needs to be done to ensure that children and 
            adults with learning disabilities achieve full social inclusion and 
            community participation, much has been achieved, and congratulates 
            ENABLE on its first 50 years and wishes it every success for the future.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1498</strong> <strong>Des McNulty on behalf of the Finance 
            Committee:</strong> <strong>5th Report (Session 2) of the Finance 
            Committee, Stage 1 of the 2005-06 Budget Process</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes the 5th Report, 2004 (Session 2) of the Finance Committee, 
            <em>Stage 1 of the 2005-06 Budget Process </em>(SP Paper 182) and 
            refers the recommendations to the Scottish Executive for consideration.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1497</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Football Museum</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            complaint lodged with the office of the Scottish Charities Regulator 
            by Mr Ged O'Brien, former Director of the Scottish Football Museum; 
            considers the allegations regarding the relationships between the 
            Scottish Football Association, Hampden Park Ltd and the Scottish Football 
            Museum to be very serious indeed, and believes that they must be fully 
            investigated to ensure that the museum has been administered with 
            the degree of probity that the Parliament expects, given the extensive 
            use of public money in the venture.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Dennis Canavan</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1496</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for the Minn Family</strong>-That the Parliament supports the aims 
            of Shetland Against Deportation, which is campaigning to ensure that 
            the Burmese family of Hazel Minn and her two children are not deported 
            by order of the Home Office from her home in Shetland to where she 
            would be in severe danger and in opposition to the wishes of around 
            6,000 Shetlanders who have signed a petition in support of the Minn 
            family.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1495</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Governance (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that 
            the Local Governance (Scotland) Bill be passed.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1495.1</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Governance (Scotland) Bill</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1495) 
            in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, insert at end &quot;but, in so doing, 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should bring forward legislation, 
            as a matter of urgency, to decouple elections to Scottish local authorities 
            from the elections to the Parliament.&quot;</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Andrew Welsh, Mr Bruce McFee</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1494</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Taste 
            of Grampian - 12 June 2004</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            success of the annual Taste of Grampian event which took place on 
            12 June 2004 at Thainstone in Aberdeenshire; further notes the importance 
            of this event to promoting food from all sectors of the industry to 
            the general public; believes that the food industry in the north east 
            of Scotland is vital to many rural economies and that such an event 
            helps to showcase Grampian's, and Scotland's, reputation as a world 
            class food producer, and congratulates the organisers on a highly 
            successful event and wishes them every success with next year's Taste 
            of Grampian event.</P>

            (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the Tenements 
            (Scotland) Bill be passed.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson, Mrs Mary Mulligan</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1492</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Possible 
            Closure of the Adventure Centre, Ratho</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that the Adventure Centre at Ratho Quarry, near Edinburgh, 
            which is the biggest indoor rock-climbing centre in the world and 
            offers a wide range of activities to schools, groups and individuals 
            at all levels of ability, is a vital element in promoting health, 
            activity, tourism and good safety practices in Scotland; is most concerned 
            at the possibility that the Bank of Scotland may force it to close 
            down, and urges the Bank of Scotland, taking account of its policies 
            of promoting good sporting, youth and community activities, to agree 
            arrangements proposed by supporters of the centre that will enable 
            it to continue to operate and build up its activities and, by greater 
            activity, better management and rescheduling, gradually repay its 
            debts.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Margaret Smith</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1490</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>The 
            Education Maintenance Allowances (Scotland) Regulations 2004</strong>-That 
            the Enterprise and Culture Committee recommends that nothing further 
            be done under the Education Maintenance Allowances (Scotland) Regulations 
            2004 (SSI 2004/273).</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1489</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Sir 
            Patrick Geddes</strong>-That the Parliament notes the increasing importance 
            of the work and philosophy of the Scottish polymath, Sir Patrick Geddes, 
            who was born in Ballater on 2 October 1854; recognises that Geddes 
            was a botanist, environmentalist, educator, planner, conservationist, 
            internationalist and patron of the arts; notes that he combined all 
            these aspects in his designs for reviving the High Street in Edinburgh, 
            for the Armenian community in Cyprus, for the University in Jerusalem, 
            for various cities in India and for the Scots College in Montpellier; 
            further notes that he foresaw the dangers of forest clearance as a 
            cause of drought, and welcomes the fact that the Ballater Geddes Project 
            2004 has adopted the quotation &quot;By Leaves We Live&quot; as its 
            motto for the exhibition they are planning from 7 August to 2 October 
            2004.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1488</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Liverpool's 
            Princess</strong>-That the Parliament calls on Her Majesty's Government 
            to intervene immediately to stop the removal and deportation of Jugder 
            and Shinee Narantsogt and their two children, Evsaana, aged 17, and 
            Misheel, aged eight; also fears for the safety of Jugder, who was 
            a provincial leader of the Mongolian Democratic Party and was arrested 
            and then forced into hiding by the ruling party in Mongolia; furthermore 
            calls on members of the Westminster Parliament to intervene on the 
            family's behalf in order to enable Aamer Anwar, the family's lawyer 
            in Scotland, to have access to their casework to ensure that they 
            have been properly and fully represented; regrets that little Misheel, 
            who was selected from hundreds of children in Liverpool to be crowned 
            Liverpool's Parade Princess on 10 July 2004, will now be unable to 
            attend the parade due to detention and removal arrangements, and finally 
            condemns the current system which treats people with such cold and 
            heartless brutality and demands the immediate closure of Dungavel 
            House, which stands on Scottish soil but lies outside the powers of 
            the Parliament, making it Scotland's very own Guantanamo Bay.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1487</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Internet 
            Dialler Fraud</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the public 
            harm caused by consumer fraud involving premium rate, satellite and 
            international number internet &quot;diallers&quot;, which close the 
            user's current internet connection to their regular service provider 
            and connect to an alternate service without their knowledge; notes 
            that calls to the telephone regulator, Ofcom, have nearly quadrupled 
            during the period 1999-2003, whilst calls to premium-rate regulator, 
            the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone 
            Information Services (ICSTIS) have risen by 500% since the discovery 
            of the internet problem; notes that ICSTIS estimates that the value 
            of premium-rated services in the United Kingdom to be worth over £1 
            billion per year; urges ICSTIS, telecommunication companies and the 
            Internet Service Providers Association to take effective steps to 
            identify the perpetrators and to warn the public of the problem, and 
            believes that Her Majesty's Government should introduce legislation 
            to protect consumers against such fraud, which is estimated to cost 
            consumers around £5 to £10 million a year on premium-rate internet 
            calls alone.</P>

            Championships held in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, on Saturday 12 June 
            2004 for arranging a spectacular day's entertainment involving in

            the Educational Institute of Scotland's (EIS) Annual General Meeting 
            on 12 June 2004 calling on the EIS National Council to enter into

          <p> <strong>S2M-1484#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            and Rationalisation of Maternity Services</strong>-That the Parliament 
            expresses its grave concern at the sustained attacks on maternity 
            services; believes that rationalisation of maternity services with 
            consultations held in isolation and without reference to cross-boundary 
            and pan-Scotland impact continue unabated; notes that claimed benefits 
            of centralisation in relation to morbidity and mortality are unproven; 
            is concerned that the risks associated with reduced access to consultant-led 
            services have not been assessed and no time has been allowed to assess 
            the impact of previous closures before further closures are embarked 
            upon; reiterates concern that there are no minimum standards for staffing 
            establishments of midwives across the service and that models for 
            calculating staff numbers and ratios are outdated and outmoded; notes 
            that expectations of staff by the public and demands of government 
            have increased dramatically over the years which has created more 
            work for all staff providing maternity services despite a declining

            a moratorium on maternity closures and conduct a full, systemic analysis 
            of the provision of maternity services across Scotland that involves 
            the public and all trade union and professional organisations with 
            the aim of establishing agreed minimum staffing establishments in 
            a safe, co-ordinated service that meets the needs of all women and 
            families across the whole of Scotland, maintains the expertise and 
            excellence already established in the provision of these services 
            and finds ways to deliver the right service for properly assessed

          <p><strong>S2M-1483#</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Real 
            Cost of Road Transport</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the 
            real cost of road transport includes the cost of climate change and 
            significant health problems attributable to noise and air pollution 
            and the ever-increasing costs of road maintenance;&nbsp;agrees, therefore, 
            that fuel tax must be progressively increased subject to three conditions: 
            firstly, that there must be overall tax reform that redistributes 
            wealth downwards to prevent unfair impacts on people with low incomes, 
            disabled people and people in remote communities, secondly, that there 
            must be significant investment in public transport alternatives to 
            the car and road freight so that people and businesses have more choice 
            in mode of transport and,&nbsp;thirdly, that there must be incentives 
            to encourage use of less polluting UK-grown biofuels, and believes 
            that such moves would make Scotland more sustainable, safer and less 
            polluted.</P>

            the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh described in their UK 
            Hepatitis C Consensus Statement of April 2004 as a &quot;public health 
            crisis&quot; which affects between 45,000 and 65,000 people in Scotland, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should acknowledge that,

            central, ring-fenced funding for both treatment and prevention.</P>

            three organisations will be joining efforts to create Alcohol Support

            a secure stream of funding to alcohol support groups such as Alcohol 
            Support would have for Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive

            the findings of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland's phase 2 peer review 
            of Highland Primary Care NHS Trust's schizophrenia care standards; 
            notes that, of 29 essential criteria, only three were fully met, and 
            of seven desirable criteria, only one was fully met; further notes 
            with particular concern the report's findings that the trust does 
            not record the number of people who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia 
            or for whom one is being considered and that there is not a standard 
            guideline for use consistently across the trust, detailing the procedure

            recognises that schizophrenia is a serious and common medical illness 
            and that many people who have the illness will continue to experience 
            symptoms of varying degrees for many years and will require help and 
            support from a number of different services, and calls on the Scottish

            in Scotland: A Survey Report,</em> produced by Capability Scotland 
            in conjunction with the Disability Rights Commission; deplores the 
            prevalence of hate crime across Scotland towards disabled people; 
            further notes the figures showing 47% of respondents reporting being 
            frightened or attacked because of their disability, that one in five 
            suffered an attack once a week, with women and under 44-year-olds

            38% change their usual routines and 25% are forced to move home; calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to work with the police to improve reporting

            and reverse population decline in the far north; believes, therefore,

            of urgency to extend protection to the entire Scottish side of the
