          <p> <strong>*S1M-3424#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Retailing of 
            Fireworks by RS McColl</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the decision of the head office of the retailer RS McColl 
            to issue a memo to all its outlets in Scotland asking them to display 
            window posters advertising half-price fireworks six weeks before 5 
            November; considers this action to be a flagrant breach of the voluntary 
            code of practice, which restricts advertising to within three weeks 
            of Guy Fawkes' night; considers that RS McColl should reconsider the 
            decision and set an example to other retailers by removing such window 
            posters from their retail outlets in recognition of the voluntary 
            code, and believes that this situation highlights the pressing need 
            for the law on retailing of fireworks to be tightened through the 
            introduction of a licensing system.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3423</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran: Race Equality</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the importance of tackling racism, prejudice 
            and inequality as integral to promoting an inclusive, confident and 
            prosperous Scotland that retains and attracts talent from different 
            cultures and backgrounds and welcomes the anti-racism and race equality 
            work being done by the Executive and other national and local bodies.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Nicol Stephen<strong>*</strong>, Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3422</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Impact on Transport 
            of the Comprehensive Spending Review</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            recognises that increased investment in transport infrastructure is 
            essential to providing the best business environment to generate growth 
            and investment in Scotland; regrets that since Labour came to power 
            in Scotland in 1997 there has been a failure to deliver any meaningful 
            infrastructure or public transport improvements; further regrets that 
            the Scottish Executive continues to prefer spin and wish-lists to 
            costed plans and timescales for delivery, and calls on the Executive 
            to provide full details, including the cost and timetable, for completion 
            of each commitment outlined in the recent Spending Review which included 
            the Scottish Passenger Rail Franchise, rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh 
            airports, public transport improvements across Central Scotland, A8 
            and A80 motorway upgrades, improvements to the existing trunk road 
            network and tackling the congestion problems in Aberdeen.</p>

            the Parliament notes the decision by the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) 
            to close the officers&#146; social club at HM Prison Polmont and considers 
            that SPS should withdraw this decision and honour its commitment to

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3418</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Business Sustainability

            of the Scottish Executive to arrest the decline of our rural industries; 
            notes that rural business start-ups remain at an unacceptably low 
            level; regrets and deplores the Executive&#146;s continued lack of 
            investment in rural transport and information technology infrastructure 
            and the over-regulation which has resulted in barriers to the regeneration 
            of the rural economy, and calls on the Executive to devolve decision-making 
            powers to a local level while reversing policies which are damaging 
            to rural communities in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3417#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Borders College</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the current financial difficulties

            further notes the Audit Scotland report, <em>Overview of Further Education 
            Colleges in Scotland 2000/2001</em>, and the subsequent report by 
            the Audit Committee, <em>Report on Overview of Further Education Colleges 
            in Scotland 1999-2000</em>, which both highlighted the severe revenue 
            and capital problems facing further education colleges; is particularly 
            aware of the special difficulties in the funding formulae which fail 
            to address the funding difficulties in rural areas, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should review the whole funding method 
            for further education colleges as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3416#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Licensing Scheme 
            for Fireworks</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">agrees 
            with the view of the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland 
            in calling for the tightening up of legislation relating to the sale 
            and use of fireworks; notes that the association specifically refers 
            to a need for sellers to be stringently vetted in order to ensure 
            that applicants for a certificate to sell fireworks are of good character 
            and should be required to show "need" before being granted a certificate; 
            believes that the best way of achieving this is through the introduction 
            of a licensing scheme for vendors of fireworks, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should, as part of the current review of licensing 
            powers under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, consider extending 
            licensing powers to include firework vendors.</a></p>
