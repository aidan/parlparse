          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2190</strong> <strong>Robert Brown on behalf of the Education Committee:</strong> <strong>Education Committee Report on Child Protection Issues</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 8th Report, 2004 (Session 2) of the Education Committee: <em>Report on the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Implementation of Recommendations of the &quot;It&rsquo;s Everyone&rsquo;s Job To Make Sure I&rsquo;m Alright&quot; Report </em>(SP Paper 201); notes the Executive&rsquo;s response to the report, and draws the attention of the Executive to the impact of disclosure requirements, particularly in light of the implementation of the provisions of the Protection of Children (Scotland) Act 2003.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2189</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>International Year of the Family Resolution and Doha Declaration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the UN General Assembly to agree, by consensus, Resolution 59/111, &quot;Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the International Year of the Family&quot;, which notes the outcome of the Doha process; notes that the Doha process includes the important Doha Declaration which had the support of over 149 countries from around the world; further notes that the Doha Declaration reaffirms the central importance of the institution of the family, as set out in Article 16(3) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), as &quot;the natural and fundamental group unit of society&quot;; calls on all nations to &quot;uphold, preserve and defend the institution of marriage&quot;; recognises that the declaration and accompanying resolution represent a significant victory for those seeking to strengthen and support the institution of the family in the international community; regrets that the European Union, Norway, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were unable to wholeheartedly welcome this declaration, in spite of the fact that it does no more than reiterate the commitments of foundation documents of the United Nations, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and calls on both the Scottish Executive and the UK Government to support the Doha Declaration wholeheartedly.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2188</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Are You Cold?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the West of Scotland Seniors Forum, Glasgow City Council and NHS Greater Glasgow for launching the &quot;Are You Cold?&quot; helpline in response to research by Energy Action Scotland and the University of Strathclyde which has shown poverty to be the main cause of premature death among Scotland&rsquo;s elderly; notes that too many vulnerable elderly people are still unaware of the free central heating and free insulation programmes, heating allowances and advisory services which are available to them; commends the helpline initiative for its clarity and simplicity in informing vulnerable older people about their entitlements, and urges the Scottish Executive to encourage the roll-out of similar, easy-to-understand and easy-to-access helplines across Scotland.</p>
