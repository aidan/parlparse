          <p><strong>*S3M-762</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Drake Music Project Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Drake Music Project Scotland on being awarded &pound;4,645 in-kind sponsorship and a &pound;4,645 SENASA award from Scotsys Ltd as part of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s New Arts Sponsorship Awards; recognises the excellent work that Drake Music Project Scotland does with adults and young people with disabilities; notes the project&rsquo;s 10th anniversary in 2007 and, as part of a new office move, its launch of a programme of taster sessions for clients at its new base, SPACE, in Craigmillar, Edinburgh; recognises the hard work and commitment that Arts and Business Scotland has undertaken in making this scheme a running success, and believes that this money is even more valuable in light of the growing concern across Edinburgh that the SNP/Liberal Democrat council will make significant cuts to the grants budget for voluntary groups across the city.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-761</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Police</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland (ACPOS)  has projected that 470 officers will retire during 2007-8; believes that it is important to develop a national strategy to attract experienced police officers from non-Scottish police forces to Scotland, and recognises that this is an ideal way to both increase overall police numbers and help bridge the forthcoming shortfall in experience due to the large number of officers who will retire over the coming years.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-760</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Was</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees with Kenny MacAskill MSP that Edinburgh should be fully recognised and funded for the cost of being a capital city; echoes Nicola Sturgeon MSP&rsquo;s remarks in 2004 that the additional &pound;600,000 given to Lothian and Borders Police was &quot;not enough to cover the cost of policing the Parliament and special events&quot;; supports the view held by John Swinney MSP that &quot;Hardly a week goes by without Edinburgh seeing a major event or high profile visit. From President Putin to members of the Royal Family, Lothian and Borders has to cope with Capital City duties&quot;, and believes that Edinburgh should be given the resources appropriate to its capital city status.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-759</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Ian Watt, Aberdeen Music School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ian Watt, a pupil of the Aberdeen Music School, for his great achievement in reaching the finals of the new BBC Classical Star competition and further congratulates the school for its sterling work in helping the young people of the area in developing their talents.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-758</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>State Visit of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deeply regrets the state visit accorded by the UK Government to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia; recognises that this absolute monarchy has little respect for democracy and refuses to allow any form of religious freedom; abhors the human rights record of the Saudi regime which, among other appalling abuses, allows the beheading and stoning of women accused of adultery; is concerned and confused by the statement made by the UK Foreign Office Minister, Kim Howells MP, when he said that the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia have shared values, and urges the Scottish Government to seek clarification from the UK Government on what these shared values are.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-757</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Harris Tweed Hebrides</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of the reopening of the mill at Shawbost on the Isle of Lewis by a new Scottish-owned company, Harris Tweed Hebrides; notes that this announcement has been greeted with relief and enthusiasm by residents on the island where concerns had been mounting about the future of the industry; further notes that this development will create a new opportunity for local people to invest in the new company and participate in a profit-sharing scheme, thereby helping to strengthen the company&rsquo;s roots in the community, and wishes Harris Tweed Hebrides every success for a bright and prosperous future.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-756</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Saudi Arabian Visit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its regret over the UK Government&rsquo;s feting of King Abdullah and the Saudi Arabian regime which discriminates against women, allegedly tortures prisoners, conducts public executions, amputates limbs as a punishment and bans freedom of expression, assembly and religion; believes that putting business issues above human rights, in light of the UK Government&rsquo;s halting of the Serious Fraud Office&rsquo;s inquiry into the Al Yamamah arms deal with BAE Systems and last month&rsquo;s agreement to sell the regime 72 Eurofighter Typhoon fighter planes from the United Kingdom at a cost of &pound;4.43 billion, sends out the dangerous message to the world that the UK Government will support and legitimise vicious dictatorships and blatantly disregard human rights violations if the money is right; notes that, in the time that King Abdullah has been red carpeted here in Britain, five public beheadings have taken place in Saudi Arabia, bringing the total for the first six months of this year to over 100 executions, and takes this opportunity to state that the values embodied by the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to overlook human rights violations in order to promote business in no way represent the views of the Scottish Parliament or the will of the people of Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-752#</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Recycling Waste Wood</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow Wood Recycling Project, a Drumchapel-based social enterprise finding new ways to recycle and reuse wood through collecting waste wood from offcuts to skirting boards and roofing; welcomes the support that this project has received from Glasgow School of Art students, who are incorporating the waste wood into their work, and Edrington&rsquo;s bottling plant in providing its old whisky barrels to be recycled into garden furniture amongst other things; believes that local initiatives such as these are of fundamental value in tackling the environmental problems facing local communities and Scotland as a whole, and hopes that as the Glasgow Wood Recycling Project grows more people will use and benefit from this service.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-751</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Arms Sales and Culpability</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that, where governments, banks and lending institutions have lent money to oppressive dictatorships for the purchase of weapons, the heads of these governments, banks and lending institutions and those of the industries that sold these arms, should be held criminally liable for the deaths, injuries and human rights violations connected with such weapons in those countries in the same way as the heads of the regimes involved.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-719.1</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Date for Removal of Forth Road Bridge Tolls</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-719) in the name of Helen Eadie, leave out from &quot;is mindful&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that the people of Dundee are suffering from increased congestion; welcomes the fact that a Bill which aims to abolish tolls on the Forth and Tay bridges is being brought before the Parliament after only six months of an SNP Government, and further notes the actions of the previous administration which in eight years failed to improve the social and economic lives of our people by removing tolls from the Forth and Tay bridges.&quot;</p>
