<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3887</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Inclusion and Support of Young People with Learning Disabilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the efforts of the Scottish Executive to enable the inclusion of young people with learning disabilities in mainstream education where it is appropriate to do so; believes that the transitions from school to further education and from further education to employment are still difficult; considers that the Executive needs to ensure a better focus at these times so that it can improve the opportunities and choices of young people with learning disabilities, and notes that continuing efforts need to be made to further ensure inclusion within the community.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3886</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Encouraging Sport for Young People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that it is essential for the Scottish Executive to provide opportunities for children to become more active and lead healthier lives; recognises that considerable effort has gone into ensuring a level of physical activity in schools; notes, however, that improvements can still be made, particularly in primary schools, and urges the Executive to develop sporting opportunities in local communities in partnership with sports organisations, such as football clubs, in order to maximise the provision of community facilities and share the wealth of experience available in local areas.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3885#</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe:</strong> <strong>Ellon Moves Towards Fairtrade Town Status</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Ellon Fairtrade Town steering group on the progress it is making towards meeting the criteria, assessed by the Fairtrade Foundation, which will allow Ellon to achieve Fairtrade Town status; notes that the criteria include generating popular support and media attention, securing the support of the local council and having fairly traded goods available in local shops and being used in local food outlets and workplaces; commends those already participating and contributing, and looks forward to a successful conclusion which will recognise a community working well together but, more importantly, being aware of and helping many other communities across the world who benefit from being able to sell their goods in a fair marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3884</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Marine Renewables - Power and Opportunity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Carbon Trust on the publication of <em>Future Marine Energy</em>, a report on the potential for wave and tidal power in the United Kingdom; welcomes the conclusions of the report that these emerging renewable energy technologies have the potential to become cost-competitive and could meet up to 20% of current UK electricity demand; notes with interest that this is a similar proportion to that currently supplied by nuclear power; strongly supports the development of offshore renewable technologies and believes that these, combined with energy efficiency measures, will play an important part in Scotland&rsquo;s and the UK&rsquo;s energy future, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use its existing powers to support the development of Scotland&rsquo;s marine renewable industry, enabling this country to fulfil its potential to lead the world in wave and tidal power.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3883</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>Creative Scotland in Renfrewshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent announcement by the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport on the planned merger of the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen to form Creative Scotland; calls on the Minister to consider situating this body outside Edinburgh, as was suggested in <em>The Herald</em> on 21 January 2006; notes that this practice has already happened with the location of the National Theatre of Scotland in Easterhouse rather than Edinburgh; further calls on the Minister to consider locations in the West of Scotland region, which has contributed to Scotland&rsquo;s cultural life, and notes the particular cultural history of Renfrewshire, which has produced many excellent participants in Scottish cultural society, including Robert Tannahill, Fulton Mackay, John Byrne, Gerry Rafferty, Carol Laula, Tom Conti, Christopher Brookmyre, Carol Smillie, Alexander Stoddart, and most recently, David Tennant.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3882#</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Banffshire Partnership and Buchan Dial-a-Community Bus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Banffshire Partnership and the Buchan Dial-a-Community Bus, who provide an essential transport service in areas with virtually no public transport; notes that transport problems faced by many people in rural communities lead to many forms of exclusion; further notes that at present the national concessionary travel scheme does not encompass transport outwith conventional services, and hopes that the formation of Transport Scotland will enable new ideas to be implemented to tackle the problem of rural transport.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3881</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>No Cover Up On CIA Rendition Flights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Swiss Senator, Dick Marty&rsquo;s, interim report on his continuing investigation into alleged secret detention centres and the use of airports and airspace within Council of Europe member states to assist the US Government&rsquo;s policy of extraordinary rendition; notes the Italian judicial investigation into an illegal abduction in the streets of Milan and the subsequent issuing of arrest warrants for 22 American agents as part of the judicial proceedings; notes that, despite Senator Marty&rsquo;s Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights having written to member states asking for information concerning the use of their airports for CIA flights, the biggest problem for the committee has been the lack of information provided so far and the lack of co-operation from those governments; calls on member states to provide the information by the stated deadline of 21 February 2006; further notes that the Polish Government ordered an inquiry into the alleged existence of CIA detention centres in Poland, but that the findings have not been published nor provided to the committee; suggests that the real question that Senator Marty&rsquo;s report raises is what information is being hidden and by whom; believes that, if such flights were using airports in Scotland and across Europe for trafficking illegal immigrants, Colombian drugs barons or parcels of cocaine, governments would not be experiencing the same problems in obtaining information, and calls on all governments across Europe to co-operate with Senator Marty and his investigation.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3880</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Food Production for Communities not for Profit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuing stress endured by many in the dairy and wider farming community; further notes that this stress is a direct result of the current free market economic policy in world food production, which is based on profit rather than on promoting locally grown food, and calls on the Scottish Executive to promote Scottish farming in an environmentally, economically and socially just manner under the control of the workers, based on the needs of Scotland&rsquo;s communities rather than the profits of big business.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3879</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Olympic Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the call by the Danish Minister for Culture, Brian Mikkelsen, for Denmark&rsquo;s devolved territories to have their own Olympic teams; notes his comments that &quot;it won&rsquo;t be easy, but it has been possible for other home rule territories to become independent members of the IOC&quot;; contrasts his actions with those of ministers in Whitehall and in Edinburgh, and calls on the Scottish Executive to back the forming of a Scottish Olympic team in time for the 2012 Olympics in London.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3878</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Save the UK Theme and Keep the British in BBC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that in 1973 the BBC began to mark the handover from the World Service to Radio 4 at 5.30 am with a fantasia of British folk tunes called UK Theme which combines Early One Morning, Londonderry Air, Annie Laurie, What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor?, Greensleeves, Men of Harlech, Scotland the Brave, Trumpet Voluntary and Rule Britannia; notes that it was composed by Fritz Spiegl, an Austrian refugee, who, escaping Nazi oppression, arrived in Britain in 1939 aged 15 and, although unable to speak English or play a musical instrument, went on to become a successful musician and composer; further notes that BBC Radio 4 controller, Mark Damazer, has decided that from April the tune should be dropped in favour of an additional &quot;pacy&quot; news bulletin before the full news programme that commences at 6.00 am; regrets this decision and considers it to be a further step by the BBC to remove visual and aural icons of Britain from the British Broadcasting Corporation; supports the retention of the UK Theme as marking the beginning of Radio 4 broadcasts, and believes that the BBC should reverse the decision and remember that it is a British institution funded by British licence payers.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3876&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Alzheimer&rsquo;s Treatment in *Scotland*</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the most recent guidance issued by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), which recommends the use of the drugs donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine for use in the treatment of people with moderate Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in England and Wales; whilst welcoming this decision, regrets that no similar commitment has been made in respect of the availability of such drugs for people diagnosed with mild Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; is disappointed that memantine has not been recommended for use at all, despite clinical evidence to suggest that it can benefit patients who have reached the severe stages of the disease; recognises the benefits of continued therapeutic and specialist nursing care in assisting Alzheimer&rsquo;s sufferers to manage their condition; agrees that initiatives such as that implemented recently by NHS Ayrshire and Arran, whereby at least two nurses on all acute wards are trained specifically to manage patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, are an effective means of aiding sufferers and their families; but believes, nonethelesss, that donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine should be available to sufferers of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in Scotland; is aware that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) will now take the final decision on whether to allow these drugs to be prescribed in Scotland and therefore urges QIS to go further than the NICE recommendations and recognise the role and experience of clinicians and GPs in assessing the needs of the estimated 62,000 people in Scotland who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and calls for a degree of flexibility and discretion to be available to such practitioners in the prescribing of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine, dependent on their evaluation of individual cases.</p>
