          <p><strong>*S1M-3679#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Private Rented 
            Housing Sector</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            lack of regulation of the private rented housing sector, despite the 
            capacity of that sector to receive public funding through housing 
            benefit; further notes the stark contrast between the obligations 
            placed on landlords in the social rented sector and landlords in the 
            private rented sector; believes that private sector landlords who 
            are in receipt of public funding should be expected to meet minimum 
            standards and procedures in the way that their properties are managed, 
            in order to protect the rights of private sector tenants and their 
            neighbours and to ensure probity in the distribution of public funds, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should address these serious 
            matters as a matter of priority.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3678</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: The Future of 
            Europe Convention - The Scottish Dimension</strong>-That the Parliament 
            acknowledges the many benefits that the European Union has delivered 
            for Europe and for Scotland, welcomes the establishment of the Convention 
            on the Future of Europe as an open and innovative means of addressing 
            the issues now facing the European Union; believes that, in light 
            of experience, the European Union needs to become more effective, 
            efficient, easier to understand, democratic, transparent and accountable; 
            recognises the role that Sub-Member State Administrations can play 
            in realising these objectives; welcomes the Scottish Executive's engagement 
            with Scottish civil society to stimulate discussion and to seek views 
            on the Future of Europe; welcomes the contribution that the Executive 
            has made to the debate so far, and calls on the Executive to press 
            the Convention to bring forward proposals for strengthening the profile 
            of the Subsidiarity Principle in the EU treaties, adopting a new mechanism 
            for enforcing it which allows for full Sub-Member State Administration 
            involvement, making greater use of framework legislation, consulting 
            Sub-Member State Administrations at an early stage of policy development, 
            generating greater transparency in European decision-making and introducing 
            financial impact assessments for legislative proposals.</p>

          <p><strong>*S1M-3674</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Raffan: Cairngorms National 
            Park</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the successful establishment 
            of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park; looks forward 
            to the establishment of Scotland's second national park in the Cairngorms; 
            notes that highland Perthshire is a vital part of the coherent natural 
            and cultural identity of the Cairngorms, and believes that the park 
            boundary should include this area, as recommended by Scottish Natural 
            Heritage and supported by the overwhelming majority of respondents 
            to the Scottish Executive's consultation on the draft designation 
            order and by the Rural Development Committee unanimously.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3673</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Majority Decision 
            of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the <em>Appeal of 
            R</em> v <em>(1) Her Majesty's Advocate and (2) The Advocate General 
            for Scotland</em></strong>-That the Parliament expresses its grave 
            concern about the implications for the criminal justice system of 
            the majority decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council 
            in the appeal of<em> R </em>v<em> (1) Her Majesty's Advocate and (2) 
            The Advocate General for Scotland</em>, delivered on 28 November 2002; 
            notes that the appeal arose from an indictment served for trial at 
            the sitting of the High Court at Edinburgh on 2 October 2001 and included 
            charges of indecent behaviour against four young girls including acts 
            on dates when two of the girls were about three years old; notes that, 
            notwithstanding delay in bringing those charges to trial, no submission 
            was made that "R" would not get a fair trial nor was it held that 
            a fair trial was other than still possible; notes the construction 
            placed by the majority of the judges on the application of section 
            57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998; believes that the human rights obligation 
            to bring accused persons to trial within a reasonable time might be 
            vindicated by remedies other than dismissal of serious charges without 
            inquiry by a jury; asserts that the right to be brought to trial is 
            comprised in a right to be brought to trial without undue delay and 
            not a right to escape trial because of undue delay and that the moral 
            authority of human rights in the eyes of the public must not be undermined 
            by allowing them to distort existing and sensible protections of our 
            criminal justice system, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
            recognise the competing interests of the public and accused persons 
            where a finding is made that there has been unreasonable delay in 
            criminal proceedings and to take all necessary measures to minimise 
            or avoid the draconian effects on the prosecution system of this decision.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3672</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Act of Settlement</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recalls motion S1M-117 which it passed unanimously 
            on 16 December 1999, condemning the Act of Settlement 1701 as an unacceptable 
            piece of legislation that institutionalises religious discrimination 
            and prejudice; deeply regrets that, despite an on-going campaign in 
            Scotland and England which has involved MPs of all parties over the 
            last three years, the Prime Minister has yet again refused to introduce 
            legislation at Westminster to repeal the act; condemns the Prime Minister 
            and his government for such intransigence and for their failure to 
            take this action, which would give an example and encouragement to 
            those that highlight the need to reject all manifestations of sectarianism 
            and bigotry, and renews its call for the Act of Settlement 1701 to 
            be repealed as a matter of urgency. </p>

            in the name of Des McNulty, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out from 
            &quot;and commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;but regrets that 
            the report does not reject outright the principle of public private 
            partnerships in recognition that this method of financing public capital 
            projects represents poor value for the Scottish taxpayer, a fact which 
            is accepted by the Scottish Trade Union Council and UNISON representing 
            public sector workers who state that the consequences of public private 
            partnerships, reduced levels of service, poorer quality systems and 
            buildings and the fragmenting of any public service staff team, have 
            meant that team working, joined-up service delivery and better public 
            services have not been delivered; accepts the findings of a MORI poll 
            taken across Scotland by UNISON in May 2001, where 91% of the public 
            said that they did not want their public services delivered by private 
            firms; believes that, given the underspend of the Scottish Executive 
            to date of £1.8 billion, the use of public private partnerships is 
            not necessary; condemns Her Majesty's Government for its failure to 
            implement the revised Acquired Rights Directive (TUPE) four years 
            after it was passed by the European Parliament and the Council of 
            Ministers, and calls on the European Commission to fine Her Majesty's 
            Government for its failure to implement the directive.&quot;</a></p>
