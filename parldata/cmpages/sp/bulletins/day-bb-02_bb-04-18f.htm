          <p><strong>*S1M-3004#</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone: Solvent 
            Abuse</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the continued threat 
            posed by solvent abuse; acknowledges the continued need to combat 
            solvent abuse, and believes that the Scottish Executive should investigate 
            and pilot new preventative measures such as the test purchasing scheme, 
            aimed at reducing underage sales of potentially abusive products, 
            which has been successfully applied throughout England and Wales, 
            and actively increase awareness among young people of the devastating 
            effects of solvent abuse.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3003</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Live Motions</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that, for the purpose of good time management 
            and the ability to keep members fully informed in a cost effective 
            manner, the Monday Business Bulletin should be restored to its former 
            effective condition by containing all live motions with a full list 
            of members who have supported each motion.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3002#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan: Current Situation 
            in the Middle East</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its deep 
            concern about the situation in the Middle East; recognises the key 
            role of the United Nations and the rule of international law, and 
            affirms that the immediate cessation of violence, the recognition 
            and protection of human rights and the need for negotiation are essential 
            in order to secure just and long lasting peace in the region.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3001</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Middle East</strong>-That 
            the Parliament condemns all acts of violence in the Middle East, whether 
            they be acts of state violence from Israel or terrorist attacks from 
            Palestine factions; calls for the immediate cessation of all acts 
            of violence; supports the codification of the Saudi initiative as 
            a UN Security Council resolution that would involve Israeli troops 
            withdrawing to pre-1967 boundaries, acceptance of the legitimacy of 
            the Israeli state by the Arab world and the establishment of a viable, 
            self-governing Palestine state; recognises that the UK should freeze 
            all military exports to Israel until it agrees to abide by UN Security 
            Council resolutions; calls for wider economic sanctions to be imposed 
            by the US and EU, preferably under the terms of a UN resolution, and 
            further recognises that the Prime Minister should resolve his contradictory 
            stance by accepting that a new UN Security Council resolution is necessary 
            before embarking on any military action in Iraq.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3000</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Congratulations 
            to Colin MacIver Campbell MSP</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Colin MacIver Campbell MSP on the birth of Ruairidh Alasdair MacLean 
            Campbell, 7lb 13 oz, his eighth grandchild and fifth grandson, born 
            on 16 April 2002 at 19.45 at Paisley Maternity Hospital to his third 
            son Laurie and daughter-in-law Allison, their second child and first 
            son, and is pleased that mother and baby are doing fine.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2999</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: European Centre 
            for Fisheries Research and Management</strong>-That the Parliament 
            supports the establishment of a European Centre for Fisheries Research 
            and Management in Scotland; notes the prestige that this would bring 
            to Scotland and particularly the fisheries scientific community, and 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to the European 
            Union and to Her Majesty's Government in support of a bid for such 
            a centre.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2997#</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Autistic Spectrum 
            Disorders Needs Assessment Report</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges 
            the recent publication of the <em>Autistic Spectrum Disorders Needs 
            Assessment Report</em> undertaken by the Public Health Institute for 
            Scotland; notes the recommendations calling for greater co-operation 
            in working practice between health, education and social services 
            and the desperate need for training all professionals in diagnosis 
            and appropriate aftercare and through- care packages; further notes 
            the increase in diagnosis, and considers the Scottish Executive should 
            implement these recommendations as soon as possible to ensure that 
            Scotland is seen as a leading provider of care and services to those 
            affected by autistic spectrum disorders.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2996</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Scottish Qualifications 
            Authority Bill</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">agrees 
            that the Scottish Qualifications Authority Bill be passed.</a></p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2994.1</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Social Care 
            Workforce Development</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2994) 
            in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from second &quot;the work&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;the steady decline over the last five years 
            in applications to study social work; further notes that Edinburgh 
            University is poised to scrap its social work degree; further notes 
            that difficulties in recruiting social workers are expressed as a 
            serious concern by the majority of local authorities in Scotland; 
            regrets the absence of a recruitment campaign such as has been launched 
            in other parts of the UK and deplores the lack of strategy which will 
            address the poor public image of the profession, review the pay and 
            conditions of social workers, increase flexibility in job opportunities 
            to aid retention, develop positive initiatives to support front line 
            staff or encourage secondment, and concludes that the Executive is 
            merely posturing on this issue and neither acknowledging the crisis 
            nor addressing the critical issues with real commitment. </p>

            in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from second &quot;the work&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;with concern their increasing difficulty in 
            carrying out these tasks owing to poor levels of staffing, increased 
            bureaucracy and additional demands on what was already an over-stretched 
            workforce, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to redouble 
            its efforts to secure an appropriately staffed and trained social 
            care workforce which is capable of carrying out its necessary functions.

            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, insert at end &quot;, however, calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to instigate further investigation into 
            the costings for a new prison at Peterhead, specifically for accommodation 
            for 500 to 700 prisoners, in order to ensure that the best possible 
            outcome is achieved to maintain the excellence that has been delivered 
            to date by HM Prison Peterhead.&quot; </p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2993.2</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Prison 
            Estates Review</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2993) in the 
            name of Mr Jim Wallace, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;notes the publication of the consultation 
            paper <em>Proposals for the Future of the Scottish Prison Service Estate</em>; 
            believes that to help achieve a safer Scotland the prison estate should 
            facilitate the secure holding of prisoners and the delivery of effective 
            rehabilitation programmes, and that prisons should provide a reasonable 
            standard of accommodation; recognises that these objectives can only 
            be achieved by substantial modernisation of the present prison estate; 
            further notes that private prisons have serious deficiencies, in their 
            management of both inmates and staff, and asserts that, in the interest 
            of public safety, such a key component of the criminal justice system 
            should remain in the public sector.&quot; </a></p>
