          <p><strong>*S1M-3097</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Payment of Inheritance 
            Tax by Her Majesty the Queen</strong>-That the Parliament believes 
            that the royal family should be treated the same as any other taxpayer 
            in the UK; further believes that Her Majesty the Queen should be paying 
            the appropriate level of inheritance tax on Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth 
            the Queen Mother's estate, and hopes that Her Majesty the Queen will 
            resolve this issue before her attendance at the Scottish Parliament 
            in Aberdeen on 28 May 2002.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3096</strong> <strong>John Scott: Burns and a' that Festival</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates Ayrshire and Arran Tourist Board and 
            its Chief Executive Janet Reuben on the resounding success of the 
            first &quot;Burns and a' that&quot; festival which was held in Ayrshire 
            between 27 April and 5<sup> </sup>May 2002; further welcomes the role 
            played in the festival's success by its backers, including South Ayrshire 
            Council, Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire, the Scottish Executive, the 
            Scottish Arts Council, VisitScotland, the National Trust for Scotland 
            and the festival producers, Unique Events, and looks forward to the 
            continued growth and development of the festival next year and in 
            further years to come.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3095</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Congratulations 
            to Fraserburgh Football Club on Winning the Press and Journal Highland 
            League Title</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Fraserburgh 
            Football Club on its winning of the <em>Press and Journal</em> Highland 
            League title; notes that this achievement was last accomplished by 
            the club 64 years ago; further notes the dedication and enthusiasm 
            of all players and team staff; believes that the team and its travelling 
            fans are a credit to the local community, and wishes the team all 
            the very best for future football seasons.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3094#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Increase in 
            the Number of Civil Service Jobs Located in the Highlands</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that in the region of 2,000 civil service jobs 
            are required in the Highlands to achieve parity with other areas; 
            supports the move of The Highland Council and Highland and Islands 
            Enterprise to convince the Scottish Executive to relocate the headquarters 
            of Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Arts Council to the 
            north, and recognises that all of Scotland must benefit from the dispersal 
            of civil service jobs in a decentralised, devolved Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3093#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Continuing 
            Crisis in Rural Healthcare</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the decision of Dr Peter Joiner to leave his general practitioner 
            practice in Lybster, Caithness; expresses concern at his description 
            of the intolerable pressures placed on single GP practices in remote 
            and rural areas; further notes the pattern of recent GP resignations 
            in Helmsdale and Argyll; regrets the inactivity of the Scottish Executive 
            in tackling this issue, and supports immediate remedial action to 
            avoid further resignations and retirements in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3090</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Timber Industry 
            in the Scottish Borders</strong>-That the Parliament notes the terms 
            of S1M-2953 in the name of Alex Fergusson; further notes that the 
            largest timber growing area in the UK is the Kielder forest in the 
            Scottish Borders and that the most effective manner of removing dangerous 
            and destructive lorries hauling timber through the small towns and 
            villages of the Southern Borders is to reinstate not just the northern 
            but also the southern half of the Waverley line, and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should undertake a fresh and full study into 
            the environmental impact of removing this freight from road to rail.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3088#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Distribution of 
            Grants to Local Authorities</strong>-That the Parliament believes 
            that the current system of distributing government grants to local 
            authorities needs to be radically overhauled in order to take account 
            more accurately of poverty and deprivation in each local authority 
            area; believes that the city of Glasgow in particular has been neglected 
            by the Scottish Executive in relation to local government financial 
            settlements because the current system fails to take greater account 
            of the real poverty and deprivation that exists in Glasgow; further 
            believes that, in a number of areas, the current distribution system 
            could be greatly improved in order to recognise the additional needs 
            and costs that arise from providing local government services in an 
            area suffering from high levels of poverty and deprivation; notes 
            that only 1.5% of the total grant available for education services 
            is set aside to provide additional services to &quot;deprived pupils&quot;, 
            despite the fact that there is a huge difference between the attainment 
            levels of children from deprived backgrounds compared to those from 
            more affluent backgrounds and that the levels of pupils staying on 
            to S5 and the levels of pupils who enter full-time education are heavily 
            influenced by the pupils' socio-economic background; believes that, 
            in order to address this imbalance, a greater proportion of available 
            grants needs to be made available to provide the additional support 
            required by pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds; further notes that 
            too little recognition is given to the fact that social work is one 
            of the main services greatly affected by levels of deprivation in 
            the Glasgow City Council area and that, while some attempt is made 
            to take account of deprivation, the current distribution system is 
            totally inadequate; recognises that, while it is widely accepted that 
            the vast majority of children who require social work support are 
            from deprived and disadvantaged backgrounds, only 14.5% of the funding 
            for community and residential care services for children is allocated 
            on the basis of indicators that take account of deprivation, the remainder 
            of the resources being allocated on the basis of the total number 
            of children under the age of 16 in each council area; further believes, 
            however, that given that the vast majority of children do not require 
            the support of social work services, it is absolutely perverse and 
            unacceptable that over 85% of the resources are distributed on the 
            basis of the size of this &quot;non-using population&quot; and that 
            it is therefore imperative that the distribution of resources in accordance 
            with the number of children living in poverty, rather than the child 
            population at large, is implemented; further recognises that the system 
            has failed in relation to social work services for disabled people 
            where the only indicator used in the current system to allocate resources 
            to local authorities is the size of the total population aged between 
            16 and 64 years of age, despite the fact that it is widely accepted 
            that poverty has an impact on the health of individuals and also on 
            their ability to fund service provision, i.e. that, while more affluent 
            persons may be able to afford care from a private provider, this option 
            is not available to persons from a deprived background who are wholly 
            reliant on the services provided by local authorities; further notes 
            that this treatment contrasts sharply with the distribution mechanism 
            introduced by Arbuthnott for distributing resources to health boards 
            for persons with a disability; notes that the above examples, only 
            covering three areas of service provision, clearly illustrate that 
            the grant distribution system is seriously deficient in respect of 
            taking account of the impact that deprivation has on the need for 
            and cost of providing local authority services, and recognises the 
            need for a radical overhaul of the distribution system in order to 
            reflect much more accurately social deprivation in each local authority 
            area.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3087</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: University of St Andrews 
            (Postgraduate Medical Degrees) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees

          <p><strong>S1M-3086</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: American Society

            in cultivating and strengthening transatlantic relations between the 
            United States of America and Scotland and for promoting the University

            and the Environment Committee recommends that the draft Scotland Act

          <p><strong>S1M-3082</strong> <strong>Euan Robson: The Draft Marriage

          <p>Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3081#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Transport Infrastructure 
            in the North East</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges that Aberdeen 
            is the only city of its size in the UK that does not have a by-pass; 
            notes that, according to the Aberdeen branch of the Institute of Directors, 
            the cost to the community of Aberdeen's inadequate transport infrastructure 
            is in the region of £20 million per year and that others estimate 
            the cost to be nearer £100 million; recognises that Aberdonians living 
            near the current trunk roads suffer from the effects of air and noise 
            pollution from heavy traffic and have their safety put at risk; further 
            notes that the Grandholm Bridge will close from 10 July 2002, which 
            will cause additional traffic chaos in the city, and further recognises 
            that Aberdeen and the north east are an economic powerhouse whose 
            future well-being is vital to Scotland and that there is an urgent 
            need to allocate the resources necessary to construct a western peripheral 
            route, with a third bridge over the River Don, as part of an integrated 
            transport system as proposed by NESTRANS.</p>

            on 27 March 2001 to implementing trunk road improvements on the A75 
            and A77 trunk roads and its decision to commission further studies 
            of proposed overtaking and climbing lane opportunities on both roads 
            in the A75/A77 ports approach study; and believes that the Executive 
            should include any additional schemes that its further studies validate 
            for inclusion in the forward programme of trunk road improvements 
            without deleting or deferring projects already identified for implementation.</p>

            of the Scottish Criminal Records Office (SCRO) in fingerprint identification 
            and expects that the Scottish Executive will ensure that evidence 
            in criminal cases given by SCRO experts is firmly and scientifically 
            based and not merely a matter of opinion.</p>

            to present businesses north of the city with a severe constraint upon 
            their future development.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3072</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Water Charges and 
            Transitional Relief Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            the initial impact of the establishment of Scottish Water and the 
            harmonisation of water charges will result in charges in the west 
            and east of Scotland rising, while charges in the north remain higher 
            but by a reduced amount; notes that the increase in charges will be 
            10% in the west and 8.5% in the east and notes that, in Glasgow, the 
            annual water and sewerage charge for a band A property will rise from 
            £266.40 to £292.77 and that this new charge will constitute 20% of 
            the overall council tax and water and sewerage charge for 2002-03; 
            further notes that the ceiling for the level of transitional relief 
            for 2002-03 has been set at £198 for bands A to E and that relief 
            is awarded within that range on the basis of council tax benefit received, 
            but that the application of this scheme will in the second year mean 
            that no household in a band A property in the city of Glasgow will 
            qualify for any level of relief and that, in addition, out of 103,000 
            households in receipt of council tax benefit in the city of Glasgow, 
            only 26,000 will qualify for any transitional relief in respect of 
            water and sewerage charges; recognises that further analysis of the 
            situation in Glasgow reveals that the average value of the reduction 
            in band B properties is £25 out of a overall charge of £228, increasing 
            to £220 in a band H household out of an overall charge of £585, that 
            the reduction in charges as a result of the Scottish Executive's Transitional 
            Water and Sewerage Charges Relief Scheme will benefit those recipients 
            in properties banded higher for council tax more than it will therefore 
            benefit those in properties banded lower for council tax and that, 
            in Glasgow, all recipients of council tax benefit in properties in 
            band D and above will qualify for a water reduction, but that those 
            in properties in band A will not; further notes that there will be 
            an overall reduction in the actual relief granted through the Executive's 
            scheme in Glasgow from 2001-02 to 2002-03 of around £30,000, taking 
            the relief granted from £1.2 million to £1.17 million; believes that 
            this scheme is woefully inadequate with regard to assisting the poorest 
            households in Scotland in dealing with huge rises in water and sewerage 
            charges and that its overall effect is to further penalise the city 
            of Glasgow by reducing the overall amount of relief available, and 
            calls on the Executive to introduce a new scheme urgently that actually 
            helps the poorest households more and, in particular, helps the city 
            of Glasgow.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3071</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Anti-TNF 
            Drugs for Rheumatoid Arthritis</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the recent decision by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence 
            (NICE) to approve the use of anti-TNF drugs as being cost-effective 
            in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in England 
            and Wales; recognises the difficulty patients in Scotland have had 
            in accessing such drugs, to the extent that more patients in Leeds 
            are prescribed anti-TNF drugs than in the whole of Scotland; urges 
            the Health Technology Board Scotland to move speedily in order to 
            endorse the NICE approval, and in the meantime asks the Scottish Executive 
            to implement the Scottish Prospective Evaluation of the Clinical Effectiveness 
            of TNF Alpha Inhibitors in Rheumatoid Arthritis (SPECTRA) protocol 
            so that patients in Barrhead, Neilston and elsewhere in Scotland with 
            severe rheumatoid arthritis who are in constant pain are not denied 
            treatment that could radically improve their quality of life</p>

            posthumous pardon for the charge of treason laid against him be granted

            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">recognises the importance of the 
            construction industry to the Scottish economy and the contribution 
            it makes to supporting employment and vocational education and training; 
            notes that nine out of every 10 construction firms employ less than 
            eight people; acknowledges that the reputation of the whole industry 
            is damaged by the actions of rogue traders, particularly within the 
            residential sector, and that small businesses contend that their profitability 
            and competitiveness is adversely affected by the system of cash retentions, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should initiate a strategic 
            review of construction in Scotland in order to (a) identify how best 
            to combat the &quot;cowboy&quot; element, (b) support the education 
            and training infrastructure so that it is able to meet the skill requirements 
            of the industry, (c) examine the possibility of developing an inspection 
            and assessment regime to evaluate the competence of construction companies, 
            (d) address the system of cash retentions and (e) ensure that the 
            provisions within the existing construction contracts legislation 
            deliver a process that is fair, effective and easy to understand.</a></p>
