          <p>9.30 am&#9;Debate on Railway Investment-</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2344</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> <strong>Railway Investment</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the desire of the Minister for Transport and 
            Planning to increase investment in Scottish railways; notes that with 
            the collapse of Railtrack plc there is an opportunity to introduce 
            an innovative system of ownership and management for Scotland's railway 
            network that takes advantage of the good partnership that exists across 
            the railway sector in Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            and all interested parties in Scotland to work together in the Scottish 
            national interest to (a) re-examine the financial and policy powers 
            at the disposal of the Scottish Ministers with respect to railways 
            investment and (b) develop an ownership and investment vehicle for 
            Railtrack assets in Scotland that maximises both public accountability 
            and investment in Scotland's railways in the public interest and on 
            a not for profit basis. </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-2344.1</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Rail Investment</strong>-As an amendment 
              to motion (S1M-2344) in the name of Andrew Wilson, leave out from 
              &quot;with the collapse&quot; to end and insert &quot;it has been 
              a difficult time for the railway industry since the tragedy at Hatfield 
              a year ago and welcomes the steps that the Executive is taking to 
              meet the needs of Scotland's rail users; calls upon the Executive 
              to continue its programme of record investment in the railways and 
              its work to make sure that projects for enhancements to the rail 
              network go ahead, building on the good partnership that exist across 
              the railway industry in Scotland; also notes the recent placing 
              into administration of Railtrack plc and the opportunity that this 
              presents to re-examine the organisation of rail services across 
              the UK; welcomes the Executive's commitment to work closely with 
              Her Majesty's Government to ensure that Scotland has a full and 
              proper input into the restructuring of the UK rail industry, and 
              calls upon all concerned to develop an ownership and investment 
              framework for Railtrack assets that maximises both public and national 
              interest.&quot; </p>

            Situation-</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2347</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Scotland and the Current 
            International Situation</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the significant 
            impact of the current international crisis on our domestic security, 
            on our economic prospects and on our Muslim community in Scotland 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive to continue to bring forward 
            proposals to deal with these matters; supports the international community's 
            desire to bring to justice the perpetrators of the acts of terrorism 
            in the United States of America on 11 September 2001, and agrees that 
            any military action in Afghanistan must, as the Prime Minister has 
            asserted, be compatible with an effective humanitarian operation which 
            meets the desperate needs of the innocent Afghan population. </p>

              International Situation</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2347) 
              in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;the international&quot; 
              to end and insert &quot;Her Majesty's Government in its aim of building 
              the widest possible international coalition, with maximum United 
              Nations support; welcomes NATO's decision to invoke Article 5 of 
              the North Atlantic Treaty and its role in the international effort; 
              agrees that the immediate objectives of the campaign should be to 
              prevent Osama Bin Laden and the Al Qa'ida network from posing a 
              continuing terrorist threat and, to this end, to ensure that the 
              Taliban regime in Afghanistan ceases to harbour and sustain international 
              terrorism and is replaced by a broadly-based government which is 
              representative of all groups in the country; acknowledges that the 
              attainment of these objectives requires the development of all available 
              means, including taking steps to deal with the humanitarian crisis 
              confronting Afghanistan and believes that halting the military action 
              in Afghanistan at this time would hinder the achievement of these 
              objectives and would simply prolong the suffering of people in Afghanistan.&quot;

              must be based on the role of international law and respect for human 
              rights, particularly innocent people's right to life, and therefore 
              calls for an end to the current military action in Afghanistan and

              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S1M-2354.1</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: National Cultural Strategy 
                - One Year On</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2354) in the 
                name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end 
                and insert &quot;regrets that the report is not available to MSPs 
                or the public until 25 October 2001; notes that of the 64 strategic 
                objectives, key priorities and supporting actions in the National 
                Cultural Strategy document Creating our Future, Minding our Past, 
                very few appear to have been progressed significantly; continues 
                to express concern that the Scottish Executive's present cultural 
                policy, as expressed in its National Cultural Strategy, lacks 
                coherence and vision, has failed to engage the support and enthusiasm 
                of the Scottish community in general, and the arts communities 
                in particular, and is unlikely to help fulfil the potential of 
                Scotland at home and abroad or to widen opportunities or assist 
                in delivering social justice; observes that funding crises and 
                other operational difficulties continue to be the daily norm for 
                most publicly subsidised arts bodies, museums and others within 
                the arts and heritage sector, despite the Scottish Executive's 
                relentless self-congratulation about its own actions, and therefore 
                calls upon the Scottish Executive to reconsider its policy and 
                to begin to deliver on some of its promises, including a properly 
                funded National Theatre within a clear and reasonable time-frame 
                based upon a better supported theatre sector in Scotland.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> <strong>S1M-2354.2</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: National Cultural Strategy 
                - One Year On</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2354) in the 
                name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end 
                and insert &quot;but regrets that the Strategy has failed to evoke 
                any substantial response from the people of Scotland who are the 
                ultimate and only source of Scottish culture; notes that the most 
                recent achievements of Scottish culture such as the dramas &quot;Gagarin 
                Way&quot; and &quot;Wiping My Mother's Arse&quot; owed nothing 
                whatsoever to the Cultural Strategy, and expresses confidence 
                that Scots culture will continue to flourish without the intervention 
                of the state as it has since 1707.&quot; </p>
