<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4889</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Clydebank Bowling Club, 125 Years and Still Going Strong</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Clydebank Bowling Club on reaching its 125th year in 2009; notes that it has made a significant contribution to the community of Clydebank, and wishes it another 125 years of success.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4888</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Kilbowie Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils and staff at Kilbowie Primary School, Clydebank, on being awarded the prestigious International School Award in recognition of the outstanding international dimensions of teaching and learning in the school and encourages the school in its efforts in promoting a better understanding of different cultures and traditions of countries the world over.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4887</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>The Hidden Costs of Trident</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of a new report by Greenpeace that refutes the UK Government estimates of the costs of renewing the Trident missile system; is concerned by the report&rsquo;s finding that the total cost of replacing Trident will be &pound;97 billion over the system&rsquo;s 30-year life span; notes that the cost estimate of &pound;20 billion provided in the <em>Defence White Paper 2006</em> does not take account of the cost of conventional military forces directly assigned to support Trident nor the cost of new installations that would be required at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston; believes that, in light of these distended costs and a &pound;500 million cut in the Scottish budget ordered by the UK Government, this report highlights the continued urgency of dropping Trident; supports the aims and work of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Working Group on Scotland Without Nuclear Weapons, and calls on the UK Government to relinquish its dogged commitment to squandering precious public resources on a weapons system that is unnecessary and irrelevant.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4886</strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Congratulating a Bighearted Fundraising Champion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly congratulates 11-year-old Abby Louise Tombs of Govanhill, Glasgow, on becoming runner-up in the Bighearted Scotland Child of the Year award; recognises her three years of effort, raising over &pound;10,000 for Kidney Research UK with a variety of fundraising events including hikes up Ben Nevis, race nights and more; notes her courage and commitment to this charity in the face of her own ongoing health concerns, and encourages the people of Scotland to take inspiration from her example and renew their dedication to charitable efforts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4885</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>GTC Scotland Teaching Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Heather Slimmon from Kirk O&rsquo;Shotts Primary School in Salsburgh on being awarded professional recognition as a sustainable development teacher by the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS); notes that her award is in recognition of her work in supporting the school&rsquo;s progress toward a second Eco-Schools Green Flag award; further notes that Ms Slimmon has been instrumental in establishing the school&rsquo;s first eco-committee and encouraging pupils throughout the school, along with teachers, non-teaching staff and parents to become actively involved;  considers that there are huge benefits to Kirk O&rsquo;Shotts Primary of having a teacher gain an enhanced standard of knowledge and skills in this field; notes that, as a result, the school now has a fully operational travel plan, a silver health-promoting establishment award and is currently working toward the gold award; welcomes the increasing emphasis on sustainable development education in Scotland&rsquo;s schools and commends Ms Slimmon&rsquo;s work to ensure that sustainable development is firmly embedded in the curriculum at Kirk O&rsquo;Shotts Primary and in the values and actions of the school and in encouraging pupils, teachers and parents to plan for a better and more sustainable future; commends the hard work, enthusiasm and commitment of all 18 teachers who were recently awarded professional recognition status by GTCS, and looks forward to more teachers across Scotland achieving this valuable award in the future.</p>
