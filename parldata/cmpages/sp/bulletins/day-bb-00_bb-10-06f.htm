            <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Discrimination Against Teaching Centres of Artistic 
            Excellence</strong>-That the Parliament notes the decision of the Department 
            for Education and Employment to introduce Dance and Drama Awards for 
            students to study at institutions in England and Wales; is aware that 
            Scottish students compete on equal terms for places at such institutions 
            with their counterparts from other parts of the United Kingdom and 
            the European Union (EU); is concerned that tuition fees are only paid 
            if students study in England and Wales and regrets that no parallel 
            funding scheme exists for students who wish to study in Scotland; 
            believes that this discrimination against Scottish institutions can 
            only harm them and in the case of Ballet West may force it out of 
            business or to relocate from Taynuilt to outwith Scotland, to the 
            detriment of the local economy and employment; notes that Ballet West 
            attracts students from across the United Kingdom, the EU and as far 
            afield as Guatemala, Japan and Malaysia and outperforms competitor 
            schools from south of the border in ballet competitions and quality 
            of training; is puzzled by the Minister for Children and Education's 
            view that &quot;there is no evidence of significant demand for Dance 
            and Drama training for young people aged 16 and over in Scotland&quot; 
            when 613 applications were received by Ballet West for 23 places; 
            regrets that 34 students withdrew or rejected offers from Ballet West 
            due to lack of funding, compared with only two students doing so at 
            English institutions; notes that the Excellence Fund supports and 
            encourages talented secondary school dancers in Scotland but that 
            the only progression into tertiary training encouraged by the Scottish 
            Executive is in England; is concerned that Scotland will become denuded 
            of teaching centres of artistic excellence and be drained of artistic 
            talent as a result of this discrimination; believes that the current 
            position of the Scottish Executive on this issue contradicts its own 
            cultural strategy that has as its key themes &quot;widening opportunities, 
            promoting education, developing and celebrating excellence&quot;, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should act in order that 
            students from across the UK can choose where to study dance, drama 
            or stage management based on the quality of course offered rather 
            than on whether or not tuition fees will be paid.</font></p>

            Release of Executive Documents Relating to the Examination Results 
            Crisis</strong>-That the Parliament requires under the terms of section 
            23 of the Scotland Act 1998 that the Minister for Children and Education 
            and Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning produce for the

            responsibility as well as bestowing honour and dignity upon the holder 
            of the post; notes with concern the views of many students of Glasgow 
            University who are calling for the resignation of the current Rector 
            Mr Ross Kemp on the basis that he has failed in many of his Rectorial 
            duties, including failing to give the freshers' address in two successive 
            years and to hold surgeries as promised, and therefore supports the
