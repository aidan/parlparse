          <p><strong>*S2M-1373</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Falkirk 
            Mini-Olympics</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Falkirk Council 
            on organising a mini-Olympic games where 1,800 pupils from 51 primary 
            schools will compete together in a variety of sports; welcomes the 
            fact that each school will represent a chosen country; wishes the 
            participants well at the centre of excellence in Grangemouth Stadium, 
            and believes that the pupils will enter into the true spirit of the 
            Olympic movement.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1372</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Money 
            Owed to Nursery Nurses</strong>-That the Parliament notes that large 
            numbers of nursery nurses do not receive holiday pay, despite their 
            entitlement under the working time directive and regulations; believes 
            that nursery nurses should have been in receipt of full holiday entitlement 
            since 1998; condemns COSLA and individual employers for not correcting 
            this wrong and withholding monies that nursery nurses are lawfully 
            entitled to, and believes that COSLA should seek to ensure that local 
            authorities reimburse nursery nurses in full for all outstanding holiday 
            entitlement and offer a full explanation and apology for its omissions.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1371#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Launch 
            of Osteoporosis Mobile Scanner in Coatbridge</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the launch in Coatbridge of the first NHS mobile scanner 
            for osteoporosis; recognises that one in three women in Scotland suffer 
            from osteoporosis, but that many women are not aware that they have 
            reduced bone density; notes that there are 20,000 osteoporotic fractures 
            in Scotland every year, which cost the NHS £1.7 billion per annum 
            and that this figure will continue to rise as we live longer; recognises 
            that this is a health issue of particular importance to the women 
            of Scotland; congratulates NHS Lanarkshire for supporting this innovative 
            project; further congratulates local Coatbridge GP, Dr Eamonn Brankin, 
            the project leader, for his vision and tenacity in securing the loan 
            of this mobile service; notes, however, that this is a temporary solution, 
            only available for 16 weeks, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should consider ways of securing future funding for this example of 
            best practice in Coatbridge and pursue the option of rolling it out 
            across Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1370</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>US 
            Aggression Towards Cuba</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the 
            report announced on 6 May 2004 by the misnamed &quot;Commission for 
            Assistance to a Free Cuba&quot;, appointed by President George W Bush, 
            which contains measures to further tighten the US Government's hostile 
            policy against Cuba; notes that the measures include new restrictions 
            on Cuban-born citizens living in the US travelling to Cuba and spending 
            money on their families there and, even more worryingly, measures 
            aimed at subverting the Cuban Government by increasing the funds provided 
            to counter-revolutionary groups, developing a global media campaign 
            to undermine Cuba's image at international level and creating a worldwide 
            disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the Cuban tourist industry, 
            thereby affecting the Cuban economy; further notes that some $59 million 
            has been earmarked for these measures, which also include promises 
            of assistance to a &quot;post-Castro government&quot;; considers that 
            these measures are part of a longer-term plan to recolonize Cuba; 
            condemns the US Government's attempt to increase the extremely difficult 
            conditions already imposed on the Cuban people by the illegal economic 
            and investment blockade it has enforced for 45 years; declares that 
            this further attempt to subdue the Cuban population through hunger 
            and disease is a violation of human rights and constitutes a flagrant 
            breach of international law; notes that the Cuban Government fears 
            that these measures are a prelude to invasion by the United States, 
            and calls on Her Majesty's Government to distance itself urgently 
            from the US policy of aggression towards Cuba and join with countries, 
            including Spain and Mexico, in denouncing this report and the measures 
            contained within.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1369</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>South 
            Lanarkshire Council Planning for Sydes Braes</strong>-That the Parliament 
            deeply regrets the decision of South Lanarkshire Council's planning 
            committee to approve the application for the construction of a crematorium 
            at the Sydes Braes site in High Blantyre; notes that this decision 
            was taken in spite of almost 2,000 letters of objection from local 
            residents, and believes that any further action in relation to the 
            application should not be taken without a public inquiry which takes 
            full and proper account of local views on the proposals.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1368</strong> <strong>Mike Watson:</strong> <strong>Incitement 
            to Racial Hatred</strong>-That the Parliament notes with disgust the 
            British National Party's election leaflet for the European Parliament 
            elections, delivered to every household in Scotland; is appalled that 
            its xenophobic content is designed to stir up racial hatred and division; 
            further notes that the Scottish Refugee Council has issued a detailed 
            rebuttal of the assertions which it contains, and urges the Lord Advocate 
            to examine the content of the leaflet with a view to bringing a prosecution 
            under the appropriate legislation.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1367</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Joint 
            ScotRail and FirstBus Initiative</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the joint initiative by ScotRail and FirstBus to provide a connecting 
            bus and rail service with through-ticketing between Haddington and 
            Edinburgh; further welcomes the initial special offer of free travel 
            for a trial period between 24 May and 20 June 2004, and recommends 
            that other bus companies enter into similar arrangements with ScotRail 
            and the new rail franchise holder.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1366</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Racist 
            Election Literature</strong>-That the Parliament notes that*, in the 
            opinion of Positive Action in Housing and other anti-racism campaigners,* 
            the British National Party's current European election leaflet amounts 
            to an incitement to racial hatred which is an offence under the Public 
            Order Act 1986; is concerned that tens of thousands of pounds of public 
            money have been used to deliver this vile, racist message of hatred 
            to hundreds of thousands of homes across Scotland; further notes that 
            Royal Mail employees, who have objected to delivering the leaflet, 
            have been threatened with disciplinary action and that, so far, despite 
            dozens of complaints by members of the public, the police have failed 
            to bring a prosecution; believes that democratic principles are undermined 
            when minority ethnic communities are placed in a state of fear by 
            literature of this nature, and calls on the Scottish Executive's Law 
            Officers to urgently investigate the possibility of prosecuting the 
            British National Party for public order offences.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie, John Swinburne, Campbell Martin, Tommy 
            Sheridan, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>S2M-1365</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Depleted 
            Uranium</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Dr Helen Caldicott, 
            a paediatrician and president of the American Nuclear Policy Research 
            Institute on her calls for the US military to clean up the depleted 
            uranium scattered across Iraq to prevent future health problems such 
            as cancer and birth defects; notes that the depleted uranium ammunition 
            currently being used by the US military could seriously harm both 
            service personnel and civilians living in the area for decades to 
            come; further notes Dr Caldicott's calls for the US Government to 
            compensate people with cancer related to depleted uranium, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to put pressure upon the Ministry of Defence 
            to stop the testing of depleted uranium at Dundrennan as a matter 
            of urgency, undertake a full health investigation into the local area 
            and fully compensate those individuals whose health has been affected 
            by this substance.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1364</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Tweed 
            Forum</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Tweed Forum on 
            its Bridging the Border Education Project, a project that helps young 
            people to enjoy and understand their natural and cultural heritage; 
            notes that the work of the forum involves educational activities and 
            events for young people, youth leaders and teachers; further notes 
            the innovative way in which this project combines environmental awareness 
            with educational activities, and urges the Scottish Executive to support 
            all similar projects that have both educational and emotional benefits 
            for youth leaders and young people.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1363#</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Sale 
            of Alcohol at Murrayfield Stadium</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            that the sale of alcohol within Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh was 
            licensed on the occasion of the BT Cup Finals on 1 May 2004 and the 
            Scotland versus Barbarians match on 22 May 2004 and that both events 
            were well conducted and gave rise to no problems of crowd disorder; 
            believes that international rugby union matches played at Murrayfield 
            Stadium should cease to be designated sporting events for the purposes 
            of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995, and *considers 
            that* the Scottish Executive *should* bring forward amending legislation 
            to that effect.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1362</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of

            of the murals outside the Partick Annexe Healthy Living Centre in 
            Glasgow; further notes that they are the work of over 90 local artists 
            from across the age spectrum, and congratulates all involved in creating 
            the eight individual murals depicting Partick, past and present.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1360</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Salute 
            to the Nursery Nurses</strong>-That the Parliament salutes the struggle 
            of nursery nurses, the majority of whom enter their 13th week of all-out 
            indefinite action; is dismayed by the intransigence and lack of care 
            displayed by COSLA, the individual local authorities and the Scottish 
            Executive, despite the nursery nurses having an obviously just case 
            and the spectre of thousands of children not receiving an education 
            for over three months; believes that nursery nurses have demonstrated 
            great dignity in the pursuit of their campaign, in direct contrast 
            to their employers and the Executive who have treated them with contempt 
            by refusing to use the power and means at their disposal that would 
            have resolved this dispute without the costs incurred by nursery nurses, 
            children and parents, and further believes that the Executive should 
            take immediate steps to ensure that a national pay and grading structure 
            is put in place for nursery nurses.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1359</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Neurological 
            Alliance of Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the launch 
            on 26 May 2004 of the Neurological Alliance of Scotland; notes that 
            an estimated one million people in Scotland live with a neurological 
            condition, a tenth of whom are disabled by that condition; while encouraged 
            by the recent increase in the number of neurologists, deplores the 
            long waiting times to see a specialist and the continuing geographical 
            inconsistencies across Scotland in the provision of neurological services, 
            and supports the alliance's call for a strategic approach to developing 
            services to meet identified neurological needs throughout Scotland.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1357</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Premier League Deal with Setanta</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with disappointment the decision by the Scottish Premier League to 
            agree an exclusive four-year deal with pay-per-view company, Setanta; 
            believes that this will restrict the ability of ordinary football 
            fans to watch Scotland's most popular spectator sport; considers this 
            to be yet another short-sighted decision by those who run Scottish 
            football, and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations 
            to Her Majesty's Government so that the necessary steps are taken 
            to ensure that there will be live football available on terrestrial 
            television in Scotland once this restrictive deal ends.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1356</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Statutory 
            Regulation of Acupuncture</strong>-That the Parliament notes the consultation 
            <em>Regulation of herbal medicine and acupuncture: Proposals for statutory 
            regulation</em> being undertaken by Her Majesty's Government's Department 
            of Health, and notes that this encompasses regulation of complementary 
            and alternative medicine in Scotland; notes that these proposals for 
            statutory regulation favour the establishment of a shared Complementary 
            and Alternative Medicine Council for herbal medicine and traditional 
            acupuncture which could then be extended to other unregulated complementary 
            and alternative medicine professions; further notes that health delivery 
            in Scotland is different to that in the rest of the United Kingdom 
            and, therefore, may require different measures to the rest of the 
            UK; notes that traditional acupuncture is a central part of the system 
            of Chinese medicine, which is a holistic approach to health based 
            on over 2000 years of observation and analysis, and has a distinct 
            theoretical basis; notes the high standards of regulation, health 
            and safety provision, extensive training and professional codes of 
            practice of those practitioners who are accredited by the British 
            Acupuncture Council, the UK's main regulatory and representative body 
            for the practice of acupuncture involving over 2,400 professionally-qualified 
            acupuncturists; believes that Chinese medicine, as a separate system 
            of medical practice, should be defined, governed and accredited separately 
            and according to the current standards of the British Acupuncture 
            Council, British Acupuncture Accreditation Board and World Health 
            Organization; believes that medical and other practitioners working 
            within the western medical tradition should avoid the term acupuncture 
            unless it is used as part of the Chinese medicine medical tradition, 
            and believes that the distinct benefits and attributes of Chinese 
            medicine should be recognised by the creation of a separate statutory 
            body to accredit, govern and act as a professional body to these activities.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1355</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Murrayfield 
            Alcohol Ban</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the vital role 
            played by the Scottish Rugby Union in promoting rugby both at international 
            and grassroots level; further recognises the financial difficulties 
            and burdens faced by, and placed upon, it; is aware of the proposal 
            within the Nicholson report to trial alcohol sales at a sports ground; 
            notes the success of the BT Cup Final and the Scotland versus Barbarians 
            matches at Murrayfield at which alcohol was sold; recalls that there 
            has never been any history of crowd trouble at rugby internationals 
            in Scotland; notes that alcohol may be sold at pop concerts, rugby 
            league games and American football matches but not at rugby internationals 
            at the stadium; further notes that Murrayfield is the only major venue 
            in the Six Nations rugby tournament to have alcohol provision precluded 
            at international matches, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to review its proposal to continue the ban on the selling of alcohol 
            at international games at Scottish rugby's national stadium.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1354#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Healthy Food for Highland Schools</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Highland Council for its decision to source locally as much of its 
            £2.5 million contracts for foodstuffs, including fresh fruit and vegetables, 
            as possible, to promote food education for children and parents alike; 
            welcomes the decision of the council's Education, Culture and Sport 
            Committee to raise awareness among local suppliers whose successful 
            tenders included the supply of organic fruit and vegetables; believes 
            that the proposed pilot in Strathpeffer Primary School based on the 
            principles of &quot;Food for Life&quot; is a most welcome step that 
            sets a good example by insisting that 50% or more food is sourced 
            locally, with ingredients to include 30% organic and 75% unprocessed 
            foodstuffs, and praises the council's public procurement policy as 
            part of major moves towards the aim of maximum local sourcing to provide 
            best quality school meals that can be produced within budget constraints.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1329#</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Affordable 
            Housing in North-east Fife</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the shortage of affordable housing for rent or sale in many 
            communities in north-east Fife; recognises that this is due to many 
            factors including the decline in the amount of public sector rented 
            accommodation, the popularity of many communities as retirement and 
            holiday locations and, in the case of St Andrews, the accommodation 
            needs of the growing student population; expresses its concern about 
            the difficulties faced by many people in trying to obtain affordable 
            accommodation in their own communities and the pressures on rural 
            services such as schools, and considers that Fife Council, Communities 
            Scotland and the Scottish Executive should develop an effective housing 
            plan for north-east Fife that addresses these concerns to ensure viable, 
            vibrant and sustainable communities throughout north-east Fife.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-866#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Asbestos-Related 
            Illnesses</strong>-That the Parliament notes with deep concern recent 
            projections regarding the increasing prevalence of asbestos-related 
            illnesses in Scotland; notes that the historic concentration of heavy 
            industry on Clydeside has left a devastating health legacy, affecting 
            many former shipyard and engineering workers and their families; notes 
            that although former shipyard communities show the highest incidence 
            of asbestos-related disease, evidence now shows that ever-increasing 
            numbers of workers from other parts of Scotland have also become victims 
            of asbestos-related illnesses due largely to the past use of asbestos 
            in construction; considers that the Scottish Executive should give 
            urgent consideration to bringing forward an integrated strategy to 
            assist all those affected by asbestos-related illnesses, which should 
            combine screening and testing people who may have been at risk in 
            order to ensure early diagnosis, counselling and support for victims 
            and their families, and the provision of specialist palliative care, 
            and further considers that the Scottish Executive should work along 
            with COSLA, NHS boards and other key bodies, including the Health 
            and Safety Executive to ensure that necessary information is made 
            available to potential sufferers from asbestos-related illnesses and 
            all those professionals in health, local government and other services 
            who may be in the position of assisting victims and their families.</P>
