          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2059</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Violence Against Women</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the International Day to Eliminate Violence Against Women on 25 November 2004; affirms its commitment to eradicating all forms of violence against women in Scotland; acknowledges the significant funding that has gone into domestic abuse initiatives over the last four years; welcomes the more recent work of the Scottish Executive in setting up the Violence Against Women Service Development Fund and supporting Rape Crisis Scotland and the ten rape crisis centres throughout Scotland, and, noting the complexity of many of the issues involved, supports the Executive&rsquo;s decision to set up an expert committee to support the development of a strategic approach to tackling these issues in future.</p>
