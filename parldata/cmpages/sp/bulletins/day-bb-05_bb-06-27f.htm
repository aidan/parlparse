          <p><strong> Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></strong></p>

          <p align="center"><strong> New and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-3030 Carolyn Leckie: No Reduction of Student Nurse Intakes&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament expresses concern at the announcement by the Minister for Health and Community Care of a 12% cut in the intake of student nurses; believes that, with workforce planning still embryonic in the NHS, sickness absence still high, the demography of the workforce ageing, major changes such as reorganisation, the Kerr report, nurses adopting more complex roles and responsibilities with, as yet, unquantified impact on staffing numbers, skill mix, training and backfilling requirements, the reductions are unsupported by credible rationale, and further believes that the Scottish Executive should reconsider this reduction and enter into meaningful discussions with all relevant parties, including trade unions and professional organisations, to reach agreement on the number of student nurses needed to sustain, secure and develop an NHS nursing workforce equipped for the 21st century.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-3029 Bruce Crawford: Battle of Bannockburn&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament recognises the heroic efforts and sacrifices made by the 13,000 Scottish freedom fighters who, inspired and led by King Robert the Bruce, defeated 40,000 soldiers under the command of King Edward II to safeguard Scotland&rsquo;s right to remain an independent nation at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June 1314.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-3028 Richard Baker: Met Office, Aberdeen&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern the Met Office&rsquo;s proposals to close its Aberdeen Office and centralise forecasting services in Exeter; notes the vital contribution that the Aberdeen Office and its 37 staff make to the fishing, oil and gas industries in the north east; notes the concerns expressed by trade unions, the UK Offshore Operators Association and the Scottish Fishermen&rsquo;s Federation over the proposals; believes that the local knowledge and expertise that the Aberdeen Met Office staff have is invaluable; calls on the Met Office to use the consultation period to reconsider the proposal, and believes that all interested parties should work together to ensure that there is no reduction in the quality of localised weather forecasting in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-3020 # Robin Harper: Invest in Local High Streets&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should consult local traders and communities to discover how best to invest in the future of Scotland&rsquo;s local high streets in cities and towns, to repair and improve buildings, to provide community facilities and better public transport, to address the negative effects of out-of-town malls and the ever-increasing number of inner city supermarkets, such as the proposed Tesco Metro in Edinburgh&rsquo;s Morningside, and to ensure a vibrant future for our local high streets that are often the only accessible shops for the elderly, infirm and the 34% of the population with no access to a car.</p>
