<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#sec">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4684</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Abertay Redundancy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the University of Abertay Dundee&rsquo;s decision to make a member of its academic staff compulsorily redundant and its refusal to consider redeployment, voluntary severance, early retirement or other mutually acceptable options suggested by the employee&rsquo;s trade union, the University and College Union (UCU), and considers that such behaviour flies in the face of good employment practice and is likely to damage the university&rsquo;s reputation and make it harder for it to recruit good academic staff in future.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4683</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Paying the Price</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Citizen&rsquo;s Advice Scotland&rsquo;s latest report, <em>Paying the Price: The Real Costs of Illness and Disability</em>, which is based on a detailed survey of clients claiming incapacity benefit or disability living allowance; notes further that more than two-thirds of claimants had a monthly household income of less that &pound;800, that 62% had incomes consisting only of benefits or augmented by tax credits and that 48% reported that they had reduced their heating, lighting or cooking because of the cost of fuel; is concerned that, as a result, more than two-thirds said that their health was fluctuating or worsening, with nearly half also having been out of work for more than five years; considers that, even within the restrictions of devolution, the Scottish government could improve matters by making available additional support for those who incur additional costs through illness and disability in areas such as prescription charging, travel costs, hospital car parking charges and energy costs, and calls on the Scottish government to address these issues now.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4682</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>US Use of Prestwick Airport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern reports that Prestwick Airport has been used by the United States of America&nbsp;for flights carrying bombs to Israel for use in Lebanon; notes that this follows repeated allegations that the same airport has been used to facilitate the illegal rendition of terrorist suspects by the US; welcomes the reported intervention of UK Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett in noting her concerns to the US Government but calls for much stronger and unequivocal representation urging that any such flights stop immediately, and calls on the UK Government, First Minister Jack McConnell and the Scottish Executive, and the Prestwick Airport authorities to take all possible action to prevent future use of the facility by any aircraft carrying materials or equipment that could be used in the escalating Israel/Lebanon conflict.</p>
<p>Supported by: Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong>, Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Roseanna Cunningham<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4681</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Use of Prestwick Airport as a Staging Post for Transporting American Bombing Support for Israel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views with extreme concern allegations that Prestwick Airport is being used as a staging post for major shipments of GBU-28 laser-guided bombs from the United States of America to Israel; considers these 5,000 pound so-called &quot;smart bombs&quot; to be a danger to any potential peace settlement in the current volatile situation and a very potent danger to ordinary Lebanese people, as recent TV and press reports have shown that such weapons pose a major threat to the general public in southern Lebanon; calls for an end to the supply of such weapons to Israel, and deplores any use of Scottish airports to facilitate the transport of such weapons from the US to the Middle East.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4680</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Call for a Permanent Ban on Wild Live Bird Imports</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament gives support to the call for a permanent ban on live wild bird imports to Scotland and the United Kingdom by the British Veterinary Association, recognising the high level of mortality that surrounds the trapping and transporting and other cruelty factors which affect such birds and acknowledging also the health risks to other livestock of importation of these birds.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4679</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Travel Costs for Cancer Sufferers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent Macmillan Cancer Support report which reveals that the most widespread cost facing cancer patients is the cost of travelling to and parking at hospital, that on average patients who incur these costs make 53 trips to hospital during the course of their treatment, spending approximately &pound;325, and that far too many cancer patients are not made aware of the help that may be available to them, such as through the Hospital Travel Costs Scheme or the NHS Low Income Scheme; recognises that these extra costs come at a time when cancer patients and their families are already dealing with the strain of a cancer diagnosis and the debilitating effects of treatment; notes that 91% of cancer patients&rsquo; households suffer loss of income and/or increased costs as a direct result of cancer; acknowledges that there is an urgent need for a review of the financial assistance available for patients travelling for treatment, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to exempt cancer patients from hospital parking charges and to give cancer patients help with their travel costs.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4678</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Gay Police Association Advertisement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the use of the phrase &quot;in the name of the father&quot; and the image of a Bible next to a pool of blood in the advertisement placed by the Gay Police Association in Scotland in the 29 June 2006 issue of <em>The Independent </em>newspaper, which thereby inferred that faith in the Bible is the cause of a 74% rise in homophobic incidents and crimes; rejects this inference as totally erroneous; values Scotland&rsquo;s Christian community and the contribution it makes to our society and our culture; deeply regrets that any police officer would choose to place an advertisement in any medium to make such a gratuitous insult to a section of the Scottish population, and hopes that all police officers will act in a manner that reflects fully the attitudes, values and beliefs which Scotland, as a modern society founded on the Christian faith, encompasses.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4677#</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>GRIP - Grid Reference Identification Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Maria Murray and ASIRUS (Asthma Support in Rural Scotland), the Scottish Ambulance Service North East Division and Grampian Fire and Rescue Service on the launch of the GRIP - Grid Reference Identification Project which will provide support to individuals considered to be at risk in remote and rural areas; notes that GRIP will provide a system which will help reduce the time required for patients to explain their location in times of emergency when every minute counts, and believes that this project should be adopted across the emergency rescue services to provide further support to asthma patients and others, including diabetic, epileptic, cardiac and anaphylactic patients, in remote and rural Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4676</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>2006 Edinburgh Military Tattoo and Brigadier Mel Jameson</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes all involved with the 2006 Edinburgh Military Tattoo every success for this year&rsquo;s event which takes place between 4 and 26 August; notes that this year&rsquo;s Tattoo will be Brigadier Mel Jameson&rsquo;s last in the role of executive director and congratulates him on his successful stewardship of the Tattoo over a number of years and on having made it an international event; acknowledges that, although not part of the Edinburgh International Festival, the Tattoo has helped bring thousands of people to Edinburgh to participate in the Festival, and wishes Brigadier Jameson every success in his new role as Her Majesty&rsquo;s Lord Lieutenant for Perth and Kinross.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4675</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Inverurie Environment Day 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Inverurie Environment Day which takes place on Saturday 29 July 2006; notes that Inverurie Environment Day is a celebration of our local environment and a shop window full of ideas and advice on how to lead an environmentally-friendly lifestyle; also notes that the event has attracted more than 25 exhibitors ranging from local groups such as Baillies of Bennachie and Inverurie Horticultural Society to national organisations such as the RSPB and Keep Scotland Beautiful; further notes that the day also provides an opportunity to both celebrate, and recognise the need to protect, our natural heritage and to recognise how everyone can play their part, and congratulates the Inverurie Environmental Improvement Group, Inverurie Business Association, Inverurie Community Council, the Rotary Club of Inverurie and Aberdeenshire Council on organising and supporting the event.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4674</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Protecting Scotland from GM Contamination</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of a consultation exercise on the coexistence of GM, conventional and organic crops; further notes comments by Ian Pearson MP, UK Minister of State for Climate Change and the Environment, that GM contamination of conventional and organic crops is inevitable should GM crops be grown commercially in the United Kingdom; observes that Mr Pearson&rsquo;s warnings are borne out by the experience of farmers in North America where organic and conventional farmers have been driven out of business following contamination by GM material; acknowledges widespread public rejection of GM agriculture and observes that as long as this remains the case there will be no market for GM produce in the UK; welcomes the unprecedented growth in demand for organic produce, up by 30% over the past year and now valued at &pound;1.6 billion across the UK, in marked contrast to the GM sector; supports the right of the organic and conventional agricultural sectors to protect their products, market reputation and livelihoods from the effects of GM contamination; finds it strange that the UK Government seems intent on jeopardising the future of a valuable and thriving agricultural sector by supporting the interests of the agricultural biotech industry, whose products virtually no-one wishes to either purchase or consume; strongly believes that whatever coexistence measures are put in place must be backed up by a rigorous strict liability regime, with any economic damages suffered by non-GM farmers fully compensated by the GM industry, and calls on the Scottish Executive to publish its own consultation on GM coexistence and liability and to take a more precautionary approach that genuinely protects the interests of Scottish farmers and consumers, the overwhelming majority of whom wish to remain GM-free.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4673</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen International Youth Festival - The World Festival of Youth Arts, 2 - 12 August 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 2006 Aberdeen International Youth Festival which takes place between 2 and 12 August 2006; recognises the importance of this bringing together of young people from across the world in this vibrant, international event which showcases talent from Scotland and around the world; wishes all involved a successful and enjoyable festival, and further welcomes the contribution the event makes to the economy of Aberdeen and the surrounding area.</p>
