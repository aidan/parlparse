<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3579 Bob Doris: Cities and the Town Centre Regeneration Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance of vibrant town centres up and down Scotland in increasing sustainable economic growth; recognises the importance of town centres for local residents and in attracting others to spend their money in the local community; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &pound;60 million Town Centre Regeneration Fund, which will provide a much needed boost to town centres that are feeling the ill effects of the current economic downturn; notes that many city-based town centres suffer from the draw of a large city centre and from out-of-town shopping centres, often leaving the most socially excluded residents in the area using a poor range of facilities; welcomes the Minister for Housing and Communities&rsquo; agreement to explore the prospect of city areas being able to apply for money from this fund, and believes that locations in Glasgow such as Springburn Shopping Centre and Victoria Road are just some examples of areas that could benefit.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3578 Christine Grahame: Judicial Inquiry into Financial System Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls for a full judicial inquiry to be established to examine the role and actions of the Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer and financial regulator, the FSA, during the banking crisis; considers that the regulator failed adequately to protect shareholders, staff and the wider economy, and believes that only a full judicial inquiry will be able to examine all of the aspects that led directly to the crisis in and failure of the UK banking system.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3577&diams;
  Sandra White: Loss of Investigative Journalism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the <em>Sunday Mail</em> on setting the benchmark for investigative journalism in Glasgow and, indeed, Scotland and which, through its dedicated and skilled journalists, has bravely led the way in exposing the country&rsquo;s most powerful criminal gangs; considers that the country&rsquo;s largest-selling paper is also acknowledged for its investigations into official corruption (political, police and government); believes that the decision to merge the <em>Sunday Mail </em>with its sister title, the <em>Daily Record, </em>will result in savage job cuts, in many criminals and corrupt officials, who might otherwise have been exposed, escaping justice and will signal the death knell for investigative journalism, and deeply regrets the decision by Trinity Mirror to press ahead with these plans.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3576 Jamie Hepburn: Admission of UK Government of Rendition of Suspected Terror Suspects</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern, following the revelation that, despite official assurances to the contrary, terror suspects detained by British soldiers in Iraq were secretly flown by the United States of America to Afghanistan; states its belief that extraordinary rendition is an errant practice with no legal basis, in which no decent government should engage, and calls on the UK Government to accede to the numerous demands for a full inquiry into the various allegations that the United Kingdom has been involved in facilitating the extraordinary rendition of individuals to countries where they face torture.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3575 Ross Finnie: Health Secretary Must Reject Narrow Vision for Vale of Leven</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to reject the narrow vision for the future of the Vale of Leven Hospital approved by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde; considers the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to restrict the catchment area for the hospital and preclude the involvement of the facilities and personnel of the Golden Jubilee Hospital to be a wasted opportunity, and calls on the cabinet secretary to scrutinise the decision.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3567 Jackie Baillie: SNP Fails Dumbarton Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Labour group of West Dunbartonshire Council to set a budget that included funding to enable the much needed rebuilding of Dumbarton Academy; considers that the rebuilding of this 500-year-old school should be a priority; expresses considerable disappointment and anger that the SNP-led council failed even to consider the Labour group&rsquo;s proposals and voted against the rebuilding of the school; further expresses concern that, if the school is not rebuilt quickly, it will disadvantage thousands of young children in Dumbarton who are currently being denied access to the best educational environment possible, and therefore calls on the SNP to build a new Dumbarton Academy without any further delay.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3559 Kenneth Gibson: The Future of the Sunday Mail and Daily Record</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision of Trinity Mirror to merge the editorial content of the <em>Daily Record</em> and <em>Sunday Mail</em> with the loss of up to 30% of journalistic staff, based primarily in Glasgow and the West of Scotland; recognises that both newspapers are an integral part of Scottish culture and that to diminish their individual identities would be a serious blow to the diversity, vibrancy and quality of the Scottish media; believes that the loss of their separate identities would undoubtedly lead to the erosion of circulation at both titles, leading inevitably to further job losses; considers that Trinity Mirror is highly profitable and that there is no need to undertake such drastic restructuring, and therefore very much hopes that good sense may prevail over the future of two of Scotland&rsquo;s leading titles.</p>
