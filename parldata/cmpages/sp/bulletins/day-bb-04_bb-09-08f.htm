          <P><strong>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks in the text show the extent of alterations made.</strong></P>
          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1658</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Congratulations on the Twinning of Lower Largo and Robinson Crusoe Island</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the community council in Lower Largo on its hard work and long campaigning to twin with Juan Fernandez Island, otherwise known as Robinson Crusoe Island; notes that 10 September, the date on which Alexander Selkirk, the inspiration for Robinson Crusoe, first landed 300 years ago on the island, will be a day of celebration and festivities, and pays tribute to all those in Fife and beyond who have put together such an excellent and varied programme of events.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1657</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Lack of High-Dependency Beds in Greater Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow to transfer the gynaecology and gynaecology oncology unit from Stobhill Hospital to Glasgow Royal Infirmary without ensuring the provision of essential additional high-dependency beds and therefore compromising clinical judgements and increasing waiting time for surgery, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to intervene to ensure that patients receive an improved service or one that is at least as good as that which existed previously at Stobhill Hospital.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1656</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Centralisation of Health Services in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the centralisation of health services across Scotland; believes that there must be a clear national strategy for the future structure of the NHS in Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to suspend all planned reorganisations while a national strategy is developed involving the public and health professionals.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Murray Tosh<strong>*</strong>, John Swinburne<strong>*</strong>, Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong>, Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Alex Fergusson<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1655#</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Young Carers in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent report from the Princess Royal Trust for Carers recording the very high number of young people providing care to parents, brothers and sisters and other family members; warmly applauds the young people who give so much of their time, energy and emotion to support their family; pays tribute to the network of projects that provide support for the education, future development and quality of life of young carers in Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should continue to expand support for young carers in Scotland.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1654</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Strathbungo Community and Network Rail&rsquo;s Attack on the Community</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns Network Rail for ordering the cutting down of trees around Moray Place and Darnley Road in Strathbungo on the southside of Glasgow on 6 September 2004; regrets, furthermore, that Network Rail did not inform the residents of its plans; considers that the trees are a vital part of the conservation area and that full consultation with the residents and other interested parties would have enhanced the plan, and is concerned that, not only has the environment, the landscape and the community suffered erosion, but that democracy has also been eroded as the wishes of the people have been ignored at the behest of unelected, unaccountable company bosses.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1653</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>Inverclyde Juvenile Pipe Band</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the members of the Inverclyde Juvenile Pipe Band for a fantastic season when it was crowned Champion of Champions of the Novice Juvenile Grade, won three of the five major competitions of the season: the Scottish Championships, the World Championships and the Cowal Championships, and came second at the remaining two major competitions: the British Championships and the European Championships; notes the hard work and dedication that has been in existence since the band was formed in 1998; further notes that the band has become the Pride of Inverclyde for this year, and extends its best wishes to the band for the 2005 season.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1652</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Clean Up the World</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Clean Up the World environmental campaign supported by the United Nations Environment Programme; recognises that this campaign will see around 40 million people in over 100 countries join together on the Clean up the World Weekend from 17 to 19 September 2004 when communities around the world will work to make their local environment a cleaner, healthier place to live; welcomes the positive impact that these actions will have; regrets, however, that there are no activities currently organised in Scotland, and urges Scottish community organisations to get involved and help to clean up Scotland.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1651</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Segregation in the New Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to strive to ensure that it is an inclusive modern democracy; condemns, therefore, the decision to create separate entrances and eating areas in the new building which segregate MSPs from workers; furthermore believes that this is a backward step given that, in the previous parliament building, all workers, including MSPs, entered and dined together, and is concerned that this will serve to create an unhealthy &quot;them and us&quot; division.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1650#</strong> <strong>National Police Memorial</strong> (lodged on 6 September 2004) Michael Matheson<strong>*</strong>, Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1648#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>In Touch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, further to motion S2M-822 lodged on 27January 2004, notes with concern that &quot;In Touch&quot;, a project based in Galashiels which enables young people between the ages of 16 and 25 to move towards education and employment, which has been continuing on interim funding from Scottish Enterprise Borders and whose funding under the New Futures Fund ceases in March 2005, has failed to secure mainstream funding as advocated by the New Futures Fund Advisory Group and as referred to by the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in his answers to questions S2W-5798 and S2W-5799 on 10 February 2004; expresses concern that it is possible that this project may disappear and will have to be replaced by a new initiative which will have start-up costs resulting in a waste of resources in equipment and staff built up over five years, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should review its position regarding mainstreaming, which is not in this instance delivering funds, to ensure that the valuable work by &quot;In Touch&quot; and other projects under the New Futures Fund continues.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></P>
