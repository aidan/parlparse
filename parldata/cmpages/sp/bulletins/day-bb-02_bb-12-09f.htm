          <p><strong>*S1M-3689</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon: Commissioner for 
            Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill - Stage 1</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Commissioner 
            for Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3688</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: General Agreement 
            on Trade in Services</strong>-That the Parliament calls for an immediate 
            cessation of negotiations on the General Agreement on Trade in Services 
            (GATS); notes the publication of the World Development Movement's 
            report into the implications of the General Agreement on Trade in 
            Services which reveals that ultimate control of key public services, 
            including health and education, has already been signed over to World 
            Trade Organisation lawyers and that broadcasting and postal services 
            are next in line to be locked into irreversible free trade agreements 
            which could see virtually the entire infrastructure of Britain owned 
            and controlled by profit-hungry multi-national companies; also notes 
            the comments of Luton North Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins who slammed the 
            World Trade Organisation's plans as &quot;an attack on democracy itself&quot; 
            and further stated, &quot;How we choose to deliver basic services 
            to citizens and how we decide to regulate the activities of companies 
            are at the core of the duties of a modern democracy. GATS attack the 
            ability of governments to make these decisions and are therefore an 
            attack on democracy itself. Negotiations on this agreement should 
            halt immediately&quot;; agrees wholeheartedly with these sentiments, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to make immediate representation 
            to Her Majesty's Government declaring the Scottish Parliament's support 
            for an immediate cessation of negotiations on the General Agreement 
            on Trade in Services in order to protect democracy and the public 
            services.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3687</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Children's Hospice 
            Association Scotland Hospice at Balloch</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the recommendation to the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs 
            National Park Authority to reject the planning application from the 
            Children's Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS) for a new hospice at 
            Balloch; recognises and applauds the excellent and valuable work undertaken 
            by CHAS for families of terminally-ill children and the pressing need 
            for another hospice to be established; considers the development of 
            the new hospice to be of national significance and notes that any 
            further delay in the planning process will mean that the service will 
            come simply too late for many children; congratulates the many individuals 
            and communities in the Dumbarton constituency and across Scotland 
            who have contributed through their considerable fundraising efforts 
            to making the second hospice a reality, and calls upon the Park Authority, 
            in recognising that the park is there for the enjoyment of all and 
            not to be preserved in aspic, to apply common sense and compassion 
            by supporting the application for a new hospice at Balloch. </p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3686</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Aberdeen Council Housing 
            Debt</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the relatively low level 
            of local authority housing debt in Aberdeen and demands that the Scottish 
            Executive, rather than punishing Aberdeen tenants for deciding to 
            stay under local authority control, take all necessary steps to write 
            off this debt, just as it did with Glasgow's local authority housing 
            debt after the vote for the Executive's preferred stock transfer scheme.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3684</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Heroin and Cannabis</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the shift in policy by Her Majesty's Government 
            on drugs; notes that the Government is now moving towards prescribing 
            heroin on the NHS, instead of criminalising addicts, and reclassifying 
            cannabis as a Class C rather than Class B drug, and notes with regret 
            that the Scottish Executive has no plans to follow suit in respect 
            of heroin prescribing and is therefore likely to allow hundreds more 
            young people in Scotland to die due to drug misuse.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3682</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell: Financial Fitness 
            Team</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Financial Fitness 
            Team (FFT) of Greenock and Inverclyde on the official opening of its 
            new offices; notes the team's excellent work in providing much-needed 
            quality information to local people on a broad range of benefits and 
            employment rights; further notes that the existence of such local 
            services is of the utmost importance, ensuring that those entitled 
            to benefits receive them in full, and further congratulates FFT on 
            successfully securing social inclusion partnership funding and Community 
            Fund monies, allowing a continued service until December 2004.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3681</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: The Draft Proceeds 
            of Crime Act 2002 (Cash Searches: Constables in Scotland: Code of 
            Practice) Order 2002</strong>-That the Justice 2 Committee, in consideration 
            of the draft Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cash Searches: Constables 
            in Scotland: Code of Practice) Order 2002, recommends that the Order

          <p><strong>S1M-3680</strong> <strong>Colin Boyd QC: Salmon and Freshwater 
            Fisheries (Consolidation) (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees that the law which is restated in the Salmon and Freshwater 
            Fisheries (Consolidation) (Scotland) Bill should be restated.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Elish Angiolini</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3679#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Private Rented 
            Housing Sector</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            lack of regulation of the private rented housing sector, despite the 
            capacity of that sector to receive public funding through housing 
            benefit; further notes the stark contrast between the obligations 
            placed on landlords in the social rented sector and landlords in the 
            private rented sector; believes that private sector landlords who 
            are in receipt of public funding should be expected to meet minimum 
            standards and procedures in the way that their properties are managed, 
            in order to protect the rights of private sector tenants and their 
            neighbours and to ensure probity in the distribution of public funds, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should address these serious 
            matters as a matter of priority.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3674</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Raffan: Cairngorms National 
            Park</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the successful establishment 
            of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park; looks forward 
            to the establishment of Scotland's second national park in the Cairngorms; 
            notes that highland Perthshire is a vital part of the coherent natural 
            and cultural identity of the Cairngorms, and believes that the park 
            boundary should include this area, as recommended by Scottish Natural 
            Heritage and supported by the overwhelming majority of respondents 
            to the Scottish Executive's consultation on the draft designation 
            order and by the Rural Development Committee unanimously.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3673</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Majority Decision 
            of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Appeal of R 
            v (1) Her Majesty's Advocate and (2) The Advocate General for Scotland</strong>-That 
            the Parliament expresses its grave concern about the implications 
            for the criminal justice system of the majority decision of the Judicial 
            Committee of the Privy Council in the appeal of<em> R </em>v<em> (1) 
            Her Majesty's Advocate and (2) The Advocate General for Scotland</em>, 
            delivered on 28 November 2002; notes that the appeal arose from an 
            indictment served for trial at the sitting of the High Court at Edinburgh 
            on 2 October 2001 and included charges of indecent behaviour against 
            four young girls including acts on dates when two of the girls were 
            about three years old; notes that, notwithstanding delay in bringing 
            those charges to trial, no submission was made that "R" would not 
            get a fair trial nor was it held that a fair trial was other than 
            still possible; notes the construction placed by the majority of the 
            judges on the application of section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998; 
            believes that the human rights obligation to bring accused persons 
            to trial within a reasonable time might be vindicated by remedies 
            other than dismissal of serious charges without inquiry by a jury; 
            asserts that the right to be brought to trial is comprised in a right 
            to be brought to trial without undue delay and not a right to escape 
            trial because of undue delay and that the moral authority of human 
            rights in the eyes of the public must not be undermined by allowing 
            them to distort existing and sensible protections of our criminal 
            justice system, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to recognise 
            the competing interests of the public and accused persons where a 
            finding is made that there has been unreasonable delay in criminal 
            proceedings and to take all necessary measures to minimise or avoid 
            the draconian effects on the prosecution system of this decision.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Jackie Baillie, Stewart Stevenson, Margaret Jamieson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3672</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Act of Settlement</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recalls motion S1M-117 which it passed unanimously 
            on 16 December 1999, condemning the Act of Settlement 1701 as an unacceptable 
            piece of legislation that institutionalises religious discrimination 
            and prejudice; deeply regrets that, despite an on-going campaign in 
            Scotland and England which has involved MPs of all parties over the 
            last three years, the Prime Minister has yet again refused to introduce 
            legislation at Westminster to repeal the act; condemns the Prime Minister 
            and his government for such intransigence and for their failure to 
            take this action, which would give an example and encouragement to 
            those that highlight the need to reject all manifestations of sectarianism 
            and bigotry, and renews its call for the Act of Settlement 1701 to 
            be repealed as a matter of urgency. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Christine Grahame, Michael Matheson, Irene McGugan</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3669</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Single MMR Vaccines</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates Direct Remedies for providing single 
            mumps, measles and rubella vaccines, thereby offering parents a choice 
            in the treatment of their children which is currently denied them 
            by the Scottish Executive, and believes that, while doubt remains 
            surrounding the 3-in-1 MMR vaccine and its possible link to the diagnosis 
            of autistic spectrum disorders, the Scottish Executive should reconsider 
            its position of denying the single vaccines to children on the NHS, 
            whilst also taking the necessary action to ensure that all possible 
            causes of autistic spectrum disorders are examined in the light of 
            the staggering increase in the incidence of autistic spectrum disorders, 
            previously a rare disease.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3668</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Glasgow Victim

            very real problem of city centre crime; notes that 15% of crime in 
            Glasgow take place in the city centre; welcomes the unique new Victim 
            Support 24 hour drop-in centre to provide practical assistance and 
            emotional support for victims of assault and muggings which opened 
            on 25 November 2002 in Glasgow's Saltmarket, and encourages victims 
            of crime to use the centre, particularly those groups including homeless 
            people, lesbian, gay and bisexual victims and others who tend not 
            to report crimes.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3666#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: London Weighting Allowance 
            and Relocation of Civil Service Posts to Aberdeen</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes recent calls to increase the London weighting allowance 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations 
            to Her Majesty's Government discouraging such a proposal and seeking 
            further dispersal of civil service posts throughout the UK, especially 
            the relocation of the remaining Department of Trade and Industry positions 
            that deal with the oil and gas industry to Aberdeen.</p>

            authority tenants of Aberdeen on their emphatic decision to retain 
            local authority housing in the recent ballot; condemns the waste of 
            resources by Aberdeen City Council in conducting this exercise, despite 
            the previously acknowledged consensus opinion of tenants in favour 
            of the chosen option; calls on the Scottish Executive to abandon its 
            ill-advised policy on large-scale voluntary transfer of council housing 
            stock, and endorses the call for Aberdeen to be given prudential borrowing

          <p> <strong>S1M-3464#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Debt and Lending</strong>-That 
            the Parliament is concerned by the number of households badly affected 
            by debt and by the contribution to debt problems made by banks, retailers 
            issuing credit cards, building societies and money lenders vigorously 
            encouraging people to borrow more money, when they are already heavily 
            in debt or obviously have no means of repaying the loan, and as regulation 
            in this sphere is outwith the powers of the Parliament, believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should address this issue by means of holding 
            discussions with these lending bodies to seek voluntary agreements 
            that they will not advertise or press credit on people that are manifestly 
            not creditworthy and should ask the banks instead to lend money to 
            credit unions for them to lend to people of limited means on the basis 
            of such unions' better assessment of the likelihood of each loan.</p>
