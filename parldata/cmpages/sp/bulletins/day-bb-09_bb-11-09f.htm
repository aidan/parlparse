<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5151</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Young Possil Futures Shortlisted for The People&rsquo;s Millions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Young Possil Futures on being shortlisted to go forward to The People&rsquo;s Millions public vote that will take place on 24 November 2009; notes that the nomination is in respect of the Get Up and Go Activity project that will create opportunities for young people aged between five and 18 to experience and participate in a wide range of outdoor activities and will help to address the issue of territorial boundaries and encourage young people to work as a team, and wishes the project every success.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5150</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(ii) or (iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5149</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Broadband for Rural Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the vital importance of good quality broadband to households and businesses in remote and rural parts of Scotland; is concerned that there is now a two-tier communication system in Scotland that is holding back business growth in rural and remote areas; notes that many rural areas of Scotland are not receiving an improved broadband service, while its cities are continually able to access a faster and better service; further notes that there are a number of telephone exchanges that are full or near to full capacity in Tayside, such as Strathardle, Fern and Menmuir; understands that there are growing concerns about the quality, speed and cost of the Scottish Government-supported Avanti service to remote and rural areas, and urges the Scottish Government to do more to ensure that all parts of the country have access to good quality broadband at affordable rates.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5148</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Concern over the Future of Glencraft</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the fears expressed by the management of Glencraft that Aberdeen City Council may not support its modified business plan, which could result in the Glencraft factory that provides employment for blind and other disabled employees closing; recognises that the organisation has transformed the lives of its employees and has received funding from successive councils for decades; notes with concern that this is the second time in two years that the current administration has threatened to close the factory; notes with regret the current uncertainty faced by employees of Glencraft who are yet again left facing the prospect of closure; notes the efforts of the trade union, Community, which resulted in the factory being saved from closure, and welcomes its determination to do so again; notes that the issue was raised by Anne Begg MP at Prime Minister&rsquo;s Questions on 4 November 2009 during which the Prime Minister affirmed his support for Glencraft and highlighted the importance of helping those most in need of support; notes that an emergency meeting of Glencraft&rsquo;s board of governors has been arranged for 6 November 2009, and urges Aberdeen City Council to work cooperatively with the board or management of Glencraft and Community to secure a sustainable future for Glencraft.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5081#</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Citizens Advice Scotland Debt Findings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the new research findings by Citizens Advice Scotland that set out the barriers and problems faced by vulnerable groups such as lone parents, older people, young people and sick and disabled people in Scotland in relation to debt as well as creditor behaviour; notes that the findings show that four in 10 clients have gone without essentials in order to try to cope with their debt, while one in four clients has borrowed further credit to pay existing debt; notes that two fifths of debt clients reported being pressurised or harassed by their creditors; further notes that two thirds of debt clients said that they would consider going bankrupt in order to manage their debt; believes that schemes such as the Low Income Low Asset (LILA) scheme and the Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS) should be made fully accessible to debtors who are stuck in a cycle of debt and that the &pound;100 fee for accessing the LILA route into bankruptcy should be abolished as only one in five clients said they could unconditionally afford it; further believes that more affordable mainstream credit should be made available to low-income groups; commends the work of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Dumbarton and bureaux across Scotland in providing free, impartial and confidential frontline advice to all who need it, and would welcome the provision of sustained funding for agencies such as Citizens Advice in order to address the growing demand for such advice.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4788#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Sconestone</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the initiation of the First Keeper of the Sconestone, the Reverend Neil Galbraith, and the historic associations that the Sconestone has with the ancient traditions and symbols of Scotland; congratulates Hunter Primary School in East Kilbride on entering into the spirit of the ethos of the stone by creating a kindness tree to mark the day, 4 September 2009, when the school hosted the Sconestone prior to its travels around the globe to promote kindness to others as a value that Scots seek to uphold, and congratulates sculptor Warren MacLeod on his design, inspired by ancient Scottish orbs first used by the Scots&rsquo; earliest ancestors, and the concept of using Scottish symbolism and values to stimulate acts of kindness in people around the world.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4629</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Concern at UCU Report on Education Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses alarm at figures in a report by the University and College Union that state that around 280 jobs are at risk in universities in Scotland; is concerned by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s failure to make higher education a funding priority, thus losing the momentum provided by the investment of the previous administration; notes that around 5,000 students will be affected, with losses hitting the full range of institutions; considers that this is not simply a fight for lecturers&rsquo; jobs but part of a much bigger fight for the Scottish education system and the struggle to widen access for all, particularly the most marginalised groups, and considers that the Scottish Government should now urgently invest in this sector, especially at this time when there is overwhelming evidence that adults faced with redundancy are returning to higher education to facilitate career change.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4629.1</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Concern at UCU Report on Education Cuts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4629) in the name of Elaine Smith, leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes however that UCU has welcomed the 3.6% cash increase and 2.1% real-terms increase in funding for higher education in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s draft budget for 2010-11; further notes that universities&rsquo; share of Scottish Government spend will remain higher under the present administration, at 3.87% compared with 3.73% under the previous administration; while recognising that Scottish universities are autonomous institutions with the freedom to allocate budgets as they choose, believes that this increase in funding will help to assuage fears of job losses in the higher education sector; welcomes UCU&rsquo;s support for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s continuing policy of free education, and agrees with UCU&rsquo;s view that investment in higher education is essential during a recession.&quot;</p>
