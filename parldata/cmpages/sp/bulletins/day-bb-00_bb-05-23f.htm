    birthday in 2002; further notes that the Glasgow Cross Tenants and Residents Association
    are planning activities for the centenary, and expresses its commitment to regenerating
    inner city areas such as Saltmarket to ensure a quality life for local people so that

    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-891#</b> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Projected Costings for the
    Parliament Remaining in Glasgow until 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses its deep
    appreciation of the welcome it has received and the facilities it has been afforded in
    Glasgow, invites the Presiding Officer to launch an immediate investigation into the cost
    of the Parliament remaining in Glasgow until the Holyrood building is finished, and

    consultation with members of the Scottish Parliament, Scottish Executive or relevant
    womens&#146; groups; further notes that Mike Tyson has at no time expressed public remorse
    for the crimes of violence for which he has been convicted, and calls upon the Scottish
    Executive to ensure by whatever means possible, and if necessary by arranging for a
    judicial review to be sought, that the boxing match scheduled for 24 June 2000 at Hampden
    Stadium does not go ahead.</p>

    and agrees that the relevant provisions to achieve this end in the Bill should be

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-887</b> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Race Relations (Amendment) Bill</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament agrees the principles contained in the provisions of the Race Relations

    those provisions relate to matters within the legislative competence of the Scottish
    Parliament or confer functions on the Scottish Ministers. </p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-886</b> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Stevenston Millennium Festival</strong>&#151;That

    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-885#</b> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Car Parking Charges in Fife Hospitals</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament deplores the proposals by Fife Acute Hospitals NHS Trust to introduce car
    parking charges at the Victoria, Queen Margaret and Forth Park hospitals; recognises the
    widespread public anger at this additional burden on sick people, their relatives and
    staff; congratulates the Dunfermline Press and the Fife Free Press group of newspapers
    which have to date collected 20,000 signatures on their petitions opposing the charges,
    and believes that the Trust should abandon these proposals and take positive action to
    restore the confidence of the Fife public.</p>
