    suicide has increased from one in nine to one in four, and for females from one in twenty

    young Scots; recognises that in Scotland the suicide rate for males and females of all age
    groups is 32 and 10 respectively per 100,000 and increasing, whereas in England it is 18
    and 6 per 100,000 and decreasing; believes the reasons for suicide to be complex,
    multi-functional and poorly understood, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to
    commission, at the earliest date possible, wide ranging, comprehensive research into the
    issue of suicide, analysing what makes people take their own lives, why the suicide rate
    in Scotland is increasing, why particular groups in society are more vulnerable than
    others, how other countries prevent suicide, and introducing an early warning system of
    diagnosis and intervention.</p>

    flies in the face of the human rights of the victims of torture under General
