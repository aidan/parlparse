            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">expresses its deep concern regarding 
            the lack of proper facilities within the NHS in Scotland that would 
            allow women with post-natal depression (PND) to continue to care for 
            their children whilst undergoing treatment; recognises that the lack 
            of dedicated mother and baby services for women with PND is completely 
            unacceptable; notes the recent Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
            Network report which detailed the shocking lack of appropriate services 
            for women with PND, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            ensure that NHS boards throughout Scotland take the swiftest possible 
            action to remedy the alarming poverty of provision of mother and baby 
            units devoted to women suffering from PND. </a></p>
