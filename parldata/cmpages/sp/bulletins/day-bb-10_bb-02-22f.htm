                                        <p><strong>* S3M-5758.1 Dr Richard Simpson: Alcohol Pricing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5758) in the name of Kenneth Gibson,   leave out from &quot;implementation&quot; to end and insert &quot;claims by the Scottish Government and echoed by Kenneth Gibson MSP that minimum unit pricing is based on overwhelming evidence runs counter to the comments by the University of Sheffield reporting team leader, Dr Petra Meier, at the Health and Sport Committee on 10 February 2010, who, in likening the case for minimum unit pricing to weather forecasting, acknowledged that the paper, and therefore the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policy, was based entirely on  modelling; considers that Dr Meier has acknowledged that the primary assumption of the Sheffield modelling that heavier drinkers are the most price-sensitive directly contradicts some of the studies cited in the University of Sheffield&rsquo;s own systematic literature review and believes that this calls into further question the asserted benefits arising from minimum unit pricing; notes the alarming findings in the report by the Centre for Economic and Business Research regarding social reference pricing in Canada that there seems to have been a growth in spirits sales in minimum pricing provinces relative to non-minimum pricing provinces and that the Sheffield modelling itself predicts that a 40p minimum price would generate extra revenue of &pound;90 million per year for alcohol retailers, which would dwarf the Scottish Government&rsquo;s current budget for alcohol treatment of &pound;40 million per year; believes that it is unfair for moderate drinkers of modest means to be punished for the irresponsible drinking of a minority particularly if wealthier drinkers are unlikely to be affected at all by a 40p minimum unit price and the predicted drop in consumption by hazardous drinking 18 to 24-year-olds would be only 0.7%, according to the Sheffield modelling; further believes that at the heart of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s arguments is a conflation between the impact of minimum unit pricing and alcohol pricing more generally and, therefore, welcomes the setting up of the alcohol commission under the chairmanship of Emeritus Professor Sally Brown to look at a range of fair and effective options to tackle excessive alcohol consumption in Scotland, including alternative pricing mechanisms, and considers that suggestions that this is tantamount to kicking the issue into touch or a failure to acknowledge the problems caused by excessive alcohol consumption are entirely erroneous and ironic given the longer timescale for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Alcohol etc. (Scotland) Bill and its complete failure to declare its proposed minimum price.&quot;</p>
