            <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Proposed Health Professions Council</strong>—That the 
            Parliament notes that Her Majesty's Government intends to regulate 
            12 health professions as if they were a single profession, including 
            chiropodists/podiatrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, 
            radiographers, dieticians, speech and language therapists, medical 
            laboratory scientific officers, prosthetists and orthotists, orthoptists, 
            arts therapists, clinical scientists and paramedics; further notes 
            that this approach does not take account of the lack of similarity 
            in the qualifications for, and clinical practice of, these professions; 
            believes that there should be parity of treatment for all health professions 
            with self regulation for chiropodists and podiatrists as well as doctors, 
            nurses, midwives, dentists and others; notes that, at the time the 
            enabling legislation passed through the House of Lords, it was stated 
            by Her Majesty’s Government that the Health and Social Care Bill would 
            &quot;provide stronger self-regulation&quot; but that the Department 
            of Health consultation paper gives no details of how uni-profession 
            input will be secured, and suggests that most matters can be dealt 
            with on a multi-professional basis; believes that commitments made 
            at the time the Health and Social Care Bill’s passage through Westminster 
            should be respected; further believes that the proposals ignore devolution 
            and disenfranchise Scotland, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland, 
            by not recognising that each country should have effective national 
            representation from each of the professions to be regulated, and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's 
            Government to work more closely with the Society of Chiropodists and 
            Podiatrists, and other professions concerned, and bring forward new 
            proposals that command greater professional support and will provide 
            better protection for the public.<strong><i> R</i></strong></font></p>

            <strong>Karen Whitefield: Airdrie FC Supporters' Trust</strong>—That the Parliament 
            welcomes the proposal by fans of Airdrieonians Football Club to establish 
            a supporters’ trust; wishes those supporters success in their endeavours, 
            and recognises the important role played by local football teams in 
            nurturing and maintaining a sense of community spirit and pride.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><strong>*S1M-1818</strong> 
            <strong>Mr Jack McConnell: Looked After Children and Adoption Services</strong>—That 
            the Parliament endorses the principles contained in the Adoption and 
            Children Bill concerning restrictions on bringing children into the 
            UK for the purpose of adoption and on advertising children for adoption; 
            agrees that the relevant provisions to achieve these principles in 
            the Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament; recognises the 
            importance of the place of adoption services within the spectrum of 
            care for children and young people looked after by local authorities; 
            agrees that a review of adoption policy and practice is desirable; 
            supports the drive towards more integrated services for the benefits 
            they bring to all children and young people within the care system, 
            and agrees that the Executive should seek to promote the interests 
            of such children with quality educational and other opportunities.</font></p>
