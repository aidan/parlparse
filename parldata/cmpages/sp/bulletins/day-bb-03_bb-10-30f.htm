          <p><strong>*S2M-531</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Evening 
            Express Aberdeen Champions Awards</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the winners of the Evening Express Aberdeen Champions awards, which 
            recognise their immense contributions to North East Scotland society 
            and commends the newspaper for running these awards.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-530</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>New 
            York Crime Success</strong>-That the Parliament notes the publication 
            of the <em>Crime in the United States</em> report by the Federal Bureau 
            of Investigation; congratulates New York City on becoming the safest 
            large city in America as crime has dropped 5% this year to its lowest 
            level since the 1960s; recognises that this impressive record is largely 
            due to the &quot;broken windows&quot; approach adopted which has led 
            to &quot;zero tolerance&quot; neighbourhood policing based on the 
            idea that no act of crime, no matter how small, should be ignored, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to increase the resources available 
            to our overstretched criminal justice system and to learn from the 
            New York experience by introducing directly elected conveners of police 
            boards who would be accountable to their local communities through 
            regular publication of localised crime statistics, based on &quot;Compstat&quot;, 
            and would therefore be able to respond to the public's expressed desire 
            for such &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policing in Scotland, along with 
            a far more visible police presence on our streets.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-529</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Education 
            (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the 
            Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Education (Additional 
            Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-528#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Collateral 
            Damage</strong>-That the Parliament recalls the concerns of Save the 
            Children before the war with Iraq that half the Iraqi population was 
            comprised of children under the age of 14, that 70% of the population 
            lived in towns and cities, that 60% were poor and dependent on food 
            rations, that 11.4% of Iraq children in north Iraq and 23.1% in central 
            and south Iraq were chronically malnourished, that under-five child 
            mortality rates in central and south Iraq had deteriorated by 160% 
            due to sanctions, that Iraqi children were forced to drink water often 
            containing up to 10 times the acceptable level of contamination and 
            that the number of internally displaced persons was, before military 
            action, estimated to be between 700,000 and one million; notes that, 
            against that background, Save the Children was "deeply concerned" 
            at renewed conflict as military action would have serious humanitarian 
            consequences for that nation's vulnerable children; notes that Save 
            the Children's fears have been realised and that since the war the 
            plight of Iraq's children has worsened; notes that it is estimated 
            that there are 120,000 orphans in Iraq, many of whom live on the streets 
            and for whom the coalition provides no support; applauds the actions 
            of Susan Karim who has lived in Scotland since fleeing Saddam Hussein's 
            regime in 1980 and who, from 18 to 29 October 2003 will complete a 
            solo sponsored walk from Dundee to the Scottish Parliament on her 
            &quot;Long Journey to Iraq&quot; to highlight the orphaned children 
            of Iraq and to collect funds for the Almuroge Project in Baghdad, 
            a project requiring £100,000 to re-open a closed orphanage that would 
            provide a home for 1,000 orphans as well as 150 elderly people who 
            have lost all family ties, and therefore considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should follow her individual example by promoting and encouraging, 
            by whatever means at its disposal, humanitarian aid for the displaced 
            children and elderly people of Iraq.</P>

            of deprived inner city areas and addressing social inequality would 
            be assisted by returning the power to raise business rates to local

            from &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the concerns 
            of many that the publication of the <em>Review of Scotland's Cities</em> 
            was a modest response to the challenges facing Scottish cities and 
            that the review neglects the opportunity to address properly important 
            issues of transport infrastructure and finance.&quot;</P>

            from &quot;since&quot; to end and insert &quot;; welcomes the bringing 
            together of a wider range of policy strands; believes, however, that 
            sustainability must lie at the heart of urban policy rather then being 
            an afterthought to economic growth, and urges the Scottish Executive 
            to take forward a policy of urban regeneration that is led primarily 
            by the needs of local communities, rather than by big business.&quot;</P>

          <p><strong>*S2M-526.4</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Building 
            Better Cities - Delivering Growth and Opportunities</strong>-As an 
            amendment to motion (S2M-526) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out 
            from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the cities 
            of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling are 
            vital drivers of economic growth in Scotland and that they, together 
            with Scotland's urban and rural economies, would benefit from a reduction 
            in non-domestic rates, an improvement in transport infrastructure 
            and better public services and further believes these three policies 
            would achieve far more than centrally-directed government-inspired 
            initiatives, strategic plans and visions.&quot;</P>
