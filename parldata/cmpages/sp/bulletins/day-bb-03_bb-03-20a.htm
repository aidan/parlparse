                      <p><strong>S1M-3897</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson:</strong> 
                        <strong>Suicide Emergency Telephone Hotline</strong>&#151;That 
                        the Parliament notes with concern that in 2000 there were 
                        880 reported suicides in Scotland, 676 males and 204 females, 
                        although the true figure could be higher; is conscious 
                        that many thousands of other people attempt to take their 
                        own lives each year; regrets that only a minority of the 
                        population know the telephone number of the Samaritans 
                        or any other organisation they could contact for help 
                        when feeling suicidal; believes that, to assist in achieving 
                        the goal of a 20% reduction in the incidence of suicide 
                        by 2013 set by the Scottish Executive in its <em>National 
                        Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent Suicide in Scotland</em>, 
                        everyone should be made aware of an all-Scotland telephone 
                        number to call for help; acknowledges that in the United 
                        States anyone can call a nationwide toll free number from 
                        anywhere in the country, 1-800-SUICIDE or 911, to ask 
                        for help which is provided swiftly if they say they are 
                        in &#145;suicidal danger&#146;; believes that the Scottish 
                        Executive should set up a suicide prevention crisis hotline, 
                        whereby calls from suicidal individuals are treated as 
                        an emergency, through using the existing 999 emergency 
                        number from which they can be referred directly to a dedicated 
                        suicide prevention 24 hour hotline, and further acknowledges 
                        that the purpose of this line would be to save lives through 
                        dissuading suicidal people from killing themselves and 
                        that the Executive should, once such a line was established, 
                        take steps to let the public know about it. </p>
