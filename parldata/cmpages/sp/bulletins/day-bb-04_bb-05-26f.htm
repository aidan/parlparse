          <p><strong>*S2M-1362</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of 
            the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Committee Substitutes</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees that Tricia Marwick be appointed to replace 
            Brian Adam as the Scottish National Party substitute on the Education 
            Committee.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1361</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Murals 
            at Partick Annexe</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent unveiling 
            of the murals outside the Partick Annexe Healthy Living Centre in 
            Glasgow; further notes that they are the work of over 90 local artists 
            from across the age spectrum, and congratulates all involved in creating 
            the eight individual murals depicting Partick, past and present.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1360</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Salute 
            to the Nursery Nurses</strong>-That the Parliament salutes the struggle 
            of nursery nurses, the majority of whom enter their 13th week of all-out 
            indefinite action; is dismayed by the intransigence and lack of care 
            displayed by COSLA, the individual local authorities and the Scottish 
            Executive, despite the nursery nurses having an obviously just case 
            and the spectre of thousands of children not receiving an education 
            for over three months; believes that nursery nurses have demonstrated 
            great dignity in the pursuit of their campaign, in direct contrast 
            to their employers and the Executive who have treated them with contempt 
            by refusing to use the power and means at their disposal that would 
            have resolved this dispute without the costs incurred by nursery nurses, 
            children and parents, and further believes that the Executive should 
            take immediate steps to ensure that a national pay and grading structure 
            is put in place for nursery nurses.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1359</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Neurological 
            Alliance of Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the launch 
            on 26 May 2004 of the Neurological Alliance of Scotland; notes that 
            an estimated one million people in Scotland live with a neurological 
            condition, a tenth of whom are disabled by that condition; while encouraged 
            by the recent increase in the number of neurologists, deplores the 
            long waiting times to see a specialist and the continuing geographical 
            inconsistencies across Scotland in the provision of neurological services, 
            and supports the alliance's call for a strategic approach to developing 
            services to meet identified neurological needs throughout Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1358</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of 
            the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees the following programme of business-</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1357</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Premier League Deal with Setanta</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with disappointment the decision by the Scottish Premier League to 
            agree an exclusive four-year deal with pay-per-view company, Setanta; 
            believes that this will restrict the ability of ordinary football 
            fans to watch Scotland's most popular spectator sport; considers this 
            to be yet another short-sighted decision by those who run Scottish 
            football, and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations 
            to Her Majesty's Government so that the necessary steps are taken 
            to ensure that there will be live football available on terrestrial 
            television in Scotland once this restrictive deal ends.</P>

            to place on record its abiding gratefulness to those fellow Scots 
            who, some 60 years ago along with their comrades from the allied nations, 
            turned the tide and destroyed the evil of Nazism and fascism in Europe 
            and, in bringing an end to that terrible war, assisted with the new 
            accord within Europe that has eventually, and not without struggle 
            of a different kind, led to the European Union of 25 nations, based 
            upon equality and fraternity that has, as one of its major aims, the 
            elimination of poverty within its member states and elsewhere in the
