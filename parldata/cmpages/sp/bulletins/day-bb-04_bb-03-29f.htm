          <p><strong>*S2M-1112</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Scotland-wide 
            Referenda</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the provision 
            of nutritional, healthy, free school meals for all children, the replacement 
            of the council tax with an income-based alternative and returning 
            rail and bus services to public ownership along with the gas and electricity 
            industries are extremely popular across Scotland and that each of 
            these vital issues should be subject to an individual Scotland-wide 
            referendum as soon as practically possible.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1111#</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Presumption 
            Against Closure of Rural Schools - Code of Guidance</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the continuing anxiety of rural communities across 
            Scotland faced with rural school closures; notes the work of, and 
            reports to, the Education, Culture and Sport Committee in Session 
            1 on rural school closures and its recommendation of 4 July 2000 that 
            national guidelines be revised; regrets that COSLA abandoned its earlier 
            agreement to draw up such a revised code of practice in 2001 by proposing 
            a review of legislation by the Scottish Executive instead, and is 
            of the view that the Executive, having acknowledged in March 2003 
            that COSLA was no longer carrying out this work, should itself, as 
            a matter of priority, produce a revised code of guidance on rural 
            school closures which should have as a central tenet the presumption 
            against closure of rural schools.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1110#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>President 
            of COSLA Should Resign</strong>-That the Parliament has no confidence 
            in the president of COSLA, Pat Watters, and considers that his refusal 
            to negotiate a national pay and careers structure with the nursery 
            nurses' union UNISON has provoked a national strike, now in its fourth 
            week; believes that, as the leader of local authorities in Scotland 
            who deliver the age three to five curriculum, Mr Watters has responsibility 
            for ensuring excellent standards in our pre-five sector for both children 
            and staff, and believes that Mr Watters has failed in this responsibility 
            and should tender his resignation.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1109</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Gynaecology 
            Services in NHS Argyll and Clyde</strong>-That the Parliament is dismayed 
            at the action of NHS Argyll and Clyde in failing to sustain gynaecology 
            services at the Vale of Leven and Inverclyde Royal hospitals; notes 
            that contingency arrangements will be in place from 29 March 2004 
            for all in-patient admissions to be centralised at the Royal Alexandra 
            Hospital (RAH), Paisley; recognises that this will place intolerable 
            pressure on existing services at the RAH and, in turn, will lead to 
            longer waiting lists; further recognises the difficulty for patients 
            north of the river to access services in the RAH due to lack of direct 
            public transport and the cost of that transport; notes that the ambulance 
            service is currently struggling to cope with the additional journeys 
            to the RAH, despite the substantial recent increase in investment; 
            further notes the impact that changes will have on allied services 
            at the Vale of Leven and Inverclyde Royal hospitals, and considers 
            that it is inappropriate to pre-empt the outcome of the clinical strategy 
            review in this way.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1108#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>North 
            East Regional Sports Facilities</strong>-That the Parliament regrets 
            the absence of high standard indoor and outdoor sports facilities 
            in the north east; supports the joint bid from Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire 
            councils with Aberdeen and Robert Gordon universities, other public 
            sector partners and a wide range of sporting clubs and bodies; encourages 
            <strong>sport</strong>scotland and the Scottish Executive to look 
            favourably on this application, and wishes the partners well in progressing 
            the bid.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1107</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Environmental 
            Justice</strong>-That the Parliament notes a new report, <em>Environmental 
            Justice</em>, published by the World Wide Fund For Nature, the Environmental 
            Law Foundation and Leigh, Day and Co, which alarmingly shows that 
            the civil justice system effectively prevents people who are concerned 
            about the environment from going to court and that the criminal justice 
            system fails to provide effective deterrents to environmental and 
            wildlife crimes in England and Wales; further notes that the report 
            surveyed over 50 respondents, including 18 solicitors, 20 barristers 
            and 15 non-governmental organisations, and found that 97% of those 
            interviewed did not think that the civil law system delivered environmental 
            justice, and urges the Scottish Executive to undertake a review of 
            the civil and criminal justice systems in Scotland to ensure that 
            the law properly protects the environment.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1106#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Planned 
            Extension of Dungavel</strong>-That the Parliament notes with<strong> 
            </strong>concern recently announced<strong> </strong>plans to increase 
            the detention capacity at Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre in Lanarkshire; 
            recognises<strong><em> </em></strong>that immigration and asylum policy 
            is a matter reserved to the UK Parliament; considers, however, that 
            the existence and operational record of Dungavel poses a serious threat 
            to the Scottish Executive's record of promoting equality of opportunity 
            and social inclusion for refugees in Scotland and is contradictory 
            to current efforts to encourage fresh talent to come to Scotland; 
            agrees that the detention of innocent children and families is both 
            inhumane and unnecessary; believes that the question of planning permission 
            for the project should be considered carefully, and considers that 
            concerns regarding the detention of asylum seekers in Scotland should 
            be raised with the Home Office.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1105</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to the Young People of Middlefield for their Bus Shelter Artwork</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the young people of Middlefield in Aberdeen 
            for their high quality and innovative bus shelter artwork; notes the 
            involvement of the Whitespace arts development team and PC John Ritchie 
            in supporting and encouraging the activity; further notes that the 
            costs are in line with current replacement screen costs, and commends 
            the initiative to other local authorities for potential roll out across 
            Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1104#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to the University of Edinburgh for Use of Renewable Energy</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the University of Edinburgh for its progressive 
            use of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and photovoltaics as part of 
            the university's energy strategy; welcomes the university's success 
            in winning a grant from the UK Government's Major Photovoltaics (PV) 
            Demonstration Programme; acknowledges the work of former student Andrea 
            Connelly who undertook a feasibility study and established that the 
            College of Science and Engineering campus at King Buildings would 
            be suitable for CHP; understands that the project will cut the university's 
            annual estates costs and free up scarce budgetary resources for other 
            priorities such as fire safety and disabled access; applauds the university 
            for commissioning another CHP system at Pollock Halls of Residence 
            and George Square which will cut carbon dioxide emissions by over 
            2,000 tonnes and reduce running costs by approximately £400,000; further 
            congratulates the university for the use of photovoltaic and passive 
            ventilation which will be incorporated into the construction of the 
            roof and cladding fa&ccedil;ade in the new campus building that will 
            house the School of Engineering and Electronics, and encourages other 
            higher education establishments and the Scottish Executive to endorse, 
            encourage and employ the win-win outcome that renewable technologies 
            provide in urban settings.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1103</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Midnight 
            Football Programme</strong>-That the Parliament commends the Midnight 
            Football programme, funded by the Bank of Scotland and provided by 
            the Scottish Football Association and local police, whereby for two 
            hours on Friday evenings young people in 14 towns in Scotland play 
            football at appropriate centres in organised tournaments with qualified 
            coaches and transport provided, as an alternative to wandering the 
            streets, and suggests that the Scottish Executive should work with 
            the existing partners to ensure that these successful projects are 
            carried on beyond their existing nine weeks and that similar projects 
            are started in other areas as one part of the Executive's measures 
            to provide young people with constructive alternatives to antisocial 
            behaviour.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1102#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Health 
            Inequalities in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the 
            information provided in <em>Health and Well-being Profiles for each 
            Scottish Parliamentary Constituency, 2004</em>; acknowledges the serious 
            and significant health inequalities within Scotland that these reports 
            highlight; recognises the clear correlation between poverty, deprivation 
            and ill-health; believes that the Scottish Executive, in its review 
            of the Arbuthnott formula for health spending, should ensure that 
            health spending more closely matches Scottish deprivation indicators 
            and health need, and further believes that the proposed independent 
            review of local government finance should examine the benefits of 
            an Arbuthnott-like review of the distribution of funding to local 
            authorities to ensure that such funding takes proper account of deprivation.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1101#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Sustaining 
            Agriculture and Sustaining Communities</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that sustaining a viable agricultural sector involves encouraging 
            an increase in employment on Scotland's land and that this would strengthen 
            the contribution of agriculture to the viability of rural communities 
            and contribute to the nutritional health of Scotland.<strong><em>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1100</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Criminal

          <p><strong>S2M-1099</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Road 
            Safety and World Health Day, 7 April 2004</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has designated road 
            safety as the theme of World Health Day 2004 on 7 April 2004; further 
            notes that the WHO has indicated that 1.2 million people die from 
            road traffic injuries each year; notes that the WHO predicts that 
            by 2020 road traffic injuries will be a greater killer globally than 
            malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS and that, despite excellent progress 
            in tackling the problem, Scotland's annual death toll from road traffic 
            remains unacceptably high, and supports World Health Day 2004 and 
            measures to improve road safety in Scotland.</P>

            of the European Union</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the enlargement 
            of the European Union that will see 10 new member states join on 1 
            May 2004; recognises that this provides both challenges and opportunities 
            to Scotland, and encourages the Scottish Executive to promote actively 
            the benefits of enlargement across Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1097</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Man's 
            Inhumanity to Man</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the launch 
            and display of the exhibition &quot;Crying Forever&quot; within the 
            Scottish Parliament as the first step of its tour to parliaments in 
            London, Brussels, Washington and Astana in Kazakhstan; abhors the 
            fact that between 1940 and 1990, 607 nuclear devices were purposefully 
            detonated by the Soviet regime in the Semipalatinsk region of Kazakhstan, 
            equivalent to the size of Wales, intentionally exposing the 1.5 million 
            inhabitants, as guinea pigs, to the equivalent strength of 20,222 
            Hiroshima bombs with disastrous consequences for both the people and 
            the environment alike; notes with horror that within the Semipalatinsk 
            region cancers run at five times the national average and that birth 
            defects are three times the national average, that many women choose 
            not to have children because of the high risk of physical and mental 
            deformity amongst the new born, that many young men are impotent and 
            that suicides amongst the young are common; offers the Parliament's 
            support to the people of Kazakhstan as they struggle to overcome this 
            prime example of man's inhumanity to man, and affirms the importance 
            of democracy in protecting individuals, communities and the precious

            survey and notes that 77% of people in Scotland support a ban on smoking 
            in public places; agrees that both smoking and second-hand smoke are

            in Scotland, disproportionately affecting those that live within the

            will have to work for an extra three days this year, compared to last, 
            solely to pay their taxes before they can work for themselves; further 
            notes that, following the Chancellor's recent budget statement and 
            the consequential increase in government debt, &quot;real&quot; Tax 
            Freedom Day, taking account of taxes and government borrowing, will 
            fall on 11 June, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to reverse 
            this trend to allow taxpayers to keep more of their own money.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1093</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>New 
            Scandinavia/Inverness Air Service</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the new Inverness/Stockholm air service to be run by the Scandinavian 
            airline Snowflake which commences on 29 March 2004; congratulates 
            the staff at Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd on their hard work 
            to negotiate the introduction of this new service using Scottish Executive 
            route development funding; notes that this new service will be an 
            asset to both business and holiday travellers in the Highlands and 
            Sweden, and hopes that this will be the first of many new regular 
            air links between Scandinavia and the Highlands of Scotland.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1092</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Campsie 
            Memorial Hall Premature Closure</strong>-That the Parliament deplores 
            the unexpected, premature closure of the Milton of Campsie Memorial 
            Village Hall in the early hours of 22 March instead of 28 March 2004, 
            when East Dunbartonshire Council, through the application of delegated 
            powers, surreptitiously erected heras fencing; notes that observers 
            witnessed approximately 10 council vehicles with 40 staff on board 
            as well as the Commercial Strategic Director of East Dunbartonshire 
            Council, a police chief inspector and a constable; believes that such 
            people were all likely to be on overtime at immense public cost; further 
            deplores the allegations made by the council that public disorder 
            and illegal occupation of the facility would arise; notes that the 
            council has not yet fully provided alternative arrangements for current 
            hall users resulting in like-for-like facilities being unavailable 
            and requiring a change of day and time for activities, and finally 
            notes that many personal effects were locked away without prior warning 
            to the public to retrieve such items.</P>

            Company (Scotland) on its latest production &quot;Reasons to be Cheerful&quot; 
            which is currently touring the country; believes that it is a good 
            example of the company's radical origins, and supports 7:84 in its

            2005.</P>

            and has received 50,000 calls since its inception; applauds the hard

            primary schools in Midlothian; acknowledges concerns about the short 
            consultation process; recognises that, while the matter of school 
            closure is primarily a subject for local authorities, they must act

            the Education (Scotland) Act 1981 and the Standards in Scotland's

            of rural services to sustainable rural communities and the need to 
            promote rural businesses.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-977#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Nursery 
            Nurses' Pay and Conditions</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            that the job of nursery nurse represents one of the remaining professions 
            characterised by both an almost exclusively female workforce and an 
            overarching legacy of low pay; notes however, that the increased academic 
            and professional demands upon nursery nurses have been consistently 
            recognised by both the Parliament and wider society in recent months; 
            expresses concern that this consensual public recognition has not 
            been reflected in the form of an adequate and timely settlement for 
            those nursery nurses currently jeopardising their own financial security 
            in an attempt to obtain a remuneration package that fairly represents 
            their job and responsibilities; conveys regret that nursery nurses 
            have now voted overwhelmingly for indefinite strike action to begin 
            on 1 March 2004 that will result in widespread disruption to children's 
            education and massive inconvenience for parents; acknowledges that 
            this dispute represents a potential watershed not only for the future 
            of the nursery service and early years education but also for the 
            issue of equal pay in Scotland, and suggests that a possible route 
            to a satisfactory settlement would be a national review of the nursery 
            service followed by a Scotland-wide regrading of the role of nursery 
            nurses.</P>
