marked with a hash symbol (#)</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3490</STRONG> <STRONG>Ms 
Margo MacDonald: Alain Baxter and the IOC</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament condemns 
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for its failure to institute a standard 
of testing methamphetamine in Alain Baxter&#146;s test sample that would have 
shown conclusively that he did not enhance his performance in winning the bronze 
medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics through illegal use of the stimulant d-methamphetamine; 
notes that the nasal spray that caused amphetamine to be registered in his test 
contained l-methamphetamine, acknowledged by Professor Arnold Beckett, formerly 
a member of the IOC medical commission, to be a non-stimulant, would have had 
no effect whatsoever on Alain Baxter&#146;s performance, and therefore urges the 
IOC to reinstate Alain Baxter&#146;s Olympic medal, after complying with the recommendation 
of the Court of Arbitration for Sport in respect of Alain Baxter's appeal, that 
it should revisit its testing process for methamphetamine</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3489#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>John Scott: Increased Workload of GPs Under the Adults with Incapacity 
(Scotland) Act 2000</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the increased workload 
being generated for general practitioners through the additional duties and responsibilities 
being placed on them by provisions under Part 5 of the Adults with Incapacity 
(Scotland) Act 2000 which deals with medical treatment and research; recognises 
the problems this is creating for GPs in treating and caring effectively for patients 
and, in particular, the elderly, and invites the Scottish Executive to consult 
as a matter of urgency with the primary care sector to gauge and monitor the impact 
of these provisions on the workload of GPs, with a view to bringing forward the 
necessary amendments to the Act which will allow GPs to treat their patients in 
a more considered and proper manner.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3487#</STRONG> <STRONG>Pauline 
McNeill: Human Trafficking</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament expresses deep concern 
over international human trafficking for sexual exploitation; notes that Anti-Slavery 
International reports that human trafficking in children and women from Eastern 
Europe, China and Africa is spreading to Scotland through organised crime networks; 
condemns this practice as modern-day slave trade involving abduction, deception, 
blackmail, threats of violence and debt bonding; further notes that this deplorable 
trade forces vulnerable women and children to work as prostitutes for little or 
no money, fearing that co-operating with the authorities could result in reprisals 
against them or their families and deportation; congratulates ECPAT, Anti-Slavery 
International and the National Criminal Intelligence Service, who have investigated, 
tracked and exposed human trafficking; welcomes the UN protocol on human trafficking, 
the draft European Union framework decision on combating trafficking in human 
beings which, when finalised, will compel all member states to incorporate trafficking 
legislation into domestic law within two years, the prohibition of trafficking 
for sexual exploitation in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill, and the 
Scottish Executive's plans to introduce amendments at stage 2 of the Criminal 
Justice (Scotland) Bill in order to make trafficking of human beings both into 
and around Scotland a criminal offence, and believes that the matter should be 
fully debated and that legislative proposals to prohibit trafficking, introduce 
stiffer sentences for trafficking children and make provisions for the care and 
protection of victims of trafficking and their families, should be brought forward 
for its consideration.<STRONG><em> R</em></STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3486#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Duncan McNeil: Mis-selling of Utilities</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
<A NAME="MotionText">notes the proposal of energy regulator, Ofgem, to penalise 
London Electricity for failing to prevent its sales staff from mis-selling products 
to customers; expresses concern over the high-pressure selling tactics employed 
by representatives of certain utility companies; believes that vulnerable members 
of the public are entitled to protection from such practices; seeks clarification 
over what safeguards are currently in place and how these are enforced, and considers 
that the industry, the Scottish Executive and all interested parties should undertake 
a concerted effort to put an end to underhand sales practices and restore public 
confidence in the utilities market.</A></P><P>Supported by: Brian Adam<STRONG>*</STRONG>,
