    cowardice, quitting posts, sleeping at posts, disobedience, striking a superior officer
    and casting away arms; regrets deficiencies in their opportunity to prepare adequate
    defence and appeals; notes the marked and enlightened change in the Army's attitude just
    over a score of years later to the consequences of soldiers enduring long periods of
    severe cold and damp, lack of food and sleep coupled with the stress and shock of constant
    shellfire with the result that not a single solider was executed on these charges
    throughout the six years from 1939-45; considers that the vast majority of the 307
    executed were as patriotic and brave as their million other compatriots who perished in
    the conflict and that their misfortune was brought about due to stress, or the stress of
    their accusers, during battle, and that even if the behaviour of a small minority may have
    fallen below that of the highest standards then time, compassion and justice dictates that
    all of these soldiers should now be treated as victims of the conflict, and urges Her
    Majesty&#146;s Government to recommend a posthumous pardon, thus bringing to a close a
    deeply unhappy and controversial chapter in the history of the Great War.</p>
