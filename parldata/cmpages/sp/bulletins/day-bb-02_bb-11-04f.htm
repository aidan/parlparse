<STRONG>Fiona Hyslop: Friction Dynamex</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
with concern the case of Friction Dynamex in Caernarfon where 87 workers taking 
part in lawful industrial action became the first workers to be dismissed after 
eight weeks of industrial action under provisions introduced by Schedule 5 of 
the Employment Relations Act 1999; further notes that such provisions run counter 
to the intent of articles 5 and 6 of the European Social Charter and of article 
11 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and therefore calls on Her Majesty&#146;s 
Government to amend the Employment Relations Act 1999 to remove the eight week 
limit on protection for striking workers.</P><P>Supported by: Linda Fabiani<STRONG>*</STRONG>,

<STRONG>Robin Harper: Friends of the Earth Scotland - Green Office</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes the publication of Friends of the Earth Scotland&#146;s 
(FoEs) revised Green Office Action Plan, a guide to sustainable office practice; 
notes that FoEs research staff will be on hand in the reception area of the Scottish 
Parliament headquarters on Wednesday 6 November 2002 between 10.00 am and 2.00 
pm to offer advice and guidance on Green Office policy and practice, and welcomes 
Friends of the Earth Scotland&#146;s forthcoming Green Office Exhibition to be 
held at the Dynamic Earth, Edinburgh, on Thursday 7 November 2002.<STRONG><em> 
R</em></STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3530#</STRONG> <STRONG>Michael Russell: Centenary 
of the Scottish National Antartic Expedition</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
congratulates the Royal Scottish Geographical Society for organising a substantial 
and imaginative programme of events to mark the centenary of the Scottish National 
Antarctic Expedition and in honour of its leader, William Spiers Bruce; notes 
that the exact anniversary of the departure of the expedition in the "Scotia&quot; 
from Troon harbour fell on Sunday 2 November 2002 but that the programme to celebrate 
Bruce and the expedition will continue over the next two years and will include 
a major exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland as well as an expedition 
to the Antarctic during this winter, work with the National Youth Orchestra of 
Scotland and the Scottish Country Dance Society and many local and regional events; 
regrets that, despite his international scientific reputation and his passionate 
advocacy of his own country and its potential, the work of William Spiers Bruce 
has been largely ignored in Scotland for the last 100 years and the many achievements 
of his expedition have been forgotten, and considers that the Polar Medal Advisory 
Committee should recommend the posthumous award of the Polar Medal to Dr William 
Spiers Bruce in recognition of his status as one of the key figures in early 20th 
century polar scientific exploration.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3529</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr 
Gil Paterson: Business Bulletin</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament believes that, 
for the purpose of good time management and the ability to keep members fully 
informed in a cost-effective manner, the <em>Business Bulletin</em> that is published 
each Monday should be restored to its former effective condition by containing 
all live motions with a full list of members who have supported each motion.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3528#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Gourock to Dunoon Ferry Route</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament notes with grave concern the events surrounding the provision of the 
Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service from Gourock to Dunoon; further notes that 
the decision by the Scottish Executive to limit the route to a passenger-only 
service removes competition and choice, creates a private monopoly from public 
money, invites a challenge by the Office of Fair Trading which almost inevitably 
will lead to a complaint to the European Commission and ignores the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
own report from Deloitte and Touche in 2000 which warned that the subsidy under 
the Public Service Obligation would have to be nearly five times higher on a passenger-only 
service; is profoundly concerned at the adoption of the catamaran-type vessel, 
the &quot;Ali Cat&quot;, on the route and the serious doubts raised both locally 
and amongst maritime experts with regard to the suitability of such a craft on 
this route; condemns this precipitous action in advance of the conclusion of the 
Scottish Executive&#146;s own consultation on the future of the Caledonian MacBrayne 
network, and believes that an immediate public inquiry into all aspects of this 
decision should be conducted. </P><P>Supported by: Richard Lochhead, Mr Kenneth

Stevenson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3527#</STRONG> <STRONG>Ms Sandra 
White: Community Police</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the extremely 
effective role played by community police officers in combating crime, particularly 
youth crime; notes that such officers are often the most visible and recognisable 
police presence in their communities and recognises the crucial role that they 
play in providing high quality policing and fostering links with the communities 
they serve; regrets that these officers are often removed from their vital community 
role to perform other police duties, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
should encourage community policing and provide the necessary resources to ensure 
the provision of adequate numbers of community police officers.</P><P>Supported 
by: Stewart Stevenson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3526#</STRONG> <STRONG>Marilyn 
Livingstone: Solvent Abuse</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the work 
of the O&#146;Brien family from Fife in setting up the Lee O&#146;Brien Solvent 
Trust (LOST); acknowledges the very real threat to young lives posed by solvent 
abuse; believes that new practical preventative measures are required to control 
sales of lighter refill gas; notes the support of 18 local authorities for the 
actions of the LOST campaign and the thousands of individuals who have signed 
the LOST campaign petition, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take 
measures to increase protection from solvent abuse through education and, where 
necessary, legislation.</P><P>Supported by: Robin Harper<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Helen

McCabe: Misuse of Fireworks</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the good 
work being done by Her Majesty's Government to ensure fireworks are licensed and 
used appropriately; welcomes and supports the national safety campaign &quot;Fool 
with fireworks and bang goes your image&quot;; notes the unacceptable level of 
injuries that occur due to firework misuse; fully appreciates the concern of residents 
and communities throughout Scotland regarding the disturbance that fireworks cause 
to young children, the elderly and pets; further notes the numerous reports of 
retailers breaking the voluntary code of practice on the sale of fireworks, and 
calls on Scottish Ministers to examine, as a matter of urgency, all possible methods 
of halting this disturbing behaviour. </P><P>Supported by: Sarah Boyack<STRONG>*</STRONG>,

<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Press Complaints Commission</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament is concerned at the low standard of journalism in some newspapers 
such as the<em> Daily Record</em>; believes that Scotland needs a Scottish Press 
Complaints Commission to regulate the press in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish 
Executive to discuss with Her Majesty&#146;s Government the possibility of setting 
up such a body with statutory powers to regulate the Scottish press.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3523#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mrs Margaret Ewing: LUPUS UK</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
the success of Lupus Awareness Month in October 2002; recognises the impact lupus 
has on over 5,000 people in Scotland as well as their friends, families and carers; 
congratulates LUPUS UK and its many branches across Scotland on raising awareness 
of the condition, as well as in providing support and advice for those affected, 
and believes that the Scottish Executive should raise public awareness of lupus 
and invest in research into effective treatment of the disease.</P><P>Supported 
by: Stewart Stevenson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3522#</STRONG> <STRONG>Johann 
Lamont: Regulation of Private Security Firms</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes with concern the lack of regulation of private security firms and the potential 
impact of unscrupulous activity by these firms on the safety and peace of mind 
of local communities within Glasgow Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and throughout 
Scotland; further notes the serious danger posed by any activity that undermines 
the confidence of the public in the police's capacity to deal with criminal behaviour 
within communities, and considers that the Scottish Executive, along with local 
authorities, the police and other relevant agencies, should develop as a matter 
of urgency means by which private security firms can be regulated and their activities 
scrutinised.</P><P>Supported by: Brian Fitzpatrick, Tommy Sheridan, Bill Butler<STRONG>*</STRONG>,

MacKay: Condemnation of the Attack on the Edinburgh Synagogue</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament condemns the attack on the Edinburgh Synagogue on Salisbury Road, 
South Edinburgh, on 24 October 2002; expresses its disgust at all manifestations 
of anti-Semitism and other intolerance; notes that, whilst the perpetrators as 
yet remain anonymous, Scotland, like the rest of the UK, has seen a rise in anti-Semitism 
and religious intolerance in the past months and that some extremist political 
groups and individuals have used the tragic situation in the Middle East as justification 
for attacks, verbal and physical, on Scotland&#146;s Jewish and other communities, 
and asserts that the odious creed of anti-Semitism and intolerance runs counter 
to the principles of tolerance, pluralism and respect for all people which are 
the central tenets of a devolved Scotland.</P><P>Supported by: Donald Gorrie,

notes that 3 December 2002 is National Carers Rights Day; recognises the crucial 
role of carers of all ages in supporting the most vulnerable people in society; 
welcomes the support provided to carers through the Community Care and Health 
(Scotland) Act 2002, and considers that the Scottish Executive should continue

<STRONG>S1M-3519</STRONG> <STRONG>Fergus Ewing: Dentistry</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament notes that children&#146;s registration with an NHS dental practice 
expires after a period of 15 months; believes that a child should be registered 
with a dentist until adulthood, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to amend 
the current rules governing registration of children with NHS dentists so that 
registration does not lapse in this way.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3518#</STRONG> <STRONG>Brian 
Fitzpatrick: End Debt on our Doorstep</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament applauds 
the work of the individuals and organisations supporting the Debt on our Doorstep 
campaign in speaking out against poverty, the effects of debt and extortionate 
lending and for fair and affordable finance in Scotland and across the whole of 
the United Kingdom; acknowledges the progress made since Church Action on Poverty's 
Pilgrimage against Poverty in 1999 and the commitments made by Her Majesty's Government 
and the devolved administrations to tackling poverty and social injustice but 
recognises that still too many people in this country continue to struggle with 
the burdens of poverty and debt and are systematically excluded from affordable 
credit and forced into the arms of extortionate lenders; affirms the need for 
greater awareness and support for credit unions and other community finance and 
development initiatives and for high street lenders to more fully honour their 
social responsibility obligations; considers that the Scottish Executive should, 
working together with the other devolved administrations and Her Majesty&#146;s 
Government, make progress on securing tighter regulation of extortionate lending 
and establishing accessible and fair Social Fund arrangements so as to alleviate 
the burdens of debt on poor people and their families, and congratulates the organisers 
of the End Debt on Our Doorstep Lobby and Action Day taking place in Edinburgh 
and London on 3 December 2002 for stimulating public debate and creating fora 
where the voices and needs of folk with direct experience of poverty and debt 
can be heard. </P><P>Supported by: Donald Gorrie, Bill Butler, Scott Barrie</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3513</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Edinburgh Hogmanay "Eurozone"</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament commends the initiative of the Scotland in Europe campaign to have 
Edinburgh designated a temporary &quot;eurozone&quot; during the period of the 
upcoming Hogmanay celebrations, whereby local businesses, shops, hoteliers and 
pubs would be encouraged to accept euros as payment from visitors; notes that 
a similar scheme in the Welsh town of Llangollen during the Eisteddfod this year 
was a great success and of huge benefit both to Llangollen and to Wales as a whole; 
believes that Edinburgh, too, would benefit from a eurozone period through the 
enhanced enjoyment of the festival, the boost to local tourism and the further 
promotion of Edinburgh&#146;s reputation as a great European city, and urges all 
political parties, Edinburgh City Council, local businesses and tourist organisations 
to work together in pursuing the Hogmanay eurozone project to a successful conclusion.</P><P>Supported

<STRONG>Brian Fitzpatrick: Leukaemia Research Fund Campaign</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes that about 24,500 people are diagnosed with leukaemia or 
a related cancer of the blood in the UK every year; further notes that around 
600 children in Britain develop leukaemia or lymphoma every year, accounting for 
about half of all childhood cancers; recognises that survival rates for the most 
common types of childhood leukaemia have risen dramatically, and warmly endorses 
the launch on 30 October 2002 by the Leukaemia Research Fund (LRF) of a major 
fund-raising campaign for a £2.25 million LRF centre to be sited at Gartnavel 
Hospital in Glasgow bringing together cancer scientists, clinicians and patients 
under one roof in order to better facilitate the cross-fertilisation of research 
ideas and to support improved research outcomes, better treatments and increasing 
survival rates.</P><P>Supported by: Donald Gorrie, Sarah Boyack, Bill Butler,

<STRONG>Kate Maclean: Royal National Institute for the Blind Campaign on Photodynamic 
Therapy Treatment</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the Royal National 
Institute of the Blind, Scotland, on its campaign to secure the provision on the 
NHS of the effective Photodynamic Therapy Treatment (PDT) for wet Age-related 
Macular Degeneration; notes that the total cost of this treatment would be an 
estimated £2 million, equating to £6,000 per patient; further notes that the average 
cost of caring for someone who becomes blind is £10,000 per annum; rejects the 
unjustified rationing of the treatment in England and Wales proposed by the National 
Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) which would limit treatment to only the 
second affected eye and only if the second eye retains at least 6/36 acuity; further 
rejects the need to wait until the NICE appeal is completed before the treatment 
is available on the NHS in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to fund forthwith 
PDT treatment by the NHS in Scotland, and believes that it is unacceptable that 
600 elderly Scots who could benefit from the PDT treatment will otherwise unnecessarily 
go blind each year.</P><P>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson, Bill Butler, Alex Neil,

Sheridan: Richard Roberts Knitwear, Ayrshire</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
supports the activities of the trade union at Richard Roberts Knitwear (formerly 
Charnos) in trying to secure important jobs at its factory in Ayrshire and believes 
that a policy of public ownership should be applied to companies which withdraw 
from Scotland, leaving behind misery and unemployment.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3508#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Fergus Ewing: Osteoporosis</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
osteoporosis is a major public health problem which results in more than 20,000 
fractures a year in Scotland, that the cost of osteoporotic fractures in the United 
Kingdom each year is estimated at over £1.7 billion and that one third of women 
and one in 12 men over 50 will suffer an osteoporotic fracture; further notes 
that with an ageing population profile this problem will become even more serious; 
is aware that osteoporosis is both treatable and largely preventable; welcomes 
the fact that the public and health professionals are becoming increasingly aware 
of osteoporosis as a major health problem but is concerned that health service 
provision throughout Scotland is patchy and that access to diagnostic testing 
and monitoring varies around the country; believes that sufficient funding can 
be made available so that all patients have equal access to services for both 
the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and that all patients suffering a 
fragility fracture or having other risk factors for the disease should be assessed 
for the presence of osteoporosis, and further believes that public health campaigns 
should be promoting the importance of lifestyle factors as influencing bone health 
and preventing osteoporosis. </P><P>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson, Michael Matheson,

possible solidarity with the striking Hairmyres Hospital workers.</P><P>Supported

and the Parliament" event being held on Wednesday 6 November 2002, organised by 
the Royal Society of Chemistry in association with Scotland's leading science 
organisations; notes the contribution of Scotland's 40,000 scientists to our economic, 
environmental and social development; further notes that Scotland is a world leader 
in many scientific disciplines; congratulates Scotland's scientists for their 
excellent ratings in the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise; welcomes the Scottish 
Executive's science strategy set out in <em>A Science Strategy for Scotland </em>and 
the efforts to foster an environment which enhances student participation in science, 
to invest in the science infrastructure and equipment of our educational establishments, 
to increase investment in research along with supporting greater industrial research 
and assisting in the practical application of our world-beating research, and 
believes that the Executive should take measures to reverse the downward trend 
and ensure that more students are choosing to study science at higher grade and 
degree level.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone, Shona Robison, Brian Adam, Robin
