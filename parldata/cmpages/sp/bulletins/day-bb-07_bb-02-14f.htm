<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5581</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Workers&rsquo; Rights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Simclar workers and calls for an appropriate redundancy package for them; welcomes the DTI investigation into the circumstances surrounding the closure of the Ayrshire plants; condemns poor employment practices that result in workers being sacked via text messages, video conferences and factory gate notices and denied real and proper consultation and appropriate redundancy payments, illustrated by the recent examples at Simclar Ayrshire, NCR Dundee and Young&rsquo;s in Annan; recognises the need to improve workers&rsquo; rights and the existence of the Trade Union Freedom Bill in the Westminster Parliament last session which attracted cross-party support from 187 MPs and the re-lodged bill in the current term; recognises that this Trade Union Freedom Bill is supported and promoted by most trade unions, including the RMT and TGWU, and agrees to endorse and encourage support throughout Scotland for this necessary bill.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5580</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Bill, debates on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, each time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a division following the first division in the afternoon being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Groups 1 - 4:  25 minutes </p>
  <p>Groups 5 - 8:  45 minutes</p>
  <p>Groups 9 - 12:  1 hour and 10 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5579</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>The Draft Prohibited Procedures on Protected Animals (Exemptions) (Scotland) Regulations 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Environment and Rural Development Committee recommends that the draft Prohibited Procedures on Protected Animals (Exemptions) (Scotland) Regulations 2007 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5578</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Recognition for Kashmiri Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and applauds the struggle of public sector workers in Pakistan-administered Kashmir to force the government to implement promises of compensation for losses suffered during the earthquake; notes that since 6 February 2007 these workers, organised under the Employees Action Committee, have been involved in an indefinite strike; further notes that women workers from the social welfare and education sectors have also joined the strike; condemns the government&rsquo;s decision of 7 February to declare the strike illegal and to issue a &quot;Section 144&quot; on the capital city, Muzaffarabad, which makes any meeting of more than four workers in the street illegal; acknowledges that leading activists in the strike, who are also members of the Trade Union Rights Campaign &ndash; Kashmir, could face severe government repression as a result of their role in the strike; notes that at the time of the October 2005 earthquake the government praised these public sector workers as &quot;heroes&quot; because they saved the lives of thousands and eased the suffering of many more, despite the losses they themselves incurred, and that as a result the federal Pakistan and the Kashmir governments offered to wipe out bank loans taken by workers during that time and also give them a bonus equivalent to three months pay; understands that none of these promises have been implemented and that compensation for damage and destruction of houses has not yet been paid, and is concerned that millions of rupees of earthquake relief funds have disappeared into the pockets of corrupt government officials and army officers who are associated with the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority.</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5573</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Power Meter Madness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the increasing intransigence of Scottish Power, which has thus far refused to end the back charging of token prepayment meter customers despite condemnation by politicians from all parties; expresses concern that the regulator, Ofgem, has taken insufficient action to stop Scottish Power continuing with a practice that pushes its low income consumers into debt through no fault of their own, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry asking him to intervene with Ofgem to ensure that this practice is ended immediately.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5572.1</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Making the NHS Local</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5572) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;congratulates&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that demand for acute services, including accident and emergency, intensive care and independent beds, will not decrease before preventative measures take effect in the context of an increasing elderly and dependent population, persistent socio-economic inequalities and related poor health; further recognises that there is insufficient capacity in the acute sector at present; believes that the future of the NHS is being undermined by government policies designed to fragment, commodify and privatise health care through, for example, open tendering for GP services, local improvement finance trusts (LIFT), joint ventures, the contracting of NHS care at Stracathro to the private sector and PFI, and believes that there needs to be a full needs-based assessment of the capacity the NHS requires to deliver optimum care in acute and community care settings and that reductions in acute provision should be halted until this is achieved and commitment made to deliver the capacity required as locally as possible, that all recent legislation which has opened up the NHS to market forces should be repealed and that the costly and discredited policy of PFI should be abandoned.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5572.2</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Making the NHS Local</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5572) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;the goal of&quot; to end and insert &quot;the delivery of core acute services, such as accident and emergency and maternity services, as locally as possible while also recognising that some specialist services may need to be delivered in larger centres; recognises that &quot;Delivering for Health&quot; provides an opportunity to reverse the trend of further centralisation and keep services local; welcomes the additional investment in primary medical services; supports the new community hospital strategy with its focus on providing local facilities and services appropriate to modern-day demands; welcomes the establishment of the Scottish Centre for Telehealth in Grampian and the approaches it will bring to widening access to specialist services, such as seen in the tele-neurology service in Orkney; commends the shift from hospital-based provision to local access for services such as chemotherapy and dialysis and expects community health partnerships to continue to accelerate such a shift; recognises the benefits of community casualty units which can help to relieve pressure from busy accident and emergency departments; welcomes the continuing development of new staff roles and expertise as a means to carry services closer to patients; supports the community pharmacy minor ailments service as an excellent example of improved local access; supports the increasing focus of NHS Scotland on reducing inequalities between those with the best and worst health; acknowledges the contribution to improving health of services in local communities for people of all ages, from improving children&rsquo;s dental health in Glasgow to promoting walking for health by older people; applauds the world-leading anticipatory care &quot;Keep well&quot; services which tackle coronary heart disease in the most deprived communities, and welcomes the continued development of local community health partnerships as a strong and coherent response to the changing pattern of demand that NHS Scotland will face.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5572.3</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Making the NHS Local</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5572) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;congratulates&quot; to end and insert &quot;however recognises the importance of retaining a sustainable number of acute sector beds and services and recognises continuing public concern over the extent of proposed centralisation of hospital services; congratulates the NHS where it has established innovative approaches to meeting modern day demands such as the use of tele-medicine in Grampian and Orkney and the shift of chemotherapy and dialysis to the local community; recognises the increase in funding for the NHS however notes that despite this substantial increase there are still many issues to address; supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s focus on health promotion and reducing inequalities between those with the best and worst health however believes that patient need would be best met with more purchasing power being placed in the hands of patients and GPs so that their choices determine the development of the service, and also seeks to develop a health service driven by clinical need rather than responding to centrally imposed targets.&quot;</p>
