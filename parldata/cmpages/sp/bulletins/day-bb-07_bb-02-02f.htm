<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5531</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Save the Simclar Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Simclar Group, based in Irvine, to withdraw from hard-tooling manufacturing, resulting in the effective sacking of 200 permanent and 40 temporary workers; recognises that the Simclar Group is one of Scotland&rsquo;s largest family-owned manufacturing concerns and has operations in Dunfermline in Fife and Kilwinning in North Ayrshire, as well as in Mexico, China and the United States of America, with a worldwide workforce of about 2,200; believes that the decision to sack 240 Scottish workers has been taken, as stated by a Simclar spokesperson, due to the &quot;rising cost of production and relentless market pressure&quot; and is a direct result of the failure of New Labour&rsquo;s economic policies; notes that unemployment in this part of Ayrshire is the highest in Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to demand top-level talks with the Simclar Group to convince it to reverse its unacceptable decision, to lobby New Labour in Westminster to bring redundancy payments and other legislation designed to protect workers&rsquo; rights up to at least European-wide standards, to ensure that Simclar uses the statutory 90-day consultation period to try to find suitable alternative employment for its workers in the local area and to do everything in its power to minimise compulsory redundancies and to establish a task force in the local area to support the Simclar workers and regenerate the Ayrshire economy with sustainable long-term manufacturing jobs.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5530</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Friends of the Refugees Ayrshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Friends of the Refugees Ayrshire on its continued work at Dungavel detention centre; notes that Friends of the Refugees Ayrshire has continued to hold vigil and maintain a dignified protest at Dungavel in all conditions to raise awareness of, and bring comfort to, those detained in Dungavel; recognises its work with Positive Action in Housing in helping refugees in this country; acknowledges that the continued presence of Dungavel in Scotland is a source of shame to this country, which has rightly been condemned by organisations such as Amnesty International, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put pressure on the Westminster Government to close Dungavel at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5529</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulation to Jay Saunderson and SCOPE</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Jay Saunderson, a Transport and General Workers&rsquo; Union shop steward from Cumnock who works for Scottish Coal, on his forthcoming fund-raising skiing trip to Colorado to raise money for SCOPE; notes that the trip involves skiing 150,000 vertical feet in five days, which equates to 10 hours of non-stop skiing per day; notes that Jay is one of only three Scots on the trip; wishes Jay all success in his trip to raise money and acknowledges that he is an example of the sort of volunteer that Scotland is proud to produce, and recognises and applauds the vast amount of work that SCOPE undertakes to support individuals with cerebral palsy and their families, as well as raising awareness of the condition.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5528</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>The Budget (Scotland) Act 2006 Amendment Order 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Finance Committee recommends that the Budget (Scotland) Act 2006 Amendment Order 2007 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5527</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>The Draft Transfer of Functions, Property, Rights and Liabilities from the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive to the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority Order 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that the Draft Transfer of Functions, Property, Rights and Liabilities from the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive to the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority Order 2007 be approved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5526</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Re-engage the Kids, Reduce Class Sizes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the recent figures from the Scottish Executive that show school exclusions to have risen by 18% in four years to an average of 226 per day in 2005-06; notes that there are too many children and young people disengaged from the school system; believes that, in order to begin the process of returning these children and young people to engagement with school, it is essential that there is a national standard for class sizes of no more than 20 and, for composite and practical classes, no more than 15, and further believes that alongside this reduction in class sizes it is essential that all school staff have appropriate training and support to meet the additional support needs of all pupils.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5525&diams; </strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Switch Off Energy Debt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the high level of energy debt in Scotland; notes from the most recent figures published by Ofgem that 343,617 customers in Dunfermline and elsewhere owe their energy supplier an average of &pound;181; further notes that energy prices remain high, with Scottish consumers typically paying more than &pound;1,000 per year for their gas and electricity; is concerned that, according to Ofgem, the number of disconnections from energy supply has risen by 285% between September 2005 and September 2006, and believes that all energy suppliers should take urgent action to address the burden of debt on Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable households.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5524</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>RNIB Scotland: Visual Impairment and Learning Disabilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the work done by RNIB Scotland whose research suggests that one in three people with a learning disability will also have a visual impairment; notes that this often goes unrecognised because of individuals&rsquo; inability to communicate their vision deficit, thereby meaning that such individuals are at risk of not being diagnosed and treated; congratulates NHS Ayrshire and Arran on its pilot project which trains and works with 23 optometry practices with support from an RNIB Scotland development worker using RNIB Scotland&rsquo;s vision assessment tool to identify, diagnose and treat such individuals and therefore enhance their quality of life, and believes that similar models should be promoted throughout Scotland to diagnose and treat this vulnerable section of society.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5523#</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe:</strong> <strong>Making our Transport Fit for Purpose</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, recognising that transport is integral to the economic, environmental and social well-being of communities, commends the joint initiative of the Aberdeenshire Environmental Forum and the City of Aberdeen Environmental Forum in organising a public meeting on &quot;Making our Transport System Fit for Purpose&quot; on 1 February 2007 in Aberdeen, to inform and facilitate the debate on the future of transport in the north east; notes that the meeting is being held during the current Nestrans consultation on its proposed regional transport strategy, and, in light of the Stern and Eddington reports, believes it is important that the people of the north east think carefully about making the transport system that serves them fit for purpose in a world in which the threat of climate change has become a factor.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5521*#*</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that people who suffer from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a severe and progressive genetic muscle wasting disease predominantly affecting boys and for which there is currently no cure, are dying in Scotland on average 10 years earlier then their counterparts in England; believes that an improvement in the life expectancy and experiences of these young people must be a priority for the Scottish Executive; considers that, in addition to enhanced medical research, better support services, equipment and adapted housing can make a massive difference to the quality of life of people with DMD and can contribute to extending their life expectancy; welcomes the development in 2003 of the Scottish Muscle Network, based at Yorkhill, as a national managed clinical network benefiting patients in Stirling and across Scotland, but believes that more must be done to improve both life quality and life expectancy for people with DMD in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5519*#*</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Time to Act</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that, despite the many advances made in ending discrimination, removing barriers and creating opportunities for people with disabilities and learning difficulties, the recent tragic accident in Glasgow, where a girl with learning difficulties threw herself in front of a train after reportedly being bullied and treated without due regard to her condition by staff and management at her work, highlights the need to initiate a parliamentary debate into the need for support systems, such as buddy systems which have been highly effective elsewhere, to be introduced in the workplace and for companies to be required to implement specific policies and training to ensure that tragic accidents like this are avoided.</p>
