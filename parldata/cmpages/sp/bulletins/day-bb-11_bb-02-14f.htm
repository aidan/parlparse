<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7937 Sandra White: Women in Employment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Women&rsquo;s Convention for organising the conference, Women in Employment: What&rsquo;s It Worth?, in Glasgow on 5 February 2011; notes that the conference looked at and discussed barriers to women in employment and how to overcome these; welcomes the feedback from the workshops held at the conference, which highlighted the difficulties that women face in this area, and looks forward to equality in the workplace and beyond.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7936 Kenneth Gibson: Motion Encap Arran Triathlon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes this year&rsquo;s Encap Arran Triathlon, which is scheduled to take place on the weekend of 10-11 September 2011; understands that 2,000 people will compete in this event; notes that it will be approximately eight times larger than any triathlon previously held in Scotland; further notes that it will consist of a 1,500 metre open water swim in Lamlash Bay, a 23 mile cycle, with views of some of Scotland&rsquo;s most spectacular scenery, and a six mile run to finish off; considers the establishment of such an event to be a huge boost for local tourism, which will project a positive image of Scotland to the world; further considers that this is an excellent opportunity for people to get involved with and participate in what has been reported as the fastest growing sport in Europe, and wishes the organisers and competitors the best of luck in what it sees as this fantastic event come September.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7935 Brian Adam: Scottish Ferry Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the investment by the Scottish Government in support of the ferry industry; accepts that there must be value for money in delivering publicly funded services; further welcomes the recent report by the University of Glasgow regarding ferry services in Scotland and believes that this is a valuable contribution to the ongoing Scottish Ferries Review by the Scottish Government; notes that the report argued that there is no evidence of services not being run efficiently and that quality standards are high and rising; further notes the report&rsquo;s claims that higher standards would be more easily retained in the context of a larger operator holding the contract for all Clyde, Hebrides and Northern Isles routes and that single operators are unlikely to be able to offer the same degree of quality and safety training to employees at the same cost due to a lack of economies of scale; also notes that the report argues that the private sector is in no better position than the public sector to charter the specialist vessels required to replace ageing ships, and urges the Scottish Government to safeguard the quality of ferry services and current maritime skills by taking all steps in its powers to retain the integrated Clyde and Hebrides ferry network in the public sector.&#8234;</p>
<p>Supported by: Elaine Smith<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-7934 Kenneth Gibson: Children of Alcoholics Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of the forthcoming Children of Alcoholics Week, which in 2011 will take place from 13 to 19 February; believes that this international campaign plays a vital role in raising awareness of the problems faced by children of an alcohol-dependent parent or parents and in letting them know that there is support available; acknowledges the assistance available through calling the National Association for Children of Alcoholics helpline on 0800 358 3456; considers that living in an alcohol-dependent environment can have major implications for the development of a child and can often lead to psychological complications in later life; believes that this week is important and welcomes its rising profile, which now enjoys support from a number of celebrities including Marco Pierre White, Tony Adams and Elle Macpherson, and further believes that this issue affects too many young people and that members should work with the National Association for Children of Alcoholics in tackling it.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7933 Cathy Peattie: Grangemouth Biomass and Air Quality</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes concerns raised at the local impact of large-scale biomass plants such as currently proposed for Grangemouth and three other Scottish sites; notes also the concerns at the sustainability of such plants with regard to transportation, production and the wood and renewables markets; notes that, because of the frequency of breaches of 15-minute mean sulphur dioxide objectives, Grangemouth has been designated as an Air Quality Management Area and considers that any increase in emissions will exacerbate this problem, and is of the view that the Grangemouth, and other large-scale biomass plants, should not proceed without a full investigation of all concerns.</p>

<p>Supported by: Bill Butler, Mary Mulligan, Elaine Smith, Elaine Murray, Cathy Peattie</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7925 Jackie Baillie: Reverse Unfair Cuts to Argyll and Bute</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers the scale of the reduction in the 2011-12 budget of Argyll and Bute Council as the greatest of any local authority in Scotland, a reduction of 4.94% on 2010-11; notes that this is double the average cuts in the settlement for other local authorities; understands that the COSLA leaders meeting on 19 November 2010 had agreed to update the indicators and maintain the existing distribution for Supporting People funding but, due to a miscalculation, the Scottish Government has allocated less funding to Argyll and Bute than it should have received; understands that West Dunbartonshire has been similarly affected, and urges the Scottish Government to reverse cuts to this funding in Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire to protect vital local services.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7912 Bill Wilson: The Bush Torture Indictment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Preliminary Bush Torture Indictment, which could serve as a basis on which to prepare country and plaintiff-specific indictments against George W Bush for condoning the use of torture in the form of waterboarding; notes that, according to international law experts at the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights and the Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, former presidents do not enjoy special immunity under the Convention Against Torture; believes that, as the UK has reportedly used information obtained from this torture, its leaders are also complicit and should face similar indictment, and is of the opinion that it is particularly important for countries claiming to believe in democracy and human rights to ensure that their nationals do not take part in, or condone, torture in any form.</p>
<p>Supported by: Joe FitzPatrick, Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell, Sandra White</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7911 Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell: Cuts to Scottish Refugee Council Advice Budgets</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is seriously concerned by reports that the UK Border Agency (UKBA) proposes to cut advice funding to the Scottish Refugee Council (SRC) by as much as 62%; considers that the people using these services are some of the most vulnerable people in Scotland, often without recourse to any public funds or services; believes that this cut would be inappropriate, and calls on the UKBA to reconsider its current proposals before it damages what is considered the vital work being carried out by the SRC and other agencies working with refugees and asylum seekers.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7903 Kenneth Gibson: Persecution of Afghan Christians</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Karzai regime in Afghanistan for imprisoning and allegedly torturing and threatening to hang disabled Red Cross aid worker and physiotherapist Said Musa for converting from Islam to Christianity; is concerned at what it sees as the increasing intolerance toward and ill treatment of Christians in Afghanistan and the regime&rsquo;s lethal approach to apostasy, and believes it shameful that the Afghan regime appears to rely on Christian troops from western nations to preserve its security while persecuting its own Christian citizens.</p>
