          <p><strong>S2W-9431</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how it will ensure that the increase in air

            Future</em>.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-9432</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how much was spent publicising the Travelline 
            Scotland service in the last financial year and whether this sum is 
            projected to increase in this and future financial years.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-9433</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what proportion of Scotland's CO<SUB>2 </SUB>emissions

          <p><strong>S2W-9434</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive, with reference to the report in <em>Scotland on 
            Sunday</em> on 27 June 2004 relating to the tender and post-tender 
            process followed by the City of Edinburgh Council for the £60 million 
            extension to the Edinburgh International Conference Centre (EICC), 
            (a) what information it has received about the matter, (b) whether 
            the Executive has offered any advice to the council on the matter, 
            (c) whether one bidder was permitted to alter the details of their 
            bid after being named the preferred bidder, whether this procedure 
            is in accordance with procurement law and whether the Executive has 
            offered any advice on this matter and, if not, whether it will now 
            do so, (d) whether one bidder, the Cala-Morrison consortium, was given 
            specific information that other bidders did not receive, namely, that 
            the council had agreed to rent the offices being built next to the 
            EICC on a 20-year lease at £5.4 million a year, (e) whether providing 
            information to one bidder and not other bidders is a breach of the 
            rules and law governing the tender process, (f) what its position 
            is on whether the council should invite all parties to resubmit their 
            offers and what the reasons are for its position on the matter, (g) 
            whether legal responsibility on such matters lies with the council 
            and, if so, whether any extra costs that may result from, for example, 
            any legal action in respect of any breach of the tender process, should 
            be solely the responsibility of the council and not the Executive, 
            (h) whether it will intervene in respect of this matter, (i) whether 
            the Executive is in regular contact with the council in a similar 
            manner to its regular contact with Her Majesty's Government, (j) whether 
            the Executive is concerned that a director of one of the property 
            developers quoted in the report stated that &quot;None of the other 
            bidders got to consider the deal with a pre-let to the council&quot;, 
            (k) whether the Executive considers that one bidder has been preferred 
            in the tender process, (l) whether, in relation to the Executive's 
            tendering process, all bidders must be treated equally and, in particular, 
            post-tender negotiations must not, in accordance with HM Treasury 
            guidance, be treated preferentially, (m) whether it will now order, 
            or recommend, an investigation into the matter and, if so, by whom 
            such an investigation should be carried out and whether, pending the 
            outcome of such an investigation, the tender process should be the 
            subject of intervention in order to protect the rights of all parties 
            who submitted a tender, (n) whether rival bidders to Cala-Morrison 
            were informed that Cala-Morrison's bid was not &quot;commercially 
            viable&quot; in its original draft and whether the council indicated 
            that the office should be taken by the council on a 20-year lease 
            on terms communicated to Cala-Morrison, but not to rival bidders, 
            (o) whether the Executive has referred the circumstances of the matter 
            to the Auditor General for Scotland and, if no such referral has been 
            made, whether it will now be made, (p) whether the council has referred 
            the matter to the Auditor General and, if no such referral has been 
            made, whether the council will now refer the matter and (q) what action 
            the Executive will now take in relation to this issue.</P>
