<STRONG>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Gourock to Dunoon Ferry Route</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament notes with grave concern the events surrounding the provision of the 
Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service from Gourock to Dunoon; further notes that 
the decision by the Scottish Executive to limit the route to a passenger-only 
service removes competition and choice, creates a private monopoly from public 
money, invites a challenge by the Office of Fair Trading which almost inevitably 
will lead to a complaint to the European Commission and ignores the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
own report from Deloitte and Touche in 2000 which warned that the subsidy under 
the Public Service Obligation would have to be nearly five times higher on a passenger-only 
service; is profoundly concerned at the adoption of the catamaran-type vessel, 
the &quot;Ali Cat&quot;, on the route and the serious doubts raised both locally 
and amongst maritime experts with regard to the suitability of such a craft on 
this route; condemns this precipitous action in advance of the conclusion of the 
Scottish Executive&#146;s own consultation on the future of the Caledonian MacBrayne 
network, and believes that an immediate public inquiry into all aspects of this 
decision should be conducted. </P><P>Supported by: Richard Lochhead<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Mr Kenneth Gibson<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Ms Sandra White<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mr Kenny 
MacAskill<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Fiona Hyslop<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Irene McGugan<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3527#</STRONG> <STRONG>Ms Sandra White: Community Police</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament recognises the extremely effective role played by community police 
officers in combating crime, particularly youth crime; notes that such officers 
are often the most visible and recognisable police presence in their communities 
and recognises the crucial role that they play in providing high quality policing 
and fostering links with the communities they serve; regrets that these officers 
are often removed from their vital community role to perform other police duties, 
and believes that the Scottish Executive should encourage community policing and 
provide the necessary resources to ensure the provision of adequate numbers of 
community police officers.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3526#</STRONG> <STRONG>Marilyn Livingstone: 
Solvent Abuse</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the work of the O&#146;Brien 
family from Fife in setting up the Lee O&#146;Brien Solvent Trust (LOST); acknowledges 
the very real threat to young lives posed by solvent abuse; believes that new 
practical preventative measures are required to control sales of lighter refill 
gas; notes the support of 18 local authorities for the actions of the LOST campaign 
and the thousands of individuals who have signed the LOST campaign petition, and 
considers that the Scottish Executive should take measures to increase protection 
from solvent abuse through education and, where necessary, legislation.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3525</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Tom McCabe: Misuse of Fireworks</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
the good work being done by Her Majesty's Government to ensure fireworks are licensed 
and used appropriately; welcomes and supports the national safety campaign &quot;Fool 
with fireworks and bang goes your image&quot;; notes the unacceptable level of 
injuries that occur due to firework misuse; fully appreciates the concern of residents 
and communities throughout Scotland regarding the disturbance that fireworks cause 
to young children, the elderly and pets; further notes the numerous reports of 
retailers breaking the voluntary code of practice on the sale of fireworks, and 
calls on Scottish Ministers to examine, as a matter of urgency, all possible methods 
of halting this disturbing behaviour. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3524</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy 
Sheridan: Scottish Press Complaints Commission</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
is concerned at the low standard of journalism in some newspapers such as the<em> 
Daily Record</em>; believes that Scotland needs a Scottish Press Complaints Commission 
to regulate the press in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to discuss 
with Her Majesty&#146;s Government the possibility of setting up such a body with 
statutory powers to regulate the Scottish press.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3523#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mrs Margaret Ewing: LUPUS UK</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
the success of Lupus Awareness Month in October 2002; recognises the impact lupus 
has on over 5,000 people in Scotland as well as their friends, families and carers; 
congratulates LUPUS UK and its many branches across Scotland on raising awareness 
of the condition, as well as in providing support and advice for those affected, 
and believes that the Scottish Executive should raise public awareness of lupus 
and invest in research into effective treatment of the disease.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3522#
