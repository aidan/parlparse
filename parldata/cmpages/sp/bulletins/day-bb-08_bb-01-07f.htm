<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1095</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Portencross Castle</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Friends of Portencross Castle (FOPC), North Ayrshire, for their hard work, persistence and dedication in restoring this fine 14th century edifice; notes the strong historic connections between the Stewart monarchs and Portencross Castle, where a charter to bring the Western Isles, Mull and much of the west coast into the Scottish realm was signed in 1372; is aware that a ship of the Spanish Armada was wrecked off the castle in 1588; recognises that, although Portencross Castle was abandoned in the 17th century, it remains a remarkably intact, if neglected, medieval building of national, historic significance; commends the FOPC for securing the title to Portencross Castle in 2005 after seven years of painstaking work and negotiation along with a &pound;50,000 grant from British Nuclear Fuels; congratulates the FOPC on obtaining a &pound;510,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and acknowledges that an application to Historic Scotland for &pound;400,000 has also been accepted, and believes that, by raising &pound;55,000 themselves and continuing their fundraising efforts, the FOPC have proven their sustained commitment to renovating Portencross Castle and establishing a publicly oriented trust that will allow people to access and enjoy the beauty of Portencross Castle in perpetuity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1094&diams; </strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Children in Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern about the 1.4 million children in Britain currently living in poverty, including in central Scotland, despite the fact that at least one of their parents is in work, as highlighted in the Institute for Public Policy Research report, <em>Working out of poverty: A study of the low paid and the working poor</em>, and notes that the report also highlights difficulties over the implementation and effectiveness of the National Minimum Wage.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1093</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Energy Sector Social Tariffs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that the rise in cost of wholesale supplies to the energy market will result in large increases in domestic prices, which will place an unacceptable burden on the poorest and most vulnerable members of society, and believes that the forthcoming UK Energy Bill should include provision to commit energy companies to introducing social tariffs to protect people who are concerned that they will be unable to heat their homes.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1092</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>US Congress Scottish Literature Classification</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the US Library of Congress to reverse its decision to reclassify Scottish literature as a subsection of English literature, so as to avoid the confusion of such authors as Burns, Scott and Stevenson being classified as English authors.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1091</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Small Babies, Short Changed?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that in Scotland the number of babies born prematurely, before 37 weeks gestation, has remained fairly constant at between 6,424 and 6,880 over the last seven years; is aware that roughly one in eight of all babies are born prematurely and admitted to specialised baby units each year; commends the superb work and high level of care undertaken by medical and auxiliary staff in neonatal units; is nevertheless concerned that neonatal units are increasingly working in excess of their recommended capacity and with far too few specialised nursing staff; recognises that this vital service requires additional resources to ensure that neonatal units are staffed to provide appropriate levels of expert care; urges the Scottish Government to ensure that NHS boards are able to meet the standards set by the British Association of Perinatal Medicine in 2001 and further reduce mortality levels among premature babies, particularly very premature babies born before 28 weeks gestation; believes that babies should have the same one-to-one staffing levels in intensive care that adults receive; agrees that the various disciplines connected to maternity care must forge closer relationships and more clearly identify mothers at risk of having premature babies in order to provide them with earlier and clearer information about neonatal care services available, and welcomes the recommendations of BLISS, the premature baby charity, on how to tackle the main challenges facing neonatal care.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1090</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Scottish Parliament Nominated as &quot;Arms Control Person of the Year&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes with gratitude its nomination as Arms Control Person of the Year by the Arms Control Association in Washington DC; notes that the wording of the nomination states that the Scottish Parliament has been nominated for its 14 June 2007 vote in opposition to the UK Government&rsquo;s replacement of the Trident nuclear-armed submarine system, and, notwithstanding the rare honour of the Parliament being regarded as a &quot;person&quot;, encourages all to visit http://survey.armscontrol.org/index.php?sid=5, the Arms Control Association website, where a full list of nominees may be viewed, to vote for the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1089</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Save the Albatross</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the campaign by the RSPB, BirdLife International and a host of partner organisations worldwide to save the 100,000 albatrosses killed each year by swallowing baited hooks used by longline fishing boats; notes that 19 of the world&rsquo;s 22 albatross species are being driven to extinction through being killed in this cruel and unnecessary way, with three species critically endangered and Amsterdam Albatross numbers already having plummeted to 17 breeding pairs worldwide; is aware that the low reproductive rate of these majestic creatures makes albatross population recovery difficult and accentuates their vulnerability; commends the work of the Albatross Task Force in helping longline fishermen introduce albatross-friendly ways of working; recognises the progress made by the campaign to date, and wishes it continued and growing success.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1088</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Phil O&rsquo;Donnell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its sadness and shock at the sudden death of Phil O&rsquo;Donnell, captain of Motherwell Football Club, on Saturday 29 December 2007; pays tribute to his record as a true ambassador for football, both on and off the pitch, and sends its sincere condolences to his family and to Motherwell FC at this time.</p>

<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1086</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>End Edinburgh&rsquo;s Housing Debt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the chronic shortage of affordable housing in Edinburgh as illustrated by the recent 1,024 applications to rent a two-bedroom property in Drumbrae; notes that there have been 134,297 homes lost from the social rented sector in Scotland through the right to buy in the last 10 years and welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s plans to encourage and safeguard new social housing; believes that the &pound;280 million housing debt faced by the City of Edinburgh Council acts as a significant impediment to investment in affordable housing; notes that the UK Government&rsquo;s offer to write off Edinburgh&rsquo;s housing debt was withdrawn when tenants voted against stock transfer in 2005; further notes that the &pound;57 billion made available by HM Treasury to Northern Rock could have written off Edinburgh&rsquo;s housing debt 200 times over, and calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer finally to end this inequity for Edinburgh, write off the debt, help alleviate the shortage of housing and improve growth in Scotland&rsquo;s capital.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1085</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>MUMS Knows Best</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Linda MacDonald from charity Malawi Underprivileged Mothers (MUMS) for raising &pound;125,000 towards new equipment for Bottom Maternity Hospital in Lilongwe through selling her African cookbook for the second year in a row.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1083</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Brick by Brick: A Tenancy Deposit Scheme for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the latest National Union of Students Scotland&rsquo;s report, <em>Brick by Brick: the state of student housing in Scotland 2007</em>, which draws attention to the one-third of Scottish students who lose their deposits on leaving private accommodation; notes that many students, who may rely on the return of this deposit to pay upfront rent for their next property, believe that their deposits have been withheld unfairly and expresses concern that the withholding of deposits unfairly can lead to hardship and ultimately homelessness; further notes the tenancy deposit protection scheme in operation in England and Wales which ensures protection for both landlords and students, and calls on the Scottish Government to engage with NUS Scotland with a view to implementing a similar scheme for Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1082</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Moorpark Youth Centre Healthy Eating Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Moorpark Youth Centre in Renfrew on its year-long healthy eating project; notes that the project involved between 60 and 100 young people between the ages of eight and 16, providing them with information about, and practical experience in, producing healthy alternatives for snacks and beverages, and further notes that the hard work invested in increasing the awareness of the importance of healthy eating among the young participants will be more than justified by the lifelong benefits that should result.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1044</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Health and Social Care Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the UK Health and Social Care Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 15 November 2007, which legislate in devolved areas in respect of provisions relating to the regulation of the healthcare professions should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-858#</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Government Powers to Ensure Terrestrial Broadcast of Sport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses displeasure about the ongoing lack of access for viewers in Ochil and across Scotland to the fixtures of the Scotland men&rsquo;s football team on terrestrial television, in particular the Scotland v Italy fixture scheduled for 17 November 2007; criticises the BBC for again scheduling in all parts of the United Kingdom the live England match on 21 November instead; notes that within the framework of the EU broadcasting directive (89/552/EC) the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport designates sporting events into three categories, corresponding to those which must be broadcast on terrestrial television (A), those for which highlights must be broadcast on terrestrial television (B) and the remainder for which no such requirements exist; further notes that the FIFA World Cup finals and UEFA European Championship finals come under category A while the qualifying matches for these tournaments do not even come under category B; observes that other countries such as Germany require that all national men&rsquo;s football team matches be made available under corresponding regulations; believes that all competitive participation in international men&rsquo;s football by Scotland should be made available to terrestrial broadcasters under these regulations, and considers that powers over broadcasting should be transferred to the Scottish Parliament so that the Scottish Government can take such action.</p>
