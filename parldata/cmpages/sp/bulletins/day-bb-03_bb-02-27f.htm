Russell: Death of Fred MacAulay/Fred MhicAmhlaidh</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
records with sadness the death of Fred MacAulay who as a broadcaster and broadcasting 
manager fought to maintain and expand the position of the Gaelic language in the 
Scottish media and in Scottish life, whose efforts over many years resulted in 
a huge expansion of Gaelic radio and television compared to the service as it 
was when he first became involved and whose wit, scholarship, enthusiasm and dedication 
to his own people, his language and his culture have acted; and will act, as a 
spur to many others and commends his example of courage and determination to all 
those who presently work for the language and its future.</P><P><EM> The member 
has provided the following translation:</EM></P><P>Gu bheil a&#146; Ph&agrave;rlamaid

gu bheil na h-oidhirpean aige thar iomadh bliadhna air leudachadh m&ograve;r adhbharachadh 
ann an r&egrave;idio agus telebhisean G&agrave;idhlig an coimeas ri mar a bha

Accommodation at Erskine Hospital</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament condemns the 
withdrawal of rent-free status for those war pensioners living in the grounds 
of Erskine Hospital and considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate 
the financial circumstances that have led to the withdrawal of their rent-free 
accommodation with a view to reinstating this concession in recognition of the 
heroism and sacrifice of these former soldiers.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3964#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Kenneth Macintosh: No Smoking Day 2003</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes that No Smoking Day will take place on 12 March 2003; recognises that tobacco 
is responsible for more than one in every five deaths and is the single biggest 
preventable cause of death in Scotland; further notes the evidence that people 
consistently underestimate the health impacts of both smoking and passive smoking; 
recognises that the introduction of restrictions on smoking in the workplace is 
effective in motivating smokers to quit; acknowledges that cutting smoking rates 
in Scotland will reduce the high incidence of cancer and heart disease caused 
by smoking and passive smoking; supports the work done by agencies who campaign 
against tobacco in Scotland and the UK; applauds the work of health professionals 
in helping smokers to give up, and congratulates the 120,000 Scots who are expected 
to make a quit attempt on No Smoking Day 2003.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3962</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Rhoda Grant: Arjo Wiggins Development of Heat and Power Generator</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes the safeguarding of the jobs of 175 employees at Arjo 
Wiggins, Lochaber, with the allocation of a £5 million grant from the Department 
of Trade and Industry and the New Opportunities Fund under the Bio-Energy Capital 
Grant Scheme to build a combined heat and power generator; congratulates the company 
on its visionary plans to build such a generator that will make its plant energy 
self-sufficient; notes that the generator will require 106,000 tonnes of wood 
fuel each year, and further notes the positive knock-on impact that this development 
will have on the forestry industry in Scotland.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3961#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Jackie Baillie: Reform of Charity Law</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
shares the Scottish Executive's commitment to progressing the reform of charity

and welcomes the Executive's commitment to keep the need for such legislation 
under review.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3960</STRONG> <STRONG>Michael Russell: 700th 
Anniversary of the Battle of Roslin</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament remembers, 
on the 700th anniversary of their sacrifice, those who died on both sides at the 
Battle of Roslin on 24 February 1303; notes that what has been called Scotland&#146;s 
forgotten battle was of enormous significance in the process of defending and 
then firmly establishing the independence of Scotland at a crucial time in its 
history, and commends the efforts of those who are endeavouring to ensure that 
the significance of the Battle of Roslin is at last understood and that the event 
is properly commemorated.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3958</STRONG> <STRONG>Ross Finnie:
