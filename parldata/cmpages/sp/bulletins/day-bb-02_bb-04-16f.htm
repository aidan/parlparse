            the first report of the Housing Improvement Task Force <em>Issues 
            in Improving Quality in Private Housing</em> as an important step 
            in meeting the Scottish Executive's commitment, as set out in <em>Working 
            Together for Scotland: A Programme for Government</em>, to address 
            the significant problems of housing quality in the private sector 
            stock.</p>

            has played in inspiring swimmers like Kirsty Balfour and Gregor Tait 
            from the City of Edinburgh Club to win British championships, thus 
            enhancing the current improvement in the standard of Scottish swimming. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2980</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: World Curling 
            Championships 2002</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the

            Anne Laird, Edith Louden and their coach, Isobel Hannen, for their 
            superb ambassadorial work for their country and sport. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2979#</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Partick Thistle 
            FC</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the management, staff, 
            players and supporters of Partick Thistle FC whose tremendous efforts 
            over the last five years have brought the club back from the verge 
            of extinction and who have seen these efforts result in the club being 
            promoted for the second time in two years, achieving once again the 
            status of a Premier League side and reaching the semi-final of the 
            Scottish Cup, thus ensuring that this well-loved Glasgow institution, 
            which has contributed so much, over many years, has regained its natural 
            place at the top level of Scottish football.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2978#</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Social Workers</strong>-That 
            the Parliament appreciates the positive difference that social work 
            services make to the lives of the people of Scotland; recognises the 
            increasingly difficult and complex role that social workers play; 
            further recognises the current serious problem in recruiting and retaining 
            social workers in Scotland, particularly within certain specialisms; 
            acknowledges the need to challenge the often negative perception of 
            social work and to attract more people into the profession; believes 
            in the importance of high quality generic social work training at 
            undergraduate level with the opportunity for post-graduate specialisation, 
            and further believes that the social work qualification should be 
            upgraded.</p>

            - 1856)</strong>-That the Parliament notes the bicentenary of one 
            of Scotland's greatest 19th<sup> </sup>century &quot;lads o' pairts&quot;, 
            the geologist and writer, Hugh Miller; further notes that his fossil 
            collection of over 6,000 specimens became the founding core of what 
            is today's Scottish national collection in the Royal Scottish Museum 
            in Edinburgh and that his books, such as <em>The Old Red Sandstone, 
            The Cruise of the Betsey, Testimony of the Rocks, Scenes and Legends 
            of the North of Scotland</em> and his autobiography <em>My Schools 
            and Schoolmasters</em> became best-sellers in many editions, and sends 
            good wishes to all events and celebrations in his honour taking place 
            throughout Scotland this year and, in particular, to Hugh Miller's 
            Cottage, his birthplace in Cromarty, cared for by the National Trust 
            for Scotland on behalf of the nation and to the community of Cromarty 
            for its many celebratory events.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2976#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie: The Forth and 
            Clyde and Union Canals</strong>-That the Parliament notes the successful 
            reopening of the Forth and Clyde Canal; further notes that the reopening 
            of the canal has given the communities on its banks a major boost; 
            looks forward to the next step in this project which, on 24 May 2002, 
            sees the opening of the Falkirk Wheel and the resulting link between 
            the Forth and Clyde Canal and the Union Canal; congratulates the board 
            of British Waterways, the Forth and Clyde Canal Society, the Scottish 
            Inland Waterways Association, Scottish Enterprise, North Lanarkshire 
            Council, Falkirk Council, Glasgow City Council, the City of Edinburgh 
            Council, West Lothian Council, East Dunbartonshire Council and West 
            Dunbartonshire Council on working in partnership in order to make 
            this ambitious project a reality, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should work together with VisitScotland and Scottish Enterprise in 
            order to maximise the benefits of this project for the local economies, 
            especially local tourism. </p>
