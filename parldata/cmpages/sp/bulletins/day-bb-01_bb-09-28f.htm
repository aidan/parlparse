          <p><strong>*S1M-2264#</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: No Confidence 
            in the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) is reporting 
            a £17 million underspend at a time when the Victorian practice of 
            slopping out continues and five out of its prisons are overcrowded; 
            further notes the recent resignations from senior management positions; 
            recognises that morale among SPS staff is at rock bottom as a result 
            of (a) the deterioration of industrial relations, (b) the continued 
            threat of further privatisation within the SPS and (c) the culture 
            of secrecy within the service; expresses no confidence in the Chief 
            Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, and believes that the Minister 
            for Justice should intervene in and resolve an apparently rapidly 
            deteriorating situation.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2263</strong> <strong>Kate MacLean: Guide Dog Week, 
            1-7 October 2001</strong>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges the 
            contribution which guide dogs make to the lives of blind and partially-sighted 
            people throughout Scotland; urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
            Body to continue in its endeavours to make both its interim accommodation 
            and the Holyrood building as guide dog friendly as possible; commends 
            the current agreement between The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association 
            and the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland on guide 
            dog access to premises serving food, and joins with the Equal Opportunities 
            Committee in accordance with its resolution of 18 September 2001, 
            in endorsing the concept of a voluntary code of practice throughout 
            Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2262</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Nursing Shortages</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the nursing shortages in Scotland; notes 
            the extensive use of agency nurses, and believes that the provision 
            of free return-to-practice courses for the estimated 10,000 registered 
            nurses in Scotland who do not nurse currently would make a valuable 
            contribution to the situation.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2261</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Shellfish Farming</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the vital role which 
            shellfish farming plays in Scotland&#146;s rural economy and the valuable 
            contribution its exports make; is concerned that the lack of insurance 
            cover for closure due to biotoxin events seriously undermines investor 
            confidence, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to work with 
            the shellfish industry in order to produce such an insurance scheme 
            or other suitable support.</p>
