<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4189</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Migration and Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the Equality and Human Rights Commission conference that took place in Edinburgh on 13 May 2009, which highlighted the importance of migration to Scotland and called for potential consideration and research into adapting immigration control to a Scottish context; notes that Scotland&rsquo;s long-term GDP growth performance is closely affected by population trends and that, in comparison to the rest of the United Kingdom, Scotland has seen a population decline between 1995 and 2001, with considerably fewer people aged 14 and under and an increased number over the age of 65; further notes that the UK as a whole does not suffer from a population shortfall and benefits from a considerably larger migrant population; observes that the UK Minister of State for Borders and Immigration announced that Labour will not allow the UK&rsquo;s population to rise above 70 million; believes that both the UK Government and the Conservative party immigration policies are in stark contrast with Scotland&rsquo;s economic and demographic needs and that these policies could damage Scotland&rsquo;s long-term economy, and considers that devolving certain aspects of immigration control to the Scottish Parliament would address the distinct immigration needs of Scotland in order to achieve a long-term economically viable and sustainable country.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4188</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Student Hardship</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls for a cross-party approach on tackling hardship among the poorest students in Scotland; believes that students have been severely let down by the SNP&rsquo;s broken promises, actions and inaction in power; further believes that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning&rsquo;s efforts have been misplaced in focussing solely on reducing graduate debt rather than student hardship while student demand for hardship and childcare funds increases, commercial borrowing among students continues and student support levels in Scotland fall far behind the rest of the United Kingdom; notes the open letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning signed by NUS, the main opposition parties and student leaders across Scotland calling for the Scottish Government to increase levels of student support through increased loans and for a new direction from the Scottish Government; further notes that on the 12 March 2009, through motion S3M-3675 as amended, the Parliament rejected all of the proposals contained in the <em>Supporting a Smarter Scotland </em>consultation, which closed in April 2009, for not adequately addressing student hardship, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the main opposition parties on their joint approach to tackling student hardship by using the available resources to provide &pound;7,000 in support for the poorest students, a &pound;500 increase in grant for the poorest students, an increase in support of &pound;200 for all students through the non-means-tested loan and almost &pound;2 million to discretionary funds for childcare and hardship funding.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4187</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Supporting Employment in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that 34,000 extra Scots were out of a job in the last year and that many live under the threat of redundancy; recognises that government support for business and individuals is vital in the current climate; calls on the Scottish Government to examine the ProAct scheme developed by the Welsh Assembly Government, which supports businesses on short-time working, with a view to developing a similar initiative in Scotland; further recognises the seriousness of the economic situation in Scotland; believes that the Scottish Government should bring forward a new and revised economic recovery programme prior to summer recess, and calls for such a plan to outline how the Scottish Government intends to deliver the extra 7,800 apprenticeship places agreed for 2009 and the 75,000 training places announced by the First Minister on 18 April 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4186</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Importance of Aquaculture to the Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of <em>A Fresh Start &ndash; the renewed Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture</em> and its key themes; promotes the continued development of an ambitious, sustainable, profitable, thriving and growing Scottish aquaculture industry; recognises the economic importance of the industry to Scotland as a whole and many coastal communities in particular; acknowledges the vital role to be played by aquaculture production, processing and associated businesses during the economic downturn; supports efforts to promote the many positives of the industry and to advance the enviable international reputation of quality Scottish aquaculture products, built on high environmental standards; encourages Marine Scotland to work with others to deliver a transparent, streamlined and proportionate regulatory framework that encourages shellfish and finfish industries while at the same time ensuring that adverse impacts on biodiversity and other users of the marine and freshwater environment are minimised and managed; welcomes proactive and effective engagement with other aquaculture-producing countries through sharing knowledge and promoting best practice and Scotland&rsquo;s role as a major contributor to international cooperation on research, and acknowledges the continued engagement of the shellfish and finfish industries and other stakeholders in the development and implementation of the Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4185</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Craig Gowans Memorial Trophy Challenge Charity Match</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the community football clubs of Hutchison Vale and Tynecastle are joining forces to play a charity challenge match for the Craig Gowans Memorial Trophy at 1 pm on Saturday 30 May 2009 in the Saughton Enclosure, Edinburgh; recognises that all proceeds of this match will go to the Children&rsquo;s Hospice Association Scotland and the Edinburgh Royal Hospital for Sick Children; notes that the Craig Gowans Memorial Fund has raised thousands of pounds for charity while keeping alive the memory of this inspiring young former Hutchison Vale player; notes that many coaches and ex-players from both clubs have confirmed their participation, including Gary Mackay, Scott Crabbe, Mickey Weir and Darren Jackson; congratulates the organisers, and hopes that the event proves to be a great success.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4184</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limits indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4183</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Further Radiation Leaks from British Submarines</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern reports of a further two leaks of radioactive waste from British submarines, including one at Devonport in March 2009; notes that the number of radioactive waste leaks from nuclear submarines now stands at nine in the last 12 years, which includes a number of safety breaches at the Royal Navy&rsquo;s nuclear submarine base at Faslane, near Glasgow; believes that these safety breaches bring into doubt the ability of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) sufficiently to administer rudimentary safety regulations, and, considering that the United Kingdom&rsquo;s entire nuclear submarine fleet is to be based at Faslane from 2017, believes that the MoD cannot remain immune to regulation by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in Scotland in light of this catalogue of grave failures.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4176</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow, Scotland&rsquo;s Curry Capital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow&rsquo;s Indian restaurant sector on its success at this year&rsquo;s Scottish Curry Awards, which saw the Ashoka restaurant lift the much coveted award of Team of the Year and Jaffar Hussain of the Kabana named Chef of the Year, while the Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Ali Ahmed Aslam, the founder of the Shish Mahal, one of Glasgow&rsquo;s first curry houses, and Balbir Singh Sumal, the owner of Balbirs in Glasgow&rsquo;s cosmopolitan west end, was proclaimed Scotland&rsquo;s Curry King, and believes that the huge success serves to underline and further enhance Glasgow&rsquo;s renowned international reputation as a modern, vibrant and multicultural city.</p>
