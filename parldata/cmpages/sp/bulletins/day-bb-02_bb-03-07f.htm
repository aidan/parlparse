            the Parliament congratulates the Children&#146;s Hospice Association 
            Scotland (CHAS) on its 10th anniversary; pays tribute to the excellent 
            work carried out by staff at the children&#146;s hospice, Rachel House, 
            in providing care and support for terminally ill children and their 
            families from across Scotland; notes that the development of a second 
            children&#146;s hospice is currently underway; recognises the efforts 
            of the many individuals and organisations who have contributed to 
            the development of this project, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should work in partnership with CHAS, NHS boards, local authorities 
            and the Scottish Partnership Agency for Palliative and Cancer Care

            continuing budgetary difficulties and threatened cuts in services, 
            and believes that Ministers should meet representatives of the council 
            with a view to maintaining services, with particular regard to education, 
            voluntary services and key community facilities.</p>

          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson*</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2849#</strong> <strong> Sarah Boyack: Ageism</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes research findings by Help the Aged indicating 
            that over 50% of Scots in the 65-74 age group feel that the country 
            treated older people as if they were &quot;on the scrap heap&quot; 
            and &quot;a burden to society&quot;; believes that such treatment 
            is unacceptable and perpetuates ageism in society, which can be seen 
            in both deliberate and inadvertent discrimination in the attitudes 
            of both public and private sector organisations, allied to continued 
            media stereotyping of older people, and therefore considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should identify and address areas of age discrimination 
            in Scottish public life so that older people feel valued and can make 
            a full and positive contribution to society.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2848#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie: Deafblind People 
            in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that there are 
            750 known deafblind people in Scotland, but that Deafblind Scotland 
            and Sense Scotland estimate that the total figure is more likely to 
            be around 2,500; further notes the introduction of guidance under 
            section 7 of the Local Authorities and Social Services Act 1970 on 
            9 March 2001 in England and Wales, which requires local authorities 
            to be pro-active in their efforts to serve deafblind people and, in 
            particular, to (a) identify and record the number of deafblind people 
            in their area, (b) ensure that an assessment of their needs is carried 
            out, (c) ensure that appropriate services are provided for deafblind 
            people, (d) ensure access to specially trained one-to-one support 
            workers, (e) provide information in formats accessible to deafblind 
            people and (f) ensure that deafblind issues are included as part of 
            one senior manager's responsibilities; recognises that this has represented 
            a major breakthrough for deafblind people in England and Wales, and 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should examine the current provision 
            of services for deafblind people in Scotland and look into ways of 
            introducing similar provision in Scotland</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2847 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary

            Executive&#146;s commitment to tackling the traffic problems of West 
            Edinburgh; recognises the strategic significance of this area for 
            the whole of Scotland and its economy; notes the importance of the 
            proposed new National Planning Policy Guideline in balancing transport, 
            economic and environmental requirements while ensuring the continued 
            protection of the green belt, and, in particular, acknowledges the

            the importance of the role that sub-post offices play in Scottish 
            communities, particularly in rural areas and deprived urban areas; 
            recognises the potential financial consequences for sub-post offices 
            in Scotland of the UK-wide Automated Credit Transfer system for the 
            payment of benefits; notes that &quot;Your Guide&quot; is a comprehensive 
            information service currently being evaluated for sub-post offices 
            in England and Wales; further notes that such a service includes Government 
            General Practitioner and Internet Learning Access Point initiatives, 
            both of which provide members of the public with the ability to interact 
            with departments of Her Majesty&#146;s Government and gain government 
            information in an accessible way; further recognises the potential 
            benefits that such a service could provide in Scotland, in terms of 
            improving openness and public participation with government, as well 
            as potentially providing a timely boost to business levels for sub-post 
            offices at a time when the network is having difficulty in sustaining 
            such levels, and urges the Scottish Executive to pilot such a scheme 
            in Scotland, with a view to rolling out the service across the country 
            as soon as possible. </p>

            welcomes the magnificent reaction to VisitScotland&#146;s recent genealogy

            to ensure that the anticipation created by these efforts will be satisfied 
            with subsequent skills, training and product development, with particular 
            emphasis on the development of a programme of formal qualifications.</a></p>

            to end and insert &quot;notes the publication of the final report 
            of the Homelessness Task Force, <em>Homelessness: An Action Plan for 
            Prevention and Effective Response</em>, two and a half years after 
            its inception; condemns the fact that homelessness applications to 
            local authorities have reached record levels during that period, under 
            the Scottish Executive, and remain close to that level; notes with 
            concern the Executive&#146;s decision to accept the task force&#146;s 
            recommendations in full without prior debate, particularly the proposals 
            to phase out the category of priority need and to remove the local 
            connection requirements, and calls on the Executive to take a less 
            prescriptive approach and allow local authorities the flexibility 
            they require in order to address the individual needs of homeless 
            people in their areas.&quot; </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2838.2</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Final Report

            Task Force, <em>Homelessness: An Action Plan for Prevention and Effective 
            Response</em>; regrets that, five years after the election of New Labour, 
            homelessness in Scotland is higher than when they took office; seeks 
            a commitment from the Scottish Executive to produce an action plan 
            for implementation of the 59 recommendations within six months; believes 
            that, for homelessness to be eradicated, the recommendations in the 
            report must be fully resourced, and acknowledges than an independent 
            Scotland, with full control over the benefits system, would be much 
            better placed to tackle homelessness than an Executive dependent on 
            the decisions and goodwill of Westminster.&quot; </p>

            the Scottish Conservatives of an issue that is reserved; believes 
            that the taxation imposed on whisky by successive UK governments has 
            disadvantaged Scotch in the home market, where whisky is taxed at 
            higher levels than wine or beer, and has also allowed other countries 
            to seek to justify their own discriminatory tax regimes by reference 
            to those in the UK; further believes that a tax stamp system would 
            constitute a barrier to trade, would be inefficient and ineffective 
            as a means of combating fraud and illicit trade, will cause many practical 
            and technical problems in respect of, for example, labelling and storage 
            and will impose substantial costs on the industry, and calls upon 
            the Scottish Executive to demand that all powers relating to the regulation 
            and taxation of the whisky industry be transferred to the Scottish 
            Parliament.&quot;</p>
