<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4131</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Engagement in the United States of America and Canada</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with the United States of America and Canada; notes the contribution of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and all those who were involved in the development of Scotland Week over the last eight years in North America; expresses its gratitude for the significant contribution of the Scottish diaspora in helping to promote Scotland&rsquo;s rich cultural heritage, and encourages the Scottish Government to continue to develop a more joined-up approach to the promotion of Scotland in Canada and the United States of America by working in partnership with all relevant organisations in the public and private sector in order to ensure that Scotland derives real social and economic benefits from such activities.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4130</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>National Minimum Wage Increases</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to accept the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendation of a mere 1.25% increase in the national minimum wage, from &pound;5.73 to &pound;5.80 per hour; notes that this comes at a time when Glasgow City Council has indicated a figure of &pound;7 per hour as a minimum for its employees, and calls on the UK Government to reconsider its decision so that people on the lowest pay scales receive an increase that genuinely makes a financial contribution to eradicating in-work poverty.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4129</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Raith Rovers Football Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Raith Rovers Football Club on winning the Second Division title following a 1-0 victory over Queen&rsquo;s Park Football Club; commends the team as its promotion to the First Division after a four year absence; pays tribute to team manager John McGlynn and his players on their terrific achievement; acknowledges the efforts of the staff and fans in supporting Raith Rovers FC through to victory in eight of its last nine games, and commends the stability that the board of directors and volunteers have brought to the club.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4124</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Coroners and Justice Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the Coroners and Justice Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 14 January 2009, relating to the EU Services Directive, criminal memoirs and the Scottish system of investigation of deaths and fatal accident inquiries into deaths abroad of members of the armed forces and others, so far as these provisions relate to matters within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4116</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>National Thrombosis Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports National Thrombosis Week, from 11 to 15 May 2009; praises campaigners Jane and Gordon McPherson of Langbank and Lifeblood: The Thrombosis Charity for their continued and strenuous efforts to raise awareness in this area; notes that thrombosis has been and remains a major cause of death in Scotland; regrets that this fact is not widely known; further notes that members of the public and even many medical professionals have little or no understanding anent the causes and effects of thrombosis, particularly the dangers of hospital-acquired thrombosis, which kills in excess of 3,000 patients in Scotland every year, more than hospital-acquired infections, even though the majority of these deaths could easily be prevented with a simple mandatory risk assessment, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government, NHS boards and all other interested parties to implement mandatory risk assessments in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4115</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Build the Beauly to Inverness Cycle Path</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the campaign to establish a Beauly to Inverness cycle path; highlights the multitude of benefits that cycling has to offer, including reducing the use of cars, traffic congestion and individuals&rsquo; carbon footprints as well as increasing the health, energy and wellbeing of cyclists, and notes that there are many people living in the area who are conscious of the benefits of cycling and would leave their cars behind to travel along&nbsp;this safe route.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4114</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Raise a Dram to Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the vital importance of Scotch whisky to the Scottish and wider UK economies; notes that Scotch whisky exports earned &pound;97 per second for the United Kingdom last year; further notes that in 2008 the value of shipments increased by 8% to over &pound;3 billion, according to the Scotch Whisky Association and that, for the fourth consecutive year, both bottled malt and Scotch whisky exports increased in value by &pound;497 million and &pound;2.43 billion respectively; therefore believes that Scotch whisky is proving to be recession resilient in the current volatile global market; appreciates that the major investment made by distillers will stand the industry in good stead during the economic downturn, and raises a dram in support of the Scotch whisky industry at home and abroad.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4113</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>European Resolution on Depleted Uranium Weapons</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the European Parliament&rsquo;s resolution on &quot;Depleted uranium weapons and their effect on human health and the environment - towards a global ban on the use of such weapons&quot;; recognises the serious health concerns about the use of depleted uranium weapons on both military personnel and civilians, concerns that are widely acknowledged by many including the UN General Assembly; further recognises the serious environmental hazards posed by depleted uranium such as the contamination of soil and groundwater, and strongly urges the Scottish Government to offer its moral and, where appropriate, practical support for a global ban on the use of depleted uranium weapons.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4110#</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>New Secondary School for North East Fife</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the children, parents and communities of Tay Bridgehead in north east Fife require a new secondary school and community facility in addition to the proposed single site at Madras College; highlights that the campaign for a new Tay Bridgehead school has been ongoing for more than half a century; considers, in light of recent leaked figures, that the proposed new Madras College will not be big enough to accommodate all the pupils, including those from the Tay Bridgehead area; notes that currently around 850 pupils from the Tay Bridgehead and Leuchars area have to be bussed to school and that this has affected their education and involvement in school activities, as has been the case for generations; congratulates <em>The Courier</em>, <em>Fife Herald </em>and<em> St Andrews Citizen Newspaper </em>for highlighting the growing public support for a Tay Bridgehead school, and supports all those involved in the campaign.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4047 *#*</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Dispensing GP Practices in Rural Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the important role of dispensing GP practices in remote and rural communities across Scotland; acknowledges the high level of patient satisfaction with these practices; is concerned about the process of the community pharmacy application in Chirnside, which has failed to properly involve the affected GPs or take account of the views of the local population; is aware of the current inquiry on dispensing under consideration by the Public Petitions Committee, and therefore welcomes the British Medical Association&rsquo;s calls for the pharmacy regulations to be reviewed.</p>
