            <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Flood Prevention</strong>—That the Parliament notes 
            the responsibility which local authorities have for flood prevention 
            measures and also the need for them to give consideration to possible 
            flood risks when considering planning applications; further notes 
            that local authorities have access to estimated 100 year flood maps 
            provided by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency for this purpose 
            but is concerned that the scale of these maps, produced by the Institute 
            of Hydrology, is 1:50,000 and that they only provide information in 
            50 square metre blocks; urges the Scottish Executive to give consideration 
            to the effectiveness of these maps; believes that the Executive should 
            work with all local authorities to identify areas of flood risk which 
            are susceptible to flooding and to develop a national scheme to restrict 
            or prohibit development on &quot;at risk&quot; areas, and further 
            urges the Executive to produce a long term strategy for areas of development 
            currently prone to flooding.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr John McAllion: Specialist Clinic for ME</strong>—That the Parliament, 
            in view of 2001 being the Year of the Severely Affected with ME and 
            in view of ME Awareness Week in May 2001, acknowledges the suffering 
            of an estimated 15,000 patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) 
            and/or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) including an estimated 2,500 
            children, and asks the Scottish Executive to commission urgently a 
            strategic needs review assessment into ME and CFS and to set up a 
            specialist ME and CFS clinic for diagnosis and treatment of sufferers.</font></p>

            <strong>Lewis Macdonald: Community Nurses and Health Visitors</strong>—That 
            the Parliament notes the key role of community nurses and health visitors 
            in community care, and that use of a car is essential in carrying 
            out that role; believes that the practices of requiring these health 
            workers to pay parking charges in the course of their work, and of 
            providing car leasing arrangements on different terms in different 
            Trusts, should be reviewed in the interests of efficiency and equity, 
            and further believes that a uniform approach to these issues should 
            be established throughout the National Health Service in Scotland.<strong><i>

            <strong>Mr Alex Salmond: Peterhead Football Club</strong>—That the Parliament 
            <a name="MotionText">congratulates Peterhead Football Club on its 
            successful run in the Scottish Cup, which culminated in the club reaching 
            the quarter final for the first time in its history; notes that this 
            achievement took place during the Blue Toon’s first season in senior 
            football; believes that the team and its travelling fans are a credit 
            to the local community, and wishes the team all the best for the remainder 
            of this season and those to come.</a></font></p>
