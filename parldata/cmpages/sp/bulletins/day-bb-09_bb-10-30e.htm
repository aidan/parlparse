<p align="center"><strong>Section E &ndash; Written questions lodged on 29 October 2009</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of information to the Parliament.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>S3W-28480 Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether a premises or personal licence to sell alcohol that has been revoked under a provision in the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 can be reallocated to the same premises or person and, if so, after how long.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28481 Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether Scottish police forces contribute data on protesters to the intelligence database run by the National Public Order Intelligence Unit and, if not, whether there is an equivalent database in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28482 Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether automatic number plate recognition cameras are used in Scotland to monitor vehicles associated with protesters and, if so, how many such cameras there are.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28483 Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to the finding in the <em>2008/09 Scottish Crime and Justice Survey: First Findings</em> that victims in 58% of violent crimes stated that the offenders were under the influence of alcohol and what action it is taking to tackle alcohol-fuelled violence.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28484 Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to the statement in the report, <em>Model-Based Appraisal of Alcohol Minimum Pricing and Off-Licensed Trade Discount Bans in Scotland: A Scottish adaptation of the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model version 2, </em>that a 50p minimum alcohol price is estimated to reduce alcohol-related crimes by 1.5% and whether it considers that this measure would reduce levels of alcohol-related violence.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28485 Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the legality of proposals to ban the promotion of alcohol in off-sales premises.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28486 Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is within its power to ban the selling of alcohol at below the cost of excise duty plus VAT and, if so, what mechanisms it could use to do so.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28487 George Foulkes:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive for what reason GPs are charging up to &pound;150 for vaccinations for people who are going to Malawi and other countries on aid programmes.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28488 John Lamont:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it is supporting the building of new affordable housing in Berwickshire.</p>

<p><strong>S3W-28492 John Lamont:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many new units of social housing are planned to be built in Berwickshire in (a) 2009 and (b) 2010.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28493 Liam McArthur:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to its news release of 23 September 2009<em>, Broadband for rural Scotland</em>, when it plans to announce the list of rural telephone exchanges that are to be upgraded to increase access to broadband and the programme for the upgrading work.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28494 Liam McArthur:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the reasons are for the adoption of an electronic net-measuring gauge to measure the mesh sizes of fishermen&rsquo;s nets, replacing the wedge-shaped measuring device used previously.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28495 Liam McArthur:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the electronic net-measuring gauge now used to measure the mesh sizes of fishermen&rsquo;s nets was independently tested for robustness and reliability before it was introduced</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28496 Liam McArthur:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the fishing industry and net manufacturers were consulted before the adoption of an electronic net-measuring gauge to measure the mesh sizes of fishermen&rsquo;s nets, replacing the wedge-shaped measuring device used previously, and what views were expressed in reply to any such consultation.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28497 Liam McArthur:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether research was carried out to compare the measurements of the meshes in fishermen&rsquo;s nets using the new electronic net-measuring gauge and the wedge-shaped measuring device used previously and, if so, what the results were.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28498 Liam McArthur:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how the cost of the new electronic net-measuring gauge to measure the mesh sizes of fishermen&rsquo;s nets compares with that of the wedge-shaped measuring device used previously. </p>
<p><strong>S3W-28499 Liam McArthur:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether fishermen will receive compensation for discarding nets that comply with the mesh-size regulations when measured by the wedge-shaped measuring device used previously but fail when measured by the new electronic net-measuring gauge and, if so, what compensation.</p>
