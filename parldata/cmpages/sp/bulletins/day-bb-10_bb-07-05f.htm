                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6702 Willie Coffey: Gargieston Primary Has the Right Chemistry for Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the team from Gargieston Primary School, Kilmarnock, on its success at the recent Salters&rsquo; Festival of Chemistry held at the University of Glasgow and which aims to help promote the appreciation of chemistry and related sciences among young people; considers that, during the last eight years, over 20,000 students have experienced the fun of practical chemistry through the Salters&rsquo; Festivals of Chemistry; further congratulates the Gargieston pupils on beating off competition from secondary schools in winning the Salters&rsquo; Challenge, in which teams undertake a practical scientific activity for which they are given no opportunity for advance preparation; recognises that this year&rsquo;s success follows the schools&rsquo; second place in the University Challenge at the Salter&rsquo;s Festival in 2008 and expresses its appreciation of the work of Head Teacher Christine McLean and the staff of the school in developing the scientific knowledge and understanding of the pupils.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6701 David McLetchie: Congratulations to David McAllister</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates David McAllister on his election as the Minister-President of Lower Saxony in the Federal Republic of Germany; notes that he is the son of a Scottish soldier who served in Germany with the 51st Highland Division; welcomes the links that have already been established between this Parliament and the Landtag of Lower Saxony, and looks forward to developing this relationship in the future.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6700 Kenneth Gibson: Palm Oil and Deforestation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the serious issue of deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia, much of it thought to be caused by the production of palm oil; recognises that palm oil has become a popular commodity that is believed to be used in 50% of all packaged supermarket products, including shampoos, soaps, chocolate, margarine and other foodstuffs; is aware that this has created huge market demand for this relatively cheap commodity, which in turn has led to the expansion of land under cultivation for palm oil from 2,000 square kilometres in 1967 to 30,000 square kilometres in 2000; acknowledges that, since then, 18,000 square kilometres have been deforested each year, much of it for palm oil production; is further aware that a recent report by the United Nations Environment Programme highlighted that 98% of Indonesia&rsquo;s rain forest could be destroyed by 2022; is concerned by the environmental impact of such industrial-scale deforestation that threatens the indigenous population, local wildlife, including orangutans, elephants and tigers, and has also resulted in Indonesia becoming one of the world&rsquo;s largest carbon dioxide emitters as peat-lands, which store large quantities of carbon dioxide, are cleared, drained and burned thus releasing 1,400 million tonnes of stored carbon into the atmosphere every year; notes that the increasing demand for biofuels has also played a major role in creating such massive demand as scientists identified that palm oil mixed with diesel reduces CO2 emissions from engines; considers, however, that this is a false economy as the plant would itself absorb greater amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> in its lifecycle; is concerned that this demand could be the result of EU biofuel targets that effectively encourage businesses to adopt biofuel technology, of which palm oil is the cheapest; believes that the EU should not be setting targets on biofuel technology until mechanisms are put in place to provide sustainable sources of a variety of biofuel sources instead of creating what is viewed as a dangerous and regressive palm oil dependency, and  further believes that leading manufacturers, including   Kellogg&rsquo;s, Cadbury, Mars, Kraft, Unilever, Premier Foods, Northern Foods and Procter and Gamble, should also do more to prevent such widescale destruction, seen ultimately as driven by their seemingly insatiable market appetites.</p>
                                        <p><strong>S3M-6699 David Stewart: Retain Fort George</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the iconic status of Fort George, near Inverness, home to the Garrison of The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland; believes that, along with Fort George being an iconic tourist attraction, the 430 soldiers stationed there and their families play an important role in the local community; notes that, in the Strategic Defence and Security Review debate in the House of Commons on 21 June 2010, concerns were raised that Fort George would close as an army barracks; believes that any proposal to close Fort George would have severe economic consequences in Inverness and the surrounding areas as a result of the troops and their families spending less in the local economy, and would welcome the preparation of a survival plan to save Fort George, ensuring that it remains both a working army barracks and a premium league tourist destination.</p>
                                        <p><strong>S3M-6698 Hugh Henry: BT Rewards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that BT is demonstrating insensitivity to staff and customers in the rewards given to senior staff and directors; regrets the 79% increase in reward to the chief executive officer with a &pound;850,000 per annum salary and an annual bonus of &pound;1,206,000; believes that there is no justification for the amounts paid to board members, including Sir Michael Rake, &pound;670,000, Hanif Lalani, &pound;1,166,000, and Patricia Hewitt, &pound;128,000, and further believes that the UK Government should investigate ways of restricting such corporate excesses.</p>
