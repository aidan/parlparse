                                          Bob Doris: Tackling Organised Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the cross-party Glasgow crime summit on Monday 8 March 2010 is a welcome initiative in tackling serious and organised crime; affirms its desire to find political consensus for the various methods of tackling serious and organised crime, and would welcome further work to close in on the seemingly respectable business activities of organised criminals and find solutions that will protect the safety of the public and seize assets from criminal networks.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5901 Johann Lamont: International Women&rsquo;s Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes International Women&rsquo;s Day on 8 March 2010; welcomes that this day will be marked in the Scottish Parliament chamber on Saturday 6 March as well as with 216 other events across the United Kingdom; believes that this day provides an opportunity to celebrate the central role of women in society, among many other things supporting their families and holding communities together in tough economic times; regrets that too many women in Scotland and across the world remain the victims of abuse, discrimination, violence and exploitation; considers that, despite progress on equality, women are still likely to be paid less than men, are underrepresented in positions of power and face discrimination in all aspects of their social and working lives, and believes that International Women&rsquo;s Day provides an important opportunity to restate a commitment to securing equality for women and reaffirm the need to ensure that government at every level acts to improve the position of women and address all the barriers that prevent women from being safe and achieving their full potential.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5900 Robin Harper: School Playgrounds</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers the importance of school playgrounds in enriching childhood through getting children active, giving them regular experiences of nature, developing their social skills and helping them to learn and develop citizenship and pride of place; is concerned that many of Scotland&rsquo;s school playgrounds are in poor shape and that only a minority of local authorities have any proactive programme in place to develop them, and urges the Scottish Government to give local authorities a clear responsibility to provide school playgrounds in which children can play, enjoy nature, learn and  thrive.</p>
