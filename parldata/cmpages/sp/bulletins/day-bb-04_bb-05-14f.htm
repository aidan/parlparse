          <p><strong>*S2M-1313#</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Screening 
            for Teenage Killer</strong>-That the Parliament notes that cardiomyopathy, 
            a thickening of the heart muscles, without screening grows undetected 
            at the body's fastest growing time, the teenage years, that apparently 
            healthy teenagers can suffer from this condition and that the condition 
            kills a large number of teenagers annually; further notes that Scottish 
            H.A.R.T, a registered charity, researches all forms of heart disease, 
            raises funds for mobile screening of young people and families at 
            risk and has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to put monitoring 
            equipment into sports centres, swimming pools and youth facilities 
            across Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            ensure provision of sufficient funding to make sure that monitoring 
            equipment is provided in sports centres, swimming pools and youth 
            facilities in line with recent funding allocations in England and 
            Wales.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1312</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Dunino Primary School</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Dunino Primary School in Fife on being awarded Permanent Eco School 
            Status for its work on environmental issues; recognises that the school 
            has been working on green issues since 1994, with its first award 
            in 1998, and is now the first school on mainland Scotland to have 
            gained this prestigious status, and sends the school best wishes for 
            its celebrations on 27 May 2004.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1311</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Proposed 
            Post Office Closures in the North East</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the proposed closures of post offices in north-east Scotland 
            and, in particular, in Aberdeen where 14 post offices face closure; 
            is concerned at the impact this may have on the communities that will 
            be affected by the closures; recognises that post offices play a key 
            role in delivering vital services in communities, and congratulates 
            Aberdeen's Members of Parliament and other local elected representatives 
            on their campaign to maintain an adequate level of post office services 
            in the city.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1310#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Redeployment 
            of the Black Watch to Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament notes reports 
            that the Black Watch have been put on standby to serve again in Iraq, 
            having returned only 10 months ago, as a result of the departure of 
            Spanish troops and considers that Her Majesty's Government should 
            seek a handover of control in Iraq to the United Nations and a UN-mandated 
            international security force rather than supporting the increasingly 
            discredited existing coalition.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1309#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Adult 
            Learners' Week</strong>-That the Parliament supports this year's Adult 
            Learners' Week from 15 to 21 May 2004; commends the efforts of Anniesland 
            College which will be working alongside partner learning organisations 
            to provide a range of 'taster' courses to promote lifelong learning 
            and encourage adults to undertake further training and education; 
            endorses the efforts of further and higher education institutions 
            across Scotland and the work of trade unions to promote lifelong learning; 
            recognises the importance of lifelong learning in improving individual 
            self-confidence and ensuring that Scotland has an appropriately-trained 
            and motivated workforce, and notes the significance of Adult Learners' 
            Week in helping people to enjoy the experience of gaining knowledge 
            and developing new skills.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1308</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>The 
            City of Edinburgh Council, Housing Stock Transfer</strong>-That the 
            Parliament has serious concerns about plans announced by the City 
            of Edinburgh Council to transfer its entire housing stock out of local 
            authority control; notes that since 1993 more than 300,000 council 
            houses have been transferred into private ownership and a further 
            46,000 demolished, whilst only 48,000 have been built in the socially-rented 
            sector; believes that the restrictions placed on council housebuilding 
            programmes should be lifted immediately; notes that the City of Edinburgh 
            Council's plan includes a commitment by the Scottish Executive to 
            write off £300 million of debt and believes that this debt should 
            not be used as inducement in this way but instead be written off now; 
            believes that the Executive must make a clear commitment to high quality, 
            affordable, public housing for rent in Scotland and is disappointed 
            that only 51 council houses were built in Scotland last year; urges 
            the City of Edinburgh Council to ensure that the views of its tenants 
            are fully consulted and that the referendum planned for 2006 is thoroughly 
            democratic and fair, and calls on the council to ensure that both 
            sides in this debate are provided with equal amounts of council resources 
            to be able to put their case forward.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1307</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Love 
            is the Drug</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates BBC Scotland 
            on its Frontline Scotland programme, &quot;Love is the Drug&quot;, 
            concerning grandparents caring for the children of drug-using parents; 
            notes the sensitive manner in which this emotive issue was handled; 
            notes that the problems of grandparents caring for grandchildren remain 
            largely hidden; notes the forthcoming legal action of some grandparents 
            who are seeking financial assistance for their admirable actions, 
            and hopes that the Scottish Executive recognises the role played by 
            grandparents and will implement measures to give financial and social 
            support to such carers as a matter of urgency.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1306#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Children 
            of Drug Abusers</strong>-That the Parliament notes the widespread 
            incidence in Scotland of children whose parents misuse drugs and who, 
            as a result, suffer diminished lives in all kinds of ways; believes 
            that such children, many of whom are infants, require comprehensive 
            care by those concerned with the protection of vulnerable families, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive, social work departments 
            and other interested parties should adopt healthcare programmes that 
            will ensure that such young citizens escape the blighting of their 
            lives brought about by parents who are themselves in need of treatment 
            and support.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1305#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Employee 
            Equal Opportunities within the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that staff employed by MSPs are a valuable resource of the 
            Parliament, provide essential services and are at the forefront of 
            representing the public image of the Parliament in their dealings 
            with constituents, institutions, members of the public and the wider 
            community in Scotland and help MSPs to develop policy ideas and respond 
            rapidly to events; recognises that they should be entitled to the 
            same personal and career development opportunities funded by the Scottish 
            Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) as staff employed directly by 
            the SPCB, and considers that a staff training and development budget 
            should be provided to MSPs in order that their directly employed staff 
            have equal career and personal development opportunities.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1301.1</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> 
            <strong>Ragwort Control</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1301) 
            in the name of Ms Rosemary Byrne, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;regrets that, as disclosed in parliamentary 
            answer S2W-2097, no prosecutions have taken place under the Weeds 
            Act 1959 and that, as disclosed in parliamentary answer S2W-2096, 
            there have been only four notices issued regarding ragwort since 1995, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to take the necessary action to 
            reduce the amount of ragwort growing in Scotland and does not believe 
            that any possible new legislation should be used as an excuse for 
            delay.&quot;</P>
