<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>A </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/index.htm"><strong>search facility</strong></a><strong> is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any questions in relation to this section should be directed to the Chamber Desk, for which contact details are provided at the end of the Bulletin.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8148 Margaret Smith: Forth Crossing Contract</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at plans for the contract for the Forth Replacement Crossing project to be awarded during dissolution; considers that this announcement breaks with tradition; recognises reported concerns that this decision means that it will be signed in haste; considers that lessons should be learned from the contractual difficulties of the Edinburgh tram project, and urges that the contract is neither awarded nor signed until members have been elected and sworn in for the fourth session.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8147 Linda Fabiani: Theatre Nemo Wins Again</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Theatre Nemo on winning the Social Economy Organisation of the Year Award from the Glasgow West Regeneration Agency on 4 March 2011; notes the work that Theatre Nemo does with people with chronic mental health problems in psychiatric hospitals and prisons and with those people left without care in the community whom the Scottish Prison Service, NHS and local authorities cannot tackle on their own; recognises the value of the work carried out in partnership with HMP Barlinnie, providing creative, artistic programmes to mentally ill and vulnerable prisoners, giving confidence and helping to build the type of social skills that are known to reduce reoffending by offering alternative, positive life choices to repeat offenders with mental health issues, and wishes all involved with Theatre Nemo continuing success.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8146 Elaine Smith: May Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of the May Day bank holiday, which was introduced by the Labour Secretary of State for Employment, Michael Foot, in 1978 in honour of organised labour and the right to strike; understands that 1 May is celebrated as a holiday in over 100 countries around the world and is synonymous with International Workers&rsquo; Day; considers that May Day has become an important international celebration of the social and economic achievements of the labour and trade union movement; is concerned therefore by reports that the UK Government is considering removing the 1 May bank holiday in favour of a new UK Day in October; understands that Scotland currently has only nine public holidays compared with the European Union average of 12 per year, and considers that any new public holiday should be an additional one and not a replacement for a traditional and internationally recognised celebration of working people.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-8145 Michael Russell: Education Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the Education Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 26 January 2011, in consequence of the abolition of the Young People&rsquo;s Learning Agency, so far as these matters fall within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Angela Constance<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-8144 Irene Oldfather: Condemning the Promotion of Smoking During Paris Fashion Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament was disappointed to see national newspapers use images of Kate Moss smoking a cigarette while modelling for Louis Vuitton at Paris Fashion Week; condemns the use of cigarettes and smoking as a method of highlighting fashion and gaining publicity; considers that images of models smoking can be very attractive to young people, who might aspire to be like such icons, and that such high-profile images detract from the work carried out to prevent young people from smoking and in educating them on the harm that it causes; notes that it is estimated that 15,000 young people take up smoking in Scotland every year and that it causes one quarter of all adult deaths, and further considers tobacco to be highly addictive and that its easy availability and visibility can lead to young people becoming hooked, which is damaging to their health and the health of those around them.</p>
