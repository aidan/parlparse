              <strong>Mr Murray Tosh:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when the current 

              advice to procurators fiscal on planning enforcement was issued; 

              whether a copy of any such advice has been placed in the Scottish 

              Parliament Information Centre; whether any audit of practice has 

              been carried out in relation to the enforcement of planning decisions 

              through the courts; whether it is content that the full range of 

              powers available in theory to planning authorities is available 

              and working effectively in practice; when planning authorities were 

              last asked for their views on the effectiveness of the legal system 

              in relation to planning enforcement and what the findings of any 

              such consultation were.</font></p>
