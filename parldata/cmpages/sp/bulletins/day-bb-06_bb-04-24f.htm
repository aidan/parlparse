<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4277</strong> <strong>John Home Robertson:</strong> <strong>Tribute to Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun 1653-1716, Patriot and Unionist</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the courageous role of Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, Member for East Lothian, in the debate on the Treaty of Union in 1706; endorses his wise statement that &quot;it is certainly in the interest of all good men to promote a nearer union with our neighbours in England&quot;; believes that 67 members of the old Scottish Parliament, including Fletcher and Patrick Home, Member for Berwickshire, were right to vote against the abolition of Scotland&rsquo;s Parliament; notes Fletcher&rsquo;s warning that &quot;the Scots deserve no pity, if they voluntarily surrender their united and separate interests to the mercy of an united Parliament&quot; and regrets the fact that an incorporating union was delivered by 110 votes, later described as the &quot;parcel of rogues&quot;; welcomes the fact that the Scotland Act 1998 has achieved a fair and final resolution to the constitutional status of Scotland within the United Kingdom, and rejoices in the fact that Scotland now has the benefits of both union and autonomy, as advocated by Andrew Fletcher in 1707, as we approach the 300th anniversary of the Act of Union and the immensely successful historic partnership of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr Alasdair Morrison<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4276</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Rock the Kelvin! Restore the Kelvingrove Park Bandstand and Amphitheatre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Friends of Kelvingrove Park for their excellent campaign to have Glasgow&rsquo;s last remaining bandstand restored to its former and deserved glory; notes the proposals to have Edinburgh&rsquo;s Ross Bandstand upgraded as a major new cultural facility; further notes that Historic Scotland has declared that the Kelvingrove Park Bandstand has cultural and social significance; welcomes the support for the campaign from contemporary Scottish music acts Belle and Sebastian, Franz Ferdinand and Teenage Fanclub; further notes that the Heritage Lottery Fund, which is currently considering a funding application, has previously provided support to some 50-plus bandstand restoration projects across the United Kingdom, and calls on Glasgow City Council to lead the way in ensuring that a viable and sustainable future can be secured for this proud piece of the city&rsquo;s heritage and so create a unique open air venue in the heart of Glasgow&rsquo;s West End.</p>
<p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-4275</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>The Panchen Lama</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 25 April 2006 is the 17th birthday of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, Tibet&rsquo;s Panchen Lama; notes that in May 1995, at the age of six, a few weeks after being named by HH The Dalai Lama as the new reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second most important leader in Tibet, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was abducted from his home in Tibet by the Chinese authorities and that no-one there has seen him or heard from him since; sends all good wishes to the Panchen Lama, and urges the international community to continue its efforts to secure his safety.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4274#</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Future Funding of Borderline Theatre Company</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the contribution of Borderline Theatre Company during its 32 years of work from its base in Ayrshire, delivering quality, professional entertainment to almost a million people across Scotland as well as 1,100 workshops to 18,168 participants in its extensive lifelong learning programme; condemns the decision of the Scottish Arts Council (SAC) to cease to provide revenue funding for Borderline Theatre Company; deplores the actions of the SAC in changing the funding criteria during the application process, and believes that an examination should take place of the processes and outcomes of SAC funding decisions.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4245</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Lorry Drivers, Politicians and Sleep Apnoea</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the exhibition in the Garden Lobby from 18 to 20 April 2006 on sleep disorders; notes that in such conditions the upper airway collapses intermittently and repeatedly during sleep, preventing breathing; notes that there are estimated to be 50,000 adults in Scotland who have this condition, affecting around 1 to 2% of middle-aged men, which is a similar prevalence to Type 1 diabetes; notes that being overweight and in a sedentary occupation increases the likelihood of suffering from this disorder which includes occupations such as lorry and train drivers and, indeed, politicians; further notes that only some 5,000 people receive treatment and that the person suffering from Obstructive Sleep Apnoea is often the last to be aware of the problem; notes that this condition can be successfully managed with a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine which is recommended as the first line of treatment by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; notes that research at the Edinburgh Sleep Centre concluded that treating 500 patients with CPAP machines for five years would cost &pound;400,000 whereas the estimated cost of accidents caused by 500 untreated sleep apnoea patients over the same period could be &pound;5.3 million; notes that the waiting time for treatment at the Edinburgh Sleep Centre has, however, now risen to 23 months, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to fund sleep centres adequately and to promote awareness of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea.</p>

<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4241</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Just Pull Yourself Together?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the work of Depression Alliance Scotland in providing information and support for anyone affected by depression and anyone caring for someone affected by depression; supports its campaign in raising awareness and understanding of depression, an illness which affected around 300,000 people in Scotland in the last recorded year, half of whom attempt to struggle on without seeking help; recognises that it is an illness and is not simply a case of &quot;pulling oneself together&quot; but that in the majority of cases is treatable, and fully supports its &quot;Mother Father Son Daughter Brother Sister Lover Friend You&quot; campaign raising awareness that depression affects us all either through personal experience or by knowing someone who suffers from depression and that depression is not something to be afraid to admit to or be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4218</strong> <strong>Brian Adam on behalf of the Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Bill Committee:</strong> <strong>Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Bill be passed.</p>
