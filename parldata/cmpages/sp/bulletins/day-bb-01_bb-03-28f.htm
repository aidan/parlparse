            methods of killing should be investigated immediately, that veterinarians 
            should be present throughout every killing and that any instances

            Scottish children, some of whom have told parliamentarians of nightmares

            realises that we have a duty not only to animal welfare but to truthful

            <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Investigation of Handling of Foot-and-Mouth

            precise date when the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food 
            (MAFF) was informed of the first cases of foot-and-mouth disease in 
            the recent outbreak, the time and day MAFF then passed this knowledge 
            to the Scottish Executive and precisely when MAFF informed the European 
            Commission or other member states of its knowledge of the foot-and-mouth 
            outbreak; wishes all actions by MAFF over this epidemic to be revealed 
            immediately and later subjected to an inquiry; bears in mind the past 
            history of MAFF regarding BSE, when it delayed informing farmers of 
            the exact contents of animal feed on grounds of so-called &quot;commercial 
            confidentiality&quot;, and regarding genetically modified (GM) crops, 
            when it delayed informing Scottish ministers that an accidental GM 
            planting had taken place in Scotland in spring 2000 and that an accidental 
            GM harvest had been gathered and had entered the human and animal 
            food chain in 1999, and notes that these cases of shocking delay were 
            condemned outspokenly by Ministers and all parties in the Scottish 
            Parliament.</font></p>

            areas; believes that conflicting information about the disease, both 
            at home and abroad, further jeopardises Scottish tourism; further 
            believes that more must be done to secure the future of the tourism 
            industry, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to implement 
            the following recovery plan for tourism and businesses within the 
            affected areas: (i) immediate action to enable and ensure efficient 
            crisis management, including a public information campaign through 
            the press and broadcast media to make people aware of what can and 
            cannot be done during the crisis, (ii) a moratorium on liability for 
            business rates and council tax, (iii) a moratorium to be sought by 
            the Scottish Executive from HM Treasury on liability for payment of 
            national taxes, (iv) the establishment of a designated crisis area 
            within the local authority area of Dumfries and Galloway to which 
            the foregoing moratoria would apply, (v) the establishment of a hardship 
            loan scheme to address the problem of cash flow facing many essentially 
            sound businesses in the designated crisis area and (vi) a robust recovery 
            strategy to be implemented by the Scottish Executive and relative 
            agencies to market Scotland as a world class tourist destination.&quot;</font></p>
