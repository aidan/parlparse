<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5781</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following revision to the programme of business for Wednesday 28 March 2007&mdash;</p>
<p>after,</p>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Final Stage: Airdrie-Bathgate Railway and Linked Improvements Bill</p>
<p>insert, </p>
<p> <em>followed by</em>&#9;SPCB Motion on the Reappointment of the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5780</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>HBOS/Barnardo&rsquo;s Tug of War Competition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the third annual HBOS/Barnardo&rsquo;s Tug of War Competition will take place on Thursday 21 June 2007 at 6 pm in Holyrood Park, Edinburgh; further notes that last year&rsquo;s event helped raise over &pound;4,000 in total for the charity to use for its excellent work, and calls on all challengers to take their chances against the reigning two-time champions, the Scottish Conservatives.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5779</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Scotland in the United Kingdom</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the United Kingdom is a mutually beneficial relationship for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England; notes that devolution &quot;is a process, not an event&quot;; notes the additional powers that have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament since 1999; notes that the majority of people in Scotland oppose separation from the rest of the UK; believes that such a course would result in either cuts in vital public services or massive increases in taxation; believes that Scotland should retain the benefits of being part of the UK, and notes the respective positions of the Labour and the Liberal Democrat parties on the powers of the Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5779.1</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Scotland in the United Kingdom</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5779) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;is a mutually beneficial relationship&quot; to end and insert&nbsp;&quot;thwarts Scotland&rsquo;s economic, social, cultural and political development; believes that Scotland would be better off if it were independent from the UK; believes that an independent Scotland would remove Trident nuclear weapons from the Clyde, scrap the hated council tax and prescription charges and redistribute the great wealth of Scotland to address widening inequalities and would never have agreed to send Scottish soldiers to fight a war in Iraq that is considered by many to be illegal; believes that Scots have the same democratic rights to self-determination as the people of any other country, and looks forward to a Scotland that is independent, socially just and internationalist in its outlook.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5779.2</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Scotland in the United Kingdom</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5779) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;United Kingdom&quot; to end and insert &quot;current constitutional arrangements do not offer the right solutions to the challenges facing Scotland, that the natural state of independence, enjoyed by our most successful neighbours, offers the best opportunities for Scotland and that the people of Scotland should have an opportunity in a referendum within the next four years to make their own decision on whether or not Scotland should be independent.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5779.3</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Scotland in the United Kingdom</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5779) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;, and notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;whilst, where appropriate, increasing the powers available to the Scottish Parliament.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5779.4</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Scotland in the United Kingdom</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5779) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;the United Kingdom&quot; to end and insert &quot;all political parties receive electoral support from people with a range of views on the constitution; considers therefore that the constitutional future of Scotland is a matter best decided by the people of Scotland through a referendum; believes that, regardless of the constitutional future chosen by the people of Scotland, there is a strong case for devolving power from government to local communities throughout Scotland, and considers that government in Scotland, whether under the current devolved arrangements or in an independent future, can do far more to empower communities than has been done to date.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5778</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>People 1 - Glasgow Housing Association 0</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the people of Glasgow and Sandra White MSP on securing a victory against Glasgow Housing Association regarding home improvement bills which left many destitute and facing bankruptcy; notes that the association will now provide financial assistance, albeit limited, to the many homeowners affected, and further notes that this U-turn by the government has taken place only in the face of an imminent election but that the citizens of Glasgow will see it for what it is.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5777</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Essential Services for Head Injuries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that there may be around 100,000 head injuries per year in Scotland for which adequate facilities should be available for assessment and rehabilitation within the NHS; emphasises the need for such services, which should be routinely available to patients and their families and carers who frequently require counselling and support, especially when dealing with the personality changes that can arise from acute brain injury; notes that relatives&rsquo; confidence can be shattered when staff are removed, as in the case of a nurse from the Physical Disability Rehabilitation Unit at the Southern General Hospital who was withdrawn and returned to ward duties due to lack of funding, leaving a hole in this essential service, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that such services are not comprised by lack of funding in future.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5776</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>The Inshore Fishing (Prohibited Methods of Fishing) (Firth of Lorn) (No. 2) Order 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Environment and Rural Development Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Inshore Fishing (Prohibited Methods of Fishing) (Firth of Lorn) (No. 2) Order 2007 (SSI 2007/240).</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5775.1</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> <strong>Celebrating Success in Scottish Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5775) in the name of Hugh Henry, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports giving top priority to ensuring that our education system enables every child to find fulfilment according to his or her ability, aptitude and inclination; believes that head teachers should have greater freedom to make decisions relating to their schools, in co-operation with parents and pupils, and further believes that particular areas for giving greater control include budgets, permanent exclusions, wearing of uniforms, setting, and the continuing professional development of teachers in their schools.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5775.2</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Celebrating Success in Scottish Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5775) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end &quot;but regrets that too many PPP schools contracts are not meeting the high standards of design and architecture that our young people deserve in their futures, is worried about the low rate of take-up of the Chartered Teacher scheme and concerned that opportunities for outdoor education and education in the outdoors are severely limited by a lack of facilities, lack of trained staff, lack of investment and lack of any commitment to outdoor education and education in the outdoors as key components of A Curriculum for Excellence.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5775.3</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Celebrating Success in Scottish Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5775) in the name of Hugh Henry, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;congratulates staff, teachers and pupils in schools and centres across Scotland for the contribution that they are making to the delivery of excellent learning and teaching; recognises that it is the duty of government to provide stewardship to drive standards forward, providing leadership and direction for a strong Scottish education system for the purpose of self-improvement and a healthier, wealthier and socially and environmentally more responsible Scotland, and notes that the following can all contribute to this aim: early intervention to increase nursery provision and identify and serve additional support needs at an early stage, cutting class sizes in primary 1-3 to 18 and maintaining teacher numbers in the face of falling school rolls to cut class sizes in secondary so that every child gets the attention they deserve and to ensure that essential literacy and numeracy skills are developed, embedding Scottish history, culture and heritage in school life, offering vocational courses from S3 onwards with parity of esteem for academic courses, introducing a new languages and science baccalaureate recognising top performance at Higher level to encourage take-up of these subjects, focussing on support for those pupils particularly from families living in poverty who are currently left behind in society and continuing the planned school building and refurbishment programme but providing councils with an alternative funding scheme to provide better value for money and access to communities and clubs to schools at evenings and weekends.&quot;</p>
