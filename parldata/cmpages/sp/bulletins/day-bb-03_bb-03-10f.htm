          <p><strong>*S1M-4003#</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Island Transport</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises that reliable, regular and affordable air 
            and sea transport links are vital to the social and economic well-being 
            of the Scottish islands; welcomes the proposal from the Highlands 
            and Islands Strategic Transport Partnership for improved air services 
            in the Highlands and Islands backed by public service obligations; 
            believes that the introduction of public service obligations provides 
            an opportunity to ensure that the specified air services' timetables 
            link in with those for ferry and bus services, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should take this opportunity to provide the 
            islands with a properly integrated transport service.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4002</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Partick Bulk Uplift 
            Service</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the initiative of Partick 
            Housing Association in piloting a new service for the uplift of bulk 
            and large items of household rubbish and for the cleansing of backcourt 
            areas in all the properties it factors; condemns, however, the decision 
            of Glasgow City Council to withdraw the bulk uplift service in September 
            2002 that resulted in a serious detrimental impact on the quality 
            of the environment with streets and backcourts becoming littered with 
            household rubbish, and, whilst commending the initiative of Partick 
            Housing Association, believes that these services should be provided 
            by the local authority and calls on Glasgow City Council to restore 
            its bulk uplift service throughout Glasgow at the earliest possible 
            time.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4001</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: GreenCity Wholefoods 
            25th Anniversary</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates GreenCity 
            Wholefoods workers' co-operative based in Dennistoun, Glasgow, on 
            reaching its 25th anniversary, which it is celebrating in May 2003; 
            notes that GreenCity Wholefoods is a non-exploitative workplace that 
            takes into consideration the interests of workers, the community and 
            the environment as a whole, and wishes continued success to GreenCity 
            in its activities of supplying natural foods throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4000</strong> <strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: The General 
            and Specialist Medical Practice (Education, Training and Qualifications) 
            Order 2003</strong>-That the Health and Community Care Committee, 
            in consideration of the draft General and Specialist Medical Practice 
            (Education, Training and Qualifications) Order 2003, recommends that 
            the Order be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Malcolm Chisholm, Mr Frank McAveety</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3999#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Promotion for 
            First Division Champions</strong>-That the Parliament believes that 
            promotion to the Scottish Premier League should be based on footballing 
            merit rather than arbitrarily set criteria that discriminate against 
            clubs of modest means and therefore believes that the Scottish Premier 
            League should ensure that the champions of the First Division of the 
            Scottish Football League are given the opportunity of promotion to 
            the Scottish Premier League provided they have guaranteed use of a 
            suitable stadium, whether through ownership or lease or a ground-sharing 
            arrangement.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing, Mr Brian Monteith, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, 
            Irene McGugan, Colin Campbell, Margo MacDonald, Helen Eadie, Mr John

            Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-3997</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: T in the Park</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the annual T in the 
            Park music festival on its 10th anniversary this year; welcomes the 
            recent launch of this year's event; notes the success of the venture 
            in previous years; acknowledges the contribution that the festival 
            makes to the tourism industry in Scotland; welcomes the opportunities 
            it affords new musical talent in Scotland to be showcased, and wishes 
            T in the Park every success for this year's event.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3996#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Spring Day in 
            Europe</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the European Commission's 
            initiative &quot;Spring Day in Europe&quot; which will take place 
            on 21 March 2003; notes the Commission's invitation to secondary schools 
            across the European Union to participate by promoting discussion on 
            the future of Europe; acknowledges the usefulness and importance of 
            encouraging young people to participate in the debate on the challenges 
            that lie ahead in reforming the European Union; recognises the importance 
            of hearing about the expectations of tomorrow's citizens in this important 
            debate; appreciates the need for co-operation at all levels of government 
            to promote this initiative; notes the Scottish Executive's efforts 
            to raise awareness of the day by contacting representatives of local 
            authorities across Scotland, and wishes all secondary schools in Scotland 
            that will be participating in &quot;Spring Day in Europe&quot; every 
            success.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3995#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie: Lochgelly High School 
            Pipe Bands and Drum Corps - Congratulations</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the recent announcement by the Scottish Executive that additional 
            money is to be made available to enable more students to enjoy the 
            opportunity to learn music in schools; congratulates Lochgelly High 
            School's two pipe bands on their recent achievements and is especially 
            proud that the drum corps, as well as being the world champion, is 
            also British and Cowal champions; further notes that the Novice Juvenile 
            Band is currently Fife, Scottish, Cowal and British champion, winning 
            the coveted Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association's Champion of Champions 
            title for the season and that the Juvenile Band is currently Fife 
            and British champion; believes that these bands show young people 
            in the very best light, particularly against other bands up to the 
            19 years age limit but have competed in other Highland Games competitions 
            in Bathgate, Crieff, Thornton, Markinch and Strathmiglo against older, 
            adult bands and, even against such &quot;hairy-kneed&quot; opposition, 
            have won eight firsts, four seconds and one third; supports such splendid 
            achievements, and considers that the First Minister should reward 
            them by inviting them to participate in the USA Tartan Day Celebrations 
            this year.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Brian Fitzpatrick, Scott Barrie</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3994</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: Public Library Services</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the delivery of the People's Network whereby 
            all public libraries in every Scottish constituency will have free 
            public internet access by the end of March 2003, thanks to the biggest 
            single investment in public libraries since the days of Andrew Carnegie; 
            recognises the 150th anniversary of public libraries, and celebrates 
            World Book Day on 6 March 2003.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John Home Robertson, Scott Barrie, Brian Fitzpatrick</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3993</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie: Proposed Redundancies 
            at Solectron, Dunfermline</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            deep concern the announcement of 4 March 2003 by Solectron Corporation 
            that it is proposing to reduce its workforce in Dunfermline by up 
            to 330 people; expresses the hope that the redundancies will not come 
            about and that Solectron and all the key agencies involved will work 
            to this end; recognises that trade unions will be fully involved throughout 
            the consultation period, and calls on the Scottish Executive, Scottish 
            Enterprise Fife and Solectron, in the event that the redundancies 
            do take place, to ensure that those made redundant are given redundancy 
            packages that recognise the excellent service they have provided to 
            Solectron and that every possible assistance is given to those made 
            redundant to ensure that they are afforded proper retraining opportunities, 
            if required, in order to find alternative employment.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Helen Eadie, Sarah Boyack, Mr Michael McMahon, Mr Keith 
            Raffan, Mr Kenneth Macintosh, Mr John McAllion, Paul Martin, Brian 
            Fitzpatrick, Bill Butler, Trish Godman, Mr Kenneth Gibson, Angus MacKay<strong>*</strong>,

            Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Janis Hughes<strong>*</strong>, Pauline 
            McNeill<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-3993.1</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Proposed Redundancies 
            at Solectron, Dunfermline</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3993) 
            in the name of Scott Barrie, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out from 
            &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot; and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive, Scottish Enterprise Fife and Solectron, in conjunction 
            with the trade unions, to work together, with some urgency, on a rescue 
            plan to ensure that any redundancies are averted or kept to an absolute 
            minimum.&quot;</a></p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3992</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: UN Resolutions on 
            Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges that the two legal 
            opinions published by Matrix Chambers indicate that neither United 
            Nations Resolution 1441 nor the draft second resolution presently 
            before the United Nations authorise the use of military action against 
            Iraq; recognises that the weight of public opinion is that war on 
            Iraq is not justified at least until a second resolution, clearly 
            authorising the use of military action against Iraq, is agreed by 
            the whole United Nations; recognises that neither Resolution 1441 
            nor the draft second resolution is the justification that many people 
            in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom are demanding before 
            military action is taken; recognises that military action taken on 
            the basis of either resolution could be illegal, leaving the UK and 
            the United States of America governments open to action before the 
            International Criminal Court; calls on Her Majesty's Government to 
            withdraw support for military action on the basis of Resolution 1441 
            or the draft second resolution; remains unconvinced that there is 
            sufficient evidence of the threat from the Iraqi regime to justify 
            a war on Iraq that is certain to result in many thousands of civilian 
            deaths and casualties, and believes that peaceful means to resolve 
            the crisis have not been exhausted and must be pursued.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Gil Paterson, Christine Grahame, Mr John McAllion</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3990</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Nursery Nurses</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that there are 7,500 nursery nurses working in 
            Scotland's nursery schools, day nurseries and special schools who 
            are paid different rates in different establishments in different 
            parts of the country; further notes that these nursery nurses have 
            been campaigning for two years for a review of their status and pay 
            in order to establish a formal career structure and a national pay 
            agreement in recognition of their important role in the education 
            service, and urges all parties involved in these negotiations to bring 
            about an early resolution to this issue.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3989</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: UNESCO World 
            Book Day 6 March 2003</strong>-That the Parliament notes that World 
            Book Day events in the United Kingdom and Ireland will take place 
            on Thursday 6 March 2003, a date chosen to fall within school term 
            times; notes that 23 April 2003, the date originally designated by 
            UNESCO in 1995, marks the birth and death of William Shakespeare, 
            the greatest literary talent these islands have ever produced; believes 
            that under the patronage of Baron Renfrew, King James VI and I, Shakespeare 
            wrote some of his finest works including <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Antony 
            and Cleopatra</em> and <em>The Tempest</em>; considers these works 
            to be among the first cultural masterpieces of the newly united kingdoms, 
            proof of the defining bonds between Scotland and England and central 
            to our place in the world and our sense of ourselves, and further 
            considers that everyone in Scotland should be supported and encouraged 
            to participate in UNESCO's sixth World Book Day and that encouraging 
            young people particularly to engage with the written word opens immeasurable 
            life-enhancing opportunities and would be the most fitting tribute 
            to the genius of William Shakespeare, the first great Briton.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3988</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell: Maternity and Paediatric 
            Services at the Inverclyde Royal Hospital, Greenock</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the ongoing threat to maternity 
            and paediatric services at the Inverclyde Royal Hospital in Greenock 
            and further notes that, in the spirit of the Scottish Executive's 
            <em>Partnership for Care: Scotland's Health White Paper</em>, any 
            reduction in maternity or paediatric services would seriously undermine 
            the Executive's key philosophy of a patient-focused health service 
            in Scotland. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-3987#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: International Women's 
            Day</strong>-That the Parliament notes the significance of International 
            Women's Day on 8 March 2003; welcomes the fact that this observance 
            continues to recognise the struggles and achievements of women throughout 
            history and highlights the ongoing plight of women across the world; 
            acknowledges the impact that campaigning organisations such as Zero 
            Tolerance, now celebrating its tenth year in operation, have had on 
            the lives and experiences of many women within our own country, and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure continued support 
            for such organisations and congratulates Zero Tolerance on their 10 
            years of campaigning on the issue of violence against women in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3975</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Departure of Black 
            Watch Regiment to the Gulf</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            departure of the Black Watch Regiment to the Gulf on 27 February 2003 
            in anticipation of possible military action against Iraq; hopes that, 
            even at this late stage, military action can be averted by Saddam 
            Hussein agreeing to disarm, but, in the event of troops requiring 
            to be committed, wishes the members of the Black Watch a successful 
            campaign and a speedy return to loved ones at home.</p>

            of clerking and reporting, corporate affairs, legal services, and 
            communications technologies, the staff of the Clerk/Chief Executive's

          <p> <strong>S1M-3973</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Regulation of Private 
            Security Industry</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the continuing 
            anxiety of local communities caused by the unregulated activities 
            of some private security firms; believes that an unregulated private 
            security industry poses a threat to local communities and to the peace 
            of local neighbourhoods, and urges the Scottish Executive to take 
            action to regulate the sector and to ensure that it cannot be used 
            to support criminal activity and that its activities are open to public 
            scrutiny.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3972#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Jack Vettriano 
            - Award of Honorary Doctorate by St Andrew's University</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the decision of St Andrew's University to 
            award an honorary doctorate to Jack Vettriano; recognises the contribution 
            he has made to the arts in Scotland, and considers that the directors 
            of the National Galleries of Scotland should<strong> </strong>acquire 
            some of Jack Vettriano's paintings to ensure that the works of one 
            of the foremost artists in Scotland are displayed for the benefit 
            of the people of Scotland and for the many thousands of overseas visitors 
            who visit Scotland every year. </p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3953#</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson: New Forth 
            Road Bridge Crossing Near Kincardine</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the completion of the A907; notes the current intention of 
            the Scottish Executive to reopen the Stirling to Alloa and Kincardine 
            rail link by 2005 and construct a new Forth road bridge crossing by 
            2007; further notes the benefits to the economy of Clackmannanshire 
            that will result from these infrastructure improvements; notes, however, 
            that the recent decision for the favoured site of a new acute hospital 
            for Forth Valley to be at the Royal Scottish National Hospital, Larbert, 
            will have significant implications for the road networks to the south 
            of the Forth road crossing, and considers that the Executive should 
            ensure that the design of this network and its date of completion 
            are expedited in order to ensure the safety of patients in Ochil and 
            Stirling constituencies as well as those from the west of Fife.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3932#</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Post Office Card 
            Accounts</strong>-That the Parliament believes that those post office 
            customers in Scotland who wish to continue receiving their benefits, 
            pensions payments and tax credits through the Post Office, following 
            the introduction of automated credit transfer in April 2003, should 
            be allowed to do so through a post office card account opened at the 
            counter of a post office or sub-post office; further believes that 
            customers should be offered a genuine choice between the options available, 
            including a post office card account; supports the National Federation 
            of SubPostmasters' call that there should be no administrative obstacles 
            to customers opening a post office card account; notes the importance 
            of post office card accounts to the future financial viability of 
            sub-post offices, and considers that Scottish ministers should work 
            with Her Majesty's Government to ensure that there is a level playing 
            field in the marketing, promotion and advertising of the banking options 
            from all departments of Her Majesty's Government, including the Department 
            for Work and Pensions, the Inland Revenue and the Veterans Agency, 
            the Scottish Executive and its agencies and local authorities. </p>
