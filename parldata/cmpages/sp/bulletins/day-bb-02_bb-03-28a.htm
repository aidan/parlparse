          <dir> 
            <p>Thursday 28 March 2002</p>
            <p>9.30 am&#9;Debate on Transport&#151; </p>
            <p><strong>S1M-2945</strong> <strong>David Mundell:</strong> <strong>Transport</strong>&#151;That 
              the Parliament notes the importance of transport to the economy 
              in delivering growth and investment to Scotland; further notes that 
              the Scottish Executive&#146;s stewardship of transport issues has 
              been characterised by chaos and muddle, evidenced by strikes, increased 
              congestion, poor maintenance of local roads and unreliable public 
              transport; regrets that the long-awaited transport delivery plan 
              launched by the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong 
              Learning on 21 March 2002 contains no concrete plans for funding 
              and delivering desperately needed improvements to Scotland&#146;s 
              transport infrastructure and services and, in particular, gives 
              no details of new trunk road improvements beyond 2004-05, and calls 
              upon the Executive to make a clear commitment to investing in transport 
              for the benefit of the economy and the travelling public. </p>

                <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
                <p><strong>S1M-2945.2</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald: Transport</strong>&#151;As 
                  an amendment to motion (S1M-2945) in the name of David Mundell, 
                  leave out from &quot;further notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes 
                  the publication of Scotland&#146;s Transport: Delivering Improvements 
                  which sets out the Scottish Executive&#146;s transport vision 
                  for Scotland; endorses this Executive-led vision of an efficient, 
                  safe transport system which meets the needs of all in society: 
                  individuals and businesses, car and public transport users, 
                  cyclists and pedestrians, whilst protecting our environment 
                  and promoting sustainable development; commends the integrated 
                  package of measures that the Executive is pursuing: tackling 
                  congestion, ensuring greater access to a modernised and improved 
                  public transport system, promoting alternative modes of transport 
                  to the private car, and targeted motorway and trunk roads improvements, 
                  and further commends the specific articulation in this transport 
                  delivery report of the Executive&#146;s top priorities for delivery.&quot;</p>
                <p><strong>S1M-2945.1</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Transport</strong>&#151;As 
                  an amendment to motion (S1M-2945) in the name of David Mundell, 
                  leave out from &quot;unreliable&quot; to end and insert &quot;trunk 
                  roads and unreliable public transport; recognises that this 
                  is a result of decades of under-investment and misguided privatisation; 
                  regrets that the Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive has failed 
                  to reverse these damaging Tory policies, and further regrets 
                  that the Scottish Executive&#146;s latest transport strategy 
                  publication, Scotland&#146;s Transport: Delivering Improvements, 
                  provides no programme, no costings and no timescale, and therefore 
                  offers little hope for, or commitment to, improvements in Scotland&#146;s 
                  transport infrastructure.&quot; </p>

            <p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Debate on Enterprise and Scotland&#151; </p>
            <p><strong>S1M-2946</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> 
              <strong>Enterprise and Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
              notes with concern the relatively poor performance of the Scottish 
              economy compared to that of the UK economy as a whole; believes 
              that public funding of enterprise programmes should be focused on 
              infrastructure improvements which benefit all businesses; further 
              notes the damaging effects of the higher business rate poundage 
              in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK, and supports the reintroduction 
              of a uniform business rate across the UK and calls for a fundamental 
              review of the role and functions of the enterprise network, both 
              with the objective of improving growth and competitiveness in the 
              Scottish economy. </p>

                <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
                <p><strong>S1M-2946.2</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Enterprise 
                  and Scotland</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-2946) 
                  in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; 
                  to end and insert &quot;welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
                  initiatives to improve Scotland&#146;s economic position and 
                  its new economic strategy for Scotland based on science and 
                  skills; believes that the Scottish Executive should build consensus 
                  behind this new strategy; notes the significant progress already 
                  made in establishing the conditions for sustained success in 
                  relation to our key objectives: global connections, growing 
                  businesses, and skills and learning, and welcomes the clear 
                  direction given to the enterprise network through Smart, Successful 
                  Scotland to work with the Scottish Executive to deliver this 
                  vision.&quot; </p>
                <p> <strong>S1M-2946.1</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Enterprise 
                  and Scotland</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-2946) 
                  in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;as 
                  a whole&quot; to end and insert &quot;and competitor European 
                  economies over the post war period; further notes that the efforts 
                  of enterprise development agencies and initiatives within the 
                  uniform UK economic policy regime have had no apparent effect 
                  on our relative economic decline throughout the period and that 
                  the gap in performance would appear to have widened more recently; 
                  believes that the policy and debate in Scotland has so far been 
                  focused on dealing with the symptoms of this relative economic 
                  decline rather than its root causes, and calls for a refocusing 
                  of the political debate in Scotland on the potential for the 
                  acquisition and use of the range of financial and economic powers 
                  available to competitor states such as Ireland and Finland and 
                  the optimal policy mix required to place the Scottish economy 
                  at the competitive advantage required to achieve faster growth, 
                  higher living standards and an improved revenue stream to resource 
                  sustained investment in public services.&quot; </p>
