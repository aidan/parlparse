          <p>9.30 am&#9;Executive Debate on Reforming Child Protection in Scotland-</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-593</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Reforming 
            Child Protection in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that 
            keeping Scotland's children and young people safe from harm and neglect 
            must be a priority for all; agrees the importance of having a sustainable 
            programme of reform of child protection services; notes the progress 
            on the three-year child protection reform programme and future plans, 
            and supports the Scottish Executive's decision to require local authorities, 
            NHS boards and the police to review their practices in respect of 
            child protection, take action where there are weaknesses, ensure that 
            there are robust quality assurance processes in place and continue 
            with initiatives to ensure that there are sufficient and well-trained 
            social workers to meet current and projected needs. </P>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-593.3</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Reforming Child 
            Protection in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-593) 
            in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;continue&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot; acknowledges its own role in increasing the 
            scale, pace and range of staff recruitment in social work and child 
            care and protection to ensure there are sufficient, well-paid staff 
            to meet current and projected needs, and agrees to review the role 
            and powers of the Social Work Services Inspectorate in this area.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-593.1</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Reforming Child 
            Protection in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-593) 
            in the name of Peter Peacock, insert at end &quot;; acknowledges the 
            findings of Susan O'Brien QC's inquiry into the death of Caleb Ness, 
            and as a result calls for greatly improved co-operation and communication 
            between agencies along with new arrangements that encourage greater 
            responsibility and accountability within the child protection system.&quot; 
          </P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-593.2</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne: Reforming 
            Child Protection in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-593) 
            in the name of Peter Peacock, insert at end &quot;; notes the continuing 
            shortage of social workers, particularly in the child and family teams 
            and that the current initiatives will not produce sufficient new workers 
            to fill these vacancies and replace those due to retire; recognises 
            that the current situation of local authorities competing with each 
            other to attract staff is counter-productive; notes that there is 
            a need to invest significantly to retain and attract future staff; 
            regrets the continuing scapegoating of social workers when things 
            go wrong which only serves to undermine the confidence of staff and 
            contributes to the difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff, 
            and recognises the extremely valuable work that social workers carry 
            out every day making significant contributions to the lives of children 
            and their families.&quot; </P>

          <p><strong>S2M-481</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Women's 
            Social and Political Union</strong>-That the Parliament notes that, 
            on 10 October 1903, a group of women met in the Manchester home of 
            Emmeline Pankhurst and founded the Women's Social and Political Union, 
            which became known as the suffragette movement, with the aim of recruiting 
            more working class women into the struggle for the vote and believes 
            that this centenary year should be marked by efforts to promote the 
            participation of women in the democratic process. </P>
