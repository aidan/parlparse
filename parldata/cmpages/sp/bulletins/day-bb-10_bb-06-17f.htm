<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6596&diams;   Linda Fabiani: Caring for Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that figures produced for the Scottish Government suggest that approximately 20% of people with learning disabilities live and are cared for in the family home by family members over the age of 65; recognises the particular concerns and needs of these families, as noted by Public Petition PE743 submitted by Madge Clark and Jeanette Kelly of the Murray Owen Carers Group, East Kilbride, which first raised the issue in the Scottish Parliament on 24 May 2004; welcomes and invites support for the <em>Charter for Change: Improving Lives for Older Families Which Include People with Learning Disabilities</em>, launched in Edinburgh on 16 June 2010, and looks forward to publication and implementation of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s carers strategy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6581.1 Jeremy Purvis: Poverty Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6581) in the name of Alex Neil, insert at end &quot;, and believes that the Scottish Government should introduce a fairer pay policy that gives a real-terms pay increase to those on the lowest wages in the public sector while paying no bonuses to higher earning staff in 2010-11 and 2011-12.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6581.2 Johann Lamont: Poverty Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6581) in the name of Alex Neil, leave out from &quot;to take&quot; to end and insert &quot;; further notes the findings of research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust that child, pensioner and overall poverty fell faster in Scotland than in any other part of the United Kingdom during the period of the previous UK administration, led by Labour, but notes concerns raised by anti-poverty organisations, such as Save the Children and the Poverty Alliance, that single outcome agreements do not give sufficient priority to meeting shared poverty targets and have created further problems in terms of monitoring progress and accountability; therefore urges the Scottish Government to review the impact of the concordat and single outcome agreements to ensure a clearer focus on reducing poverty and that measures are put in place to monitor progress made at the national level, and further, in this European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion and given the critical role for the Scottish Government in tackling poverty, calls on it to report to the Parliament detailing how it will use all the powers at its disposal to tackle poverty and disadvantage.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6580.2 Margaret Smith: Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6580) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;, and notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s package of education failures includes the abandonment of SNP election commitments to reduce class sizes in P1 to P3 to 18, dump student debt and match brick for brick the previous administration&rsquo;s school building programme.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6580.3 Michael Russell: Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6580) in the name of Des McNulty, leave outfrom &quot;or even&quot; to end and insert &quot;employment; further notes the unanimous recommendation of the Curriculum for Excellence Management Board, including the representatives of the major teaching unions, that implementation in secondary schools should begin in August 2010; notes the announcement of a 10-point plan to support implementation including an additional &pound;3 million, tailored help for secondary schools that need it, increased training for teachers and improved practical materials; recognises that the Curriculum for Excellence embodies the cross-party recommendations of the 2002 report by the Education, Culture and Sport Committee into the purposes of education, and calls on the Scottish Government to listen to teachers&rsquo; and parents&rsquo; concerns over the new curriculum and reach an early agreement with local authorities and teachers organisations that guarantees the necessary preparation time and resources for successful implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence.&quot;</p>
