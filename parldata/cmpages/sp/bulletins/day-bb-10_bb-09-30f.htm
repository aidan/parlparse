<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7123 David Stewart: Graduated Driving Licence Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the research carried out by Dr Sarah Jones from Cardiff University in relation to the graduated driving licence scheme; notes in particular the research carried out in Scotland, which identified that, while road traffic collisions among older drivers were falling, those occurring among younger drivers remain unchanged; supports the view that, if such a scheme was introduced in Scotland, up to 22 lives per year on average could be saved from fatal collisions, with over 1,000 casualties being avoided; believes that up to &pound;80 million could be saved every year with the introduction of a graduated driving licence scheme, and urges the Scottish Executive to work with the Department for Transport to implement a pilot scheme in the Highlands to evaluate whether this can help to reduce the deaths of young people on Scotland&rsquo;s roads.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7122 Stuart McMillan: Alcohol Awareness Week 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Alcohol Awareness Week, which is scheduled to run from 4 to 10 October 2010; notes that Alcohol Awareness Week is an initiative that brings together the Scottish Government, the alcohol industry, health professionals and the voluntary sector to promote a joined-up message about drinking alcohol responsibly; further notes that this is Scotland&rsquo;s fourth Alcohol Awareness Week and that it includes a joint programme of events designed to provide useful information about responsible drinking; acknowledges the efforts of the Scottish Government to tackle alcohol misuse through introducing the Alcohol etc. (Scotland) Bill, and strongly urges all politicians to support the bill when it is debated in the Scottish Parliament at Stage 3 and back the raft of measures that the Scottish Government wishes to introduce, including a 45p minimum unit price on alcohol, to tackle what is considered to be the scourge of alcohol misuse on society.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7121 Nanette Milne: Asthma UK Scotland&rsquo;s Model of Good Asthma Care for Adults and Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the model of good asthma care for adults and children with asthma that has been produced by Asthma UK Scotland; notes that it was reported that, in the year to 31 March 2010, there were 6,272 hospital stays where asthma was recorded as the main symptom, including 555 in NHS Grampian, and encourages NHS boards to implement the model in order to help reduce hospital admissions and improve the quality of life for the 368,000 people with asthma.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7120 Jamie Hepburn: Opening of Scotland&rsquo;s Largest Food Waste Recycling Facility</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the official opening of Scotland&rsquo;s largest waste recycling facility at Deerdykes in Cumbernauld by the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment on 28 September 2010; considers that this state-of-the-art anaerobic digestion facility will make a considerable contribution to reducing waste and provide a boost not only for Cumbernauld but Scotland as a whole as the first such facility in the country, and expresses its hope that the opening of this combined anaerobic digestion and in-vessel composting plant is the first of many such facilities being opened in Scotland, which will help Scotland on the way to meeting its world-leading climate-change targets and provide a cleaner, greener and more sustainable environment.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7119 Murdo Fraser: Highland Perthshire in Cairngorms National Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the extension of the Cairngorms National Park to include parts of eastern and Highland Perthshire, which comes into force on 2 October 2010; considers that Blair Atholl is the natural southern gateway to the Cairngorms National Park; thanks all the organisations involved in ensuring that Blair Atholl and Highland Perthshire became included in the national park, including the Pitlochry Partnership, the John Muir Trust, the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, the Blair Atholl Area Tourism Association and many others; further considers that the Spittal of Glenshee is the natural eastern gateway to the national park and thanks all the organisations involved in ensuring that the boundary was extended to include it, and believes that these areas are now rightly part of the Cairngorms National Park and that this will give the local economy a boost.</p>
