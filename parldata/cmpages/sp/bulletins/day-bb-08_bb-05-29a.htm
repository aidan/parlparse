    <p> <strong>S3M-2002.1</strong> <strong>John Scott: Common Agricultural Policy Health Check</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2002) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;but, in so doing, notes the importance of consulting on the potential impact of progressive modulation on Scottish farms and affirms that any increases in European Union-wide modulation should be matched by a corresponding deduction in levels of voluntary modulation.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2002.2</strong> <strong>Jim Hume: Common Agricultural Policy Health Check</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2002) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;considers that any increase in compulsory modulation must be offset by a corresponding reduction in voluntary modulation to ensure that Scottish producers are not put at a competitive disadvantage within the European Union; further considers that Scotland, with its high proportion of large farm units, must not be disadvantaged by proposals for progressive modulation or capping; believes that, in light of rapidly escalating food and fuel costs, the Scottish Rural Development Programme should be reviewed, with the production of food and food security considered as a key priority, and recognises the correlation between economic activity on the ground and delivery of environmental benefits for all. </p>

<p><strong>2.55 pm</strong>&#9;Scottish Government Debate: Moving Scotland Forward&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-2001</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Moving Scotland Forward</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the many decisions taken over the last 12 months to make Scotland a wealthier, greener, healthier, safer and smarter nation, including the reduction in business rates for 150,000 small business properties, the funding to put more police on Scotland&rsquo;s streets, the new partnership with local government and the cross-party initiatives to tackle problems related to drugs, alcohol and tobacco; further welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to more open government and its proposals on proactive publication of material across government and, in particular, the pilot project within the environment portfolio; looks forward to a range of proposals from the Scottish Government with regard to climate change, patients&rsquo; rights, criminal justice, marine policy, safeguarding rural schools and driving forward the Curriculum for Excellence, and believes that many of the measures already agreed by the Parliament to improve the lives of people living in Scotland will be undermined unless the UK Government takes action to tackle rising costs of fuel and food. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2001.2</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: Moving Scotland Forward</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2001) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;condemns the self-congratulation and lack of positive policies for the future in the First Minster&rsquo;s statement on Moving Scotland Forward on 14 May 2008; recognises the many SNP broken promises on a whole range of manifesto commitments, from dumping student debt to providing a &pound;2,000 grant to first-time buyers, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward substantive policies to address climate change, skills development, affordable housing shortages, health inequalities and the other big challenges that confront Scotland. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</p>
      <p><strong>S3M-2001.2.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> Moving Scotland Forward&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-2001.2) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &quot;and further calls on the Scottish Government to work constructively with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government on these and other issues for the benefit of the Scottish people, thus demonstrating the benefits of our historic union with England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a union which continues to attract overwhelming public support.&quot; </p>
      <p> <strong>S3M-2001.1</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Moving Scotland Forward</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2001) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;is concerned that the First Minister&rsquo;s statement on Moving Scotland Forward lacked substance, failed to justify the many promises broken by the SNP over the last 12 months and failed to address the long-term issues facing Scotland; welcomes the cross-party initiatives to tackle problems related to drugs, alcohol and tobacco, the commitment to drive forward the previous administration&rsquo;s Curriculum for Excellence and the pilot scheme on environmental information; calls for a substantial extension of the bodies covered by the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002; believes that the statement was a missed opportunity to bring forward a coherent energy strategy; calls for the introduction of a minimum income guarantee for students, and further calls on the Scottish Government to empower children and young people to have the best possible start in life by attacking the causes of early disadvantage.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong>&#9;Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#9;Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-1626</strong> <strong>Angela Constance:</strong> <strong>No Recourse No Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of <em>No Recourse No Safety: The Government&rsquo;s Failure to Protect Women from Violence</em>, a report by Amnesty International and the Southall Black Sisters; is disturbed by the evidence that not having recourse to public funds prevents women with insecure immigration status from accessing the benefits they need to claim refuge, effectively trapping women in violence or destitution; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to tackling violence against women, continuing the good work commenced by the previous Scottish administration; acknowledges the pivotal contribution of local services such as the West Lothian Council Domestic Abuse Service which provides a service to women from a minority population; notes that not having recourse to public funds affects women who have valid visas as spouses, students, visitors and workers and those who are classed as &quot;overstayers&quot; in addition to victims of trafficking; acknowledges that organisations such as West Lothian Women&rsquo;s Aid are accommodating and assisting women with no recourse to public funds, and commends the recommendations of <em>No Recourse No Safety</em>, in particular the need for the Scottish Government to put in place emergency funding while a permanent solution from the UK Government is sought, namely exempting women fleeing violence from the no recourse to public funds requirement. </p>
