<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1614</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>Fifth Anniversary of the Start of the Iraq War</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament observes that Thursday 20 March 2008 is the fifth anniversary of the start of the Iraq war; expresses its sympathy for the families and friends of the 174 British troops, over 4,000 troops from other countries and over 80,000 civilians who have been killed in the war so far; regrets that the war has involved the expenditure of &pound;6.5 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money; notes that the war was entered into on the basis of poor intelligence and insufficient planning and that the reasoning of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government in deciding to enter the war is still not known, and therefore calls for a full public inquiry to help to ensure that British forces are not involved in such ill-conceived campaigns in the future.</p>
<p>Supported by: Iain Smith<strong>*</strong>, Liam McArthur<strong>*</strong>, Mike Rumbles<strong>*</strong>, Ross Finnie<strong>*</strong>, Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Alison McInnes<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Smith<strong>*</strong>, Jim Tolson<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Jim Hume<strong>*</strong>, Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell<strong>*</strong>, Jeremy Purvis<strong>*</strong>, Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, John Farquhar Munro<strong>*</strong>, Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1613</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Parliamentary Launch of Designing Lighting for People with Dementia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of <em>Designing Lighting for People with Dementia, </em>a new pamphlet which demonstrates how appropriate use of lighting can significantly help people with dementia to understand their environment; acknowledges the importance of research into dementia which can provide improved levels of support and treatment for suffers and allow carers to better manage the condition; congratulates those involved, including the Dementia Services Development Centre at the University of Stirling, the Institute of Lighting Engineers and Vision Call, on the collaborative work which allowed the launch to take place in the Parliament on 20 March 2008, and agrees that studies such as this will help to ensure that Scotland is prepared for the estimated increase in the number of people with dementia over the course of the next 30 years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1612</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Scottish Campaign for Cardiac Rehabilitation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Scottish Campaign for Cardiac Rehabilitation, led by British Heart Foundation Scotland and Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland; supports the campaign&rsquo;s aim for all patients to have access to a high-quality cardiac rehabilitation programme; notes that cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to reduce the chances of dying of heart disease by up to a third and is very cost effective in comparison to other treatments; is aware that, although cardiac rehabilitation is provided for up to 60% of people who have had heart attacks or heart bypass operations, access is still limited amongst many groups, including women and people in deprived or remote and rural communities; is concerned that for certain other heart conditions, such as chronic angina and heart failure, the level of provision of cardiac rehabilitation for patients is very low; believes that, with at least 190,000 people in Scotland already living with significant heart disease, a robust and well-resourced national approach to cardiac rehabilitation is essential to allow our health service to cope with increasing numbers of people living with heart conditions in the future, and urges the Scottish Government and NHSScotland to ensure that the campaign&rsquo;s policy calls are implemented in full.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1611#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Bullwood Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the ambition, energy, tenacity and vision of the Bullwood Project, a self-help group based in the Pollok parliamentary constituency; notes the creativity and environmental benefits of its work and that it is working towards being a self-sustaining social enterprise; supports social enterprises which make a real difference in our communities; applauds particularly the Bullwood Project&rsquo;s contribution to Scotland Week in New York in producing the largest caber in the world; congratulates the project on being invited by the Tartan Day Parade Committee to march in the parade on 5 April 2008, and believes that this caber is an imaginative way of communicating Scotland&rsquo;s message of friendship and humanity to all those who will participate in the Scotland Week celebration and will see the caber as it is exhibited in the USA.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1610#</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Young Drivers - Reducing the Death Toll</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that one in three fatal road accidents in Scotland last year involved young people under the age of 25 and that three quarters of those crashes happened on rural roads; notes that this is particularly true in the Grampian region where 40% of fatalities were young drivers and so welcomes&nbsp;<em>The Press and Journal&rsquo;s</em> Young Driver of the Year competition; further welcomes the competition entrants&rsquo; innovative recommendations on how the death toll on the roads could be reduced, and considers that all these recommendations should be examined in detail to see which proposals could be taken forward to improve the safety of young drivers in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1609</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Reducing Smoking in Young People: The Social Norms Approach</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s announcement of an additional &pound;3 million a year to support a new action plan on smoking; notes the continued development of a network of smoking cessation services across Scotland and the NHS Lothian project offering confidential guidance for 12 to 15-year-olds in schools, and urges the NHS and the Scottish Government not to overlook the highly effective social norms approach in their efforts to reduce smoking in youngsters.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1608</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>New Sponsorship Deal for Scotland&rsquo;s Under-21 Footballers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent news that the Scottish under-21 football team will be sponsored by the Scottish Government through the CashBack for Communities scheme; notes that the current sponsor, Tennent&rsquo;s, has agreed to donate its sponsorship rights for the under-21 team to the scheme, which uses the proceeds of crime to make a positive difference to the lives of young people throughout Scotland; believes that the new sponsorship deal will help drive awareness of the scheme among young people; also notes that the deal will see the CashBack for Communities scheme promoted on the training kit of the Scotland men&rsquo;s under-21 team as well as through trackside advertising at all home games, editorial and advertising in match programmes and access to the players for CashBack-related media opportunities, and further notes that the deal will also include 300 free tickets for each under-21 home game, to be used for competitions.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1607</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Conor McKay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends members of the Scottish Youth Parliament (SYP) for their ongoing work; endorses the SYP&rsquo;s belief that &quot;young people in Scotland have the right to have their views listened to and acted upon&quot;; notes the hard work and enthusiasm of Conor McKay, MSYP for Gordon, and congratulates him on winning the Member of the Year award.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1606</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Sparrowhawk Relocation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is aware that the Scottish Government is in the process of considering whether to issue a licence to the Scottish Homing Union for a trial project to translocate sparrowhawks at 15 racing pigeon lofts in central Scotland, ostensibly to test whether this measure protects racing pigeons from predation; expresses concern that the trial itself may not be lawful and that, regardless of this, any resulting licensed removal or killing of sparrowhawks may not be legal under Scottish legislation, including under the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004; notes recent research which shows that sparrowhawks take less than 1% of released racing pigeons annually and considers that, although this predation may be very distressing when witnessed, it is a negligible threat to the interests of pigeon fanciers; further notes research which shows that most racing pigeons that go missing are not killed by sparrowhawks and other birds of prey but stray off course or are lost to bad weather; believes, therefore, that there is no scientific justification for suggesting that the killing or removal of sparrowhawks is an appropriate or proportionate response to this issue and, while sympathising with those whose pigeons may have been affected by sparrowhawks, calls on the Scottish Government to recognise that this interest should be safeguarded by loft-based protective measures only and should not be given priority ahead of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s international responsibility to protect its raptor populations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1605</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>GM Crops</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proposals by the Welsh Assembly Government to make producers of genetically modified (GM) crops fully liable for any damage that these crops cause; believes that this policy will in effect amount to a complete ban on the planting of GM crops because of the significant scientific uncertainty about the associated risks; notes the support that this move has received from the Farmers Union of Wales as well as from RSPB and other environmental organisations; further notes the decision by Scottish Ministers to continue with a moratorium on the planting of GM crops, and calls on Scottish Ministers to go further and adopt the same type of full liability approach proposed in Wales.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1604</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>ExxonMobil and Venezuelan Oil Assets</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the High Court in London to suspend an earlier court order that froze US $12 billion (&pound;6 billion) of the assets of Venezuela&rsquo;s state oil firm, PDVSA; notes the comments of the Venezuelan Ambassador to the United Kingdom, who said that ExxonMobil had been using courts outside Venezuela to conduct a &quot;campaign of harassment against PDVSA around the world&quot;, and calls on all multi-national companies to respect the sovereign rights of countries to manage their natural resources as they see fit.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1603.2</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1603) in the name of Johann Lamont, after &quot;housing targets&quot; insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s provision of a real terms increase of 9% in affordable housing over the period of the comprehensive spending review falls far short of what is needed to address the affordable housing shortage.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1603.3</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1603) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from &quot;the SNP government&rsquo;s&quot; to end and insert &quot;the failure of the Labour and Liberal Democrat administration to tackle the chronic shortages of housing; notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase the rate of house building across all tenures from 25,000 to at least 35,000 houses per year by the middle of the next decade; welcomes the fact that the Housing Supply Task Force has brought together stakeholders from all sections of the housing sector to tackle blockages in the housing system; recognises that it is important to achieve value for money in, and increase the provision of, social rented housing while retaining the benefits of community-based provision and encourages the Scottish Government to continue to work with social housing providers to achieve that goal; further recognises the efforts of the Scottish Government to work together with housing associations, local authorities and the private sector to tackle the legacy of housing shortages; endorses the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to the 2012 target on homelessness, and calls on the Scottish Government to make a statement on Firm Foundations by the summer recess.&quot;</p>
