            Language Teaching and Research, University of Stirling, in collaboration 
            with Aberdeen City Council; notes with interest the overall aim of 
            the project for children to achieve a good level of literacy and numeracy 
            in both English and French by the end of their primary education; 
            congratulates the project co-ordinators on the success of the project 
            thus far, whereby primary 2 children are able to communicate and process 
            basic French; applauds the teachers, parents, co-ordinators and pupils 
            for their enthusiasm and dedication to the project; recognises the 
            importance of our young people being exposed to a European language; 
            notes the benefits that such language proficiency will have for their 
            future education and employment prospects; wishes the project every 
            success in its next phase, and calls for consideration to be given 
            to rolling the project out to other areas of Scotland.</p>
