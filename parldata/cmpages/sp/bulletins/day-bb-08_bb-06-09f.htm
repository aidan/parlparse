<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2091</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>National Liftshare Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets that there are approximately 38 million empty car seats on the United Kingdom&rsquo;s roads every weekday; welcomes National Liftshare Day on 9 June 2008, which aims to raise the profile of car sharing and to encourage and enable more people to give it a try; believes that car sharing is a simple and effective way of increasing individual mobility, helping motorists keep down their travel costs, reducing congestion on the roads and helping the environment by cutting harmful exhaust emissions; notes that, as fuel prices escalate, car sharing offers the opportunity for individuals to save money as well as do their bit towards saving the planet, and encourages individuals, communities, organisations and businesses to make 9 June the day that they give car sharing a try.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2090</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Veterans Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the two weeks of activities being held nationwide for Veterans Day 2008, and in particular those in Stirling running from 29 June to 13 July, to commemorate and raise awareness of the issues facing ex-service personnel; looks forward to the bagpipe procession through the city as part of the pipers&rsquo; trail on 12 July; believes in addition that there is particular poignancy to the inclusion of a screening of an Argentinean film about the Falklands War as part of the film festival; recognises the inputs of the wide range of charities doing excellent work to support this large, important and often extremely vulnerable section of Scottish society, and wishes both the organisations and the local authority the very best for the events.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2089</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Scottish Crime Survey</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the moves by the Home Office to extend the British Crime Survey to include under 16-year-olds; further notes that young people across the United Kingdom are more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators; recognises that young people are less likely to share details of minor incidents with their parents or the police; acknowledges the spate of serious and violent attacks in recent months across the UK; believes that extending the British Crime Survey will offer a greater understanding of how crime affects young people in England and Wales, allowing the gathering of more information which will better shape messages on encouraging young people not to carry knifes or engage in antisocial behaviour, and calls on the Scottish Government to extend the Scottish Crime Survey to cover under 16s.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2083</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Graham&rsquo;s: The Family Dairy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scotland&rsquo;s largest independent dairy, Graham&rsquo;s, for its fine achievement in winning another award at the Scottish Food and Drink Excellence Awards in 2008; recognises that the Bridge of Allan-based family business plays a vital role in both the national and local economy and employs around 270 members of staff, and further notes the health benefits of milk in improving eyesight and building stronger bones and teeth.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2078</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Learning the Lessons of Manchester</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the overwhelming majority of football supporters who visited Manchester for the UEFA Cup Final between Glasgow Rangers and Zenit St Petersburg were impeccably behaved, that any issues in relation to the planning and management of the cup final provided no excuse for a mindless minority of individuals who do not represent Glasgow Rangers Football Club and that the deeply regrettable events in Manchester should be used as an opportunity to reduce the likelihood of such scenes ever happening again; calls on the Scottish Government to take the lead in helping to co-ordinate efforts to ensure that lessons are learned and that all stakeholders, including the Scottish and UK governments, local authorities, football clubs and the police, work closely together on such matters, and further believes that where legislative changes may be necessary, such as in the case of ensuring that football banning orders handed out in England can be enforced in Scotland, such changes are implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2077</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Centenary of the Vatersay Raiders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that it is 100 years since the 10 fishermen from Barra and Mingulay, who sought to establish crofts as a way of life on Vatersay, appeared at the Court of Session in Edinburgh accused of breaching an interdict imposed upon them by the absentee landlord, Lady Gordon Cathcart; notes that their two month imprisonment caused an outcry across Scotland, leading the Government to buy Vatersay for crofting; further notes that today the descendants of the raiders still live on Vatersay with a causeway now linking them to the larger island of Barra, built in order to avoid abandonment by the population of Vatersay as befell Mingulay, and notes that it was the Labour-led Scottish Executive that led the way in introducing land reform measures to give communities such as Gigha and South Uist greater control of their land and how it is managed and giving them greater power to shape their own futures, following the example of the Assynt crofters and the people of Eigg and Knoydart.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2075</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Netting Youth Disorder</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Central Scotland Police on its recent crackdown on antisocial behaviour through investigation of the social networking site Bebo; notes that the success of the operation included interviewing 182 young people aged between 12 and 18 about issues such as underage drinking, drug-related activities and weapon possession; recognises that this casts doubts on the effectiveness of social networking sites&rsquo; content control, and expresses unease that the readiness displayed by these young people to put photographs of their actions online, given current concerns over child protection and safeguarding vulnerable persons, undermines an otherwise excellent and extremely popular facility for young people to communicate with each other.</p>
