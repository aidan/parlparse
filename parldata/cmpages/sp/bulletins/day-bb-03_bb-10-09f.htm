          <p><strong>*S2M-474</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>Horse 
            Racing Industry in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the significant contribution that the horse racing industry makes 
            to the economy, generating up to £125 million and providing the equivalent 
            of 1700 full-time jobs; commends the success of the racing industry 
            in continuing to expand and develop, recognising its contribution 
            to local economies and tourism; notes that there is widespread concern 
            regarding the potential implications of the proposed Office of Fair 
            Trading (OFT) rule 14 notice on the deregulation of the British horse 
            racing industry and, in particular, on its likely impact on Scotland&#146;s 
            five racecourses, Ayr, Hamilton Park, Kelso, Musselburgh and Perth, 
            each of which is independently owned and managed with profits generated 
            ploughed back into the sport for long-term growth, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should work with representatives of the racing 
            industry to identify opportunities to promote and develop the industry 
            and to explore the possible implications of the OFT ruling.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John Home Robertson<strong>*</strong>, Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-473</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Criminal 
            Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill - Stage 1</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Criminal Procedure 
            (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-472#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            and Rationalisation of Maternity Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            is extremely concerned at the increasing numbers of proposed closures 
            of maternity hospitals and rationalisations of maternity services 
            with consultations held in isolation and without reference to cross-boundary 
            and pan-Scotland impact; notes that claimed benefits of centralisation 
            in relation to morbidity and mortality are unproven; is concerned 
            that there are no minimum standards for staffing establishments of 
            midwives across the service and that models for calculating staff 
            numbers and ratios are outdated and outmoded; notes that expectations 
            of staff by the public and demands of government have increased dramatically 
            over the years which has created more<strong> </strong>work for all 
            staff providing maternity services despite a declining birth rate, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should implement a moratorium 
            on maternity closures and conduct a review of the provision of maternity 
            services across Scotland that involves the public and all trade union 
            and professional organisations with the aim of establishing agreed 
            minimum staffing establishments in a safe, co-ordinated service that 
            meets the needs of all women and families across the whole of Scotland 
            and maintains the expertise and excellence already established in 
            the provision of these services.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-471</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>GM 
            Crops</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the EU Commissioner 
            for Health and Consumer Protection, David Byrne, on his clarification 
            that the issue of GM crops coexisting with non-GM crops and its associated 
            threat to biodiversity is a national issue under national competency; 
            welcomes this confirmation of the Scottish Executive&#146;s powers 
            on this issue, and looks forward to it using these powers to announce 
            the banning of all GM foods and crops.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-470#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            of Queen Mother's Hospital, Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            opposes the recommendation to the Greater Glasgow NHS Board from the 
            Maternity Working Group, chaired by Professor Margaret Reid, to close 
            the Queen Mother's Hospital and transfer services to the Southern 
            General and Princess Royal hospitals; believes that it makes no sense 
            to close down a well-functioning unit with a proven and world-renowned 
            record of care of mothers and babies; notes that the Queen Mother's 
            Hospital has won many awards for clinical excellence and delivers 
            services to communities that most need the service; further notes 
            that the expert views of Scottish paediatricians and other medical 
            staff appear to have been ignored by the working group, particularly 
            those that expressed the view that transporting ill babies would pose 
            a degree of risk that is currently not necessary; believes that the 
            prospect of closing the Queen Mother's Hospital is not just a loss 
            to women in the west of Glasgow and west of Scotland, but crucially 
            denies a critical service to mothers and ill babies throughout Scotland 
            who have relied upon the close link between the Queen Mother's Hospital 
            and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, a model of care 
            which has catered for women expecting babies that require immediate 
            medical attention; is concerned over the negative knock-on effect 
            to children's services as a result of clinicians remotely serving 
            the two retained maternity units and the uncertainty now created over 
            the future of the Yorkhill NHS Trust following the recommendation 
            of the Maternity Working Group to close the children's hospital in 
            the longer term and transfer all services to the Southern General 
            Hospital, and considers that the Greater Glasgow NHS Board should 
            reject the recommendations of the Maternity Working Group.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-469</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>National 
            Construction Week 8 to 15 October 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            supports National Construction Week from 8 to 15 October 2003 and 
            recognises the many economic advantages for Scotland that an expanding 
            construction industry will bring, notably in employment preservation 
            and creation, training, skills and provision of the built environment; 
            welcomes the setting up of a Cross Party Group on Construction to 
            consider and debate all appropriate issues concerning the structure 
            and operation of the construction industry in Scotland as they may 
            affect all relevant stakeholders; supports the industry&#146;s schemes 
            to register construction firms through the Construction Licensing 
            Executive and workers through approved registration schemes, thereby 
            protecting the public by eradicating rogue traders, enhancing the 
            industry&#146;s image and improving the skills base and health and 
            safety practices, and acknowledges that the Scottish Executive, local 
            authorities and other government bodies can assist by (a) supporting 
            registration schemes by insisting that all public works contractors 
            are committed to them, (b) supporting the education and training infrastructure 
            so that it meets Scotland&#146;s construction requirements, (c) acting 
            as an enlightened client by ensuring, where possible, advanced programmes 
            of work on which the industry can plan its skills requirements and 
            provide its workforce with security of employment and (d) ensuring 
            that public works contracts are fair, open, effective and straightforward 
            to administer and deliver.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-467.2</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Creating 
            an Enterprise Culture in Scotland's Schools</strong>&#151;As an amendment 
            to motion (S2M-467) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from 
            &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert, &quot;believes that the trade 
            union movement has much to contribute to the development of education 
            for work activity in its broadest sense, not only in making young 
            people aware of the realities of work from a worker&#146;s perspective 
            and the individual and collective rights they should expect at work, 
            but also about how work relates to wider issues within society, such 
            as equality, environmental sustainability, lifelong learning and community 
            development and participation, which are areas of longstanding trade 
            union activity, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to bring 
            forward detailed proposals for trade union involvement in education 
            for work activity across all sectors of Scottish education that include 
            the identification of the resources necessary for their implementation 
            and their possible sources.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-467.3</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Creating 
            an Enterprise Culture in Scotland's Schools</strong>&#151;As an amendment

            &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the necessity 
            of creating an enterprise culture in Scotland in order to help reverse 
            our economic decline; welcomes any moves to encourage young people 
            to become more entrepreneurial but understands that what the business 
            sector primarily looks for from school leavers are skills in literacy, 
            numeracy, communication and timekeeping, and accordingly calls upon 
            the Scottish Executive to take steps to reduce the unacceptable number 
            of school pupils failing to meet basic standards in reading and writing, 
            widen access to vocational courses at further education colleges for 
            14 and 15-year-olds, and increase opportunities for school pupils 
            to experience work placements.&quot;</p>

            businesses and shape successful communities; requires that enterprise 
            be fully integrated with teaching on citizenship, social obligation 
            and sustainability, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure 
            that locally-based voluntary and social enterprises play a full and 
            equal part alongside other businesses in helping young people to develop 
            ideas and skills.&quot;</p>
