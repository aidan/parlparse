            <strong>Ross Finnie: Fisheries</strong>—That the Parliament welcomes the record 
            £27 million package for the fishing industry announced by the Deputy 
            Minister for Rural Development on 8 March 2001; notes that the joint 
            objective of the Executive and the industry is the conservation of 
            fish stocks and a sustainable long-term future for the fishing industry; 
            further notes that best scientific advice is that these objectives 
            are most effectively achieved through a targeted decommissioning scheme 
            and immediate technical conservation measures; welcomes further research 
            into these practical measures intended to reduce the number of discards 
            and protect stocks of fish, and welcomes the fact that the Executive, 
            taking into account the view expressed by the Parliament on 8 March 
            2001, is engaged in continuing discussion with the fishing industry 
            to explore a degree of re-balancing of the £27 million package of 
            measures to address the short term needs of the industry by extending 
            that research programme. </font></p>

            <strong>John Scott: National Association of Rape Crisis Centres</strong>—That 
            the Parliament recognises the good work done by rape crisis centres 
            throughout Scotland, supports the creation of a National Association 
            of Rape Crisis Centres and believes that adequate funding should be 
            put in place to support such a national association and its work.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Hosting Football's 2005 World Club Championship</strong>—That 
            the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Football Association (SFA) 
            on holding exploratory talks with FIFA’s President Sepp Blatter on 
            a possible bid to host the 2005 World Club Championship; urges the 
            SFA to follow this up with a formal bid to host the tournament as 
            well as the 2008 European Nations Championship, and believes that 
            hosting these tournaments would be of great benefit to domestic football, 
            to tourism, to other sectors of the economy and to Scotland’s international 
            reputation.</font></p>

            <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Scottish Working People's History Trust and 
            Working Class History Museums</strong>—That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Scottish Working People's History Trust on the publication of 
            the 2nd volume of oral recollections entitled <i>Bondagers</i> (female 
            bonded farm workers); notes that the Trust is committed to preserving 
            for future generations, through deposit in public libraries and museums 
            in Scotland, all surviving documentary and oral sources of working 
            people's history north of the Border; further notes that the Trust 
            receives no National Lottery funding as it is revenue based, depends 
            entirely on voluntary donations and operates with only one part-time 
            researcher and volunteers, yet continues to produce invaluable work 
            on the history of Scotland, and is concerned at the threat for the 
            future faced by other outlets dedicated to working class history such 
            as Springburn Railway Museum.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1755</strong> 
            <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: War Crime of Mass Rape</strong>—That the Parliament 
            acknowledges the recent landmark ruling from the Yugoslav War Crimes 
            trial in the Hague that recognises mass rape as a war crime; notes 
            that for the first time such acts and sexual enslavement in times 
            of war will be regarded in international law as crimes against humanity, 
            second in gravity only to genocide, and believes that speaking about 
            the reality of rape as a war crime and challenging its existence is 
            the only way towards ending it.</font></p>

            &quot;but nevertheless regrets: (i) the proposed high and potentially

            exemptions, in particular the exemptions afforded to the Crown Office, 
            and (iii) that independent decisions by the Information Commissioner 
            may be vetoed by the First Minister, and further expresses its concern 
            that the passing of a Freedom of Information Bill in the terms proposed 
            by the Executive would make little difference to the culture of secrecy 
            which continues to pervade the governance of Scotland.&quot; </font></p>

            henceforth publishing the minutes of its Cabinet meetings.&quot;</a></font></p>
