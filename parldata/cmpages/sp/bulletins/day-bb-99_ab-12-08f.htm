    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-363</b> <strong>Irene McGugan: Campaign for Scotland's Post Offices</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Express on its campaign to save Scotland&#146;s
    small post offices, recognising that many of these businesses provide vital services to
    communities without which they would not be able to survive; and wishes the newspaper
    every success in removing the current threat to their existence.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-362#</b> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Deprivation in Aberdeen</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the publication of <i>Deprivation amongst affluence: Social exclusion
    in the City of Aberdeen</i> and supports this report&#146;s call for additional funding to
    tackle problems of relative deprivation in Aberdeen, which are often ignored by central
    Government due to the perception of the city&#146;s affluence.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-361#</b> <strong>David Mundell: Rural Sub Post Offices</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament recognises that current Benefit Agency &quot;modernisation&quot; proposals will
    encourage the payment of more pensions and other benefits by automated bank transfer,
    rather than at Post Offices, potentially leading to the closure of hundreds of rural
    sub-post-offices in Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make
    representations to the Benefits Agency and the Post Office as to the serious adverse
    effects such closures would have on the needs and sustainability of rural communities in
    Scotland.</p>

    the Parliament notes that the Transport Bill launched by the Department of Transport in
    England obliges local authorities to fund at least 50% of a concessionary fare scheme for
    all pensioners and calls upon the Scottish Executive to initiate a similar scheme in
    Scotland and to provide resources to meet the necessary funding.</p>

    the transfer of lead responsibility for European Union fisheries negotiations from Her
    Majesty&#146;s Government to the Scottish Executive, in recognition of Scotland&#146;s
    dominant position within the UK industry; pursue a control regime for the Scottish
    industry that does not place it at a competitive disadvantage in comparison to other EU
    fleets, and influence the forthcoming reform of the Common Fisheries Policy by bringing
    forward proposals to introduce the concept of zonal management thereby involving the
    industry itself in the decision-making process, whilst maintaining the founding principles
    of the original agreement, namely relative stability, the Hague preferences and historic
    fishing rights, to re-affirm that the Common Fisheries Policy is not a free-for-all.<i><strong>

    amendment to motion (S1M-358) in the name of Mr John Home Robertson, delete from
    &#145;calls&#146; to end and insert: &quot;recognises that the current Common Fisheries
    Policy arrangements are failing our fishermen and calls upon the Scottish Executive to
    advocate reform of the CFP that devolves power to regional and zonal levels which would
    give our fishermen better control over the stocks of fish whilst recognising the
    traditional rights of other countries, and further calls for the fishing section of MAFF
    to be relocated to the North East of Scotland, the UK&#146;s main fishing centre, and that
    continuous assessment should replace the current practice of annual negotiation.</p>
