          <P><strong>*S2M-1110#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>President 
            of COSLA Should Resign</strong>-That the Parliament has no confidence 
            in the president of COSLA, Pat Watters, and considers that his refusal 
            to negotiate a national pay and careers structure with the nursery 
            nurses' union UNISON has provoked a national strike, now in its fourth 
            week; believes that, as the leader of local authorities in Scotland 
            who deliver the age three to five curriculum, Mr Watters has responsibility 
            for ensuring excellent standards in our pre-five sector for both children 
            and staff, and believes that Mr Watters has failed in this responsibility 
            and should tender his resignation.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1109</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Gynaecology 
            Services in NHS Argyll and Clyde</strong>-That the Parliament is dismayed 
            at the action of NHS Argyll and Clyde in failing to sustain gynaecology 
            services at the Vale of Leven and Inverclyde Royal hospitals; notes 
            that contingency arrangements will be in place from 29 March 2004 
            for all in-patient admissions to be centralised at the Royal Alexandra 
            Hospital (RAH), Paisley; recognises that this will place intolerable 
            pressure on existing services at the RAH and, in turn, will lead to 
            longer waiting lists; further recognises the difficulty for patients 
            north of the river to access services in the RAH due to lack of direct 
            public transport and the cost of that transport; notes that the ambulance 
            service is currently struggling to cope with the additional journeys 
            to the RAH, despite the substantial recent increase in investment; 
            further notes the impact that changes will have on allied services 
            at the Vale of Leven and Inverclyde Royal hospitals, and considers 
            that it is inappropriate to pre-empt the outcome of the clinical strategy 
            review in this way.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Duncan McNeil<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1108#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>North 
            East Regional Sports Facilities</strong>-That the Parliament regrets 
            the absence of high standard indoor and outdoor sports facilities 
            in the north east; supports the joint bid from Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire 
            councils with Aberdeen and Robert Gordon universities, other public 
            sector partners and a wide range of sporting clubs and bodies; encourages 
            <strong>sport</strong>scotland and the Scottish Executive to look 
            favourably on this application, and wishes the partners well in progressing 
            the bid.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1107</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Environmental 
            Justice</strong>-That the Parliament notes a new report, <em>Environmental 
            Justice</em>, published by the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF), the 
            Environmental Law Foundation and Leigh, Day and Co, which alarmingly 
            shows that the civil justice system effectively prevents people who 
            are concerned about the environment from going to court and that the 
            criminal justice system fails to provide effective deterrents to environmental 
            and wildlife crimes in England and Wales; further notes that the report 
            surveyed over 50 respondents, including 18 solicitors, 20 barristers 
            and 15 non-governmental organisations, and found that 97% of those 
            interviewed did not think that the civil law system delivered environmental 
            justice, and urges the Scottish Executive to undertake a review of 
            the civil and criminal justice systems in Scotland to ensure that 
            the law properly protects the environment.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-1106#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Planned 
            Extension of Dungavel</strong>-That the Parliament notes with<strong> 
            </strong>concern recently announced<strong> </strong>plans to increase 
            the detention capacity at Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre in Lanarkshire; 
            recognises<strong><em> </em></strong>that immigration and asylum policy 
            is a matter reserved to the UK Parliament; considers, however, that 
            the existence and operational record of Dungavel poses a serious threat 
            to the Scottish Executive's record of promoting equality of opportunity 
            and social inclusion for refugees in Scotland and is contradictory 
            to current efforts to encourage fresh talent to come to Scotland; 
            agrees that the detention of innocent children and families is both 
            inhumane and unnecessary; believes that the question of planning permission 
            for the project should be considered carefully, and considers that 
            concerns regarding the detention of asylum seekers in Scotland should 
            be raised with the Home Office.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1105</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to the Young People of Middlefield for their Bus Shelter Artwork</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the young people of Middlefield in Aberdeen 
            for their high quality and innovative bus shelter artwork; notes the 
            involvement of the Whitespace arts development team and PC John Ritchie 
            in supporting and encouraging the activity; further notes that the 
            costs are in line with current replacement screen costs, and commends 
            the initiative to other local authorities for potential roll out across 
            Scotland.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1104#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to the University of Edinburgh for Use of Renewable Energy</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the University of Edinburgh for its progressive 
            use of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and photovoltaics as part of 
            the university's energy strategy; welcomes the university's success 
            in winning a grant from the UK Government's Major Photovoltaics (PV) 
            Demonstration Programme; acknowledges the work of former student Andrea 
            Connelly who undertook a feasibility study and established that the 
            College of Science and Engineering campus at King Buildings would 
            be suitable for CHP; understands that the project will cut the university's 
            annual estates costs and free up scarce budgetary resources for other 
            priorities such as fire safety and disabled access; applauds the university 
            for commissioning another CHP system at Pollock Halls of Residence 
            and George Square which will cut carbon dioxide emissions by over 
            2,000 tonnes and reduce running costs by approximately £400,000; further 
            congratulates the university for the use of photovoltaic and passive 
            ventilation which will be incorporated into the construction of the 
            roof and cladding fa&ccedil;ade in the new campus building that will 
            house the School of Engineering and Electronics, and encourages other 
            higher education establishments and the Scottish Executive to endorse, 
            encourage and employ the win-win outcome that renewable technologies 
            provide in urban settings.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-1103</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Midnight 
            Football Programme</strong>-That the Parliament commends the Midnight 
            Football programme, funded by the Bank of Scotland and provided by 
            the Scottish Football Association and local police, whereby for two 
            hours on Friday evenings young people in 14 towns in Scotland play 
            football at appropriate centres in organised tournaments with qualified 
            coaches and transport provided, as an alternative to wandering the 
            streets, and suggests that the Scottish Executive should work with 
            the existing partners to ensure that these successful projects are 
            carried on beyond their existing nine weeks and that similar projects 
            are started in other areas as one part of the Executive's measures 
            to provide young people with constructive alternatives to antisocial 
            behaviour.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1102#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Health 
            Inequalities in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the 
            information provided in <em>Health and Well-being Profiles for each 
            Scottish Parliamentary Constituency, 2004</em>; acknowledges the serious 
            and significant health inequalities within Scotland that these reports 
            highlight; recognises the clear correlation between poverty, deprivation 
            and ill-health; believes that the Scottish Executive, in its review 
            of the Arbuthnott formula for health spending, should ensure that 
            health spending more closely matches Scottish deprivation indicators 
            and health need, and further believes that the proposed independent 
            review of local government finance should examine the benefits of 
            an Arbuthnott-like review of the distribution of funding to local 
            authorities to ensure that such funding takes proper account of deprivation.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1101#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Sustaining 
            Agriculture and Sustaining Communities</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that sustaining a viable agricultural sector involves encouraging 
            an increase in employment on Scotland's land and that this would strengthen 
            the contribution of agriculture to the viability of rural communities 
            and contribute to the nutritional health of Scotland.<strong><em> 
            R</em></strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1100</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Criminal 
            Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament

            passed.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1099</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Road 
            Safety and World Health Day, 7 April 2004</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has designated road 
            safety as the theme of World Health Day 2004 on 7 April 2004; further 
            notes that the WHO has indicated that 1.2 million people die from 
            road traffic injuries each year; notes that the WHO predicts that 
            by 2020 road traffic injuries will be a greater killer globally than 
            malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS and that, despite excellent progress 
            in tackling the problem, Scotland's annual death toll from road traffic 
            remains unacceptably high, and supports World Health Day 2004 and 
            measures to improve road safety in Scotland.</P>
