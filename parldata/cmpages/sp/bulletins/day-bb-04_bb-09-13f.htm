          <P><strong>*S2M-1675</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>United Kingdom's First Calcium Summit, 14 September 2004, Dynamic Earth, Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the first UK Calcium Summit, to be held in Edinburgh on 14 September 2004; recognises the potential osteoporosis time bomb within the Scottish population; is concerned that a quarter of teenage girls are not meeting calcium intake requirements, and commits itself to addressing the behavioural and motivational issues that affect teenage food choice, the role of dietary calcium in bone health and the effectiveness of existing health promotion initiatives.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1674#</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Development and Manufacture of Renewable Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Highlands and Islands Renewable Energy Group and the trade union Amicus on their initiative to promote the development and manufacture of renewable energy structures, whether for wind, wave or tidal power, in the Highlands and Islands; recognises that there is a skilled engineering workforce available locally; further recognises the considerable socio-economic benefits that would flow from this work to the nearby communities; believes that renewable energy infrastructure would be better supported by these communities if they perceived that it was bringing local economic benefit, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should do all it can to support Highland-based companies in bidding for renewables contracts in Scotland and elsewhere.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong></P>

          <P>Supported by: Nora Radcliffe</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1672</strong> <strong>Des McNulty on behalf of the Finance Committee:</strong> <strong>Relocation of Public Sector Jobs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 6th Report 2004 (Session 2) of the Finance Committee, <em>Report on the Relocation of Public Sector Jobs </em>(SP Paper 189), which summarises the considerable evidence in support of the principle of relocation of public sector jobs, calls for greater transparency in the decision-making process associated with relocation, highlights the need for the objectives of the policy to be set out clearly and realistically, identifies lessons to be learnt from elsewhere and puts forward a number of recommendations for consideration and debate.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1671</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.8) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.8) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/344) be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe</P>

          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1668</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Diarrhetic Shellfish Poison) (East Coast) (No.2) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (No.2) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/378) be approved.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1667</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Support for a Moratorium on NHS Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the succession of profound concerns expressed in debates and motions on the NHS; further notes that these concerns are so serious that calls for a moratorium on NHS closures and centralisations have been made for over a year; notes that communities remain at odds with NHS boards and the Scottish Executive over the future of the NHS, that NHS boards implement Executive policy and budgets, notably on PFI/PPP, that boards do not play any political role in terms of PFI/PPP or pharmaceutical profits which represent a massive strain on their budgets, that the application of the working time regulations have neither been planned properly nor budgeted for, that new contracts for medical staff at all levels have not been fully funded and that numbers of graduates in all health professions have been, and are, consistently insufficient to meet the needs of patients or a 21st century NHS; believes that NHS boards should be democratically accountable for their responsibilities but that it is the Executive that sets the structural, strategic, financial and political context that they operate in and regrets the failure of the Executive to acknowledge that responsibility or engage in a debate with the public; further believes that the threat of closure of so many important facilities is entrenching the disengagement between communities and government, and therefore believes that the Executive should now announce a moratorium so that a wide-ranging and meaningful debate about the security and future of the NHS can take place in Scotland.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, John Swinburne<strong>*</strong>, Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Colin Fox<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1666</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Franz Ferdinand Winning the Mercury Music Prize</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Franz Ferdinand on winning the Mercury Music Prize on 7 September 2004 and notes that a Glasgow-based band winning this prestigious pop music award draws attention to the vibrancy and fresh talent on the Scottish popular music scene.</P>
          <P>Supported by: David Mundell, Trish Godman, Michael Matheson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1665#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>HMI Report on Stirling's Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Stirling Council Children&rsquo;s Services for the outstanding report published by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education in August, providing strong evidence that inclusive schools are high-achieving schools and of the benefits of an integrated children&rsquo;s service.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Trish Godman</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1664#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Beslan Tragedy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its deepest sympathy to the people of Beslan following the terrorist outrage which ended in the death of over three hundred people, many of whom were children; notes that, with experience of the Dunblane Primary School tragedy, the people of Scotland will be sharing the anguish felt across the world at this terrible act of terrorism against young children, carers and teaching staff in what was considered to be a safe and secure learning environment, and supports the thousands of Russian people in their grief who have taken to the streets to look for answers to this tragedy.</P>
          <P>Supported by: David Mundell, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Trish Godman, Michael Matheson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1663#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Second Forth Road Bridge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the relaunch of the campaign against a second Forth Road Bridge, under the title ForthRightAlliance, including Friends of the Earth Scotland, the Cockburn Association, TRANSform Scotland and others; further notes that 70% of cars crossing the bridge at peak times do so with a single occupant, and believes that the investment proposed for a new bridge would be better spent on providing public transport alternatives to allow drivers an alternative to using their cars.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1662#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Opposition to Rationalisation of Medical Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with growing concern the continuing rationalisation and centralisation of medical services in Scotland; notes the increasingly vocal public opposition to these measures, and believes that the Minister for Health and Community Care should not stay silent on this matter and that it is his duty to take action to halt further rationalisation and centralisation until full consultation involving the medical profession and the public has been undertaken and until a national strategy has been put in place.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell, Michael Matheson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1661</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Mercury Music Prize</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the band Franz Ferdinand on winning the Mercury Music Prize; believes that this is another indicator of the international success of the music industry in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work closely with the industry and artists and performers to ensure the continued success of this important cultural enterprise for the country.</P>

          <P>Supported by: Alex Johnstone, Mrs Nanette Milne, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Bruce Crawford, Chris Ballance, Iain Smith, Phil Gallie, Ms Sandra White, Mr Jamie McGrigor, Shiona Baird, Robin Harper, Mr Brian Monteith</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1657</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Lack of High-Dependency Beds in Greater Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow to transfer the gynaecology and gynaecology oncology unit from Stobhill Hospital to Glasgow Royal Infirmary without ensuring the provision of essential additional high-dependency beds and therefore compromising clinical judgements and increasing waiting time for surgery, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to intervene to ensure that patients receive an improved service or one that is at least as good as that which existed previously at Stobhill Hospital.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne, Phil Gallie, Mr Bruce McFee, Frances Curran, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Chris Ballance, Patrick Harvie, Robin Harper</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1656</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Centralisation of Health Services in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the centralisation of health services across Scotland; believes that there must be a clear national strategy for the future structure of the NHS in Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to suspend all planned reorganisations while a national strategy is developed involving the public and health professionals.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr David Davidson, Christine Grahame, Bruce Crawford, Murray Tosh, John Swinburne, Campbell Martin, Mrs Nanette Milne, Stewart Stevenson, Alex Neil, Tommy Sheridan, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Alex Fergusson, Bill Aitken, Rob Gibson, Eleanor Scott, Jim Mather, Mr Bruce McFee, Shona Robison, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Tricia Marwick, Mary Scanlon, Fiona Hyslop, Chris Ballance, Patrick Harvie, Miss Annabel Goldie, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong>, Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1654</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Strathbungo Community and Network Rail's Attack on the Community</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns Network Rail for ordering the cutting down of trees around Moray Place and Darnley Road in Strathbungo on the southside of Glasgow on 6 September 2004; regrets, furthermore, that Network Rail did not inform the residents of its plans; considers that the trees are a vital part of the conservation area and that full consultation with the residents and other interested parties would have enhanced the plan, and is concerned that, not only has the environment, the landscape and the community suffered erosion, but that democracy has also been eroded as the wishes of the people have been ignored at the behest of unelected, unaccountable company bosses.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1653</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>Inverclyde Juvenile Pipe Band</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the members of the Inverclyde Juvenile Pipe Band for a fantastic season when it was crowned Champion of Champions of the Novice Juvenile Grade, won three of the five major competitions of the season: the Scottish Championships, the World Championships and the Cowal Championships, and came second at the remaining two major competitions: the British Championships and the European Championships; notes the hard work and dedication that has been in existence since the band was formed in 1998; further notes that the band has become the Pride of Inverclyde for this year, and extends its best wishes to the band for the 2005 season.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1651</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Segregation in the New Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to strive to ensure that it is an inclusive modern democracy; condemns, therefore, the decision to create separate entrances and eating areas in the new building which segregate MSPs from workers; furthermore believes that this is a backward step given that, in the previous parliament building, all workers, including MSPs, entered and dined together, and is concerned that this will serve to create an unhealthy &quot;them and us&quot; division.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Campbell Martin, Tommy Sheridan, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Frances Curran, Chris Ballance, Eleanor Scott, Shiona Baird</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1650#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>National Police Memorial</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the unveiling on 7 September 2004 of a national memorial, sited at the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan, to all Scottish police officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty; recognises that giving one&rsquo;s life in the line of duty is a sacrifice which very few people in our society ever have to face, but one that is faced by our police officers on a daily basis, and acknowledges that sacrifice and recognises the loss suffered by the families of police officers.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Donald Gorrie</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1648#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>In Touch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, further to motion S2M-822 lodged on 27January 2004, notes with concern that &quot;In Touch&quot;, a project based in Galashiels which enables young people between the ages of 16 and 25 to move towards education and employment, which has been continuing on interim funding from Scottish Enterprise Borders and whose funding under the New Futures Fund ceases in March 2005, has failed to secure mainstream funding as advocated by the New Futures Fund Advisory Group and as referred to by the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in his answers to questions S2W-5798 and S2W-5799 on 10 February 2004; expresses concern that it is possible that this project may disappear and will have to be replaced by a new initiative which will have start-up costs resulting in a waste of resources in equipment and staff built up over five years, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should review its position regarding mainstreaming, which is not in this instance delivering funds, to ensure that the valuable work by &quot;In Touch&quot; and other projects under the New Futures Fund continues.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Donald Gorrie, Michael Matheson</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1647#</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Fatigue and Chronic Neurological Illnesses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that there are many thousands of individuals living with chronic neurological illnesses in Scotland, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), multiple sclerosis (MS), post polio syndrome (PPS) and fibromyalgis; notes that one of the major causes of stress in this population is fatigue associated with their condition; further notes that, given the range of illnesses and care needs, patients are often given inappropriate treatment and medications, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should consider as a first step the establishment of a centre of excellence specifically to assess, treat and research ways of managing and improving such individuals&rsquo; life quality and that any centre should be promoted in such a manner as the Scottish Executive sees fit to ensure that GPs and other health professionals are informed of this new service and are encouraged to refer patients as the need arises.</P>
          <P>Supported by: John Swinburne, Donald Gorrie, Mike Watson, Campbell Martin, John Farquhar Munro, Murray Tosh, Brian Adam, Bruce Crawford, Ms Sandra White, Bill Butler, Margaret Jamieson, Frances Curran, Mr Bruce McFee, Alex Neil, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Mike Pringle, Chris Ballance, Shiona Baird, Robin Harper, Trish Godman</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1646</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Ghurkas Welcome</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government on behalf of the Ghurkhas who have served in the British armed services to ensure that they automatically qualify for the right to British citizenship thereby giving priority, within the Executive's policies in respect of inward immigration, to those who have already established their credentials through loyal service to Scotland and the UK.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Donald Gorrie</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1638.1</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> <strong>Hidden Treasure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1638) in the name of Christine Grahame, leave out from &quot;, in recognition&quot; to end and insert &quot;thanks Mrs Althea Dundas-Bekker for her extremely generous gift to the Parliament of a lintel from the pre-1707 Parliament building; acknowledges that the architect&rsquo;s plan to locate the lintel in a position where it can be seen from the public stairway at Holyrood is not entirely satisfactory; supports the decision of the Holyrood Progress Group to have it moved to a more prominent position in time for the official opening of the new building, and welcomes the new-found interest of many members in the merits of the Holyrood building.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1636.1</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>A Tolerance-Free Parliament?</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1636) in the name of Mr Brian Monteith, leave out from &quot;the majority&quot; to end and insert &quot;smokers are victims of a vile trade which promotes this addiction, and believes that individuals should receive support to overcome this in a way that is supportive, sympathetic and effective.&quot;</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1579#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Citizens Advice Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Advice Week from 6 to 13 September 2004; commends the vital work that Scotland's 77 citizens advice bureaux do in providing free, impartial and confidential advice to all; recognises that in the last year they handled over 400,000 issues and secured nearly &pound;26m for clients; further recognises that such good quality advice on issues such as benefits, debt, employment, housing and consumer affairs is increasingly necessary in today's society; acknowledges that the use of client evidence means that citizens advice bureaux speak with authority and relevance on changing social issues from both a local and national perspective; congratulates the 2,193 volunteers and 329 paid members of staff who provide this service, and hopes that parliamentarians across the political spectrum can work together to ensure that the service will continue to inform government and meet the needs of local communities across Scotland in the years to come.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1306#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Children of Drug Abusers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the widespread incidence in Scotland of children whose parents misuse drugs and who, as a result, suffer diminished lives in all kinds of ways; believes that such children, many of whom are infants, require comprehensive care by those concerned with the protection of vulnerable families, and considers that the Scottish Executive, social work departments and other interested parties should adopt healthcare programmes that will ensure that such young citizens escape the blighting of their lives brought about by parents who are themselves in need of treatment and support.</P>
