          <p><strong>*S2M-1407</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Antisocial 
            Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees 
            that the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill be passed.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson<strong>*</strong>, Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong>, 
            Ross Finnie<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1406#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Reserved 
            Contracts to Support Remploy</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the work of Remploy in Scotland in supporting 700 people with special 
            needs in employment and congratulates the organisation on its training 
            and development programme which has seen the creation of dedicated 
            learning rooms at all 10 of its employment sites, with 275 employees 
            currently undertaking skills training in language and mathematics 
            and a further 135 involved in other learning activity, and a commitment 
            of at least 5% of working time over a year to be dedicated to personal 
            development; notes that this programme has been implemented in just 
            over two years, and believes that the Scottish Executive and all publicly-funded 
            organisations should examine their procurement policies with a view 
            to reserving contracts for supported employment organisations such 
            as those working with Remploy.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1405</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Norway's 
            Ban on Smoking in Public Places</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Norway on its decision to ban smoking in all public places; notes 
            that the proposal comes after heavy pressure from restaurant workers' 
            unions who say that their members have a higher incidence of lung 
            cancer than others due to passive smoking and that the Norwegian Health 
            Ministry states that between 300 and 500 people die of passive smoking 
            in Norway each year; notes that, even before the ban came into force, 
            the smoking rates had dropped from 29% to 26%, suggesting that many 
            smokers are looking for a reason to give up smoking and that a ban 
            such as this assists them in doing so, and recommends that members 
            follow the example set by Norway by supporting such measures as the 
            Prohibition of Smoking in Regulated Areas (Scotland) Bill to protect 
            the health of both workers and patrons of eating establishments.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1404</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Football Supporters Against the Scottish Premier League</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that the refusal by the Scottish Premier League 
            (SPL) to accept First Division Champions, Inverness Caledonian Thistle 
            Football Club, as being entitled to promotion to the SPL is unfair 
            and unreasonable and urges every MSP to register concern by signing 
            the on-line petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/spl/petition.html 
            set up by the fans of Inverness Caledonian Thistle which reads: &quot;Scottish 
            Football Supporters against the SPL - To: Scottish Premier League, 
            Scottish Football Association, Scottish Football League, Scottish 
            Parliament - The following persons wish to make known their anger 
            at the Scottish Premier League's (&quot;SPL&quot;) decision to deny 
            Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC the right to take up their place in 
            the SPL (on 1st June, 2004). We would also like to protest against 
            the SPL's management of the Scottish game as a whole, and to call 
            for the Scottish Football Association (&quot;SFA&quot;) to take control 
            of the administration of all leagues in Scotland. This, in our opinion, 
            is the only way that the Scottish game can progress.&quot;</P>

            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;congratulates&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;acknowledges that the long-term economic decline 
            of the Highlands and Islands was reversed under the last Conservative 
            government; believes that strong businesses are essential in bringing 
            about further economic growth in the Highlands and Islands; notes 
            with concern that businesses in the Highlands and Islands continue 
            to be hampered by high business rates, excessive regulation and poor 
            transport infrastructure; recognises, particularly, the need for improvement 
            of the A9 as the major strategic link between the central belt and 
            the north, and calls on the Scottish Executive to improve the business 
            environment in the Highlands and Islands by lowering business rates, 
            cutting regulation and investing in transport infrastructure improvements.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1395.2</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Economy 
            of the Highlands and Islands</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1395) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;believes that the Highlands and Islands have 
            both the right and the potential to be an economy that is diverse, 
            dynamic and sustainable; commends the progress that has been achieved 
            to date by individual endeavour, quality local services, business 
            resilience and innovation in spite of hurdles which must be overcome 
            in order for that potential to be realised; considers that these hurdles 
            include the threats to primary and acute healthcare, the failure of 
            the Scottish Executive to mount a coherent campaign for the contribution 
            of adequate EU structural funds, the lack of affordable housing, poor 
            transport links, higher fuel costs and an overall failure adequately 
            to address the needs of key industries, and urges the Executive to 
            produce a comprehensive strategy that will overcome these inhibitors 
            and enable the Highlands and Islands to achieve its full potential.&quot;</P>

            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;, particularly&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;; notes the lessons to be learned including 
            the need to engage with, and invest in, local communities in areas 
            such as telecommunications, research and development and renewable 
            energy; further notes the need for investment in sustainable transport; 
            recognises that serious challenges still lie ahead in terms of sustaining 
            more fragile areas, and endorses the view expressed in <em>A Smart, 
            Successful Scotland - the Highlands and Islands dimension,</em> that 
            economic growth must be achieved in tandem with no less important 
            aspects of Highlands and Islands life, such as social cohesion, vibrant 
            cultures and natural environment, and that development activity must 
            remain aware of the legacy it leaves for the future.&quot;</P>
