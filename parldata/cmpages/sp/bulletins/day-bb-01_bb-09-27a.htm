          <p>9.30 am&#9;Scottish National Party Debate on Implications of the 
            Care Development Group Report-</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2248</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Care 
            Development Group</strong>-That the Parliament notes the publication 
            of the report of the Care Development Group and welcomes the opportunity 
            for a full parliamentary debate on the detail of the recommendations 
            contained in the report; further welcomes the Scottish Executive's 
            pledge to make personal care free for all elderly people from April 
            2002 whilst noting that aspects of the detail of this commitment require 
            further clarification; notes in particular that the £125 million set 
            aside by the Scottish Executive will not be sufficient to fund the 
            recommendations of the Care Development Group unless Her Majesty's 
            Government agrees to allow those currently eligible for Attendance 
            Allowance to retain this benefit, notwithstanding their entitlement 
            to free personal care; believes that, as a matter of principle, any 
            such shortfall should not be met from within existing Scottish Executive 
            resources, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to make the necessary 
            amendments to the social security regulations or, alternatively, to 
            transfer the resources that will be saved as a result of the withdrawal 
            of Attendance Allowance to the Scottish Executive. </p>

            <p><strong>S1M-2054</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>RCN 
              Scotland's "Value Nurses" Campaign</strong>-That the Parliament 
              supports the Royal College of Nursing Scotland's &quot;Value Nurses&quot; 
              campaign, which highlights the crucial role that nurses play in 
              delivering high quality patient care; welcomes the nursing summit 
              announced by the Minister for Health and Community Care, and believes 
              that the Executive should take action to recruit and retain more 
              nurses and to reward them in a way which demonstrates the value 
              the Parliament attaches to their work. </p>
