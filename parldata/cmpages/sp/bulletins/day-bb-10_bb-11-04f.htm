<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the<a href="#end"> end of this section </a>the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7344 Marilyn Livingstone: Maggie&rsquo;s Merry Messages</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Maggie&rsquo;s Merry Messages and considers it to be a fun and innovative Christmas campaign by Maggie&rsquo;s Cancer Caring Centres in which people are encouraged to write their Christmas messages to friends, family and colleagues on a large, specially designed festive poster in place of sending Christmas cards; notes that people can write their Christmas messages on the poster for all to see and make a donation to Maggie&rsquo;s in the process; commends the fact that any group of people who send cards to each other can get involved, whether it is a club, a company, a hospital department, a place of worship or a school; welcomes the fact that Maggie&rsquo;s Merry Messages allows people to help the environment and make a donation to Maggie&rsquo;s at the same time, and hopes that as many people as possible support the initiative to raise money for their local Maggie&rsquo;s Cancer Caring Centre.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7343 Stuart McMillan: Inverclyde Council&rsquo;s Green Charter</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that all 43 educational establishments in the Inverclyde local authority area now have their own green charter and three-year action plan; notes that the green charter implemented by Inverclyde Council seeks to promote the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of local people and the community; further notes that Inverclyde schools have committed to taking action on energy saving, recycling and litter and aiming for an eco-school award at the appropriate level, with the option of focusing on other environment topics, such as water conservation, reducing waste or the journey to school; acknowledges what it considers the bold action taken in Inverclyde to address climate change and find greener solutions, and urges other local authority areas to follow this example.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7342 Aileen Campbell: Biggar&rsquo;s Restaurant 55 is a Top Rural Eatery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Restaurant 55 in Biggar on being nominated for the Best Rural Restaurant of 2011 award; believes that this nomination is due to what it considers to be the high quality food served in the restaurant and its relaxed atmosphere; welcomes its use of locally sourced produce, and wishes the restaurant the best of luck at the awards.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7341 Aileen Campbell: Lanark&rsquo;s Airshow Centenary Statue Takes Off</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Lanark Airshow Committee on the unveiling of the commemorative Lanark Airshow Centenary statue at Lanark Loch and what it considers to be the excellent programme of events that the committee has held over the past year to celebrate the 1910 International Lanark Airshow; notes that the sculpture was commissioned by the committee and was designed and built by artist blacksmiths P Johnson &amp; Company, and believes that the sculpture and programme of events have helped to celebrate and recognise the importance of the 1910 Lanark Airshow to the town, which attracted aviators from around the world and was attended by 250,000 visitors.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7340 Aileen Campbell: Increasing Police Numbers in Clydesdale Subdivision of Strathclyde Police</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Strathclyde Police South Lanarkshire Division to increase the number of officers in the community policing teams in the area; notes that among the areas to benefit will be the Clydesdale subdivision in the South of Scotland region, where increased officer numbers will allow for full police coverage every day of the week in some areas where previously such coverage has not been available; believes that the ability of the police force to deploy officers in this way is a result of investment by the SNP-led Scottish administration, which has provided resources to employ more than 1,000 additional officers across Scotland since May 2007, and hopes that these new arrangements in the Strathclyde Police South Lanarkshire Division will help to reduce crime and the fear of crime in the area.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7339 Sarah Boyack: Herald Society Award for Edinburgh Care Tender Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Edinburgh Campaign for Choice in Care and Support Services on being awarded the Herald Society Award for Campaign of the Year in 2010; notes that the campaign opposed proposals by the City of Edinburgh Council to tender a number of care and support services for people with learning disabilities and other support needs that reportedly would ultimately have affected nearly 800 people receiving support from 30 different care providers and expressed concern at the lack of proper consultation; understands that the proposals in the tender would have removed hundreds of service users from carers with whom they had built up trusting relationships over time and severely restricted the level of direct payments available to people who wanted to organise their own care; further notes the findings of an independent review by Deloitte, which criticised flaws in the tender process, including inconsistent scoring of tender bids, inaccurate and incomplete pricing information and an execution that was &quot;not as sufficiently meticulous or as thorough as expected&quot;; further notes an internal report by the chief executive of the City of Edinburgh Council, Tom Aitchison, acknowledging the flaws in the process, and his apology for the distress caused to vulnerable groups, and recognises the contribution that the Edinburgh Campaign for Choice in Care and Support Services made, in highlighting the concerns of vulnerable people, to persuading the council to abandon the tender and prompting the above reviews.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7338 Pauline McNeill: V&amp;A At Dundee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, whose design has been chosen for the V&amp;A museum planned for Dundee&rsquo;s waterfront; pays tribute to the other architects shortlisted, and considers it important to bring the V&amp;A museum to Dundee and to properly fund such a development.</p>
<p>Supported by: Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7337 Joe FitzPatrick: Victoria and Albert Museum Dundee Design Competition Winner</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kengo Kuma and Associates, the design team that has been awarded the contract to construct the Victoria and Albert Museum building at Craig Harbour in Dundee; welcomes the news that four UK-based companies, including three from Scotland will be involved in the project to build what it expects will become a national landmark; understands that the project, expected to be completed in 2014, will create 900 jobs and bring an estimated 130,000 extra visitors to Dundee each year; further notes that the museum aims to provide access to high-quality exhibitions for residents in Dundee and across Scotland, and welcomes the support given to the project by the University of Dundee, the University of Abertay Dundee, Dundee City Council, Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Government.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7336 Sandra White: Storyline Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the international success of the Scottish Storyline method, developed in and after 1967 by Steve Bell, Sallie Harkness and Fred Rendell at Jordanhill College of Education in Glasgow; considers this to be an innovative teaching approach, placing students&rsquo; existing knowledge at the centre of the learning experience, and notes that it has been taken up not only in Scotland but internationally, in Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States; congratulates Steve Bell and his colleagues on their success and contribution to international teaching, and believes that this evidences Scotland&rsquo;s continuing excellence as a centre of imaginative liberal education in the tradition of Robert Owen, Thomas Davidson, AS Neill and RF MacKenzie.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-7335 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Committee Membership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that&mdash;</p>
<p>Bill Kidd be appointed to replace Jamie Hepburn as a member of the European and External Relations Committee;</p>
<p>Jamie Hepburn be appointed to replace Bill Kidd as a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee;</p>
<p>Jamie Hepburn be appointed to replace Bill Kidd as a member of the Public Audit Committee.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7334 Robert Brown: National Dementia Strategy Should Include Care Homes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the challenge of the increasing number of people suffering from dementia, predicted to double over the next 25 years from the current estimated 71,000; notes the publication of <em>Scotland&rsquo;s National Dementia Strategy</em> in June 2010 and welcomes the ongoing work of the Dementia Strategy Implementation and Monitoring Group and its commitment to report annually on progress and to review the strategy by June 2013; believes, however, that the strategy places too little emphasis on the need for a supportive environment, a stable and committed workforce and the availability of stimulating activities in care homes, which accommodate about one third of dementia sufferers, particularly those with more advanced conditions; stresses the need for better information and patient pathways for dementia sufferers and their carers, and is grateful for the work done to support carers and people with dementia by organisations such as Rutherglen Community Carers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7333 Robert Brown: No Consultation with Scottish Human Rights Commission on Emergency Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the views of Professor Alan Miller, Chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission, that there are serious concerns about both the human rights implications and the detailed terms of the   Criminal Procedure (Legal Assistance, Detention and Appeals) (Scotland) Act 2010, which was drafted specifically to address a human rights issue ; believes that the legislation may well leave Scottish criminal procedure relating to the detention and interrogation of suspects open to further challenge under the European Convention on Human Rights; feels that the speed with which the legislation was rushed through the Parliament was unnecessary and represented a constitutional outrage, and is appalled that the Scottish Government did not consult the Scottish Human Rights Commission, a body set up for advice on precisely this type of case, on what is considered the biggest human rights issue since the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7332 Bill Wilson: UN Vote on Depleted Uranium</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes various reports of recent increases in the incidence of childhood leukaemia and other cancers, stillbirths and birth defects in Iraq, which also suggest that these are linked to the deployment of depleted uranium weaponry; supports the recent UN resolution calling on countries using depleted uranium weapons to release quantitative and geographical data relating to the use of these weapons to the governments of affected states; notes that the UK Government did not support the resolution at an earlier stage, and expresses the hope that, when the resolution goes forward to the United Nations General Assembly for a second vote at the end of November 2010, it will at least not veto it.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7330.1 Derek Brownlee: Managing Scotland&rsquo;s Finances</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7330) in the name of Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;despite&quot; to end and insert &quot;the previous UK administration presided over a deficit in each year from 2001, seven years before the longest and deepest recession in British history and the banking crisis and nine years into a 16-year-long period of sustained economic growth, until its ejection from office in 2010; notes that the previous UK administration intended to continue running deficits for a further seven years if it were re-elected; regrets the failure of the Labour Party to acknowledge any responsibility for the state of the UK public finances and the impact that the fiscal mismanagement of the Blair/Brown years has had on the devolved budget, and calls on all parties in the Parliament to ensure that the Scottish budget for future years protects the vulnerable from the consequences of Labour&rsquo;s legacy of overspending and debt.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7330.2 Jeremy Purvis: Managing Scotland&rsquo;s Finances</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7330) in the name of Andy Kerr, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that, in order for local authorities, NHS boards, universities, colleges and the wider public sector to plan services most effectively, the Scottish Government should publish a spending review for the period 2011-12 to 2014-15 in addition to its one-year budget proposals for 2011-12.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7330.3 John Swinney: Managing Scotland&rsquo;s Finances</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7330) in the name of Andy Kerr, leave out from second &quot;that&quot; to end and insert &quot; the dire condition of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s finances due to years of Labour economic mismanagement; regrets the impact of the UK Comprehensive Spending Review that takes &pound;1.3 billion out of the Scottish budget, including &pound;800 million from the capital budget; regrets that UK Government cuts go too far and too fast, jeopardising the Scottish economy and putting jobs at risk, and calls for the Scottish Parliament to be given full financial responsibility as the best means of ensuring that Scotland can build sustainable economic recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7227*#* Elaine Smith: There Is a Better Way</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the STUC on the launch of its There is a Better Way campaign; believes that deep, savage and immediate cuts are neither unavoidable nor inevitable and that they would actually threaten economic recovery *across Scotland and in areas such as Coatbridge and Chryston*; further believes that a sensible and sustainable response to the current economic crisis is to promote growth and ensure fairness through creating jobs and protecting services, through fair taxation and a living wage, and *would welcome widespread support for the STUC campaign*.</p>
