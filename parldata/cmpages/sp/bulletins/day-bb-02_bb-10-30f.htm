<STRONG>Fergus Ewing: Dentistry</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes that children&#146;s 
registration with an NHS dental practice expires after a period of 15 months; 
believes that a child should be registered with a dentist until adulthood, and 
calls upon the Scottish Executive to amend the current rules governing registration 
of children with NHS dentists so that registration does not lapse in this way.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3518#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Brian Fitzpatrick: End Debt on our Doorstep</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
applauds the work of the individuals and organisations supporting the Debt on 
our Doorstep campaign in speaking out against poverty, the effects of debt and 
extortionate lending and for fair and affordable finance in Scotland and across 
the whole of the United Kingdom; acknowledges the progress made since Church Action 
on Poverty's Pilgrimage against Poverty in 1999 and the commitments made by Her 
Majesty's Government and the devolved administrations to tackling poverty and 
social injustice but recognises that still too many people in this country continue 
to struggle with the burdens of poverty and debt and are systematically excluded 
from affordable credit and forced into the arms of extortionate lenders; affirms 
the need for greater awareness and support for credit unions and other community 
finance and development initiatives and for high street lenders to more fully 
honour their social responsibility obligations; considers that the Scottish Executive 
should, working together with the other devolved administrations and Her Majesty&#146;s 
Government, make progress on securing tighter regulation of extortionate lending 
and establishing accessible and fair Social Fund arrangements so as to alleviate 
the burdens of debt on poor people and their families, and congratulates the organisers 
of the End Debt on Our Doorstep Lobby and Action Day taking place in Edinburgh 
and London on 3 December 2002 for stimulating public debate and creating fora 
where the voices and needs of folk with direct experience of poverty and debt 
can be heard. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3517 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary

<STRONG>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Edinburgh Hogmanay "Eurozone"</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament commends the initiative of the Scotland in Europe campaign to have 
Edinburgh designated a temporary &quot;eurozone&quot; during the period of the 
upcoming Hogmanay celebrations, whereby local businesses, shops, hoteliers and 
pubs would be encouraged to accept euros as payment from visitors; notes that 
a similar scheme in the Welsh town of Llangollen during the Eisteddfod this year 
was a great success and of huge benefit both to Llangollen and to Wales as a whole; 
believes that Edinburgh, too, would benefit from a eurozone period through the 
enhanced enjoyment of the festival, the boost to local tourism and the further 
promotion of Edinburgh&#146;s reputation as a great European city, and urges all 
political parties, Edinburgh City Council, local businesses and tourist organisations 
to work together in pursuing the Hogmanay eurozone project to a successful conclusion.</P><P>Supported 
by: Tricia Marwick<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Linda Fabiani<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3512</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Brian Fitzpatrick: Leukaemia Research Fund Campaign</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes that about 24,500 people are diagnosed with leukaemia or 
a related cancer of the blood in the UK every year; further notes that around 
600 children in Britain develop leukaemia or lymphoma every year, accounting for 
about half of all childhood cancers; recognises that survival rates for the most 
common types of childhood leukaemia have risen dramatically, and warmly endorses 
the launch on 30 October 2002 by the Leukaemia Research Fund (LRF) of a major 
fund-raising campaign for a £2.25 million LRF centre to be sited at Gartnavel 
Hospital in Glasgow bringing together cancer scientists, clinicians and patients 
under one roof in order to better facilitate the cross-fertilisation of research 
ideas and to support improved research outcomes, better treatments and increasing 
survival rates.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3511</STRONG> <STRONG>Richard Lochhead: Fishing</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament recognises that sustainable fisheries are essential for the well-being 
of our fishing communities but rejects any advice to close Scotland&#146;s mixed 
fishery as part of a cod recovery plan given the devastating and unjustifiable 
impact that such a measure would have on our fishing communities and associated 
sectors; calls on the Scottish Executive to work in partnership with the fishing 
industry with a view to drawing up proposals for the future management of all 
fish stocks; notes that technical conservation measures and the recent decommissioning 
scheme have not been fully taken into account; further notes that other states 
that fish Scottish waters, or impact on local stocks, have a duty to adopt similar 
measures including a reduction in the industrial fishery, and believes that any 
further measures, for which the necessary funding should be made available, should 
be delayed given that they would be most effectively generated through the new 
mechanisms proposed as part of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy that will 
be adopted in a matter of weeks and that Scotland should seek to officially lead 
the UK delegation during forthcoming European negotiations on which the future 
of the fishing industry depends. </P><P>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson<STRONG>*</STRONG>,
