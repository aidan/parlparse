          <p><strong>*S2M-246</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Deportation 
            of the Ay Family</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is appalled at 
            the persistent attempts of Her Majesty&#146;s Government to prevent 
            the Ay family, currently imprisoned at Dungavel Immigration Removal 
            Centre, from receiving asylum in Britain and, in particular, deplores 
            the House of Lords&#146; refusal on 31 July 2003 of the Ay family&#146;s 
            last appeal which, if not overturned, will mean the deportation of 
            Mrs Ay and her four children to Germany and their return from there 
            to Turkey where they will almost certainly face imprisonment and possible 
            death; supports the Ay family&#146;s lawyer&#146;s attempts to lodge 
            an asylum application on behalf of the Ay children so that they can 
            be saved from deportation, and calls urgently on the Home Office not 
            to remove these children from Scotland until their asylum application 
            has been processed in the proper way.</p>

            Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, 
            Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-245</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Rangers 
            Football Club</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Rangers 
            Football Club on its remarkable and unprecedented achievement in winning 
            fifty league titles since the club's formation, the first football 
            club in the world to achieve this total, and wishes Rangers every 
            success in the forthcoming league season at home and in Europe.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-244#</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>Argyll 
            and Clyde NHS Board Maternity Review</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            views with concern the decision of the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board, 
            taken at its meeting on 29 July 2003, relating to its review of maternity 
            services; notes that implementation of the board&#146;s decision would 
            result in only one consultant-led maternity unit in Paisley remaining 
            within the board&#146;s entire area; further notes the removal of 
            consultants from the Rankin Maternity Unit in Greenock and the non-return 
            of consultant services to the Vale of Leven Hospital, after the withdrawal 
            of maternity services from that hospital last year, and believes that 
            the Minister for Health and Community Care should delay reaching a 
            final decision on the board&#146;s recommendation until such time 
            as the effects on paediatrics, gynaecology, anaesthetics, accident 
            and emergency and clinical support services, as a consequence of the 
            board&#146;s decision, have been fully assessed, along with the impact 
            of the decision on the wider review of health care services.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mr Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Jim Mather<strong>*</strong>, 
            Murray Tosh<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn 
            Leckie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-243</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Caledonian 
            MacBrayne Ltd</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the vital 
            role played by the workers of Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd (Calmac) in 
            providing vital lifeline links to Scotland&#146;s island communities; 
            fully supports the action of the National Union of Rail, Maritime 
            and Transport Workers in balloting workers for potential strike action; 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to fund fully the 3.5% pay rise to 
            the workers and end the practice of long working hours, the use of 
            low-paid agency labour and the disparity in workers&#146; conditions 
            between the Clyde and Western Isles division, and further calls on 
            the Executive to resist all attempts to privatise Calmac by the back 
            door.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-242</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Ian Edmond</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Ian 
            Edmond on creating a new Commonwealth record in winning the silver 
            medal for the 200 metres breaststroke at the World Swimming Championships 
            and extends its appreciation of his achievement to the coaches and 
            swimmers in Scotland whose dedication and application are raising 
            standards at all levels in Scottish swimming.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-241#</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Galloway 
            Fisheries Inshore Exclusion Zone</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the threat to the fisheries within Luce Bay and 
            Wigtown Bay in Galloway posed by recent exploitation of the fisheries 
            by a &quot;supercrabber&quot; and the consequential threat to the 
            20 local livelihoods that these fisheries sustain; further notes that 
            any future expeditions by industrial vessels of this nature will inevitably 
            deplete available stocks to unsustainable levels, and therefore believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should introduce a three-mile exclusion 
            zone for all vessels over 40 feet to cover both of these bays thereby 
            safeguarding both the stocks and the jobs that they sustain.</p>
          <p>Supported by: David Mundell<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-240</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Legal 
            Deposit Libraries Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports 
            the principles of the Legal Deposit Libraries Bill 2003 and agrees 
            that the provisions in the Bill that relate to devolved matters should 
            be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-239</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>The 
            Office of Communications</strong>&#151;That the Parliament urges that, 
            in view of the importance of telecommunications and broadcasting for 
            the economic and social development of Scotland, there should be statutory 
            provision for ensuring that the interests of Scotland are taken into 
            account in the governance and procedures of the Office of Communications 
            (Ofcom) and, in particular, that the Ofcom board should include a 
            member for Scotland, that the Ofcom Consumer Panel should be required 
            to set up a committee capable of representing the interests and opinions 
            of people living in Scotland and that Ofcom should be required to 
            maintain an office in Scotland.</p>
