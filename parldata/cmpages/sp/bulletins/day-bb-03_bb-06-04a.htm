            <p><strong>S2M-47</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>The 
              Need for a New Secondary School in North-East Fife at the Tay Bridgehead</strong>-That 
              the Parliament notes the longstanding need for a new secondary school 
              at the Tay Bridgehead in north-east Fife; is aware of widespread 
              local community support in the area for such a school; believes 
              that the school is vital to relieve pressure on Madras College, 
              St Andrews, which is the second largest secondary school in Scotland 
              with a pupil roll of 1,850 and on Bell Baxter High School, Cupar, 
              and further notes that the relocation of an additional squadron 
              to RAF Leuchars will increase the pressure on the existing secondary 
              schools and exacerbate the current situation. </p>
