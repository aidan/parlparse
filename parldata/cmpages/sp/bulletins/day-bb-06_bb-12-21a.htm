<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish National Party Debate: Trident&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>&#9;</em><strong>S2M-5355</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Trident</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication by the UK Government of its White Paper on the future of the Trident nuclear missile system on Monday 4 December 2006; recognises the need for a full debate to explore the military, economic and political consequences of Trident renewal and believes that a convincing case can be made, in military, economic and political terms, for the non-replacement of Trident, and calls on the UK Government not to go ahead at this time with the proposal in the White Paper. </p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5355.5</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan: Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5355) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;the publication&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the UK Government has initiated a debate on the future of the independent nuclear deterrent force and urges everyone in Scotland to take part in it; recognises that the decisions on national defence are rightly reserved to Westminster; considers that any government has a primary duty to protect the security of its people and that this includes a credible policy on national defence and international security; believes in a shared objective of a world without nuclear weapons and supports further reductions in the global nuclear arsenal; further believes that, in seeking a world free from nuclear weapons, we should utilise and develop our international engagement at every level including at the EU, the United Nations including the UK&rsquo;s seat on the Security Council, NATO and the G8; notes with concern the plans of the SNP to take Scotland out of the collective security arrangements of the UK and NATO and to establish separate armed forces for Scotland with greatly diminished capabilities either to contribute to international peacekeeping operations or even to defend Scottish interests, and rejects those policies on the grounds that they would threaten the security of Scotland, diminish our armed forces and destroy jobs.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5355.2</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie: Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5355) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;and believes&quot; to end. </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5355.3</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5355) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;rejects the case made by the UK Government in its White Paper on the future of the Trident nuclear missile system published on 4 December 2006 that the decision on a replacement for Trident needs to be made in early 2007 and calls on the UK Government not to go ahead with the proposals in the White Paper at this time.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish National Party Debate: Post Offices&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>&#9;</em><strong>S2M-5349</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Post Offices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the reductions in the post office network proposed by the UK Government and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the UK Government to ensure that Scotland retains a comprehensive and accessible post office network.</p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5349.4</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Post Offices</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5349) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that it is necessary to look carefully at the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals for the future of the post office network in full and the consultation paper itself to ensure that the special needs of Scotland&rsquo;s remoter communities are properly taken into account; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s proposal to apply four criteria to this assessment, namely whether there will be an acceptable level of future services, especially in remote rural and disadvantaged communities, whether there is a recognition that post offices do not occupy a purely commercial role in our communities, but have an important social role to play, whether there is proper consultation with affected local communities and whether there will be a continuation of Post Office efforts to promote innovative means of service delivery; believes that it is important that the vital social and economic role of post offices has been acknowledged; is pleased to see the commitment of &pound;1.7 billion to support the network and to pay for restructuring and that the annual social network payment will remain in place meantime, and is encouraged by the push for outreach locations for remote communities&quot;. </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5349.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Post Offices</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5349) in the name of Mr John Swinney, after first &quot;Government&quot; insert &quot;notes that decisions taken by the UK Government have themselves contributed to the losses being made by the post office network and that it is therefore disingenuous for ministers to justify the extensive scaling down of the network on the basis that it is losing money; believes that the UK Government should seek to bring new business opportunities to the network rather than merely manage its decline&quot;. </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5349.3</strong> <strong>Euan Robson: Post Offices</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5349) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the post office network plays a crucial role in Scotland; notes that this is a reserved issue and supports the Liberal Democrats&rsquo; rejection of the recommendation of the UK Government&rsquo;s post office network consultation paper that a further 2,500 post office branches be closed across the United Kingdom.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5349.2</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Post Offices</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5349) in the name of Mr John Swinney, after second &quot;Government&quot; insert &quot;to begin paying post offices adequately for the government services they provide, to return services that it has withdrawn, such as issuing  television licenses, to post offices, to begin the development of post office accounts as a banking facility for those living in deprived and rural communities and to consider providing assistance to communities in deprived urban and rural areas to open community post offices to prevent the loss of vital local services, and thus.&quot; </p>
