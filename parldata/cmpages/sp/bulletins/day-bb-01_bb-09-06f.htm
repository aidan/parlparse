            business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2176</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Future of Glasgow Underground</strong>-That 
            the Parliament supports Bill Miller MEP in his efforts to exempt the 
            Glasgow underground system from any European legislation which would 
            force all public transport systems across Europe to go out to tender 
            for five-year contracts and notes that the tendering process could 
            cost Strathclyde Passenger Transport £10 million that could instead 
            be spent on improving the service for passengers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2175#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: European Year of Languages 
            2001 &amp; BSL</strong>-That the Parliament believes that in 2001, the 
            European Year of Languages, the Scottish Executive should take forward 
            the lessons of the Millennium Project 2000 which taught the basics 
            of British Sign Language (BSL) and Deaf Awareness to schoolchildren; 
            invites the Scottish Executive to investigate the introduction of 
            BSL to the school curriculum, and further believes that Her Majesty's 
            Government should give official recognition to BSL under the terms 
            of the European Charter on Minority Languages. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2174</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Maintenance of Manufacturing 
            Base</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the decisions of companies such 
            as Compaq, BAe Systems and Marconi to axe thousands of jobs across 
            Scotland, thereby not only putting at risk the livelihoods of workers 
            and their families but also the very manufacturing base of which Scotland 
            is justifiably proud and agrees that action needs to be taken to ensure 
            the long-term security of Scotland's skilled manufacturing base and 
            that ways should be examined, including the seizure of these companies' 
            assets, to prevent Scotland from being turned into an industrial wasteland 
            by global corporations whose only motivation is profit.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2173</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Medical Secretaries in North 
            Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament supports the action of the medical 
            secretaries in North Glasgow who have been forced into industrial 
            action by poverty pay and an unfair grading system and further supports 
            their claim for higher grading and improved salaries.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2163.1</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Erskine Bridge Tolls Bill</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S1M-2163) in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave 
            out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;does not agree 
            to the general principles of the Erskine Bridge Tolls Bill because 
            it wishes first to examine the whole issue of bridge tolling and requests 
            that the Transport and the Environment Committee stages an inquiry 
            into the economic and legal impact of bridge tolls in Scotland and 
            makes recommendations on what legislation, if any, is required.&quot; 
          </p>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2162.1</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Erskine Bridge Tolls Bill</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S1M-2162) in the name of Sarah Boyack, <a name="AmendmentText">insert 
            at end &quot;and calls on the Parliamentary Bureau to bring a motion
