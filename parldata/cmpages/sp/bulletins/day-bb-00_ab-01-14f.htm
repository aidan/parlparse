    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-423#</b> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson: Non-Housing Building Consents</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the problems that smaller local authorities have with the size of
    non-housing building consents in respect of significant capital projects and in particular
    the problems faced by Clackmannanshire Council, the smallest mainland authority, where the
    consequences for completing vital infrastructure projects such as the A907 are
    problematic, and calls upon the Executive to investigate a flexible approach which
    recognises the problems of scale.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-421</b> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Musical Instrument Tuition</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that participation in music can enhance young people&#146;s
    attainment in numeracy and literacy, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to recognise
    the difficulties faced by local authorities in maintaining provision for musical
    instrument tuition for young people, and to recognise the need to provide increased
    central funding to support such provision and allow Scottish local authorities to give
    opportunities to all young people who wish to benefit from the experience of playing a
    musical instrument.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-420</b> <strong>Ross Finnie: The Pesticides (Maximum Residue Levels in
    Crops, Food and Feeding Stuffs) (Scotland) Regulations 2000</strong>&#151;That the Rural
    Affairs Committee in consideration of the Pesticides (Maximum Residue Levels in Crops,
    Food and Feeding Stuffs) (Scotland) Regulations 2000, recommends that the Regulations be
    approved.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-419</b> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: The Glasgow Edinburgh Financial
    Divide</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the special problems of Glasgow,
    particularly in relation to unemployment and the widening gulf between Glasgow and
    Edinburgh which results in Glasgow having double the unemployment of the capital, and
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure that key departments are transferred to
    Glasgow to alleviate unemployment; to support Glasgow being granted metropolitan status,
    and to allocate a special budget to tackle poverty urgently.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Ms Sandra White<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-418</b> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Suicide</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    notes with deep concern the death of 874 Scots by their own hand in 1998; is aware that
    since 1984 the proportion of male Scots aged 35 or under whose deaths can be attributed to
    suicide has increased from one in nine to one in four, and for females from one in twenty
    to one in seven in the same age category, making suicide the most common cause of death in
    young Scots; recognises that in Scotland the suicide rate for males and females of all age
    groups is 32 and 10 respectively per 100,000 and increasing, whereas in England it is 18
    and 6 per 100,000 and decreasing; believes the reasons for suicide to be complex,
    multi-functional and poorly understood and calls upon the Scottish Executive to
    commission, at the earliest date possible, wide ranging, comprehensive research into the
    issue of suicide, analysing what makes people take their own lives, why the suicide rate
    in Scotland is increasing, why particular groups in society are more vulnerable than
    others, how other countries prevent suicide, and introducing an early warning system of
    diagnosis and intervention.</p>
