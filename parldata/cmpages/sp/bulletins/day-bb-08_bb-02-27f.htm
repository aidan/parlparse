<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1436</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Air Route Development</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen airport on being named by the Airports Council International as the world&rsquo;s most improved airport; recognises the potential importance of such an award in attracting new business and increased tourism to Aberdeen and the north east, and calls on ministers to help Aberdeen and other airports to continue to grow business by putting in place a scheme to support the marketing of Scotland as a destination, in association with the establishment of new direct air routes to Scotland, to build on the successes of the Route Development Fund.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1435</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2007 Amendment Order 2008 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1434</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Improving Accountability</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that government should be open and accountable; affirms its support for the Seven Principles of Public Life established in the first report of the Nolan Committee and for the further principles governing ministerial conduct as set out in the Scottish Ministerial Code; notes that the First Minister is reviewing the code, in line with practice after each Scottish parliamentary election; acknowledges the increasing calls for independent oversight of the code; considers that a modern and progressive government has nothing to fear from ensuring transparency and accountability in all that it does, and therefore calls on the First Minister to include independent oversight of the Scottish Ministerial Code, taking the new UK Ministerial Code as the starting point, and to bring forward a statement to the Parliament on this when the review is concluded.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1423</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Architecture and Design Scotland Schools Design Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the creation of Architecture and Design Scotland&rsquo;s (A+DS) schools design programme and the ambition to raise both awareness and ambition in the design of schools; notes A+DS&rsquo;s recent briefing that successful schools have flexible and adaptable designs which are at the heart of their communities and in which environmental sustainability informed all aspects as part of an integrated concept, and congratulates Scottish architect Paul Stallan on becoming A+DS&rsquo;s education design champion.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1422</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Hamish MacInnes on Scottish Award for Excellence</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glencoe resident Hamish MacInnes on his well-deserved Scottish Award for Excellence in Mountain Culture in recognition of his pioneer spirit and service to the mountaineering community; notes that Mr MacInnes has made considerable contributions as an inventor, author, climber and search and rescue specialist, and welcomes the presentation of his award at the Fort William Mountain Festival on Saturday 23 February 2008.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1420</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>St Andrew&rsquo;s Medal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that a special award should be commissioned to reward acts of civilian bravery and recognise exemplary acts of gallantry by individuals in, or meriting recognition by, Scotland; notes that the UK Government presently issues its own gallantry medal to its subjects in the form of the George Medal, depicting St George of England slaying a lion, but that the Scottish Government currently has no formal method to recognise acts of bravery and heroism by its own citizens, and therefore urges Scottish ministers to consider instituting an award for bravery, entitled the St Andrew&rsquo;s Medal, as a way to recognise and acknowledge acts of great bravery by individuals in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1419</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Fair Trade is the Answer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Whitelees Primary School, in Abronhill, Cumbernauld, for its commitment and enthusiasm in promoting fair trade in its community and bringing Cumbernauld closer to being established as a Fairtrade Town;  applauds the work of Whitelees Enterprise Team in identifying the need to widen awareness of fair trade products with the objective of &quot;promoting and supporting the work of the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund and Fair Trade by raising awareness of the exploitation of poor people globally, promoting and embracing global citizenship, valuing diversity and engendering a real sense of community which stretches across the world&quot;; recognises the importance and opportunity from the release of &quot;Fair Trade is the Answer&quot;, a CD with music and lyrics written and performed by the pupils of Whitelees School of Rock and Primary 7; shows appreciation to the staff and students at Cumbernauld College for their support and technical expertise in producing the CD; welcomes the partnership approach adopted by the school and its ability to engage with outside organisations to benefit and enhance pupils&rsquo; educational experience;  welcomes the team&rsquo;s commitment to spreading its message across the United Kingdom and, through links with Cumbernauld&rsquo;s twin town, Bron in France, taking the message beyond our shores; acknowledges that all money raised from the sale of the CD will go to support fair trade and encourages every school in Scotland to purchase a CD in support of fair trade and the message of global citizenship that it contains, and looks forward to Scotland earning fairtrade status.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1412</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>The Glennie Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the potential impact of the implementation of the Glennie Report on *dental practices* throughout Scotland as it will require dental surgeries to have a separate sterilisation room, new equipment and more staff to meet its requirements; notes that many dental surgeries cannot physically be altered to accommodate these changes and acknowledges that, if enforced, these changes will hit NHS dental surgeries, particularly rural dental surgeries, hardest; is further aware of the existing acute lack of dentists in the Highlands and Islands and believes that, if the Glennie Report&rsquo;s recommendations are implemented, it will mean the closure of some of the few remaining surgeries, leaving people to travel even further for treatment or being forced to go private, and calls on the Scottish Government not to enact the *Glennie Report*.</p>
