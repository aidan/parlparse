    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-858</b> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Glasgow Regeneration</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament endorses the wide-ranging action being taken by the Executive to ensure
    that all of the key agencies work together with the citizens of Glasgow to tackle the
    deep-rooted challenges facing the city; recognises the excellent work being done by the
    key players who form the Glasgow Alliance and the role they have to play in tackling these
    challenges, and notes the part the Executive has played in supporting the significant
    developments which will prepare Glasgow&#146;s economy, housing, education provision and
    hospitals for the 21st century. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Henry McLeish<strong>*</strong>, Mr Frank McAveety<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-857</b> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil: Gourock/Dunoon Ferry Service</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament welcomes the commitment by the Minister for Transport and the Environment
    to make strong representations to the European Commission for the Gourock/Dunoon ferry
    service to be included in the wider CalMac tendering process; notes that vehicular
    transport on the service receives no public subsidy at present; further notes that nothing
    in the current proposals precludes CalMac from continuing to carry vehicles; and
    recognises that, to have the best chance of securing the long-term future of the service,
    all interested parties should support the Minister in her negotiations with the Commission
    to the fullest of their ability.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-856#</b> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh: Assisted Area Status of Arbroath</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with concern the exclusion of Arbroath from the revised Assisted Area
    boundary proposals; recognises that while significant gains have been made in recent years
    to restructure the local economy, the case for re-inclusion is strong, given the
    consistently high levels of unemployment, the significant dependence on a declining
    manufacturing sector, and the opportunities which exist to benefit from Regional Selective
    Assistance; understands that without Assisted Area status recent gains in Arbroath will be
    reversed, and invites the Scottish Executive to make representations to the Department of
    Trade and Industry to reinstate the excluded areas.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-855#</b> <strong>George Lyon: Dervish Landmine Clearance Project</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament applauds the work of the Edinburgh-based Dervish Landmine Clearance Project
    which is working to produce the cheapest and most effective method of landmine clearance
    in the world; wishes the charity every success in its bid to raise the £4 million it
    requires in order to produce and maintain the clearance equipment, and believes that the
    project could make Scotland a world leader in the fight to rid the planet of landmines.</p>
