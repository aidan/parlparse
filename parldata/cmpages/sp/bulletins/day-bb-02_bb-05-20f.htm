          <p><strong>*S1M-3133</strong> <strong>George Lyon: Water Connection Charges</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises that tens of thousands of households around 
            rural Scotland are not currently connected to either water or sewerage 
            mains; notes that such households are reliant on private, untreated 
            water supplies and are continuing to discharge raw sewage directly 
            into our rivers and lochs; further notes with concern that there are 
            as yet no clear guidelines relating to the cost of, or criteria for, 
            connecting these households to the new water and sewerage mains currently 
            being installed by the water companies; acknowledges that first time 
            connection charges to the water mains represent a considerable cost 
            for domestic residents, and calls on the Scottish Executive to produce 
            a clear, transparent policy on first time connection criteria and 
            charges for Scottish Water.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3132</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Energywatch "Stop Now!" Campaign</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the energywatch &quot;Stop Now!&quot; campaign 
            which is designed to put a stop to cowboy tactics used by some gas 
            and electricity companies, regrets the increase in unscrupulous sales 
            tactics by such companies which, customers report, can include lying, 
            bullying, misleading requests and intimidation; supports the demands 
            made by energywatch to ensure that the gas and electricity companies' 
            house is put in order by (a) the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets 
            (Ofgem) keeping and strengthening the operating licensing conditions 
            with which the energy companies must comply, (b) Ofgem using its power 
            to fine unscrupulous energy companies, (c) the energy companies establishing 
            a &quot;rogues' register&quot; of sales agencies and individuals who 
            fail to meet acceptable standards, (d) the energy companies paying 
            proper compensation to consumers for any distress and inconvenience 
            caused by their sales malpractices and (e) the establishment of a 
            standard format for energy supply contracts so that consumers are 
            able to understand contracts and compare them with other suppliers; 
            welcomes the commitment of energywatch to work with the police to 
            combat bogus caller crime; urges the Scottish Executive to work in 
            partnership with Scottish energy companies to improve consumer relations, 
            and commends energywatch for raising the profile of such important 
            consumer issues.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3131</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Donation to New Labour From 
            Mr Richard Desmond</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the acceptance 
            by New Labour of a £100,000 donation from porn publisher Richard Desmond; 
            believes that it is no coincidence that this followed approval by 
            Her Majesty's Government for Mr Desmond's controversial purchase of 
            Express Newspapers; notes with surprise and disappointment the remarks 
            made by John Reid that New Labour does not exercise &quot;moral judgment&quot; 
            over prospective donors; believes that Mr Desmond's titles are demeaning 
            and degrading to women; notes the academic research proving a link 
            between pornography and violence against women, and calls on New Labour 
            to end its relationship with Richard Desmond and return this donation.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3130#</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Victims of Asbestos at Work</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the decision of the House of Lords over-ruling 
            the High Court and Court of Appeal in the test cases of Fairchild 
            and others; welcomes the opportunity to acknowledge this historic 
            victory for victims of asbestos-related diseases, their families and 
            trades unions and recognise the crucial role of trade union legal 
            aid schemes in securing justice; notes that it was known as long ago 
            as 1910 that workers who were exposed to asbestos risked injury and 
            death; further notes that the first asbestos regulations were introduced 
            in 1931, that by the 1940s it was known to major employers that asbestos 
            was linked to lung cancers, that by the 1960s it was known to them 
            that exposure to asbestos caused mesothelioma but that workers on 
            the Clyde and elsewhere continued to be exposed to asbestos negligently 
            and in breach of statutory duties throughout the 1970s and into the 
            1980s, at a terrible cost to them, their families and society; recognises 
            that it was trade unions, including the GMB, UCATT and Amicus, that 
            spoke up for their members and took on powerful and wealthy forces, 
            including insurance companies who, to their eternal shame, adopted 
            tactics that spun out legal claims to which there was no legal answer 
            wilfully and in expectation of the victims dying; notes the work of 
            our trades unions and their allies across the labour movement who 
            campaigned to change the law on damages and who are working now to 
            speed up claims and secure fair compensation; believes that the Scottish 
            Executive and MSPs should ensure that the needs of asbestos victims 
            and their families and carers are addressed across all Executive departments 
            and across the responsibilities of the committees of the Parliament, 
            and urges renewed effort in order to secure speedy resolution and 
            fair compensation for asbestos victims.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3129</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: University of St Andrews Students' 
            Association - Landlords' Charter</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the publication by the University of St Andrews and the University 
            of St Andrews Students' Association of the <em>Landlords' Charter for 
            Rental to Students in St Andrews</em> and, in particular, the co-operation 
            between landlords and the Students' Association in agreeing the terms 
            of the charter which will help to ensure that students in St Andrews 
            will be able to rent high quality accommodation which is properly 
            maintained and safe whilst landlords will be assured of responsible 
            tenants, and believes that this initiative will help foster better 
            relations between town and gown in St Andrews.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3128</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Local Government in Scotland Bill</strong>-That

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3127</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: Independence Day: East Timor</strong>-That

            of Timor Loro Sae to achieve international recognition of nationhood; 
            congratulates East Timor, which has a population of 800,000, on today, 
            20 May 2002, becoming the world's newest independent nation and looks 
            forward to the day when Scotland also becomes a fully fledged member 
            of the family of nations.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3126#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Re-opening of Reston Railway 
            Station</strong>-That the Parliament supports the campaign by RAGES for 
            the re-opening of a railway station at Reston in Berwickshire, the 
            former station having closed in 1964; notes that many Borderers currently 
            commute by car to either Berwick or Dunbar to then travel citywards 
            by train; further notes that there is agricultural land available 
            for a new-build station and parking and that for a small sum, in the 
            order of £10,000, a feasibility study into the re-opening of a station 
            at Reston could be undertaken, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should commission such a study now.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3125#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: National Carers' Week, 10-16 
            June 2002</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 10-16 June 2002 has been 
            designated as National Carers' Week and welcomes the opportunity to 
            acknowledge and celebrate the crucial role of carers within the Glasgow 
            Pollok constituency, in Glasgow and across Scotland; recognises the 
            central role of carers in providing support for people who are frail 
            or who have a disability which otherwise would cost social and health 
            care services in Scotland in excess of £5 billion and, as shown in 
            recent research by Carers Scotland, in contributing to the broader 
            life of local communities; accepts that the demands of caring can 
            often lead to social exclusion; invites the Scottish Executive and 
            MSPs to ensure that the role of carers is addressed across all Scottish 
            Executive departments and across the responsibilities of the committees 
            of the Parliament, and asks all those with a statutory responsibility 
            to consult and engage with carers so as to do everything in their 
            power to ensure that the expertise, knowledge and commitment of carers 
            are harnessed in the important work of securing social justice for 
            carers and those for whom they care.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3124#</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Closure of Longannet Deep Coal 
            Mine</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the closure of Scotland's last 
            deep coal mine at Longannet in Fife; is deeply disappointed that over 
            500 mining jobs were lost and that Scotland has also lost its most 
            valuable low sulphur coal reserve; is concerned that the pit flooded 
            at a time when Scottish Coal (Deep Mine) Ltd was experiencing financial 
            and production difficulties and that the reasons for the flooding 
            have not yet been adequately explained; is further concerned that, 
            despite the substantial public investment, in excess of £45 million, 
            inadequate steps were taken by Her Majesty's Government to protect 
            the public's investment in the mine, save the jobs or retain this 
            valuable energy resource for the nation, and therefore believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should carry out a full public inquiry to determine 
            how the flooding was allowed to take place that resulted in the mine's 
            closure.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona McLeod</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3123</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Family History Societies Support</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the excellent work being done by the many 
            volunteer genealogists within the network of family history societies 
            throughout Scotland, despite facing problems of unsuitable accommodation 
            and lack of funding and support, and asks the Scottish Executive to 
            consider how it might best support this network as part of the geneaology 
            tourism niche market strategy.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3122</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: UNISON Campaign to Avoid Cuts

            launched by UNISON, the UK's largest trade union, against the United 
            Kingdom joining the European Single Currency and notes its concern 
            that joining the euro would be a disaster for public services if public 
            spending had to be cut to comply with European Central Bank spending 
            limits.</p>

            the Parliament notes the abandonment by the Portugese Government of 
            its economic agenda due to the threat of potential fines and a reduction 
            in European Union development subsidies if it were to breach the tight 
            restrictions of the Stability and Growth Pact which are required as 
            a member of the euro currency and further notes that VAT will rise 
            from 17% to 19%, civil service recruitment has been halted, 30 publicly 
            funded institutions are to close and the independent Government of 
            Portugal has withdrawn its plans to reduce corporation tax which was

            Body (SPCB) for offering Fairtrade tea and coffee to members and staff; 
            looks forward to the steps that the SPCB will take to extend the range 
            of fairly traded products; calls upon local authorities throughout 
            Scotland to promote Fairtrade products in their offices and also within 
            local communities by asking supermarkets and local shops to stock 
            Fairtrade products; congratulates those cities and areas such as Edinburgh, 
            Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Strathaven and the Isle of Skye for taking 
            this initiative and considers that the Scottish Executive should take 
            the lead and help Scotland become the world's first "Fairtrade country".</p>

            in Scottish politics; believes that in this post-devolution era this 
            course is a great asset to the Scottish academic and political community 
            and hopes to see the continuation of this course for many years to

            by traders in Glasgow's Trongate for the regeneration of the area; 
            notes with concern that the area has suffered from neglect and decline 
            in recent years whilst other parts of the city have benefited from 
            regeneration; supports the demands of the traders for steps to be 
            taken for the area's regeneration, including a new railway station 
            at Glasgow Cross as part of the Glasgow CrossRail scheme, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should ensure that measures are put in

          <p><strong>S1M-3113#</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Diabetes Week 9-15 June 2002</strong>-That

            Diabetes UK on its hard-hitting campaign, &quot;Diabetes - possible 
            to deal with, deadly to ignore&quot;, which underlines the seriousness 
            of diabetes in that, according to research funded by Diabetes UK, 
            people with diabetes are nearly twice as likely to die prematurely 
            as people without the condition; recognises the implications for public 
            health and health education of the recent diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes 
            in children, and believes that the necessary steps should be taken 
            to ensure that people in Scotland, including children, have access

          <p><strong>S1M-3104#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Community Police Officers</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the extremely effective role played by community 
            police officers in combating crime, particularly youth crime; notes 
            that such officers are often the most visible and recognisable police 
            presence in their communities and recognises the crucial role that 
            they play in providing high quality policing and fostering links with 
            the communities they serve; regrets that these officers are often 
            removed from their vital community role to perform other police duties, 
            and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should encourage 
            community policing and provide the necessary resources to ensure the 
            provision of adequate numbers of community police officers. </p>

            the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from 
            the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any 
            increase in expenditure payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund 
            in Consequence of the Act.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace, Dr Richard Simpson, Peter Peacock</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3101#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler: Local Authority Funding</strong>-That 
            the Parliament commends the initiative of Glasgow City, Argyll and 
            Bute, Dundee City, Inverclyde, Midlothian and West Dunbartonshire 
            councils in commissioning a special report from Professor Arthur Midwinter, 
            <em>Grant Distribution and the Mismatch Effect: An Assessment of its 
            Impact on Council since Reorganisation</em>, which concludes that there 
            is &quot;clear evidence of the erosion of grant income&quot; between 
            1996-97 and 2001-02 in these local authority areas; acknowledges the 
            report's view that the flawed reorganisation of local government ordered 
            by the last Conservative government is the root cause of a situation 
            where, in these six local authority areas in the period, government 
            grants fell by 4.8% in real terms compared to an average drop of 1.2% 
            across Scotland's councils and council tax rose by 20% in real terms 
            compared to an average of 16%, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should seriously consider accepting the central recommendation of 
            the report, namely that it should provide a supplementary grant of 
            £50 million to redress this historical mismatch of funding: £32 million 
            to Glasgow, £5 million to Dundee, £3.4 million each to Midlothian 
            and Argyll and Bute and £2.5 million each to West Dunbartonshire and 
            Inverclyde respectively, such funding arising from a more equitable 
            distribution of grant increases in the future.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3100</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Scottish Local Government Funding 
            Crisis</strong>-That the Parliament notes the publication of the report 
            <em>Grant Distribution and the Mismatch Effect: An Assessment of its 
            Impact on Councils since Reorganisation</em> by Professor Arthur Midwinter; 
            recognises the report's conclusions that Argyll and Bute, Dundee City, 
            Glasgow City, Inverclyde, Midlothian and West Dunbartonshire councils 
            have suffered due to the reorganisation of local government to the 
            tune of £50 million per annum; further recognises that this additional 
            grant would allow an average reduction in council tax of £112, and 
            calls on the Minister for Finance and Public Services to take account 
            of this financial injustice in advance of the local government settlement 
            for 2003-04.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Tommy Sheridan</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3099#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Funding Mismatch for Local Authorities</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText"></a>notes the erosion of grant 
            income resulting in a severe funding mismatch for six local authorities, 
            including Glasgow City Council, as identified in a specially commissioned 
            report by Professor Midwinter of Strathclyde University; further notes 
            that the mismatch occurred as a direct result of local government 
            reorganisation in 1996 following which grant income fell 4.6% for 
            these local authorities against a Scottish average drop of 1.2%; expresses 
            concern at the direct affect that these budgetary</p>
          <p>restraints have had on council tax payers with a 20% increase in 
            the affected authorities against a Scottish average of 16%; recognises 
            that Glasgow City Council and the other five councils have since operated 
            at a financial disadvantage; supports the call of the six local authorities 
            and Professor Midwinter for restoration of £50 million, £32 million 
            going to Glasgow, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            rectify this mismatch immediately and ensure equitable distribution 
            of future grant increases.</p>
