<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1043</strong> <strong>Iain Gray:</strong> <strong>Knowes Farm Shop - Scotland&rsquo;s Best Local Food Retailer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Knowes Farm Shop, near East Linton, on being awarded the title of Best Local Food Retailer at Scotland&rsquo;s Best Rural Retailer Awards 2007 held on 11 December in the Parliament; commends its business model of growing and producng a wide range of eggs, vegetables and herbs which are then sold direct to customers fresh from the field, and wishes Knowes Farm Shop the very best of luck in the UK finals of the Best Rural Retailer competition.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1042</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Fur Farms</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 85% of the fur industry&rsquo;s skins come from animals that have lived captive on fur factory farms where conditions are often overcrowded and inhumane practices are regularly documented; considers the slaughter of animals for their fur to cause unnecessary cruelty and calls for an end to this abhorrent trade, and congratulates animal rights agencies who are campaigning this Christmas to urge the public to boycott all real fur products.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1041</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Possible Breach of the Councillors&rsquo; Code of Conduct</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the investigation by the Standards Commission for Scotland into the conduct of two Midlothian Councillors who voted to reinstate a senior official of their party after he had previously been dismissed from his council position; understands that the councillors failed to register their interest in the situation, and notes with concern that this incident is the latest in a series of alleged&nbsp;breaches of the code of conduct by members of this party.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1040</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Teenage Kicks - Improving Musical Opportunities for Young People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent visit of Feargal Sharkey, chair of the UK Live Music Forum and former lead singer of The Undertones, to meet members of the Cross-Party Group on the Scottish Contemporary Music Industry; congratulates the forum for the work done with the UK Government to utilise assets from dormant bank accounts to fund rehearsal spaces and instrument lending for young people in disadvantaged communities and for securing an advance payment from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to take forward plans modelled on a studio in Wrexham and proposals which have been suggested for Ferguslie Park in Paisley, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the cross-party group to ensure that Scotland receives its share of any funds released and also to examine whether proceeds of crime revenue can be used to widen access to the music industry for young people in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-964</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Adam Ingram, Maureen Watt</p>
<p><strong>S3M-953#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Support Project Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its dismay at the decision of the Scottish Government to withdraw funding from Project Scotland, the ground-breaking volunteering project, which since its inception has secured well over 1,000 placements for young people throughout Scotland; recognises the very real and tangible benefits both to local communities and organisations, such as the Temple Shafton Youth Project in Glasgow, which have participated in the scheme and wholeheartedly applauds the effort and commitment of the volunteers involved; acknowledges that participants have been able to discover and develop new skills during their time with Project Scotland; notes the cross-party support for motion S3M-695 in the name of Sandra White, which acknowledged the positive role played by Project Scotland in helping &quot;those previously excluded from participating in society to realise their true potential and aspirations&quot;, and believes that the decision should be reversed and support given to a project which, through the sterling efforts of volunteers, has made a significant contribution to a more inclusive and co-operative Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-944</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Road Hauliers and a Fuel Price Regulator</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Road Haulage Association&rsquo;s campaign to introduce a fuel price regulator; notes the burdensome cost of fuel for motorists and the road haulage industry which affects Scotland; notes that Scotland is one of the world&rsquo;s largest oil producers with oil at record prices; further highlights the negative effect of soaring fuel prices on competitiveness; urges the UK Government to close the gap between fuel duties charged in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe; considers that the revenues from fuel duties and VAT, accounting for 60% of the price of petrol and diesel, pose an unfair burden on industry and consumers, and calls on the UK Government to introduce a fuel price regulator which would ensure the smooth modulation of VAT on fuel to reflect changes in the price of oil thus protecting hauliers and consumers.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-944.1</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Road Hauliers and a Fuel Price Regulator</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-944) in the name of Brian Adam, insert at end &quot;and to ensure that the fuel price regulator mechanism allows for regional variations in tax rates set so that it can be used to remove regional variation in the price paid for fuel at the pumps in order that motorists in the islands and remote rural areas, who need their cars as public transport alternatives are limited, no longer pay around 10 pence per litre more for fuel than motorists in Scotland&rsquo;s cities, where motorists have many public transport alternatives.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Liam McArthur<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-464#</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Support for Border News</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that moves by ITV to merge some of its smaller regional news services should be opposed; believes that these proposals pose a significant threat to the future of Border television and would be damaging to regional news in the region; considers that a merger of Border television news with STV news services would also be a bad move for television in Scotland and would provide a downgraded service for the customer, and believes that local and regional television services provide a valuable role in an increasingly centralised market.</p>
