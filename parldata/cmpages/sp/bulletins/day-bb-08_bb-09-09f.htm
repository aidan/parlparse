<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2516</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Real Garlicky Win</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Really Garlicky Company in Nairn for its Best Farm Entrepreneur win at the Country Living and Waitrose Made in Britain Food Awards and recognises that during Scottish Food Fortnight local companies throughout the nation, and especially in the Highlands and Islands, are key to delivering good quality tasty food and will play a key factor in the development of the Scottish national food policy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2515#</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Crossrail Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Aberdeen Crossrail project as an integral part of a future transport strategy for the north east; believes that a frequent rail service with new stations running between Stonehaven, Inverurie and Aberdeen is vital to tackling congestion in Aberdeen and to economic growth in the north east; believes that the project is essential for a sustainable transport strategy in the area and to provide much improved public transport options for residents and commuters; believes that supporting Aberdeen Crossrail will enable even more ambitious plans to be developed for new rail services in other parts of Aberdeenshire; is concerned at recent reports that the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland are no longer supporting the scheme, and hopes that the long-established consensus to support Aberdeen Crossrail will continue.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2514&diams; </strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Legacy from Lottery Funding for Community Sport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in view of the reduction in lottery funding for the development of community sport in Scotland, supports calls for a substantial sum of National Lottery funding to be released now, thus ensuring both support for ongoing coaching programmes and a legacy from the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow that benefit the population of Glasgow and all of Scotland, and believes that such funding is capable of enhancing the Glasgow games so that, in addition to supporting a spectacular event, the investment would lay the foundations for health and sporting improvements across the entire population of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2513</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Rectors for All of Scotland&rsquo;s Universities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with interest the call from Scotland&rsquo;s five university rectors for the creation of similar positions at the other universities in Scotland and believes that the post of rector acts as an independent champion for students in these institutions and that students across Scotland would benefit from such a position being introduced in every university.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2511</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>BBC Alba - Speed Up Freeview Option</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the BBC Alba Gaelic television channel; wishes that all those involved will make the service a success; notes the potential that it has to boost the profile of the Gaelic language while informing and entertaining people throughout the country; however also notes, with disappointment, the fact that this service is not intended to be available through Freeview until after the digital switchover and that this will be subject to a review by the BBC Trust, and calls on the UK Government and BBC to speed up this process so that the channel has the chance to be watched by Gaels and non-Gaels throughout the nation who possess a Freeview box but do not have cable nor a satellite television.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2510</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Perth Street Pastors</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the work done by the multi-denominational voluntary Perth Street Pastors; notes that, while the only location in which street pastors currently operate in Scotland is Perth city centre, there are moves to extend the concept into Aberdeen, Inverness, Glasgow, Dunfermline, Stirling and Edinburgh; further notes that in England, where the street pastor movement is widespread, some studies indicate that street crime falls by around 84% for the period of time when street pastors are out on the streets, and commends the many volunteers who are prepared to give up time at night to help make city streets safer and therefore make a night out a more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2509</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Good Luck to Andy Murray</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Andy Murray on his victory in the US Open semi-final, over Rafael Nadal, to reach his first grand slam final; notes that he is the first Scottish, and only the second British, tennis player to reach a grand slam final in modern day tennis; wishes him all the best in the final against Roger Federer, and hopes that he becomes the first British tennis player to win a grand slam for 72 years, since Fred Perry won the 1936 US Open.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2502*#*</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Bannockburn Battlefield</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament observes the importance of the Battle of Bannockburn in Scottish history, where Robert the Bruce led a significant Scottish victory against the English in the Wars of Scottish Independence in June 1314; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s historic battlefields are important to Scottish history and that the sites must be protected as a memorial to the men who fought and died in the battles as well as allowing future generations to visit the sites and learn more about Scotland&rsquo;s past; notes the concerns of the National Trust for Scotland that the Bannockburn battlefield may fail to qualify for Historic Scotland&rsquo;s planned inventory of battlefields as too much housing has already been allowed on and around the historic site, and considers that the battlefield site has already been subject to enough development and that it now requires protection to stop any future development.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2497*#*</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Sex and Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Sex and Power 2008</em>, the Equality and Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s annual report looking at women in positions of power and influence across the public and private sector; notes the theme of the report, &quot;missing women&quot;, and its statement that &quot;if women hope to shatter the glass ceiling and achieve equal representation, we would need to find the women who are missing from top positions of power in Scotland&quot;; is concerned that despite higher academic attainment, with 57% of university students being women, women constitute only 7.4% of senior police officers, 11.8% of judges of the Court of Session and 13.6% of Scottish MPs and that, while Falkirk Council has women as leader of the administration and Chief Executive and in many senior posts, this is rare elsewhere, with women constituting only 12.5% of local authority chief executives and only 18.8% of local authority leaders; is further concerned that the report shows a declining percentage of women among public appointments, senior police officers, judges of the Court of Session, Scottish MPs and MSPs and highlights that ethnic minority women experience greater barriers in the workplace and are almost completely absent from positions of power; considers that Scotland is failing to get talented women into these positions and consequently is losing out on their contribution to Scotland&rsquo;s social and political life and our economy, and believes that much more should be done to find the 130 women missing from public appointments, the 85 missing women headteachers in secondary schools, the 21 missing women MSPs and many others, as identified by the report.</p>
