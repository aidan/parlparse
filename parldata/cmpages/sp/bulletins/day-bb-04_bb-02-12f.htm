          <p><strong>*S2M-908</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for the Ay Family Threatened with Imminent Deportation to Turkey</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with grave concern the imminent threat to deport 
            the Ay family from Germany to Turkey and the unusually speedy rejection 
            of their last appeal; further notes the disappearance of Mr Ay on 
            his return to Turkey in 2002 and the fact that he remains missing 
            to this day; cautions the Home Office that failure to note this evidence 
            of danger to the family could lead to their death or similar disappearance 
            and represents a breach of their human rights guaranteed under the 
            United Nations Charter and European Convention on Human Rights; calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to Home 
            Office ministers to intercede immediately on behalf of the Ay family 
            and use their discretionary powers to grant the family leave to return 
            to the UK, and further calls upon the Executive to work with the Home 
            Office to develop an impartial asylum assessment system.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-907#</strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison:</strong> 
            <strong>Fish Farming in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the results of a study into the presence of chemical residues in seabed 
            sediments near fish farms, published by the Scottish Environment Protection 
            Agency (SEPA); notes that 89% of sample measurements did not detect 
            any residues of chemicals used to treat sea lice; further notes that, 
            in the 11% of analysis where there were measurable concentrations 
            of active ingredients, residues were restricted to areas of seabed 
            below and close to fish farms and that all results from outwith these 
            immediate areas were below SEPA's safe environmental standards; welcomes 
            the continuing commitment of the Scottish aquaculture industry to 
            minimising the environmental impact of fish farming, and commends 
            SEPA on its use of sound science, robust regulation and partnership 
            working to ensure the protection of Scotland's marine resources.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-905#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Satrosphere 
            Science Centre</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the review of 
            science education in Scotland; supports the role that science centres 
            such as Satrosphere in Aberdeen play, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should financially support these centres on a fair and equitable 
            basis.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-904</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Rock 
            Challenge</strong>-That the Parliament notes the excellent work undertaken 
            by the Be Your Best Foundation in organising the 2004 Rock Challenge 
            for school students, allowing them to use and develop music, dance, 
            drama and production skills with the aim of encouraging young people 
            to maintain a healthy lifestyle by making a commitment not to take 
            drugs and avoid drinking and smoking, and congratulates Peterhead
