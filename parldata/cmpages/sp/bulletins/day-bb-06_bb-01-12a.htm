<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary  Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed  by</em> Scottish  National Party Debate: Local Government Finance&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <strong>S2M-3795 Mr John Swinney: Local Government Finance&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the widespread  concern over the inadequacy of the local government finance settlement for  2006-07 and 2007-08; notes the recommendations of the Finance Committee that  the Scottish Executive should reconsider the settlement; welcomes the moves to  make government more efficient but calls for this process to be applied equitably  across national and local government and conducted with greater rigour; calls  on the Executive to restore the &pound;58.5 million in efficiency savings to local  government baselines and to make available to local authorities &pound;34.7 million  from the pre-Budget report consequentials on condition that this is used to  deliver a real-terms freeze in council tax, and recognises that these are  short-term improvements to the unfair council tax that will only be resolved  when the system is abolished and replaced by a local income tax based on the  ability to pay. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The  Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S2M-3795.4 George Lyon: Local Government Finance&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3795)  in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &ldquo;widespread concern&rdquo; to end and  insert &ldquo;record levels of finance  provided to local government by the Scottish Executive which mean that by  2007-08 core funding will have increased by over &pound;3 billion or 55% compared  with 1999-2000; welcomes the report from the Local Government Improvement  Service which confirms that councils are on course to achieve at least &pound;122  million in efficiency savings in 2005-06; notes that the Executive has given a  commitment to consider some further additional resources for 2007-08 subject to  local government delivering on their efficiency targets and that the Executive  is engaged in an ongoing discussion with local government about the financial  pressures councils are facing and the steps local government can take to  maintain downward pressure on council tax, and looks forward to the report of  the independent committee on local government taxation, which is due later this  year.&rdquo; </p>
    <p><strong>S2M-3795.3 Mr David Davidson: Local Government Finance&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3795)  in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &ldquo;, and recognises&rdquo; to end and  insert &ldquo;as many in Scotland are suffering as a result of the 55% rise in  council tax since the Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition came to power; believes  that a proposed new system of local income tax would be over-complicated,  expensive to collect, would remove accountability and transparency from local  government and adversely penalise young working households, and notes that the  real problem in Scotland is the high level of council taxes charged, not the tax  itself.&rdquo; </p>
    <p><strong>S2M-3795.1 Mark Ballard: Local Government Finance&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3795)  in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &ldquo;local income tax&rdquo; to end and  insert &ldquo;system of land value taxation that recognises that ability to pay is  not determined solely by income.&rdquo; </p>
    <p><strong>S2M-3795.5 Tommy Sheridan: Local Government Finance&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3795)  in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &ldquo;welcomes&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;believes  that local authorities have taken giant strides to improve efficiency but are  hampered by inefficient and uneconomic public private partnership deals and the  use of expensive consultants which, coupled with the inadequacy of central  government funding, makes the protection and expansion of vital local government  jobs and services increasingly difficult to achieve; calls on the Executive to  restore the &pound;58.5 million in efficiency savings to local government baselines  and to make available to local authorities &pound;34.7 million from the pre-Budget  report consequentials on condition that this is used to deliver a real-terms  freeze in council tax; recognises that these are short-term improvements to the  unfair council tax that will only be resolved when the system is abolished and  replaced by a local income tax based on the ability to pay, and believes the  Executive must fully fund equal pay restructuring across Scotland&rsquo;s local  authorities to deliver economic justice to the hundreds of thousands of women  workers who have been illegally underpaid for years.&rdquo; </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> <strong>S2M-3806 Allan Wilson: Skills and Training for a Modern Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees  that developing the current and future workforce of Scotland is key to ending  poverty and sustaining economic growth; recognises the very good progress that  is being made in reducing unemployment through investment in skills and training,  and welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s intention to work with the United Kingdom  Government, employers and employer organisations, universities, colleges,  training organisations and other public agencies to drive forward opportunities  for workforce development to strengthen the economy and improve the  employability and skills of individuals across Scotland, in particular those  furthest from employment and those in lower paid, low skilled jobs. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The  Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S2M-3806.1 Jim Mather: Skills and Training for a Modern Scotland&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to  motion (S2M-3806)  in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &ldquo;; recognises&rdquo; to end and insert  &ldquo;but regrets the continuing delay in the publication of the Scottish  Executive&rsquo;s employability strategy and the lack of any new measures to tackle  the unacceptably high number of 16 to 19-year-olds who are neither in  employment, education or training in Scotland and recognises that the  Executive&rsquo;s worthy objectives self-evidently can only be met comprehensively  when Scotland couples relevant, valued and constantly improving training with  the full range of economic powers that can credibly and tangibly improve  competitiveness and create the levels of employment opportunity and sustainable  income improvement for all which, in turn, will retain and attract talented  people to Scotland.&rdquo; </p>
    <p><strong>S2M-3806.2 Murdo Fraser: Skills and Training for a Modern Scotland&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to  motion (S2M-3806)  in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &ldquo;recognises&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;notes  the outstanding success of modern apprenticeships in helping thousands of young  people into work and training since 1994; welcomes the devolution of workforce  services currently provided by the New Futures Fund from Scottish Enterprise to  local community partnerships; notes with concern that Scotland has more young people  who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) than any other OECD  country or UK region; is disappointed at the delay in the Scottish Executive  publishing its long-awaited Employability Framework; notes the findings of the  NEET working group set up by the Executive that young people who are NEET are  generally characterised by low educational attainment, truancy and/or  disadvantaged backgrounds, and calls on the Executive to extend the vocational  opportunities available at further education colleges from the age of 14 and to  expand the role of community-based voluntary programmes which play a crucial  role in combating deprivation.&rdquo; </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed  by</em> Parliamentary  Bureau Motions</p>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong> Decision  Time</p>
<p><em>followed  by</em> Members&rsquo;  Business:</p>
<p> Debate  on the subject of&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-3558 Shona Robison: The Tayside Project&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament commends Marie Curie Cancer  Care for joining forces with NHS Tayside, Dundee City Council, Perth and  Kinross and Angus Councils and the Scottish Ambulance Service to deliver the  first Scottish project of the Delivering Choice Programme in Tayside, which  aims to look at the problems in palliative care provision in the region before  developing a strategy to deliver the best possible palliative care and  end-of-life care for patients in the area, allowing them to be cared for in the  place of their choice; notes that Tayside has specific problems in this area,  with 75% of the admissions to the cancer centre in Ninewells Hospital being for  palliative care, and that over the three-year project issues like this will be  tackled, and believes that the findings of the project should be utilised in  other areas of Scotland to inform palliative care policy so that everyone in  Scotland can benefit from this ground-breaking project. </p>
