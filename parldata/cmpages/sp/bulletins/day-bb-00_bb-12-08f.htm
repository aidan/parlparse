            <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Homelessness and Access to Education</strong>-That the 
            Parliament commends Ayr Housing Aid Centre and Barnardos Ayr Homelessness 
            Service for their recently launched report <i>Homelessness and Access 
            to Education: Breaking Down the Barriers</i>; recognises the adverse 
            impact of homelessness on children and their education and the need 
            to develop policies and services which address this; acknowledges 
            that children are not normally in a position to represent their own 
            interests in the same way as adults and that particular attention 
            therefore needs to be paid to the effect of policy changes on their 
            lives; endorses the conclusions of the report, and asks the Scottish 
            Executive to consider these when developing housing, education and 
            children's services policies.</font></p>

            <strong>Fergus Ewing: Less Favoured Areas Subsidy</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that the deal obtained for crofters regarding the Less Favoured 
            Area Subsidy amounts to a betrayal of crofting communities and calls 
            upon the Executive to bring forward urgent measures to tackle the 
            financial crisis which will face many individual crofters.</font></p>

            Galloway Standard</i> on the success of its Millennium Jobs Crusade 
            initiative in partnership with the Employment Service, the Careers 
            Service and Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise, which has succeeded 
            in getting more than its target of 104 unemployed people in Dumfries

            <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: AGS and Audit Committee Reports on Holyrood

            the Holyrood Project by the Auditor General for Scotland and the Audit 
            Committee, finds it necessary to censure Mr Muir Russell, the Permanent 
            Secretary at the Scottish Executive, for his failure to properly advise 
            the Scottish Executive and the Parliament on the true state of the 
            progress and costs of the new Parliament building at Holyrood. </font></p>

            <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Equal Rights for Gartmore Forestry Development 
            Objectors</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the overwhelming majority 
            of the community of Gartmore is opposed to the plans for a commercial 
            Christmas tree plantation at Borland Farm, Gartmore; supports the 
            application of the Sandford principle to ensure that the limited economic 
            value of the proposal is balanced against the social and environmental 
            costs which would affect an area which will lie within the Loch Lomond 
            and Trossachs National Park; notes that the Forestry Commission Environmental 
            Assessment process has failed to take proper account of the representations 
            of the local community, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to amend 
            the Environmental Impact Assessment (Forestry) (Scotland) Regulations 
            1999 to establish equal rights for all concerned with proposals for 
            commercial forestry developments, including community representatives.</font></p>

            welcomes the inquiries that are to follow; considers that, in line 
            with both the principle of open government referred to by the Minister 
            for Justice and the wider public concern over the way in which the 
            prosecution process is currently being pursued, the inquiry undertaken 
            by Sir Anthony Campbell should be held in full public view, and registers 
            its concern that a person with known connections to the Labour Party 
            has been appointed to conduct the second inquiry, as this undermines 
            public confidence in the integrity of the inquiry.</font></p>
