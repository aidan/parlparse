<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3438</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Committee Membership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that&mdash;</p>
<p>Maureen Watt be appointed to replace Roseanna Cunningham on the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee;</p>
<p>Linda Fabiani be appointed to replace Alex Neil on the Finance Committee.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3437</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Build Dumbarton Academy Now</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament urges West Dunbartonshire Council to commit to funding a new-build Dumbarton Academy at its budget-setting meeting on 12 February 2009; considers that the building is in an appalling state with substantial repairs required to bring the school up to minimum standards; understands that this is of concern to pupils, parents and teachers alike; believes that the pupils are restricted in their learning opportunities due to the condition of the learning environment; further believes that West Dunbartonshire Council has the resources to fund the project, and therefore strongly urges the council to build a new Dumbarton Academy without further delay.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3436</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Venezuela&rsquo;s Progress Towards Eliminating Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research that records a significant decline in poverty in Venezuela over the last 10 years as measured by multiple criteria, one aspect of which is a decline in extreme poverty of 72%; also notes that most of Venezuela&rsquo;s economic growth has been in the non-oil sector of the economy, that the private sector has grown faster than the public sector, that employment and access to healthcare and education have substantially improved, that total public debt has fallen from 30.7 to 14.3% of GDP and foreign public debt from 25.6 to 9.8% of GDP; further notes that Venezuela holds foreign exchange reserves equivalent to 25% of its GDP and considers that it is therefore well placed to weather a period of low oil prices and the global economic downturn; congratulates Venezuela on these successes, and calls on western governments to learn from the approach of Venezuela under the leadership of Hugo Ch&aacute;vez Fr&iacute;as and for the western media to acknowledge these facts and present a fair and balanced picture of that country and its government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3435</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Loss of Jobs at the RAC Call Centre in Bishopbriggs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement that the RAC is to axe around 100 jobs at a call centre in Bishopbriggs; further notes that the workers affected by the job losses answer telephone calls from motorists who have broken down; acknowledges that during these difficult economic times it is disappointing to see further job losses, and asks that the RAC does everything in its power to listen to the views of the workers during the 90-day consultation period and keep job losses to a minimum.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bob Doris<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3434</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>RBS Job Losses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the latest announcement from the Royal Bank of Scotland that it is cutting its workforce by 2%, which will result in 2,300 job losses across the United Kingdom; notes that the announcement affects 40 sites in Scotland and that more than half of the bank&rsquo;s 16,500 jobs in Scotland are based in Edinburgh; considers it deeply regrettable that skilled hardworking staff will pay the price for the financial mismanagement of the senior bankers; believes that it is utterly unacceptable for bonuses to be awarded to senior staff at this time, particularly in a company that is now 70% in public ownership, and hopes that as many jobs as possible can be safeguarded.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3434.1</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>RBS Job Losses</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3434) in the name of Shirley-Anne Somerville, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Royal Bank of Scotland to work with the trade unions, Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) and other employment agencies to maximise redeployment opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3433</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, at &pound;50.55 per week, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is lower than most earnings replacement benefits, lower, for example, than the category A State Pension of &pound;90.70, than long-term Incapacity Benefit and Employment and Support Allowance (with work-related activity component) of &pound;84.50, than Statutory Sick Pay of &pound;75.40 and than contribution-based Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance for over-25s of &pound;60.50, with the contribution-based Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance for under-25s being an exception at only &pound;47.95; considers that unpaid carers make a vast contribution to society as a whole, both in terms of social wellbeing and public finance, and calls for an urgent and substantial increase in Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to support more fittingly those who unselfishly sacrifice their time to look after others.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3432#</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Action Mesothelioma Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports national Action Mesothelioma Day, which takes place on 27 February 2009, in recognition of people who have died and those who continue to suffer from mesothelioma; commends the work of Clydeside Action on Asbestos in providing an invaluable service to sufferers of mesothelioma, providing support for more than 80% of people affected in Scotland with representation in health, legal and financial matters, while contributing to public policy; notes the need to increase awareness and understanding of the illness and to identify the needs of people diagnosed and their families and friends; recognises that many people who have developed mesothelioma have done so from going to work and contributing to the growth of the Scottish economy in a range of professions, including not only people employed in heavy industry and construction but also people employed in hospitals, teachers and lab technicians, and therefore recognises the continued need for research into the management and treatment of this condition.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3430</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow&rsquo;s Hidden Treasure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the ongoing success of the Hidden Gardens, a former derelict industrial site in Glasgow&rsquo;s south side that has been transformed into a tranquil and inspirational haven; commends the Hidden Gardens&rsquo; worthy aim to increase understanding and integration between cultures alongside improving the health and wellbeing of the local community, and believes that the Hidden Gardens offers a glimpse of how the urban landscape can be used to put the needs of the local community at its heart.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3429</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Petition to Save Royal Mail from Privatisation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the petition on the 10 Downing Street website, launched by the Communication Workers Union, which calls on &quot;the Prime Minister to reject any part privatisation or minority stake sale of Royal Mail which could lead to loss of service, price hikes and would erode a much loved public service&quot;; endorses the sentiment of this petition, and encourages people across Scotland to sign the petition at http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/Royal-Mail-Sale/ and show their support for a publicly-owned postal service in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3428.1</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Healthcare Associated Infections</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3428) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end &quot;and, given that the cabinet secretary has deemed the publication of the report of the independent review team on Clostridium difficile at Vale of Leven Hospital as not being prejudicial to the police inquiry, calls on the Scottish Government to establish a public inquiry immediately.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3428.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Healthcare Associated Infections</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3428) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the high priority that the Scottish Government is placing on tackling and driving down healthcare associated infection, backed by investment of &pound;54 million; notes that a national action plan is in place and that a national reporting template has been introduced to ensure that NHS boards have the necessary policies and practices in place to drive forward improvements in areas such as governance, leadership and surveillance; further notes that NHS boards are now required to report publicly on hospital by hospital performance on MRSA and Clostridium difficile rates, environmental cleaning and the causes of adverse incidents; further acknowledges that a target of a minimum 30% reduction in Clostridium difficile rates by 2011 is in place and that there is a zero tolerance approach on hand hygiene; also notes that the Healthcare Associated Infection Task Force has been asked to consider implementation of the elements of the Labour Party&rsquo;s 15-point plan not already underway, and&nbsp;further notes that the Scottish Government has agreed to progress the electronic bed management system supported by the Conservative Party and that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing will report regularly to the Parliament on the progress being made on tackling healthcare associated infection.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3427.1</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3427) in the name of Mary Mulligan, insert at end &quot;; welcomes the second-stage stock transfer to local housing associations in Glasgow; notes that housing stock transfer in Scotland would achieve &pound;2 billion of debt write-off from HM Treasury, and therefore urges the Scottish Government to engage proactively with the 26 local authorities yet to transfer their stock with a view to effecting stock transfers to community-based housing associations and facilitating further investment in affordable housing in Scotland.&quot;</p>
