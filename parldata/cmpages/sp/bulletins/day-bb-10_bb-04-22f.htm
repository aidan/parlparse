                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6183 Cathy Peattie: Remember the Dead, Fight for the Living</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day on 28 April 2010, which this year has the theme, unions make work safer; notes that this is the first year that the day has been officially recognised by the United Kingdom; believes that formal recognition will reinforce the significance of the day and raise awareness of the millions of workers who are injured or die from accidents and diseases at work, and the 160 million who fall ill each year due to unsafe, unhealthy or unsustainable work and workplaces; notes that such deaths greatly exceed the number of deaths caused by war and that many would be preventable by improved health and safety; notes that events will be held throughout Scotland, including a wreath-laying ceremony at noon on 24 April in Falkirk Municipal Buildings; calls for the day to be widely observed in Scotland through action to improve safety and provide a healthier working environment, and congratulates the trade union movement on its perseverance and dedication to making workplaces safer.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6182 Bill Kidd: Generals Call for Trident to be Included in Strategic Defence Review</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the expression of deep concern on the part of Field Marshal Lord Bramall, General Lord Ramsbotham, General Sir Hugh Beach and Major-General Patrick Cordingley at the fact that the future of Trident has been excluded from the Strategic Defence Review, which is to follow the UK general election; agrees that dismissing other options out of hand would be a major strategic blunder, and considers that the new impetus given to nuclear disarmament by the Obama administration, to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons, presents an opportunity for the next UK Government to give due consideration to the renewal of Trident, which the Parliament rejected by a vote of 77 to 16 in June 2007.</p>

                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6175 Bill Kidd: Countering Extremism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of Quilliam, the world&rsquo;s first counter-extremism think tank, which stands for religious freedom, human rights, democracy and developing a Muslim identity at home in, and with, the West, in pioneering new and effective ways in which to challenge, expose and sideline extremism; notes that, over the past year, Quilliam has, among other initiatives, trained over 1,000 public sector workers in countering extremism, run a project in Pakistan that has reached over 5,000 students, empowering them in the battle against extremist ideas, and initiated a series of outreach events at British universities and in Muslim communities in the United Kingdom and beyond; believes that it is only through countering extremist ideology with reasoned debate that understanding and respect can be reached, and hopes that that the lessons learned from these initiatives can be replicated in communities across Scotland.</p>
