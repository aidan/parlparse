            <p>S1M-3621.2 John Farquhar Munro&#151;As an amendment to motion S1M-3621 
              in the name of Ross Finnie (The draft Cairngorms National Park Designation, 
              Transitional and Consequential Provisions (Scotland) Order 2003), 
              insert at end &quot;but, in doing so, regrets that the Order does 
              not include the Gaelic translation of Cairngorms National Park which 
              is P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta a&#146; Ch&agrave;irn Ghuirm.&quot;</p>
