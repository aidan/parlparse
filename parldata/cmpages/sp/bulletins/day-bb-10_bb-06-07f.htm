<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6508 Mary Scanlon: Congratulations to the Glenlivet Distillery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the official opening of the expansion of the Glenlivet Distillery by the Duke of Rothesay on 4 June 2010; congratulates all involved with this &pound;10 million development, which will see a 75% increase in the production capacity of the distillery, including the local suppliers from Moray and Banffshire that provided many of the components inside the new building; notes that The Glenlivet was first licensed in 1824 and is the biggest exported single malt to the United States; further notes that, every year, 45,000 people visit the Glenlivet Distillery and considers that their experience will be further enhanced by this development, with the use of glass creating an opportunity to link the distillery with its rural surroundings;also considers that the enhanced visibility allows the distillery to reconnect with its origins, the site of George Smith&rsquo;s original distillery at Upper Drumin, and wishes the Glenlivet Distillery continued success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6507 Patrick Harvie: Gender Pay Gap</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the pay gap that continues to exist between men and women in the workplace as illustrated by a recent Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) Scotland study; notes that, on average, women still earn 12.2% less for full-time work and 32% less for part-time work; welcomes the small reduction in the pay gap since 2008, but recognises that much more has to be done, and supports the EHRC&rsquo;s call to businesses to be proactive and address this pay gap by adopting transparent pay policies and more flexible working practices.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6506 Patrick Harvie: UK Border Agency and International Volunteering</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the valuable contribution of short-term visitors coming to Scotland to volunteer in the country&rsquo;s communities and contribute positively to important intercultural exchange; is concerned that recent changes to tier 5 of the UK Border Agency (UKBA) Points Based System do not distinguish between volunteer and migrant worker and therefore may prevent volunteers from coming to Scotland due to the extra bureaucracy, expense and delay involved with this change; urges the UKBA to amend the Points Based System to remove volunteer from the work category or at least make an exemption for short-term volunteers, and recommends that the UKBA considers the merits of the approach used in the Australian points-based system, which allows tourist visitors to volunteer as part of their stay without the need for a specific temporary worker visa.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6505 Marilyn Livingstone: Accident and Emergency Services in Kirkcaldy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of accident and emergency services in the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy to the health and wellbeing of patients in Kirkcaldy and Mid-Fife; notes with concern that the hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency unit was closed from 17 to 24 May 2010 due to a shortage of junior doctors to staff the department; welcomes the resumption of the evening services since then, and looks forward to talks between NHS Fife and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to secure an adequate allocation of junior doctors for Fife, the opening of the new wing of the Victoria Hospital building in 2011 and the reconfiguration of services.</p>
