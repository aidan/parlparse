          <p><strong>*S2M-2186</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Right to Read</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 96% of books are never made available in large print, audio or Braille formats; further notes that there are 180,000 blind or partially-sighted individuals in Scotland who are being denied the ability to enjoy these books; welcomes the Right to Read campaign which is being organised by the Right to Read Alliance, a group of fourteen charities which campaigns for everyone to be able to read the same book at the same time and at the same price, for a greater number of books to be published in accessible formats and to ensure that no student is denied the right to learn because they cannot read study materials; encourages as many people as possible to sign up to the Right to Read Charter; calls on all local authorities to ensure that public libraries stock books in large print, audio and Braille formats, and further calls on all Scottish publishers to ensure that books are made accessible to those who suffer from partial sight or blindness.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-2183#</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Inadequacies of Funding for Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Cost of Care Report which was independently audited by the Scottish Local Authority Management Centre and points out the inadequacy of Scottish Executive funding for care; regrets that the funding shortfall will reduce the number of continuing care beds and the quality of care provision and will increase bed blocking; notes that nursing home fees are running at &pound;73 per person per week below the cost of provision; further notes that residential home fees are running at more than &pound;42 per person per week below the cost of provision, and agrees with COSLA and Scottish Care that the Executive must address this shortfall.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2182#</strong> <strong>George Lyon:</strong> <strong>Campbeltown Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that NHS Argyll &amp; Clyde has shut the assessment ward at Campbeltown Hospital with no public consultation and no alternative provision in place; further notes that the board is cutting primary care budgets in Argyll and Bute, despite the fact that the primary care sector in Argyll and Bute has not overspent, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should intervene and press the board to suspend the closure until proper public consultation is carried out and alternative provision supported by the community is put in place and that the board should refocus its cost recovery plan on the areas that have been consistently overspending in the past.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-2175#</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Congestion Charging Scheme Referenda</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates West Lothian Council for agreeing to hold a consultative referendum on the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s congestion charging scheme and for setting a question which conforms with the guidelines issued by the Electoral Commission and regrets that the City of Edinburgh Council, in its referendum, has proposed for answer a question which does not conform with these guidelines and intends to circulate an information leaflet with the ballot paper which will not include statements from parties opposed to the scheme.</p>

          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Donald Gorrie, Christine Grahame, Mr Stewart Maxwell</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-2080#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Closure of Craigneuk Development and Support Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep regret that the Craigneuk Development and Support Unit has been forced to announce its closure and the forced redundancy of its staff with effect from Christmas Eve, as a direct result of the actions taken by North Lanarkshire Council to withdraw funding from this organisation and the services it provides; notes that the withdrawal of the unit&rsquo;s counselling and support services will have a detrimental effect on the levels of poverty and deprivation in the communities which it serves, and believes that the way in which the council has treated this excellent organisation should be the subject of a detailed examination by Audit Scotland and the auditors of the European Commission and that appropriate steps should be taken to stop local authorities creating third party agencies which deliberately undermine and subvert the work of existing providers who are doing an excellent job, as was the case with the Craigneuk Development and Support Unit.</p>
