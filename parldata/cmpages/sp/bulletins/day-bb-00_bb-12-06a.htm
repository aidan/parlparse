                        rail scheme in Glasgow would provide enormous benefits 
                        to the city in relation to jobs, improving the environment, 
                        tackling congestion and related pollution and regenerating 
                        the city as a tourist attraction; resolves therefore to 
                        reappraise urgently the Strathclyde Passenger Transport 
                        Executive’s private legislation proposal for a light rail 
                        scheme promoted in 1994 but rejected by four Parliamentary 
                        Commissioners, appointed under the Private Legislation 
                        Procedure (Scotland) Act 1936, in 1996, and agrees that 
                        this matter deserves to be investigated by the Minister 
                        for Transport and the Environment immediately. </font></p>
