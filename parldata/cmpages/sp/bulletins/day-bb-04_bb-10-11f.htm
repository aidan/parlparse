          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1842#</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Right to Read Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates RNIB Scotland, and other Right to Read consortium members, on organising activities to mark Right to Read Week in Scotland, beginning on 15 November 2004; supports the call for many more books to be made available in alternative formats such as large-print or audio, at the same time and same price as print versions, so that the estimated 300,000 people in Scotland who are either blind or partially-sighted, or have dyslexia or other impediments to reading ordinary print can, nonetheless, enjoy the right to read; is aware that around 95% of books are currently never made available in alternative formats; is conscious that the large majority of unabridged books that are made available in formats such as audio or large-print are transcribed by charities relying on public donations and is concerned that some blind and partially-sighted school pupils in Scotland do not always receive curriculum materials in their preferred format at the same time as their sighted classmates, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should review and develop the support offered to the small network of charitable transcription services in Scotland, fund the roll-out across Scotland of the successfully-piloted &quot;DAISY&quot; cd-rom technology which allows blind and partially-sighted pupils and students to access their curriculum texts, encourage local authorities to fully fund membership fees to the RNIB Talking Books service, work to develop the best means of co-ordinating Scottish efforts to advance the Right to Read agenda in conjunction with local government, publishers, authors, bookshops and libraries and make representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to zero-rate VAT on audio books.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1841</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Justice for People Infected by Contaminated Blood Products</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the statement by Rt Hon John Reid MP referring to haemophiliacs who may be infected with variant CJD&nbsp;as&nbsp;posing a possible risk to public health; considers that this is an unacceptable further stigmatisation of people with haemophilia and their families who have, for&nbsp;20 years, been subject to fear, stigmatisation and isolation because of cases where people were infected with HIV/HCV,&nbsp;hepatitis C and now variant CJD through contaminated blood products used in transfusions, and considers that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Health Department should commission an urgent and long-overdue public inquiry into this tragic issue.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1840#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Science and the Parliament Event, 10 November 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Science and the Parliament 2004 event being held on 10 November 2004, organised by the Royal Society of Chemistry in association with Scotland&rsquo;s leading science organisations; notes the contribution of Scotland&rsquo;s 40,000 scientists to our economic, environmental and social development; notes that Scotland is a world leader in many scientific disciplines;&nbsp;further notes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s efforts to foster an environment that enhances pupil and student participation in science, to invest in the science infrastructure and equipment of our educational establishments, to increase investment in research along with supporting greater industrial research and assist in the practical application of our world-beating research, and welcomes the review of the Executive&rsquo;s review,&nbsp;<em>A Science Strategy for Scotland.</em></p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1839</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Opposition to Scottish Executive Funding of Talisman Energy Inc. Windfarm</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Scottish Executive to allocate &pound;3 million for an offshore wind farm to Talisman Energy Inc., a company that has been associated with human rights abuses in Sudan, including killing, bombing and looting, in order to open up oilfields; applauds the actions of the Presbyterian Church of Sudan and 15 other tribesmen and women, who claim they were forced from their homes in and around Talisman oil fields, in bringing a human rights case against Talisman; calls on the Executive to review its funding procedures and criteria as a matter of urgency, and further calls on the Executive to initiate the development of ethical criteria as a priority for all future planning and funding decisions.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1838</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Flying of Flags from the Scottish Parliament Building</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the flying of flags from public buildings, as is custom and practice throughout the world, helps to promote national and international identity and should be encouraged, not just on certain days but at all times, and therefore resolves to set an example by flying the Saltire, the Union flag and the European Union flag from the Scottish Parliament building.</p>
          <p>Supported by: John Farquhar Munro, George Lyon, Mike Rumbles, Jeremy Purvis, Mr Jamie Stone, Donald Gorrie, Nora Radcliffe, Margaret Smith, Mr Keith Raffan, Mike Pringle</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1837#</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Diabetes in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the rising numbers of people with diabetes in Scotland as evidenced in the recent report from Diabetes UK Scotland, <em>Diabetes in Scotland and the UK 2004</em>, which shows that there are 148,000 people in Scotland diagnosed with diabetes, a rise of 28,000 since 1996; is concerned that at least 65,000 people in Scotland are undiagnosed, as highlighted in the report, and that this number is rising year-on-year; recognises that diabetes is associated with chronic ill-health, disability and premature mortality and that long-term complications, including heart disease, strokes, blindness, kidney disease and amputations, make the greatest contribution to the costs of diabetes care, and believes that many of these long-term effects could be avoided with earlier identification and more effective treatment.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1836</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>National Celebration of Gaelic</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the city of Perth on being the venue for this year&rsquo;s Royal National Mod and hopes that this year&rsquo;s event will be as successful as last year&rsquo;s Centenary Mod in Oban; notes that this year&rsquo;s Mod, the most important cultural event for Gaeldom and a significant national icon, takes place against the welcome background of a debate about the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill which the Scottish Executive has recently introduced, and expresses the hope that the nation will now take the opportunity to recognise the immense and enduring contribution to Gaelic and Scotland&rsquo;s literary reputation throughout Europe of the work of the late Gaelic bard Sorley Maclean of Raasay through the establishment of a fitting permanent memorial, of which a scholarship to assist young Gaelic speakers could be a key part.</p>
          <p>&#9;<em>The member has provided the following Gaelic translation:</em></p>
          <p>Gu bheil P&agrave;rlamaid na h-Alba a&rsquo; cur meal-a-naidheachd air Baile Pheairt far an t&egrave;id am M&ograve;d N&agrave;iseanta R&igrave;oghail a chumail am bliadhna; gu bheil i an d&ograve;chas gun soirbhich am M&ograve;d seo mar a shoirbhich an Ceudamh M&ograve;d anns an Oban an-uiridh; gu bheil i a&rsquo; toirt fa-near gum bi M&ograve;d na bliadhna seo, a&rsquo; chuirm as cudthromaiche do shaoghal na G&agrave;idhlig agus mar &igrave;omhaigh n&agrave;iseanta cli&ugrave;iteach a&rsquo; tachairt aig an aon &agrave;m agus a tha deasbad a&rsquo; dol air adhart air Bile na G&agrave;idhlig (Alba), a chaidh fhoillseachadh leis an Riaghaltas bho chionn ghoirid; agus gu bheil i an d&ograve;chas gun gabh an n&agrave;isean an cothrom a-nis a chuimhneachadh na d&igrave;leib m&ograve;ir maireannaich a chuir obair a&rsquo; bh&agrave;ird Somhairle MacGillEain nach maireann ris a&rsquo; Gh&agrave;idhlig agus ri seasamh litreachas na h-Alba anns an roinn E&ograve;rpa, tro bhith a&rsquo; st&egrave;idheachadh cuimhneachan freagarrach agus maireannach, agus gum faodadh sgoilearachd do dh&rsquo; &ograve;igridh le G&agrave;idhlig a bhith mar ph&agrave;irt dheatamach dheth.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1832#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Supporting People Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that 19 local authorities will receive standstill or reduced funding from the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Supporting People initiative, including Dumfries and Galloway Council which will lose &pound;2.4m from its budget in the next financial year; considers that this will lead to a reduction in support services to some of the most vulnerable people in these local authority areas, and believes that the Executive should consider increasing the funding available to this initiative to maintain at least the current level of support to those local authorities that stand to lose funds from April 2005.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Fergusson, Trish Godman, Rosie Kane, Sarah Boyack, Margaret Smith, Alasdair Morgan, Shiona Baird, Christine Grahame, Brian Adam, David Mundell, Alex Neil, Mike Pringle, Donald Gorrie, Chris Ballance, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Irene Oldfather<strong>*</strong></p>

          <p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie</p>
