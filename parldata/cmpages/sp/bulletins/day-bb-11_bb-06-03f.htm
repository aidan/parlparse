<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section </a>the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any questions in relation to this section should be directed to the Chamber Desk, for which contact details are provided at the end of the Bulletin.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00203 John Pentland: Windmills Caf&eacute;, Motherwell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Windmills Caf&eacute; on being shortlisted in the Best Education Project category of the National Lottery Awards 2011; notes that the project works with young disabled adults using a working caf&eacute; environment to encourage them to develop and learn new skills, enhancing employment potential and reducing social isolation, and encourages everyone to visit http://www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk/awards, where they can find more information and vote for this and other projects in a variety of categories.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00202 Claudia Beamish: Recognising Young Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament understands that over 100,000 young people across Scotland are carers, providing emotional, physical and practical support to a family member; acknowledges that this figure is not definitive as it does not include many young carers due to the hidden nature of this group in society; expresses concern that these carers risk losing out on many of the childhood experiences enjoyed by their peers due to caring commitments; commends the work of young carers, which is borne out of care, respect and affection for another person and which it believes deserves particular recognition as part of Carers Week 2011, running from 13 to 19 June, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that young people can enjoy their childhood, protected from inappropriate or onerous caring demands.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00201 Colin Keir: State Street Expands in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that State Street, which provides financial services to institutional investors, is expanding its Scottish operations by creating a European centre of excellence for cash servicing in Edinburgh; notes that this will create 90 new jobs, increasing the company&rsquo;s workforce in Scotland from 750 to 840; further notes that both Scottish Development International and Scottish Enterprise have worked with the business to develop its growth in Edinburgh; understands that the firm&rsquo;s decision to expand its operations in the capital, as opposed to numerous other European locations, was influenced by the city&rsquo;s reputation as a key financial centre and for what it considers to be the high-calibre talent pool that exists in the financial services industry in Scotland, and recognises the substantial contribution that the financial services industry makes to Edinburgh&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00200 Colin Keir: Europe&rsquo;s Largest Economy Abandons Nuclear Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the decision by the Federal Republic of Germany to close all 17 nuclear plants in the country by 2022, aiming to replace around 20% of its total electricity consumption with emissions-free sources of energy; further notes that Germany, Europe&rsquo;s largest economy with a population of over 81 million, will become the biggest industrial power to commit to a nuclear-free future; considers that Scotland has the potential to benefit from Germany&rsquo;s increased demand for renewable energy and that the ambitious EU plans for a North Sea energy interconnector will enable Scotland to become the green energy powerhouse of Europe with the ability to export power to countries across the continent, and believes that Germany&rsquo;s landmark decision to abandon nuclear power and embrace renewables demonstrates that Scotland is on the right path with its commitment to generate 100% of its own electricity needs from renewable sources by 2020 and become a nuclear-free nation.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00198 Willie Coffey: Basketball Scotland&rsquo;s Young Persons&rsquo; Coach of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Mark Renny, recently named as Basketball Scotland&rsquo;s Young Persons&rsquo; Coach of the Year for his success in delivering Stewarton Academy&rsquo;s Basketball Development Programme; notes that Mark has been principal teacher of physical education and health promotion at the academy for three years and that under his direction the school&rsquo;s S1 and under-15 basketball teams have been undefeated in all Ayrshire competitions this season and have won the Ayrshire League and Ayrshire Cup competitions; further notes that, building on their success at Ayrshire level, Stewarton pupils are now competing for selection to represent Scotland, and recognises this as testament to Mark&rsquo;s inspiration, hard work and dedication to developing the sporting talents of Stewarton Academy pupils.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00197 Helen Eadie: Forth Crossing Construction Team Listening to Local People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the Scottish Government for making progress with the construction of the Forth Replacement Crossing; is concerned, however, that Transport Scotland has chosen to construct a gantry providing information to motorists on speeds on a section of the motorway adjacent to Park Lea in Rosyth, the one residential area on the M9 between the River Forth and Perth, and that local people are incensed about these plans; understands that there will be 61 similar gantries between Fife and West Lothian as part of best standards and good practice; is concerned, however, that each gantry will cost in excess of &pound;150,000 and, at a time of severe financial constraints, hopes that a few of these gantries can be eliminated, balancing support for the highest professional standards with the views of residents affected in local communities; considers that Transport Scotland has removed a number of mature screening trees without adequate notification or consultation with the local community and risks losing the goodwill and trust of the local residents on which the construction work of the Forth Replacement Crossing depends; calls on Transport Scotland to reconsider the need to construct a large gantry so close a residential site; hopes that the gantry can either be cancelled altogether or another location identified away from the residential area, and hopes that, as construction of the crossing continues, Transport Scotland will be careful to take a positive and open-minded approach to the concerns of affected communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00196 Bill Kidd: Who Controls Trident?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at reports that much of the Royal Navy&rsquo;s operations at Coulport, where Britain&rsquo;s nuclear deterrent is based, is to be outsourced to a consortium of multinational private firms led by US arms dealer, Lockheed Martin; considers Lockheed Martin to be a controversial firm; criticises the method for making this decision; is of the view that it was taken in secrect in order to avoid public scrutiny, and believes that any future decision concerning Coulport and Trident, should respect the wishes of the Scottish public and fully involve the Scottish Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00195 John Park: Brave Carnegie College Students</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament highly commends Carnegie College students Alyson Dingwell and Jenna Varndell for their bravery in saving a disabled older woman from a flat on fire in Dunfermline at great risk to themselves; recognises that despite the girls&rsquo; attempts to also save Linda O&rsquo;Neill, another resident in the building, she tragically died in the fire; notes that both girls and the woman they saved suffered smoke inhalation during the rescue but have since recovered well; congratulates the two brave students, who have received the first ever Carnegie Community Responsibility Award at the recent Carnegie College Awards ceremony in May 2011 for their heroic efforts, and considers that this award is well deserved and that the girls&rsquo; actions set a great example to other young people.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00194 Margo MacDonald: Cannabis and the Scottish Criminal Justice System</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the report published on 2 June 2011 by the Global Commission on Drug Policy; notes the report&rsquo;s conclusions arguing that &quot;the war on drugs has failed&quot; and calling on &quot;world governments to break the taboo on debate and reform&quot;; recalls various motions, stretching back to S1M-00097 on 26 August 1999, arguing for an investigation on cannabis use in Scotland, and would welcome the establishment of a commission of experts and laypersons to examine and report on the social and medical factors that might require changes to be made to Scots law and the working of the Scottish criminal justice system in relation to the use of cannabis in Lothian and the rest of Scotland.</p>

That includes new Scots who have escaped persecution or conflict in Africa or the Middle East...&quot;, and pays tribute to the many dedicated people and organisations across Scotland, such as the members of Hamilton&rsquo;s Justice and Peace Group, who have campaigned for fair treatment of refugees and worked to help people forced to flee their own countries make a new home in Scotland.</p>
