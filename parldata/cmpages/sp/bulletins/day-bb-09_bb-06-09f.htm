<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4330</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Sexual Offences (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limits indicated, each time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
<p>Groups 1 to 5:&nbsp;       35 minutes</p>
<p>Groups 6 to 9:&nbsp;       55 minutes</p>
<p>Groups 10 to 13:   1 hour 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4329</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Temp of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates John Harland who was recently awarded Temp of the Year by the Workforce Staff and Business Agency; recognises the important contribution that temporary workers make to the UK economy; notes that National Temporary Workers Week, which, this year, ran from 1 to 5 June 2009, acknowledges the significant contribution of temporary employees; values the contribution that the Workforce Staff and Business Agency makes to the local economy as the second-largest employer in Helensburgh and Lomond; applauds Margaret McDonach, the owner of the company, on her vision, which has seen a small business started in her spare room in 1977 grow into a thriving organisation with quality staff, and wishes John Harland and the Workforce Staff and Business Agency every success in the future.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ross Finnie<strong>*</strong>, Dr Richard Simpson<strong>*</strong>, Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong>, David Whitton<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4328</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Veterans Win the Right to Compensation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that veterans of atomic testing, who took part in the British Government nuclear deterrent tests in the 1950s, have won the right at the High Court to seek compensation from the Ministry of Defence; notes that around 1,000 servicemen claim that they were used as guinea pigs by the government to study the effects of radiation during tests in the Pacific Ocean; further notes that the veterans and their families have suffered from serious ill health including cancer, bone degeneration and blood disorders, and acknowledges that veterans such as Ken McGinley from Johnstone, Renfrewshire, have campaigned for decades to receive recognition and compensation and that the recent High Court ruling will finally allow them to receive justice.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Joe FitzPatrick<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4327</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>No Place for the BNP</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with dismay the election of two members of the BNP to the European Parliament; strongly reasserts its belief that there is no place for racism in our society, and agrees to work together, regardless of all other political differences, to ensure that parties widely considered to be racist, such as the BNP, do not succeed in gaining a foothold in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4326</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Escape to Arran</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent YouGov survey of 2,276 adults from across Britain which showed 14% choosing the islands of Scotland&rsquo;s west coast, including Arran, as their first choice holiday destination; is aware that the Lonely Planet Guide to Great Britain recognises islands such as Arran as being first-class destinations in terms of breathtaking scenery, wildlife, sports, activities for people of all ages and excellent food and accomodation, and concurs with VisitScotland&rsquo;s chief executive that, to enjoy something unique, there has never been a better time to explore islands such as Arran.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4325&diams; </strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Shark Tagging in the Solway</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the depletion of shark, ray and skate species in Scottish waters; welcomes the Scottish Shark Tagging Programme, organised by the Scottish Sea Angling Conservation Network; notes that tagging, which is a non-destructive method of gathering data, will assist understanding of species migration, growth rates and populations, and welcomes the shark tagging event in the Solway between 12 and 14 June 2009, which is expected to involve the participation of 400 rods and to generate around &pound;60,000 to the local economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4324</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Bishopbriggs Victory</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the players and coaches of the under-15 and under-18 football teams of Bishopbriggs Academy in East Dunbartonshire on &quot;doing the double&quot; by achieving the rare feat of winning both Scottish Schools Shield finals in the same season; particularly congratulates the under-18 team on winning the Senior Shield by four goals to two against St Mungo&rsquo;s High School, Falkirk, after a thrilling final at Hampden Park, and acknowledges the role of the Bank of Scotland, the main sponsor of the Scottish Schools Football Association (SSFA), whose backing has meant that over 140,000 young people have benefited from one of the three football programmes, Soccer One, Midnight League and Shield Competitions, run in partnership with the SSFA and the Scottish Football Association, in addition to the Bank of Scotland&rsquo;s support for the international squads run by the SSFA.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4323</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>C in The Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates everyone involved with C in the Park, an annual community festival that was held by the Barmulloch Community Development Company on 6 June 2009 in Robroyston Park; notes that the event was held jointly with the Glasgow City Council Land and Environmental Services Department; welcomes this year&rsquo;s focus on volunteering as a theme and recognises that many local organisations rely on such volunteering; commends everyone who helped organise and participated in a variety of games, pipe band and dancing displays, which led to everyone having an excellent day out, and looks forward to the growing success of this central community event for years to come.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4322</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>National Men&rsquo;s Health Week, Access to Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes National Men&rsquo;s Health Week, from 15 to 21 June 2009; commends the work of the Men&rsquo;s Health forum, which seeks to raise the profile of men&rsquo;s health by raising awareness of men&rsquo;s health issues among people working with men and men themselves with the aim of making a difference to the quality of life of men everywhere; notes that the current life expectancy for men in Scotland, at 74.2 years, is five years less than for women and that men&rsquo;s life expectancy varies enormously across Scotland, with 66 years in the 10% most deprived areas and 79 years in the 10% least deprived; notes that the number of men in Scotland dying from alcohol-related diseases is double that in England; further notes that, over a 10-year period from 1995, the incidence of prostate cancer rose by 14.3%, with 2,500 men in Scotland diagnosed with prostate cancer; also notes that the poor health outcomes and reduced life expectancy experienced by a large proportion of men can be improved by simple lifestyle changes, and considers that it is generally accepted that men access health services differently from women although this is not always factored into the design of NHS services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4321</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Mebyon Kernow, The Party for Cornwall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Mebyon Kernow (MK), the Party for Cornwall, on winning three seats in the 4 June 2009 local authority elections, three more than the Labour party; considers Cornwall to be a unique and historic nation with its own culture, traditions and Celtic language, Kernowek, now undergoing a revival; considers that MK is a progressive party campaigning for greater Cornish self-government and a just, fair, sustainable, prosperous, more confident, inclusive and outward-looking Cornwall; supports MK&rsquo;s call for the establishment of a Cornish assembly, and wishes it every success in fighting for a better deal for all the people of Cornwall.</p>
