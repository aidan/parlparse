<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2032</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Supported  and Semi-independent Accommodation for Young Care Leavers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is greatly concerned at the challenges facing young care leavers, particularly the high number of care leavers who are not in touch with aftercare services and who become homeless; notes the concerns about the shortage of semi-independent living units for young care leavers identified by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland in her report, <em>Sweet 16? The Age of Leaving Care in Scotland</em>; is concerned that the Scottish Government has not made any assessment of the extent of the shortfall of supported and semi-independent living units for young care leavers, and urges the Scottish Government to carry out a full survey of need in this area and put in place arrangements to increase the supply of appropriate supported accommodation for young care leavers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2031</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>21st Anniversary of the Riding for the Disabled Association Glasgow Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Riding for the Disabled Association Glasgow Group on the 21st anniversary of its establishment at Sandyflats, Summerston; notes the important contribution that Riding for the Disabled Association has made, providing almost 4,000 hours of riding and driving lessons for disabled people, and recognises the contribution of the six staff members and 160 volunteers who make this provision possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2030</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Common Ridings and Borders Processions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the historic and cultural importance of the common ridings across the Scottish Borders, such as those in Selkirk, Hawick, Lauder, the Braw Lads&rsquo; Gathering in Galashiels and Penicuik&rsquo;s Hunter &amp; Lass Week; considers that, since the enactment of the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006, these local celebrations have had to meet quite onerous requirements that are not suitable for well-established and uncontroversial public processions, and would invite the Scottish Government to review the operation of the Act as it applies to such ridings and processions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2029</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Launch of the Alba Endeavour</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent launch of Ocean Youth Trust Scotland&rsquo;s new boat, Alba Endeavour, by the Minister for Children and Early Years in Greenock; acknowledges this exciting launch of a 72-foot yacht which is to be used to inspire young people; notes that the Ocean Youth Trust hopes to welcome 1,300 youngsters on board its fleet, alongside Alba Ventura and Alba Explorer, and further notes that these voyages are aimed at inspiring young people through the challenge of adventure under sail by introducing them to sailing, seamanship, cooking and cleaning.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2000</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Inquiry into the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent announcement by the Scottish Government to restrict the scope of what can be discussed at the forthcoming public local inquiry into the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR), allowing only discussion on technical aspects of the road and disallowing any wider discussion on the AWPR project in principle or context; notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision to restrict the scope of the public local inquiry into the AWPR means that a large number of the more than 10,000 objectors to the project will be disallowed from giving evidence to the public local inquiry, as their objections and arguments now lie outwith its scope; is concerned that the public local inquiry into the AWPR will not, therefore, consider the project&rsquo;s spiralling and uncapped cost, its impact on local communities and the local environment, its context within wider transport policy, its impact on traffic levels and pollution, its proposed funding method through both and national and local government, and its relevance in the context of climate change and the spiralling cost of private motoring; considers the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision to restrict the scope of the public local inquiry into the AWPR to be a serious blow to public participation and local democracy, which undermines the aim of the Scottish Parliament to engage and involve the people of Scotland in planning and development issues, and calls on the Scottish Government to broaden the scope of the public local inquiry into the AWPR to include discussion and examination of all of the evidence available and relevant to it, including consideration of the principles underlying the proposal.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1984</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Scottish Cup</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Queen of the South and Rangers football clubs for an exciting Scottish Cup Final on 24 May 2008 and congratulates Rangers on its victory and Queens on its spirited performance, especially in the second half.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1983</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Oil Wealth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the recent study, performed by Grant Thornton, validating the immense oil wealth potentially available to Scotland; notes conservative estimates giving an independent Scotland a &pound;4.4 billion annual surplus, even if Scotland had access to only 82.5% of North Sea oil revenue; is aware that, with oil prices now at $135 a barrel and heading towards $200, this is an huge underestimate of the wealth that could accrue to Scotland; acknowledges that Oil &amp; Gas UK has stated that reserves could last for at least 30 years, during which time a fund for future generations could be initiated and established; regrets that Scotland&rsquo;s unionist parties, in thrall to their bosses in London and with no faith in the Scottish people, still try to argue that Scotland is a parasitic burden on the United Kingdom, with Labour being particularly guilty, claiming in the spring of 2007 that an independent Scotland would be in deficit to the tune of &pound;12.9 billion a year; looks forward to a time when Scotland and its people will, through independence, be allowed to realise its full economic potential, and calls on the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer to transfer Scottish oil and gas wealth into the hands of the Scottish people.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1983.1</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Oil Wealth</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1983) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, leave out from &quot;the recent study&quot; to end and insert &quot;the current high International price of oil at around $135 per barrel but also notes that in the last decade alone the price has fluctuated significantly from the current high to as low as as $9; believes that, notwithstanding the current high price of crude oil, basing an economy and the funding of public services on such an erratic commodity whose supply is determined principally by a Middle Eastern cartel would be economically illiterate; regrets the typically obtuse characterisation by Scottish nationalists of fellow Scots who do not favour splitting the United Kingdom into separate states but who rather believe the interests of Scottish people are best served by retaining their influence in one of the world&rsquo;s largest economies as &quot;in thrall to their bosses in London&quot;, and considers that the Barnett Formula guarantees Scotland a higher proportion of revenue per head of population than south of the border and that far from having &quot;no faith in the Scottish people&quot; the pro-Union parties have every confidence that they will make the correct decision with regards to Scotland&rsquo;s constitutional future in clear and stark contrast to the SNP.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1960#</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Holocaust Education in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament accepts the crucial importance of ensuring that the genocide of the Jewish and other peoples and minority groups inflicted during the Holocaust is never allowed to slip from public consciousness; welcomes the commitment of successive Scottish governments to developing a permanent National Holocaust Museum based in East Renfrewshire and looks forward to the fulfilment of that commitment; applauds the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust, among other organisations, for the role it plays in educating young people from every background about the Holocaust and the important lessons that can still be learned from it today, and considers that sufficient resources should be made available to allow schools across the west of Scotland and beyond to provide ongoing Holocaust education, with visits to the Auschwitz concentration camp being considered as part of that educational mix.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1960.1</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Holocaust Education in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1960) in the name of Jackson Carlaw, insert at end &quot;, and while admiring the chutzpah of calling for a Member&rsquo;s Business debate on this subject which does not commit ministers to take action, wonders why some MSPs did not feel able to support substantive amendment S3M-1768.2 on Holocaust Education on 24 April 2008, which might have resulted in funding being made available and stated that the Parliament &quot;believes that Holocaust education, including visits to the Auschwitz concentration camp, is an important part of lessons on citizenship and international education; agrees that the Scottish Government should ensure that the Barnett consequentials of the &pound;4.65 million in funding announced by the UK Government for visits to Auschwitz are used specifically to support Scottish pupils for this same purpose&quot;.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1923#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>60th Anniversary of the National Health Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 60th anniversary of the National Health Service, launched on 5 July 1948 by Labour Minister for Health, Aneurin Bevan; recognises the continuing relevance of its founding principles of a socialised health service, funded through general taxation, free to all at the point of need; salutes the huge contribution of all NHS staff down the years in providing vital, lifesaving care and treatment which has improved the quality of life for millions of people, leading to dramatic improvements in life expectancy; supports the central role of the state in providing healthcare free at the point of need; encourages communities throughout Scotland to become involved in events to mark this anniversary, including those organised by NHS Greater Glasgow, the <em>Evening Times </em>and Radio Clyde, which will tell the story of the first 60 years of the NHS and serve as a powerful reminder of the unacceptable state of healthcare available to the vast majority of the population prior to 1948, and considers that all citizens, trade unions and politicians should remain true to the founding  principles of the NHS.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1893.1</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Scottish Agricultural Wages Board</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1893) in the name of Elaine Murray, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the valuable work performed by the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board (SAWB) in protecting minimum pay and conditions arrangements for agricultural workers; welcomes the Government&rsquo;s review of the SAWB as an opportunity to give careful consideration to future arrangements for determining the pay and conditions of service of agricultural workers in Scotland; agrees that work is needed to review the functions and processes of the SAWB in the context of national minimum wage structures and other employment legislation; believes that protection for all agricultural workers&rsquo; pay and conditions must be maintained, and recognises the importance of consulting widely with stakeholders on achieving the most effective processes.&quot;</p>
