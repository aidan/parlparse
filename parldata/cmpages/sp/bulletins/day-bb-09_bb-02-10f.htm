<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3414</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Review of Legal Aid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that offenders convicted of serious crimes are able to receive significant sums in legal aid to undertake vexatious appeals against sentence and against the consequences of their crimes, for example in terms of lost pension entitlements; considers that the criteria for eligibility of legal aid should be reviewed to prevent the use of public funds for gratuitous serial appeals by persons convicted of serious crimes such as rape, and further considers that such actions compound the injury and distress cause to victims of these crimes and may deter rape victims from reporting offences.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3413</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>No Place for Trident in Civilised Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern, following the accidental publication of a top secret Ministry of Defence document, originally prepared in 1978, in the National Archives in London last year, the revelation that Trident was deployed to allow ground-bursts that could subject 55 to 60% of Moscow to a &quot;radiation dose sufficient to cause rapid debilitation followed by death for most people in the area&quot; and to cause &quot;sufficient damage to bring about the breakdown of the city as a functioning community&quot;; believes that the Dr Strangelove-esque logic that guided the strategic decisions of Margaret Thatcher during this period was profoundly misguided, and further believes that, in the absence of the desire to annihilate the civilian population of Moscow, the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown MP, and the Secretary of State for Defence, John Hutton MP, should put an end to this defunct reasoning and scrap Trident.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3412</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Keep Respite Care at Fyneview</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposal under consideration by Argyll and Bute Council to cut funding to the Fyneview Respite House in Lochgilphead; considers that there has been a lack of consultation with all service users and carers in Argyll and Bute regarding the future of Fyneview; understands that there are no other respite facilities for 18 to 64-year-olds in the area, making Fyneview an invaluable resource for the community; believes that Argyll and Bute Council should not terminate respite care at Fyneview, particularly as the Scottish Government has made an extra &pound;9 million available to enable local authorities to provide additional services for carers and an extra 10,000 respite weeks on top of existing service, and therefore calls on the council to reject the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3411#</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Songbird Survival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is aware of the concerns of many bird lovers throughout the United Kingdom about the decline of the songbird population; notes research that suggests that over the last 40 years many species of songbird have seen a reduction in numbers of 50% or more with some species declining by over 90%; recognises that a number of factors have led to these declines and that these should be considered by policymakers, and commends individual birdwatchers and bird groups&nbsp;in the Highlands&nbsp;and Islands&nbsp;and elsewhere in Scotland&nbsp;for&nbsp;their role in recording species&rsquo; numbers and&nbsp;the work of organisations such as Songbird Survival that campaign to raise awareness of the threat to our songbird species and ensure the creation of a balanced biodiversity.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3410</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Wanderlust for West Highland Line</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament hails the vote by almost 3,000 readers of <em>Wanderlust</em>, an independent travel magazine, naming the West Highland line as the top rail journey in the world; notes that the West Highland line came ahead of the Trans-Siberian Express and the Cuzco to Machu Picchu line in Peru and beat 400 other nominated rail journeys from around the world, and congratulates ScotRail and all those involved in earning this prestigious recognition for Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3409</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Closure of Girvan Swimming Pool</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the significance of Girvan Swimming Pool as a key community facility; notes that public swimming pools provide crucial life-saving training and contribute a great deal to public health; expresses dismay at the decision by South Ayrshire Council to close the Girvan Swimming Pool, a decision that was made without public consultation, and calls on South Ayrshire Council to invest in swimming facilities in Girvan, explore all available options with regard to funding a new facility and renew its commitment to support leisure facilities in Girvan.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3408#</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Pressurised Area Status in North Lanarkshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Scottish Government to grant pressurised area status to the North Lanarkshire Council areas of Cumbernauld and Moodiesburn, which enables the council to suspend the right to buy to tenants who started their tenancy after 30 September 2002, and considers that the action by the government and council should stop the decline of housing stock lost through right to buy and ensure that the council can maintain control over existing housing stock.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3371*#*</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Bicentenary of Louis Braille</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 200th anniversary of the birth of Louis Braille, inventor of the unique communication system for blind people that has been instrumental in unlocking knowledge and potential, creating opportunities and supporting independent action from the time of its invention to the present day; notes the importance of providing braille and other forms of accessible information to people with visual impairments across all sectors and in all areas of activity to create a fair and inclusive society; also notes the potential of modern technology to give full effect to Louise Braille&rsquo;s vision of effective communication for blind and visually impaired people, and considers that the Scottish Government has an important role as an exemplar of best practice in relation to the accessibility to visually impaired people of public services and information provision across Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3351</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive Opt-out</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the vote by the European Parliament on 17 December 2008 in favour of removing Britain&rsquo;s working time directive opt-out; also notes with serious concern the effect that the removal of the opt-out will have on retained firefighters across Scotland and the consequences that it may have for public health and safety; further notes that of 391 fire stations across Scotland 321 are staffed by 3,429 retained firefighters; notes the valuable service that these volunteer firefighters provide to their communities and that the Retained Firefighters Union opposes the removal of the opt-out; considers that, if the opt-out is removed and Retained Duty System (RDS) fire stations are proven unviable under the working time directive, 91% of the United Kingdom will lose valuable emergency fire cover, and notes the serious and potentially fatal consequences that the removal will have on communities across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3351.2</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive Opt-out</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3351) in the name of Liam McArthur, leave out from &quot;with regret&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the vote by the European Parliament on 17 December 2008 in favour of removing Britain&rsquo;s working time directive opt-out was supported by Scotland&rsquo;s Liberal Democrat MEP; also notes that the decision of the European Parliament represents a difference of view from that of the Council of Ministers and will now be sent for negotiation and conciliation before there is any question of its final approval or implementation; further notes that a failure to agree between the European Parliament and Council of Ministers will result in the proposal falling; notes the role played by Scotland&rsquo;s retained firefighters and the vital service that these firefighters provide to their communities; considers that in any future potential change to the working time directive an appropriate provision to allow a continuation of fire services in the Highlands and Islands in particular will be required, and expresses confidence in those involved to ensure such an outcome.&quot;</p>
