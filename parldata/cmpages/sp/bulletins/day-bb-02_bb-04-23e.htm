            have been imposed on Superfast Ferries in respect of hiring (a) UK

          <p><strong>S1W-25265</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it will investigate the prescribing 
            of steroid creams on the NHS and, in particular, whether repeat prescriptions

            Prison Service Estates Review, whether in estimating costs for a publicly

            detailing the reasons for its position on the matter.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-25268</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> To

            the reasons for its position on the matter.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-25270</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive, in relation to paragraph 95 of the Scottish

            built prison.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-25271</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether the costs of removing appliances which

            in the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth constituency should be borne by the

          <p><strong>S1W-25272</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether there have been any instances in the

            were old, broken or no longer required, detailing the reasons behind

          <p><strong>S1W-25273</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what instructions it provided to contractors 
            fitting systems under its central heating programme in the Cumbernauld 
            and Kilsyth constituency regarding the removal and disposal of appliances 
            which are old, broken or no longer required, and when and how any 
            such instructions were issued.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-25274</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what definition of central heating system it 
            uses under its central heating programme and what minimum type of

            covered by the programme.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-25275</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-24336

            Homes in each of the last five years and at what cost.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-25276</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-24494

            by the second part of the question was not given and whether Lanarkshire

            accept a referral and closing waiting lists no longer exist.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-25277</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether its strategy for housing includes a

          <p><strong>S1W-25278</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether Communities Scotland operates a percentage 
            target for home ownership when approving housing projects for grant
