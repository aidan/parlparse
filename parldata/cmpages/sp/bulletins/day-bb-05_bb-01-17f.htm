          <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

          <p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2263#</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>The Closure of Rural Primary Schools in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the concerns of local communities and parents about the continuing closure of rural primary schools across Scotland; regrets the closure of rural primary schools, especially in cases where they are well attended and enjoy widespread parental and community support; recognises the vital role that rural primary schools play in sustaining community life, often in some of our most marginal, fragile and remote communities, and the part they play in providing a diverse educational infrastructure, thus helping to allow parents to exercise choice in placing their children in schools; acknowledges that rural primary schools often provide a first-class standard of education to pupils, and calls on the Scottish Executive to respond to the continuing concerns of rural parents and communities about rural primary school closures by taking action to tighten the rules on rural school closures, providing new guidelines on this subject and introducing a national presumption against the closure of rural schools.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2262#</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Ban on Sale of Arms to China</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns any move to lift the 15-year embargo on the sale of arms to China; urges the European Union to resist any move by the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, and French President, Jacques Chirac, to have the embargo lifted; hopes that other European states will oppose efforts by France, Germany or Britain to restore arms sales; believes that China&rsquo;s human rights record is comparable to Burma and Zimbabwe&rsquo;s record, and further believes that this move, if successful, could lead to greater instability in the region.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2247#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Scotland Leads the Way in Revolutionary New Skin Cancer Treatment, Highlighting Partnership Between Dunfermline, St Andrews and Dundee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the fact that Scotland is leading the way in developing a revolutionary new skin cancer treatment; notes the significance of this development as skin cancer has become so prevalent throughout the world that full statistics are generally no longer collected for its most common form, non-malignant melanoma; acknowledges conservative estimates that around 10% of Scotland&rsquo;s population, or half a million people, will suffer from the disease at some point in their lifetime and that the percentages of the population at risk in countries with sunnier climates, such as the United States of America and Australia, are very much higher; regrets that non-melanoma skin cancer is often excluded from comparative analyses of cancer data due to a perception by medical professionals that cancers of this kind are rarely life-threatening; welcomes, however, the news that most non-melanoma skin cancers are detected early and can be treated on an out-patient basis; understands that the relationship between sunlight and skin cancer is well known, but also welcomes the news that cause can become treatment; congratulates, therefore, Professor Samuel of the Organic Semiconductor Centre at the University of St Andrews and Dermatology Consultant and Professor James Ferguson, Head of the Photobiology Unit at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, who have come up with a novel way of treating melanomas using a treatment called &quot;photodynamic therapy&quot; with the use of &quot;light bandages&quot;, a concept which has never been tried anywhere else in the world and which works by using a dressing containing its own light source; notes that patients undergoing photodynamic therapy are able to move around freely, ensuring that it is less painful than existing treatment methods because a less intense light is required and that using the bandage is also often more effective as it can be used over a longer period of time; further notes that Professor Samuel and Professor Ferguson are ready to take the next step towards making it available to the world, and commends Mr Alf Stewart, a Dunfermline businessman, for his generous financial support of the photodynamic treatment for cancer through the Barbara Stewart Cancer Trust in memory of his late wife, Barbara, a victim of skin cancer.</p>
