          <p> <strong>*S2M-450</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Interim 
            Report from Lord Fraser on Holyrood Inquiry</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament calls on Lord Fraser to produce an interim report in respect 
            of his inquiry into the Holyrood project, containing his findings 
            and conclusions in respect of the early decisions made before the 
            Parliament was reconvened, including those taken by the Labour Government, 
            on the choice of site, architect and construction manager and the 
            type of contract used, and urges him to publish such an interim report

          <p> <strong>*S2M-449</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Liberal Democrats' Comments on Council Tax</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the comments of Edward Davey, Liberal Democrat 
            local government spokesman, who stated on 29 September 2003, &quot;John 
            Prescott has demonstrated that once again this government is not listening 
            to the people hit hardest by their policies. John Prescott had the 
            opportunity to announce an end to the hated council tax, which hits 
            the poorest hardest, especially vulnerable pensioners. Instead he 
            has ducked the real issue and sought to shift the blame. The structure 
            of council tax is patently unfair. The only way to deal with it is 
            to scrap it, not cap it&quot;; further notes the comments of Liberal 
            Democrat Councillor Chris Clarke, Leader of Somerset County Council 
            and Deputy Chairman of the Local Government Association, who stated 
            on 29 September 2003, &quot;The government must accept the fact that 
            the council tax is unfair. The people with the lowest incomes pay 
            more than those with the highest&quot;; believes these comments to 
            be an accurate description of the unfair council tax, and further 
            believes that it should be replaced with a tax based on personal income 
            at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-448</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Comments 
            of John Swinburne MSP</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns, 
            and dissociates itself from, the comments of John Swinburne MSP in 
            the debate on mainstreaming equality in the Parliament on Wednesday 
            1 October 2003 and calls on all MSPs to uphold the founding principles 
            of the Parliament.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-447#</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Nuclear 
            Submarine Decommisioning</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns 
            any plans to cut up and dispose of nuclear waste from the reactor 
            compartments of decommissioned nuclear submarines stored in Scotland; 
            considers that land-based storage at Rosyth of sealed reactor compartments 
            cut out from those decommissioned submarines currently stored afloat 
            is the best environmental option, and further considers that no additional 
            nuclear submarines should be brought to Scotland for disposal or storage 
            and that no new nuclear submarines should be added to the naval fleet.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-446</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Deaths 
            of Young Servicemen and Women at Deepcut Barracks</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that more than 1748 members of Her Majesty's 
            armed forces have lost their lives through non-natural and non-combat 
            causes since 1990, that almost 200 deaths have been caused by discharge 
            of firearms and that some 200 of the deaths are described as self-inflicted; 
            further notes the courage and determination of the friends and families 
            of Sean Benton, James Collinson, Geoff Gray and Cheryl James who died 
            at Deepcut Barracks in Surrey and the friends and families of Paul 
            Cochrane, Ross Collins, Richard Donkin, Tony Green, Dale Little, Aled 
            Martin Jones, Alfie Manship, Gary Riches, Richard Robertson, Alan 
            Sharples, David Shipley and Christopher Young who have subsequently 
            come forward to make public their own grievances and frustrations 
            at the hands of the military authorities; believes that the Ministry 
            of Defence response to these deaths is inadequate and distressing 
            to the bereaved; further believes that the army has a duty of care 
            and protection towards all personnel, particularly young soldiers, 
            that the culture of secrecy surrounding the varied causes of these 
            deaths must give way to greater transparency and that the environment 
            in which these deaths continue to occur and the absence of a system 
            for prompt, effective and independent investigation of deaths has 
            led to a breakdown in public confidence that can only be restored 
            through a full and independent public inquiry, and therefore resolves 
            to urge Her Majesty's Government to establish a tribunal of inquiry 
            without delay.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-445</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Use 
            of Language by the Executive on Anti-social Behaviour</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament is appalled at the use of stigmatising and ill-informed 
            language in recent debates; is further appalled at the Scottish Executive's 
            use of the word &quot;plague&quot; in a press release in reference 
            to the anti-social behaviour debate; recognises that those referred 
            to as persistent young offenders are overwhelmingly the most vulnerable, 
            disadvantaged and sometimes abused section of the population, and 
            calls on the Executive to define who the &quot;plague&quot; is, explain 
            its use of the word, withdraw the comments and apologise unreservedly.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-444</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Food 
            Advertising on TV</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that research 
            by the University of Strathclyde on behalf of the Food Standards Agency 
            found that TV adverts are responsible for children eating too much 
            sugar, fat and salt and that research by the Food Commission found 
            that food advertising accounts for half of all advertising during 
            children&#146;s viewing time and, in light of this research, calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to introduce a ban on the advertising of 
            junk food to children in line with calls from the Scottish Consumer 
            Council, the British Heart Foundation, the Royal College of General 
            Practitioners, the Food Commission and 80 other organisations.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne, Tommy Sheridan, Rosie Kane, Colin

          <p> <strong>S2M-443#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Executive Relocation Policy</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned 
            that the formula used to shortlist locations suitable for the relocation 
            of the Scottish Executive departments, agencies and non-departmental 
            bodies is not resulting in jobs being dispersed adequately across 
            Scotland and calls on the Executive to re-examine the criteria used 
            to select such locations.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-442#</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>European 
            Week for Safety and Health</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            that the European Week for Safety and Health will take place between 
            13 and 19 October 2003; welcomes the week&#146;s acknowledgement of 
            the need to promote safety and health in the workplace; congratulates 
            trade unions for the role that they have played in improving health 
            and safety in the workplace, and commends the commitment of the European 
            Agency for Safety and Health and the Health and Safety Executive to 
            promote safe and healthy working.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-441</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Planning 
            Appeals</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to change the appeals procedure for planning applications to make 
            the reporter the convener of an independent committee rather than 
            the sole arbiter of appeals.</p>

            congratulates the Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, Keith Patrick 
            O&#146;Brien, on his well-deserved appointment as cardinal and wishes 
            him every good fortune and success.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-439</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Church 
            of Scotland Care Homes</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes 
            the announcement by the Church of Scotland Board of Social Responsibility 
            that it has secured the future of the vast majority of its residential 
            homes for older people; agrees with <em>The Herald</em> that these 
            homes are &quot;recognised by almost everyone as the best in the sector&quot; 
            for the quality of care they provide; welcomes the positive partnership 
            approach that has been taken between the Church and local authorities, 
            and applauds the board&#146;s intention to invest in its homes to 
            ensure that they have a sustainable future and meet the quality standards 
            laid down by the Care Commission.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-437#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Rising 
            Crime in Forth Valley</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            the number of recorded crimes and offences in Forth Valley increased 
            again in 2002-03, despite the local constabulary&#146;s enviable record 
            of detecting and clearing up crime; recognises that a secure society 
            can only be built on a foundation of public order and that this requires 
            public policy to focus on cutting crime, reducing the risk of re-offending 
            and keeping young people off the conveyor belt to crime, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should begin by supporting the local police 
            force with additional resources for a more visible presence on the 
            streets, ensuring honesty in sentencing of convicted criminals by 
            removing automatic remission and providing more flexible funding arrangements 
            to local authorities when asking them to tackle the problems of crime 
            and anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-427</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Mr 
            John Swinney MSP's Reported Use of Offensive Language</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the reported use by SNP leader Mr 
            John Swinney MSP of the expression &quot;tell the Brits to get off&quot; 
            at his party&#146;s conference in Inverness on Friday 26 September 
            2003; believes that such language is offensive to many in Scotland 
            and throughout the UK and is inappropriate for an MSP and party leader 
            in the Parliament, and calls on John Swinney to withdraw these remarks 
            and apologise to the Scottish people for them.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-426#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Hepatitis 
            C from Contaminated Blood Products</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            recognises the valuable work of the former Health and Community Care 
            Committee in its report on hepatitis C (17th Report 2001) and its 
            seven recommendations; notes that the scheme proposed by the Minister 
            for Health and Community Care with a package worth in the region of 
            £15 million falls far short of the recommendations of the independent 
            inquiry team chaired by Lord Ross where payments would have totalled 
            some £89 million; further notes that the inquiry team's figure is 
            still well below settlements elsewhere in the world; considers that 
            the Scottish Executive's offer will be perceived as being hurtful, 
            mean, unjust and insulting; notes that there are substantial unresolved 
            issues regarding the probable prescribing of known infected blood 
            products until as late as the mid 1990s; further notes that there 
            are issues surrounding the effectiveness of the subsequent prescribing 
            of &quot;synthetic&quot; Factor 8 products, and considers that the 
            Executive should review its offer to comply with the recommendations 
            of Lord Ross's inquiry and instigate a public inquiry now.</p>

            Farms</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the proliferation 
            of planning applications for onshore wind farms throughout Scotland; 
            is further concerned, whilst supporting renewable energy, about the 
            environmental and landscape impact of wind farms and understands that 
            these frequently face vigorous local opposition; believes that the 
            current planning regime provides inadequate guidance to local authorities, 
            communities and developers in relation to the siting of wind farms; 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should bring forward as a matter 
            of urgency new planning guidance on the siting of wind farms taking 
            proper account of these factors, and further considers that the Executive 
            should declare a moratorium on the determination of locally-opposed

            Peace Service</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that 5 
            November is a powerful reminder that religious and other divisions 
            can escalate destructively into conflict; welcomes the initiative 
            of churches, faith groups, non-government organisations, the Scottish 
            Centre for Nonviolence, the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly, the United 
            Nations Association and others to promote in Scotland the concept 
            of a civilian peace service, and endorses the need for a standing, 
            trained service with a key role in conflict resolution and post-conflict 
            peace-building.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-422#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>The 
            Airborne Initiative</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns the 
            trial by media of the alternative to custody project, the Airborne 
            Initiative, and any attempts to cut the project&#146;s funding; notes 
            that this project works with some of Scotland&#146;s toughest offenders 
            and offers a course that addresses offending behaviour and is regarded 
            as a model of rehabilitation across the western hemisphere; considers 
            it to be completely unacceptable for the future of such projects to 
            be put in jeopardy by the incomplete and subjective evidence of a 
            scene in a television documentary, and commends the Airborne Initiative 
            for taking part in a programme that shows the extent of the problems 
            those attempting to address offending behaviour have to face on a 
            daily basis.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-291#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Auxiliary 
            Fire Units in the Highlands</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            that auxiliary fire units play a vital role in many rural communities 
            in fighting fires and do so in conjunction with the retained fire 
            brigades; notes with concern that, following a report from Her Majesty's 
            Inspectorate of Fire Services (HMI), 32 auxiliary units face possible 
            closure; further notes that the new approach of integrated risk assessment 
            should permit the preservation of as many as possible of these auxiliary 
            units; considers that the Scottish Executive should explicitly endorse 
            the need for such units and acknowledge the essential role that they 
            play in protecting human life and property; believes that, if the 
            recommendations of the HMI report are not carefully considered and 
            auxiliary units are forced to close because of the proposed introduction 
            of compulsory access to breathing apparatus within a short timescale, 
            then human life and property may be placed at risk; believes that 
            all involved, including Highland Council, the Firemaster, HMI and 
            the Health and Safety Executive, should continue to discuss the implications 
            of the HMI report in the context of integrated risk assessment and 
            find an outcome that prevents the closure of so many of the auxiliary 
            units.</p>
