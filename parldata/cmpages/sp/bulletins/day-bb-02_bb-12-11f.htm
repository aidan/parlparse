            appointment as the Scottish Information Commissioner.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3700</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Fisheries 2003</strong>-That 
            the Parliament supports the Scottish Executive in its efforts to negotiate 
            an outcome from the Fisheries Council meeting in December 2002 that 
            reflects both the best achievable deal for the Scottish fishing industry 
            and the fishing communities that depend on it and the need to preserve 
            stocks for the long term. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3699</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Scrap Scottish 
            Enterprise and Increase Minimum Wage in the Public Sector</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the research conducted by the Scottish Parliament 
            Research Service, revealing that the cost of imposing a £7.32 per 
            hour minimum wage and a 35-hour maximum working week across the public 
            sector in Scotland would be £450 million per annum and would create 
            an additional 24,000 public sector jobs; further notes that the Scottish 
            Enterprise (SE) budgets for 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 are £446 
            million, £453 million and £454 million respectively; believes that 
            SE should be scrapped and its budget used instead to eradicate low 
            pay in Scotland's hospitals and town halls, modernise working conditions 
            and create 24,000 new jobs on a minimum hourly rate of £7.32, as recommended 
            by the Low Pay Unit, and further believes that such a public investment 
            package would end low pay in the public sector, raise hundreds of 
            thousands out of poverty and set good employment practices which the 
            private sector would be compelled to match and that, instead of talking 
            about tackling poverty, the Scottish Executive should act. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3698</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Children's And 
            Young People's Services in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament commends 
            the recent reports into children's services of the Child Protection 
            Audit and Review, <em>It's everyone's job to make sure I'm alright</em>, 
            Audit Scotland, <em>Dealing with offending by young people</em> and 
            the Scottish Committee of the Council on Tribunals, <em>Special Report 
            on the Children's Hearings System</em>; notes in particular the references 
            to the need to address urgently the crisis in the recruitment and 
            retention of social workers; urges the Scottish Executive to give 
            serious consideration to this matter and to the other recommendations 
            in the reports and to act upon them; agrees that, when implemented, 
            the recommendations would offer substantial improvements to the services 
            for our most vulnerable children and young people; recommends bringing 
            forward legislation to provide a statutory basis for child protection 
            committees thereby ensuring increased status and resources and uniformly 
            high quality services across the country, and recognises the need 
            for the Scottish Executive to tackle once and for all the underlying 
            social problems which disfigure our nation by limiting the chances 
            of Scottish children, too many of whom continue to live in poverty.</p>

            Chilingirian String Quartet and its performance in tribute to one 
            of the major benefactors of Scottish music in the twentieth century, 
            Sir John Blackwood McEwen (1868-1948); notes that John McEwen was 
            a renowned supporter of composers and young musicians, ultimately 
            setting up the McEwen Bequest at the University of Glasgow, and that 
            his fund encourages the performance of music by Scottish composers 
            and has included works commissioned <em>inter alia</em> from Thea 
            Musgrave, Martin Dalby, Robert Crawford and William Sweeney, and sends 
            its congratulations to the quartet on its special concert at the University 
            of Glasgow Concert Hall on 10 December 2002 to celebrate Sir John 
            McEwen's own music with a programme evidencing the quartet's reputation 
            for pioneering British music through its unearthing of the music of 
            Sir John McEwen in collaboration with the Scottish Music Information

            commends the work of all the firefighters from brigades across the 
            south-east of Scotland that were involved in tackling the blaze and 
            the commitment of council staff and the police who worked to protect 
            lives and provide emergency accommodation for residents; notes the 
            need for a swift outcome to the full investigation into the causes 
            of the fire; acknowledges that the incident has left a &quot;gaping 
            wound in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town&quot;; encourages swift 
            establishment of ownership of the thirteen buildings in the devastated 
            area and safe demolition where required on safety grounds, and calls 
            for consultation with the local community about the future of the

            report into the implications of the General Agreement on Trade in 
            Services which reveals that ultimate control of key public services, 
            including health and education, has already been signed over to World 
            Trade Organisation lawyers and that broadcasting and postal services 
            are next in line to be locked into irreversible free trade agreements 
            which could see virtually the entire infrastructure of Britain owned 
            and controlled by profit-hungry multi-national companies; also notes 
            the comments of Luton North Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins who slammed the 
            World Trade Organisation's plans as &quot;an attack on democracy itself&quot; 
            and further stated, &quot;How we choose to deliver basic services 
            to citizens and how we decide to regulate the activities of companies 
            are at the core of the duties of a modern democracy. GATS attack the 
            ability of governments to make these decisions and are therefore an 
            attack on democracy itself. Negotiations on this agreement should 
            halt immediately&quot;; agrees wholeheartedly with these sentiments, 
            and *considers that* the Scottish Executive *should* make immediate 
            representation to Her Majesty's Government declaring the Scottish 
            Parliament's support for an immediate cessation of negotiations on 
            the General Agreement on Trade in Services in order to protect democracy 
            and the public services.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3623# Mr Duncan Hamilton: Glasgow to Barra Air Link 
            Public Service Obligation-</strong>That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the decision to *announce a one-year contract for the Glasgow 
            to Barra air link; recognises that such contracts are normally awarded 
            for the three years of a public service obligation (PSO) order*; further 
            recognises the concern felt in Barra that this constitutes a major 
            threat to the long-term future of the air service which, in turn, 
            could engender more social and economic decline in an area already 
            affected by depopulation, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should *guarantee a PSO and contract for three years.*</p>
