<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong><br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;<br />
        <br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong><br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong><br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6411Stewart Maxwell:World No Tobacco Day, 31 May 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates World No Tobacco Day 2010, a World Health Organisation (WHO) campaign to encourage a full day of abstinence from tobacco consumption across the globe, which is scheduled to take place on 31 May; welcomes this year&rsquo;s theme, Gender and tobacco with an emphasis on marketing to women; considers this appropriate as a 2007 WHO report stated that &quot;generic tobacco control measures may not be equally or similarly effective in respect to the two sexes&quot;; believes that the tobacco industry should be condemned for its alleged targeting of young women to take up smoking, and applauds the WHO for its campaign to counter this.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6410Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:Committee Membership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that&mdash;</p>
<p>Alex Johnstone be appointed to replace Jackson Carlaw as a member of the Subordinate Legislation Committee;</p>
<p>Jackson Carlaw be appointed to replace Alex Johnstone as a member of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6409Annabel Goldie:Relationships between HM Government and the Scottish Parliament and Government</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the commitment of HM Government to establish a positive and constructive working relationship with the Scottish Government and Parliament to tackle the problems facing the country and, in particular, welcomes the commitment in the Queen&rsquo;s Speech to introduce legislation to implement recommendations from the final report of the Commission on Scottish Devolution and the willingness to consider matters in relation to the Fossil Fuel Levy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6408Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:Withdrawal of Funding for South Lanarkshire Disability Forum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision by South Lanarkshire Council to withdraw funding from the South Lanarkshire Disability Forum (SLDF) owing to non-financial reasons and regrets SLDF&rsquo;s subsequent decision to close; recognises that SLDF has provided advice and support across the range of disabilities and help for those in need of it to obtain their benefit entitlements as well as signposting the routes toward appropriate sources of aid and advice; regrets the disappearance of these services, which continue to be greatly in demand; understands that, although the decision by South Lanarkshire Council&rsquo;s Director of Social Work Resources to withdraw all funding from SLDF with effect from 31 March 2010 was taken in October 2009, SLDF was not notified of the decision until mid-February 2010, and suggests that, had more time been given by South Lanarkshire Council to consultation with SLDF and the users of its services prior to the decision to close the forum, the loss of these services could have been avoided.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6407Bruce Crawford:Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that&mdash;</p>
<p>Malcolm Chisholm be appointed to replace Margaret Curran as the Scottish Labour Party substitute on the Local Government and Communities Committee;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6399Stuart McMillan:Launch of Engage for Education Website</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Engage for Education website by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning and the Minister for Skills and Lifelong Learning at St Ninian&rsquo;s High School in East Dunbartonshire on 25 May 2010; notes that this groundbreaking website will provide an online space for everyone involved in Scottish education to provide their views and feedback; further notes that the process will be two-way, with quick responses expected from the Scottish Government, including direct input from the education ministers, and acknowledges that the Engage for Education website offers what it believes to be an excellent opportunity for those involved in education to make their opinions and views known, and to articulate them directly with the Scottish Government.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6398Kenneth Gibson:Afghan Heroin</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the ever-increasing presence of opium production in Afghanistan and its ill-effects on Scotland and the wider world; observes that many counter-narcotics policies have been less than effective and is disappointed that Afghanistan has grown to supply 93% of the world&rsquo;s heroin while under Allied control; regrets the growing dependence on opium of Afghan youth and notes the linkage of this dependence to the future security and stability of the region; remembers an Afghanistan where orchards of apricots and pomegranates filled the landscape rather than the poppy fields of today and sees these as potential alternatives; is concerned by the worldwide damage created by the opium trade, with 30,000 annual drug-related deaths in Russia alone where heroin addiction is best described as a tsunami; acknowledges Russia&rsquo;s rebukes to NATO for allegedly standing by while opium production continues under its nose and petitions NATO to accept outside assistance; seeks a robust and balanced counter-narcotics policy whereby eradication efforts are part of a wider strategy that focuses on long-term alternative livelihoods and combating corruption, and hopes that greater progress will be made in containing this scar on the global community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6397Helen Eadie:Scottish Gas Contractors</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns reports that a Fife resident who applied for the energy assistance package (EAP) was visited by contractors from Perth, Dundee and Shotts, but not from Fife; considers that, as the administrator of the EAP, the Scottish Executive holds ultimate responsibility for how the package is managed and for ensuring that its key objectives are met; believes that, as Scottish Gas has been contracted as managing agents to administer the scheme, it has a duty to ensure that, where packages are awarded, they are sub-contracted out to as many local independent firms as possible, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review how the tender process for contracts for stage four assistance is managed so that local jobs and services can be protected and regeneration further assisted in those areas where unemployment rates are still what is considered to be unacceptably high.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6396Cathy Jamieson:Girvan 150</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 150th anniversary of the railway arriving in Girvan; congratulates all those involved in the celebrations held on 24 May 2010 at Girvan Station, including members of the Stranraer to Ayr Line Support Association (SAYLSA), pupils and staff from Girvan Primary School, Pipe Major Jimmy Wilson, representatives of ScotRail and Strathclyde Partnership for Transport, local councillors and local residents; recognises the past importance of the Stranraer to Ayr line for the economy of Girvan; further recognises the importance of the line for the current and future tourism and business economy of the town; notes also that the current Girvan Station occupies a unique place in railway history, having been built in 1951 to a London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railway art deco design, being the first post-war station constructed in Scotland and the first under railway nationalisation, and thanks Richard Carr and members of SAYLSA for their work in preserving this unique heritage.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6395Patrick Harvie:72% of Kids Want to Grow Their Own Veg</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the findings of a recent National Trust poll that indicate that children are keen to grow and eat their own food; notes that, in a UK-wide poll of a thousand 8 to 12-year-olds, 72% of children stated that they would like to have their own space to grow fruit and vegetables and that 51% would prefer to eat food that they had grown themselves over fruit and vegetables bought from a supermarket, and calls on the Scottish Government and local authorities to adopt long-term commitments to boost local food production and support the next generation in its desire for the opportunity to grow food in a fun, healthy and environmentally friendly manner and to ensure that allotments and public spaces are made widely available to all those who wish to grow their own produce.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6394Murdo Fraser:Shaun Murawski</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Shaun Murawski for being selected to take a portrait of Her Majesty the Queen on behalf of the Scottish Parliament, which will go on display at the Parliament later this year; thanks all the individuals who were nominated and congratulates the finalists, Sylwia Kowalczyk, Chris Park, Carolyn Scott and Julie Tinton, for being shortlisted; thanks the judges who selected the finalists and internationally acclaimed photographer Harry Benson, who will mentor the winning photographer before and during the royal photo shoot; believes that this competition has highlighted Scotland&rsquo;s rich talent of skilled young photographers, and welcomes the news that there will soon be a portrait of Scotland&rsquo;s Head of State on display in the Scottish Parliament.</p>
