    the decision of the Home Secretary to grant a visa for Mike Tyson to enter the United
    Kingdom; is concerned that his decision was taken without any genuine consultation with
    members of the Scottish Parliament, Scottish Executive or relevant womens&#146; groups;
    further notes that Mike Tyson has at no time expressed public remorse for the crimes of
    violence for which he has been convicted, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure
    by whatever means possible, and if necessary by arranging for a judicial review to be
    sought, that the boxing match scheduled for 24 June 2000 at Hampden Stadium does not go
    ahead.<i><b> </p>

    benefit from the jobs created by the boom in the construction industry, and further
