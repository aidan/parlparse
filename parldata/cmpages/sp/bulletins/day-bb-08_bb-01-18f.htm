<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1178</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Publication of The Birds of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>The Birds of Scotland</em>, the definitive two-volume work on Scottish birds, which has been drawn up over five years under the auspices of the Scottish Ornithologists&rsquo; Club (SOC) with the support of a range of organisations and individuals including Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Forestry Commission and the RSPB; commends the work of all its editors, authors and illustrators; recognises that the million words in the two volumes of the work represent an extraordinary achievement which will contribute greatly to national and international knowledge; is pleased that Scotland leads the world in studying its own bird life and its own environment with a view to ensuring sustainability and a healthy biodiversity, and express its gratitude to the SOC for the copy of the book which it presented to the Minister for Environment at the book&rsquo;s launch on 9 January 2008 in the Royal Museum of Scotland with the request that it be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1177</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Clarinda</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 2008 marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of Nancy McLehose, the &quot;Clarinda&quot; who so greatly inspired Robert Burns; congratulates Mike Gibb on his new musical play called &quot;Clarinda&quot; , which has music by Kevin Walsh; notes that the world premier of the play will be held at The Netherbow in Edinburgh on Friday 25 January 2008, Burns Night, and commends the generosity of the author in ensuring that all&nbsp;the author&rsquo;s royalties from the play go to the Mary Slessor Foundation which carries on the work of that other great Scot in Calabar, Nigeria, who was the heroine of an earlier musical play by him entitled &quot;Mother of All the Peoples&quot; which was performed in the Parliament in March 2007.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1176</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Budget (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Budget (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alex Salmond<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1175</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Winter Break for Scottish Football</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the recent call from the Scottish Football Association Chief Executive, Gordon Smith, to introduce a winter break into Scottish football; notes that the concept of a winter break has support from respected figures in the game such as Alex Ferguson, Walter Smith and Craig Levein; recognises that European countries such as Germany have had successful winter shutdown periods for a number of years; believes that a winter break would be beneficial for players, protect playing surfaces and would show consideration to the safety of spectators travelling to matches, and hopes that discussions between Scottish football&rsquo;s governing bodies can find a way forward on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1174&diams; </strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Celebrating Fairtrade Fortnight</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the ongoing efforts of individuals and organisations working to promote and raise awareness of fair trade in Scotland, welcomes the steady increase in the number of schools, colleges, church groups, towns and cities across Scotland who now have Fairtrade status; acknowledges the important contribution made by the Scottish Fair Trade Forum in the work to help Scotland achieve Fairtrade nation status, notes that Fairtrade Fortnight will take place from 24 February to 9 March 2008, and looks forward to marking this at an event in the Parliament on the evening of Thursday 28 February.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1173</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Campaign to Ban Snaring in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the continued use of snaring subjects thousands of Scotland&rsquo;s wild animals every year to a degree of suffering, including disembowelment, mutilation and death by slow strangulation, which is unacceptable and could not legally be inflicted on domestic animals; agrees that Scotland&rsquo;s wildlife, pets and farmed animals should not be exposed to indiscriminate trapping methods such as snares which are known to exact a heavy toll of non-target animals, including European protected species; notes that last year&rsquo;s Scottish Executive consultation on the future of snaring elicited a more than two-to-one majority in favour of an outright ban on snares; welcomes the campaign to ban snaring in Scotland launched on 15 January 2008 by Advocates for Animals, the League Against Cruel Sports, Hessilhead Wildlife Rescue Trust, the Hare Preservation Trust, the International Otter Survival Fund and Scottish Badgers, and sponsored by the Marchig Animal Welfare Trust, and believes that snaring should be banned.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1171</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Funding for Training in the Food and Drink Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets that food and drink industry training schemes have become ineligible for European Social Fund grants following the implementation of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Lowlands and Uplands Scotland Operational Programmes 2007-2013; notes that, in the bakery sector alone, it is estimated that this will result in a fall in the number of training places from around 800 to as low as 200 a year; believes that such cutbacks in training activity may jeopardise the industry&rsquo;s status as one of Scotland&rsquo;s major sources of employment and export income and provider of many products and services that enhance the quality of life of the Scottish people, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to work with the European Commission to amend the Lowlands and Uplands Scotland Operational Programmes 2007-2013 in order to make food and drink industry training schemes eligible for European funding once again.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1170</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Dundee - Intelligent Community of the Year Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dundee and its residents on being nominated as one of the seven finalists from across the world in the Intelligent Community of the Year awards for 2008 for the second time running; recognises that Dundee has come a long way since the days of jute, jam and journalism and is now a leading centre for life sciences and digital technology; notes that innovative schemes such as smart cards for citizens were pioneered in Dundee, and looks forward to the continued growth of the science and technology sectors in Dundee.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1164</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Trade Union Democracy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern about the fact that many trade unions link their political funds to only one political party; is concerned that this does not reflect the diversity of political opinion within the trade union movement, and therefore calls on trade unions to ensure that there is democratic renewal and to hold a ballot of trade union members on which political party, if any, their political fund should support.</p>
