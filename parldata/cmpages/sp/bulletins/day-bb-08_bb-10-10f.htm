<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section.</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2699</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations on Scottish University World Rankings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the 2008<em> Times Higher Education QS World University Rankings</em>; congratulates the University of Edinburgh, University of Glasgow and University of St Andrews for being ranked in the top 100; further congratulates the University of Aberdeen for being ranked in the top 200 universities in the world; recognises that Scottish universities make up four of the 29 UK universities in the top 200; notes the improved ranking of the University of Glasgow and the drop in ranking for the University of St Andrews and University of Aberdeen; notes the drop in ranking of the University of Dundee out of the top 200 world universities; further notes the delay in publishing the final report of the Joint Future Thinking Taskforce on Universities; highlights the serious financial concerns expressed by many leaders across the university sector in Scotland over the last few weeks, and calls on the Scottish Government to come forward with concrete and substantive proposals to ensure Scotland&rsquo;s universities maintain and build on their current international position over the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2698</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>University of Stirling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the contribution that the University of Stirling makes to higher education in Scotland; notes the recent installation of the new Chancellor of the University of Stirling, an event that takes place only every 10 years; congratulates Dr James Naughtie for achieving this position and notes that this post was previously held by Dame Diana Rigg; is pleased to note that, alongside Louise Martin CBE and Jasminder Singh OBE, the Rt Hon Jack McConnell MSP, a Stirling graduate, will be made a Doctor of the University for his contribution to public affairs; extends further congratulations to those receiving honorary degrees, and wishes the University of Stirling and all its staff and students every continued success.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2697</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Regret for Continuing Complacency on Reducing Clostridium Difficile Hospital Infections</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the most recent Health Protection Scotland (HPS) statistics on healthcare associated infections; while recognising the continuing improvement in MRSA, notes that the number of cases of Clostridium difficile in the most recent quarter (April to June 2008) showed an increase from the same quarter in 2007 of 150 cases or around 9%; regrets that HPS, having tried to explain the increases over the previous two quarters (October 2007 to March 2008) as &quot;probable seasonal variation&quot;, now suggests that the small reduction from the two winter quarters represents a real reduction rather than a continuing year-on-year increase; further notes that, unlike England, Scotland still reports on the basis of NHS boards and not individual hospitals, thus preventing the public from having any information about their local hospitals; considers that the continued rise in antibiotic resistance reflects the continuation of a failure to implement effective antibiotic policies; calls on the Scottish Executive to urgently review hand hygiene policies, practice and reporting to ensure that alcohol wipes and hand washing are not conflated in hand hygiene reports and ensure that the denominator of observations is standardised for each hospital and also that inspection is rigorous and independent for each hospital, thus ending self reporting, and further calls on the Scottish Executive to set tough targets for a reduction in Clostridium difficile cases by 2011 to match or exceed the 30% target set in England.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2696</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Black Pudding Makers of Stornoway</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the black pudding makers of Stornoway for their distinctive and high quality product, which is enjoying a growing reputation; welcomes the increased export of Stornoway black pudding from the islands; regrets the marketing of black pudding not made in Stornoway but which uses the name of Stornoway on its labelling; supports the possibility of securing protected origin or geographical status for genuine Stornoway black pudding, and encourages all Scots and others to sample the delights of real Stornoway black pudding.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2695</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Plight of Wives of Miami Five</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the visit by Olga Salanueva and Adriana P&eacute;rez, the wives of two Cuban nationals, Ren&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez and Gerardo Hern&aacute;ndez, who are here as part of a UK-wide trip to highlight their own and their husbands&rsquo; plight; recognises that their husbands, members of a group of men known as the Miami Five, are currently serving long prison sentences in the United States of America since being arrested while trying to gather information on Miami-based groups allegedly responsible for terrorist attacks against the Cuban people; is concerned that the wives have been denied US visas, meaning that they cannot visit their husbands and have not seen them for over eight years; agrees with Amnesty International that this action is &quot;contrary to standards for humane treatment of prisoners and to states&rsquo; obligations to protect family life&quot;; further considers that it is inhumane, unjust and cruel, and believes that the US authorities should grant visas to enable the women to visit their husbands.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2694</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Tackling Wildlife Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Lothian and Borders Police on appointing a full-time serving officer as Wildlife and Environmental Crime Officer to work alongside the existing Wildlife Crime Co-ordinator; notes that the Lothian and Borders force now joins Grampian force in employing a full-time serving officer as a wildlife crime officer; commends the Grampian model for providing strong support from senior officers; hopes that other police forces will follow suit; calls on the Scottish Government to urge other police forces to employ a serving officer as a wildlife and environmental crime officer, as recommended by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland and the Inspectorate of Prosecution in Scotland in <em>Natural Justice: A joint thematic inspection of the arrangements in Scotland for preventing, investigating and prosecuting wildlife crime</em> and highlighted as an important step by all parties during the debate on that report on 22 May 2008, and further calls on the Scottish Government to report to the Parliament its progress on implementing the recommendations of the report.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2693#</strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Community Service Volunteers (CSV)</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Community Service Volunteers (CSV) for its strong track record in supporting retired people to engage with their local communities as volunteers; congratulates the Energy Challenge project in Aberdeen, which trains older volunteers to bring fuel efficiency and energy savings advice to people in their own homes to ensure that they stay warm and have energy-efficient homes; notes that, in view of government funding ending in March 2009, CSV&rsquo;s support to 1,600 older volunteers working in their local areas will come to an end, which will have a huge impact on communities and individuals across Scotland, and believes that consideration should be given to how continued support can be provided for volunteer-involving organisations.</p>
