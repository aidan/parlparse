          <p>9.30 am&#9;Debate on Investment and Reform in Health and Community 
            Care- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3106</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Investment 
            and Reform in Health and Community Care</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the Scottish Executive's commitment to sustained investment 
            in health; agrees that investment must be accompanied by reform that 
            is focused on the needs and expectations of patients and service users; 
            acknowledges the progress that has already been made by the National 
            Waiting Times Unit and looks forward to further improvements; supports 
            a collaborative approach to reform which involves patients, staff 
            and the wider public; welcomes the priority attached to dealing with 
            delayed discharge and hospital-acquired infection, and believes that 
            improving health and tackling health inequalities in both urban and 
            rural Scotland should be central features of the reform agenda. </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3106.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Investment 
              and Reform in Health and Community Care</strong>-As an amendment 
              to motion (S1M-3106) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out 
              from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets 
              that the sustainability of investment in health is dependent solely 
              on decisions taken by Her Majesty's Government rather than determined 
              by the Scottish Parliament; agrees that reform in the delivery of 
              health care is essential if we are to create a modern NHS which 
              improves health and tackles health inequalities throughout Scotland, 
              is transparent in its operation and publicly accountable, and prioritises 
              the needs and expectations of patients and service users; is concerned 
              that the Scottish Executive's use of the Private Finance Initiative 
              and private healthcare capacity to redress decades of under-funding 
              by the Tories damages the NHS and undermines the principle of a 
              universal service that is free at the point of need; is further 
              concerned that waiting lists and times are manipulated to the point 
              of being meaningless, and believes that continuing reduction in 
              the NHS acute sector capacity and staff shortages across the range 
              of healthcare professions must be reversed if the NHS is to tackle 
              effectively the crucial issues of bed blocking, waiting lists and 
              times and hospital-acquired infection which remain fundamental obstructions 
              to improving the health of the people of Scotland.&quot; </p>
            <p> <strong>S1M-3106.3</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Investment and 
              Reform in Health and Community Care</strong>-As an amendment to 
              motion (S1M-3106) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from 
              first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;agrees that investment 
              in health must be accompanied by reform that is focused on the needs 
              and expectations of patients and service users; supports a collaborative 
              approach to reform which involves patients, staff and the wider 
              public; believes that improving health and tackling health inequalities 
              in both urban and rural Scotland should be central features of the 
              reform agenda; regrets the failure of the Scottish Executive to 
              deal with delayed discharge and hospital-acquired infection; notes 
              that medical activity has decreased, and further notes that the 
              Scottish Executive's National Waiting Times Unit has only achieved 
              success after utilising the independent sector.&quot; </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3105</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>National 
            Waste Strategy</strong>-That the Parliament supports the Scottish 
            Executive's commitment to sustainable waste management; commends the 
            progress being made towards the establishment of a National Waste 
            Plan by partnership working between the Executive, local government, 
            the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and other stakeholders; 
            welcomes the preparation of draft area waste plans to establish the 
            best practicable environmental options for municipal waste management, 
            and notes that all have a part to play in the reduction and better 
            management of Scotland's waste. </p>

                Waste Strategy</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3105) in 
                the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to 
                end and insert &quot;notes that in February 2000 the European 
                Commission applied for a declaration that the UK had failed to 
                fulfil its obligations in particular under Council Directive 75/442/EEC 
                of 15 July 1975 on waste, and that the UK accepted this failure 
                and the European Court of Justice found the UK (including Scotland) 
                in breach of a number of waste related Directives; further notes 
                that the National Waste Strategy was published in 1999 together 
                with a commitment to the production of Area Waste Plans by the 
                end of 2000 and that this target date was subsequently extended 
                to a final deadline of March 2002; is concerned with the slow 
                progress being made towards the better management of waste in 
                Scotland, and believes that in order to speed up progress the 
                Executive must firstly introduce mandatory targets, on an all 
                Scotland basis, of 30% to 35% for recycling and composting of 
                household waste by 2010.&quot; </p>

                plans; regrets the slow progress being made towards ambitious 
                recycling targets being set in the National Waste Plan; notes 
                the need to build on work done already by local authorities, and 
                recognises the need for community involvement and ownership of 
                the problems of waste disposal at all levels to make a National 
                Waste Strategy effective throughout Scotland.&quot; </p>

            to the Scottish economy and the contribution it makes to supporting 
            employment and vocational education and training; notes that nine 
            out of every 10 construction firms employ less than eight people; 
            acknowledges that the reputation of the whole industry is damaged 
            by the actions of rogue traders, particularly within the residential 
            sector, and that small businesses contend that their profitability 
            and competitiveness is adversely affected by the system of cash retentions, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should initiate a strategic 
            review of construction in Scotland in order to (a) identify how best 
            to combat the &quot;cowboy&quot; element, (b) support the education 
            and training infrastructure so that it is able to meet the skill requirements 
            of the industry, (c) examine the possibility of developing an inspection 
            and assessment regime to evaluate the competence of construction companies, 
            (d) address the system of cash retentions and (e) ensure that the 
            provisions within the existing construction contracts legislation 
            deliver a process that is fair, effective and easy to understand.
