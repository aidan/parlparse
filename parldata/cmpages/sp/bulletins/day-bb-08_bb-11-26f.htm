<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2967</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>International Students and ID Cards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that all non-EU nationals renewing their visas after this week will be required by the UK Government to buy an ID card and that this particularly affects international students studying in Scotland; shares the previous Scottish Executive&rsquo;s view, supported by the Parliament in 2005, that ID cards must not be required for the use of devolved services; notes that, while immigration is currently reserved, universities and education are devolved services; believes that international students contribute substantially to Scottish society and the Scottish economy, and urges the Scottish Government to provide whatever advice and support it can for such students studying in Scottish universities and colleges if they refuse to comply with the ID card scheme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2966</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Scottish Government in negotiating a deal that is fair and just for Scotland&rsquo;s fishing communities and that reflects in full the leadership that Scotland&rsquo;s fishermen are showing the rest of Europe on sustainable fisheries.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2965</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>St Andrew&rsquo;s Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes in the importance of St Andrew&rsquo;s Day, Scotland&rsquo;s national day; recognises the opportunity that it presents for everyone in Scotland, and friends of Scotland around the world, to celebrate our history, culture and traditions as well as the vibrant, creative and dynamic nation that Scotland is today; notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s support for a programme of events throughout Scotland as part of the Winter Festival, and supports the opportunity that St Andrew&rsquo;s Day provides to prepare the way for the 2009 Year of Homecoming, which will give a much-needed boost to the Scottish tourism sector and to the economy generally.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2964</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Women&rsquo;s Welfare in the Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the state of women&rsquo;s welfare in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the widespread systematic rape and sexual violence against women and young girls; notes the indiscriminate nature of the crime with rape victims as young as infants or as old as 80-year-old grandmothers, with many being raped by groups of soldiers and others held as sex slaves; highlights the reported 40,000 victims of sexual violence that were treated in UN and partnered medical centres in 2007 and notes that experts believe this to be only a fraction of the actual number of victims; applauds campaigns such as the <em>Enough Project</em>, which aims to empower Congolese women and girls to put an end to assaults of sexual violence; calls for an end to rape being used as a weapon of war by all armed groups, and finally hails the courageous women of the DRC who are making their voices heard by the international community and demonstrating against this ongoing campaign of physical, psychological and social assault.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2963</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Redevelopment of School Playing Fields</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the redevelopment of school playing fields across Scotland and the consequent loss of facilities for schools and communities; considers that the omission of Fields in Trust (FIT) Scotland, previously known as the National Playing Fields Association, as a mandatory consultee on all playing field development proposals is a bizarre anomaly, and believes that FIT Scotland should be accorded mandatory consultee status by the Scottish Government without delay.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2962</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>AFS Alcohol Support Online</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Alcohol Focus Scotland and Alcohol Support Ltd, Aberdeen, on launching a new pilot online support service for the people of Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, AFS Alcohol Support Online, which can be found at www.alcoholsupport.co.uk, and believes that this interactive website will form a valuable tool in the range of services that are provided to help those who wish to talk to someone about their or another person&rsquo;s drinking and will reduce barriers to gaining free and confidential advice from trained counsellors for those who live in rural areas, young people and disabled people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2961</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Suspension of Standing Orders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, for the purpose of allowing up to 30 minutes to debate motion S3M-2958 on Thursday 27 November 2008, the second and third sentences of Rule 10.6.5 of Standing Orders be suspended.</p>

<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2959</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Bill at Stage 2 be completed by 19 December 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2958</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Provision of School Lunches (Disapplication of the Requirement to Charge) (Scotland) Order 2008 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2957#</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Forensic Science Laboratory</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposals made by the Scottish Police Services Authority for the closure of the forensic science laboratory in Aberdeen; welcomes the direction issued by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to the authority in May 2008 that it should engage in fresh consultation with interested parties; considers, with regret, that the authority&rsquo;s consultation document published in November 2008 amounts to no more than a further case for closure; believes that the authority has thereby appeared to suggest that the conclusion of its consultation has already been determined in favour of closure, and further believes that the continued provision of forensic services to Grampian Police and Northern Constabulary by the forensic laboratory in Aberdeen is one of a number of options worthy of proper consideration in a meaningful consultation process.</p>
<p>Supported by: Richard Baker<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2956</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Red Cross Report - What We Do in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Red Cross for its <em>What we do in Scotland</em> report; notes that the activities of the Red Cross are provided by a local network of more than 4,000 volunteers, supported by more than 400 members of staff, helping around 100,000 people in crisis in Scotland every year; welcomes the cooperation of the Red Cross with the Scottish Ambulance Service in the operation of four Community First Responder schemes in Kyle of Lochalsh, Aberdeen, Forth Valley and Grangemouth, a model of cooperation replicated in its work with HM Coastguard in providing support to those rescued in emergency situations; supports the Red Cross programmes of first aid instruction, including working with Deafblind Scotland for a specific course for deafblind adults, and looks forward to the continued work of the Red Cross in future years.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Aileen Campbell<strong>*</strong>, Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong>, Elizabeth Smith<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Pauline McNeill<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Shirley-Anne Somerville<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2955</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Forests</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Forestry Commission Scotland has a central role with regard to sustainable development and to combating climate change; recognises the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase forest cover from 17% to 25% by 2020; expresses its dismay at the proposal to lease Scottish woodland to commercial companies for up to 75 years, a decision that could, in the long term, threaten productivity, employment, sustainable use of woodland and environmental policy making, and calls on the Scottish Government to withdraw forthwith from any negotiations that may have been started and to renew its commitment to continue to support the Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s important work on both climate change and sustainable development.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2954</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Steven Taylor, Professional of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Steven Taylor, an employee of Capita Life and Pensions, Glasgow, who was awarded the prestigious United Kingdom-wide titles of Professional of the Year - Agent and Overall Professional of the Year at the 2008 Customer Contact Association awards in Edinburgh; believes that such awards demonstrate Steven&rsquo;s hard work, commitment, ability and professionalism, and further believes that such an accolade going to an employee of a Scottish-based firm sends out a strong signal as to the quality, skill and dedication of a Scottish-based workforce, which is vital not only in terms of maintaining Scottish jobs but also in expanding Scotland&rsquo;s jobs base.</p>
<p>Supported by: Aileen Campbell<strong>*</strong>, Bashir Ahmad<strong>*</strong>, Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, John Park<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2953</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Dependent Britain</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that<font color="#0000ff">,</font> as a result of the pre-Budget report announced on 24 November 2008 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer<font color="#0000ff">,</font> the estimated budget deficit for the UK Government will rise to over 8% of GDP in 2010 and the national debt will rise to nearly 60% of GDP, with both these figures excluding the billions required to pay off the debts arising from PPP/PFI commitments and the bail out of the banks; notes that the United Kindgom&rsquo;s credit rating has now been downgraded to being, apart from Italy, the lowest in the developed world; deduces that, based on previous statements made by the unionist Labour, Liberal and Tory parties about the economic viability of an independent Scotland, the United Kingdom can no longer survive as a politically-independent state, and therefore invites those parties to advise which other nation should now assume responsibility for running Britain.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2952</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>DR Congo Conflict</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its dismay that an estimated 250,000 civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have had to flee their homes and are living in desperate conditions following the latest outbreak of violence in eastern DRC; notes that these refugees are joining more than one million civilians already displaced in the region; commends the aim of the world&rsquo;s largest UN peacekeeping force of 17,000, which is attempting to secure an end to the DRC&rsquo;s lengthy civil war and ultimately disarm and re-integrate rebel forces into a joint defence force for the region; further notes that the civil war has already caused more than three million deaths, mainly due to starvation and disease, with around 1,200 people dying each day as a direct or indirect result of the conflict; applauds the Disasters Emergency Committee Democratic Republic of Congo appeal, which brings together a unique alliance of the international aid, corporate, public and broadcasting sectors to rally funds and ensure that they go to delivering life-saving food, water, shelter and emergency medical supplies to those affected, and, finally, highlights the critical scale of the crisis, signalling that much more is needed from the international community in order to end the conflict and rebuild the DRC.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2941</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Govanhill Law Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the Govanhill Law Centre, a new law centre offering free legal advice to residents of Govanhill, which will work with the local community to root out slum landlords, gangmasters and organised criminals; congratulates principal solicitor Mike Dailly for his commitment to the centre; thanks Glasgow City Council leader Steven Purcell and Govanhill Housing Association chairperson Janice McEwan for their work on behalf of the centre; further thanks Louise Carlin of Oxfam Scotland&rsquo;s Poverty Programme for the charity organisation&rsquo;s ongoing support, and hopes that the Govanhill Law Centre will help empower the community to solve the problems that it faces and provide further confidence to residents in their campaign for a better Govanhill.</p>
