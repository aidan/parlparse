          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-663</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Integration of Prison Health Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the Scottish Consortium on Crime and Social Justice&rsquo;s paper, <em>The Cost of Unnecessary Imprisonment</em>; agrees with the proposal that the Scottish Prison Service needs to accelerate its integration of health services, including mental health and addictions services, with the NHS; believes that an approach of interventions integrated with the patients&rsquo; pathway determined by NHS practitioners and, where appropriate, followed up by provision in the community on release would result in reduced crime and reoffending, reduced costs to the taxpayer and fewer people in Scottish prisons, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support the Scottish Prison Service and the NHS in achieving this integration.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-662#</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Further Job Losses at Young&rsquo;s Seafood, Annan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the announcement on 11 October 2007 by Young&rsquo;s Seafood of the loss of 89 jobs from its Annan plant; notes that 100 jobs had already been lost in February this year and at that time the company announced that it remained committed to a long-term future for its Annan site; notes also that only approximately 25 jobs are likely to remain at Young&rsquo;s Seafood in Annan; believes that the workforce and the local community have been badly let down by the company, and considers that the consultation period for the current tranche of job losses should be extended from 30 to 90 days to enable workers facing redundancy to consider relocation options and that those workers wishing to take up employment opportunities at other sites should be offered appropriate financial support.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-661</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Greenock High School FP Football Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Greenock High School FP football team as it celebrates its centenary year; notes that to mark this special occasion the club has played football matches against Greenock Morton FC and a Scottish Amateur Football League select team and has received a civic reception from Inverclyde Council; further notes that Greenock High School FP football team won the Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division in the team&rsquo;s centenary year and is currently leading this season&rsquo;s premier league, and wishes the management and players every success for the future.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-660</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>NCH and Glasgow Perthshire Juniors Challenge Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the valuable collaboration between NCH and Glasgow Perthshire junior football club in providing a meaningful renovation project for 10 young people; congratulates the young people involved who learned new skills and teamwork, and notes with satisfaction that all 10 have achieved employment or meaningful training opportunities as a result.</p>
