<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong><br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;<br />
        <br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong><br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong><br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6426 Irene Oldfather: European SME Week 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that European Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) Week 2010, which runs from 25 May to 1 June, seeks to promote and support entrepreneurship; notes that it is estimated that over 3 million people will participate in some 1,261 events and activities that are being organised in 37 countries across Europe, showcasing the support available to business at European, national, regional and local levels; recognises the importance of this event as an engine to encourage entrepreneurship so that more people seriously consider becoming an entrepreneur as a career option; notes that in Scotland there is believed to be approximately 280,000 SMEs, employing around 1 million people and representing 99% of all enterprises and 53% of all employment; believes that events being held in Scotland and elsewhere in the UK will allow SMEs and micro-firms to share experiences with their European equivalents in order to further develop their businesses, and wishes those involved in organising the events, and those participating, all the best for a successful week.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6425 Irene Oldfather: Volunteers&rsquo; Week 2010 and European Year of Volunteering 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Volunteers&rsquo; Week 2010, which is scheduled to run from 1 to 7 June and is focused on raising the profile of the voluntary sector; notes that events celebrating the work of volunteers will be held across the United Kingdom; recognises that in Scotland an estimated 3 in ten adults have provided unpaid help to organisations or individuals, equivalent to 142,455,672 hours per annum and worth an economic value of &pound;2.2 billion; believes that volunteers from all strata of society can help to support local communities and, further to this, that the voluntary sector can provide experience and skills that people may otherwise not have the opportunity to access; further notes that the European Commission has declared 2011 to the be the European Year of Volunteering, with events being planned across Europe to highlight the value and importance of volunteering; acknowledges the hard work of volunteers in Scotland, and hopes that both Volunteers&rsquo; Week and the European Year of Volunteering will help to encourage greater participation in the sector.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6424 David Whitton: Congratulations to Auchinairn Primary and Nursery, Bishopbriggs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and congratulates Auchinairn Primary and Nursery for the vast array of extra-curricular activities conducted and supported by the school; recognises the drama, Latin, chess, and rugby activities at the school, as well as the World of Work and enterprise initiatives with local businesses, including Greggs, Asda and Kingsmill, and workshops conducted with Scottish Ballet and Carl Rosa Opera; also notes that the school is an accredited health promoting primary, and congratulates the school&rsquo;s Eco committee on receiving a silver award from the Eco-Schools project and on recently being awarded its first green flag.</p>
