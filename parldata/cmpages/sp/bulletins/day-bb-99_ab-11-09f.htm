    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-260</b> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Hamish Henderson</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament recognises the contribution Hamish Henderson has made, not only to Scottish
    culture through song, verse and by translation of other nations&#146; culture into English
    and Scots, but to the reputation of Scotland as a progressive, forward looking, inclusive
    nation, both at home and abroad; congratulates him on the occasion of his 80th birthday
    and recognises that, as a veteran of the Second World War, its co-incidence with armistice
    day is a fitting point for reflection on the values of peace, social justice and the
    aspiration to a global community based on trust and mutual respect crossing all boundaries
    which underpin his work.</p>
