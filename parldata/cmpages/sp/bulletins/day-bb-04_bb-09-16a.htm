          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Executive Debate on Growing Scotland&rsquo;s Economy &ndash; Building on Progress&mdash;</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-1695</strong> <STRONG>Mr Jim Wallace:</STRONG> <STRONG>Growing Scotland&rsquo;s Economy - Building on Progress</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s response to the issues raised at the Business in the Parliament Conference 2004; welcomes the input of the business community into the current revision of <em>A Smart, Successful Scotland</em> and welcomes this opportunity for members to influence that revision; notes the broad consensus in support of the Executive&rsquo;s recently published framework for economic development in Scotland for addressing Scotland&rsquo;s historically low rate of economic growth by working to deliver improved productivity, and believes that improved economic growth is key to generating first-class public services for the people of Scotland. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><STRONG>S2M-1695.2</strong> <STRONG>Jim Mather: Growing Scotland&rsquo;s Economy - Building on Progress</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1695) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;; notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;in the belief that the case has now been made and popularly acclaimed at home and internationally-proven in recent competitiveness indices for more powers for the Parliament, which are needed in order to reverse Scotland&rsquo;s historically low rate of economic growth and generate both the wealth required to provide world-class public services and infrastructure and the high quality employment opportunities needed to retain and develop fresh talent in Scotland.&quot; </p>
              <p> <STRONG>S2M-1695.1</strong> <STRONG>Murdo Fraser: Growing Scotland&rsquo;s Economy - Building on Progress</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1695) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the continuing underperformance of the Scottish economy relative to the United Kingdom as a whole, despite the economic strategies of the Scottish Executive over the last five years; further notes with concern that Scotland was ranked 36th out of 60 countries in <em>IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2004</em>, some 14 places behind the United Kingdom as a whole; recognises the broad consensus of the business community in response to the Executive&rsquo;s recently published framework for economic development in Scotland, that action rather than words is required from the Executive to grow the Scottish economy, and calls upon the Executive to take immediate steps to create a more business-friendly environment by reducing business rates and water charges and cutting red tape, thereby encouraging business development and boosting Scotland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness.&quot; </p>
              <p> <STRONG>S2M-1695.3</strong> <STRONG>Shiona Baird: Growing Scotland&rsquo;s Economy - Building on Progress</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1695) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges that Scotland&rsquo;s economy, society and environment are interlinked and cannot be treated in isolation; notes that prioritising economic growth, above all else, contradicts the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s stated commitment to human and environmental welfare, and that GDP growth alone is not a measure of improvement in people&rsquo;s quality of life and environmental sustainability; notes the revelation in the recent report to the Environment and Rural Development Committee by CAG Consultants, <em>Is The Scottish Executive Structured and Positioned to Deliver Sustainable Development?</em> that the most significant weakness emerged in relation to the perceived need for economic growth and the failure to acknowledge the negative environmental impacts of growth policies, and calls on the Executive to place quality of life as its number one priority, supported by the development of a sustainable economy that does not undermine social and environmental justice.&quot; </p>
