<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6981 Michael Matheson: Falkirk Council Charges are an Attack on the Most Vulnerable in Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with dismay the charges for services used by older people, including the emergency care service, that have been introduced by the Labour/Tory-led administration of Falkirk Council; believes that these services are essential for many older residents; further believes that they are being imposed on some of the most vulnerable in society and will have a detrimental effect on their quality of life, and urges Falkirk Council to rethink what it considers to be this disgraceful set of new charges.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6980 Sandra White: Glasgow&rsquo;s Double Triumph</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow on winning two major prizes at the Scottish Events Awards that were held in the city&rsquo;s new Grand Central Hotel; notes that the Chairman&rsquo;s Award and the Best Medium Event Award were won in recognition of the city&rsquo;s success in hosting the 2009 MOBO awards; values the work of EventScotland and Glasgow City Marketing Board for helping to achieve this success, and believes the Scottish Events Awards, which recognise achievements in the national events industry, to be prestigious.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6979 Des McNulty: Tackling the Link Between Poverty and Educational Underachievement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at what it considers to be the wide gap in educational attainment in Scotland between children from poorer and better-off families; believes that this reinforces and perpetuates existing patterns of poverty; further believes that it is not acceptable that Scotland&rsquo;s poorest children make less progress at every stage of schooling than their better-off classmates; considers that, to break the cycle of deprivation, targeted support for children from the poorest homes and the most disadvantaged communities is needed to help them reach their full potential; welcomes Save the Children&rsquo;s campaign, Better Odds At School, which highlights this issue of educational underachievement; supports the nurture class programme that is being carried forward by Glasgow City Council, which targets resources at improving the life chances of the most vulnerable children, and urges the Scottish Government to bend resources toward those in greatest need.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6978.1 John Lamont: Drugs Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6978) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the progress that has been made in Scotland with the publishing of Scotland&rsquo;s national drugs strategy,<em> The Road to Recovery</em>; notes that, with the change in emphasis to recovery, Scotland has slowly started the journey toward battling the damaging effects that substance abuse has on society; believes that more needs to be done in identifying models that work, including those delivered by voluntary and faith groups, removing discrimination and territorial barriers and rolling out best practice to ensure that the ethos of the drugs strategy is felt in every aspect of rehabilitation; notes the significant role that substance abuse plays in criminal activity and the complex needs of those in custody with substance addictions, and believes that more needs to be done to ensure that prisons are drug free and every support is made available to those prisoners who want to become free of drugs.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6978.2 James Kelly: Drugs Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6978) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the serious problems with drug misuse still blighting too many communities; recognises that,despite the small reduction in drug-related deathsin the last year, significantchallenges remain in achieving a further reduction; is concerned about recent funding cuts to voluntary sector organisations and the impact that this could have on services; notes the high number of prison inmates abusing drugs, and urges the Scottish Government and Scottish Prison Service to do more to stop illegal drugs entering prisons.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6978.3 Patrick Harvie: Drugs Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6978) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;, but, in so doing, notes that experts such as Professor Pertwee of Aberdeen University and Sir Ian Gilmore, former President of the Royal College of Physicians, have called for a reconsideration of the failures of current drug legislation; believes that the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 neither promotes good health nor reduces crime associated with drug taking; recognises that some alternative approaches such as those taken in Portugal have been found to promote health and reduce crime, and, while recognising that drug policy is reserved to the UK Government, urges Scottish ministers to engage with the UK Government and to acknowledge the broader debate that is now taking place in civic Scotland and which examines alternatives to the current legislation.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6978.4 Robert Brown: Drugs Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6978) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;; recognises the effectiveness of drug treatment and testing orders (DTTO) in providing intensive, specialist support to individuals involved in drug-related offending, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that DTTOs are available to all Scottish courts as required.&quot;</p>
