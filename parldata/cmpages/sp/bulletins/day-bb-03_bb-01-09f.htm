          <p><strong>*S1M-3756#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: UNICEF Report, 
            <em>The State of the World's Children 2003</em></strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the publication of the report <em>The State of the World's Children 
            2003</em>; commends UNICEF's commitment to monitoring children's rights 
            and development internationally and congratulates it for its contribution 
            for achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals: is 
            concerned that the report shows that children's participation in society 
            is largely undeveloped and that millions of children and young people 
            have doubts about the usefulness of voting as a method of improving 
            their lives and often do not see government leaders as role models; 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should take all possible action 
            to assist Her Majesty's Government in achieving the Millennium Development 
            Goals, and supports the creation of a protective environment to allow 
            children world-wide to grow up free from poverty, abuse, neglect and 
            exploitation.</p>

            the Transport and the Environment Committee: Report on Inquiry into 
            the Rail Industry in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            15th Report 2002 of the Transport and Environment Committee, <em>Report 
            on Inquiry into the Rail Industry in Scotland</em> (SP Paper 674). 
          </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3753#</strong> <strong>Gordon Jackson: Regeneration 
            of the Clyde</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance 
            to Scotland of efforts to regenerate the Clyde; considers that the 
            Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise should establish and resource 
            a development framework for the Clyde which encourages joined-up thinking 
            and action; further considers that the respective councils, enterprise 
            companies, regeneration agencies and private developers should work 
            co-operatively in reclaiming derelict land, ensuring adequate flood 
            protection and improving the transport infrastructure, and believes 
            that ministers should make the regeneration of the Clyde one of the 
            top economic, environmental and social justice priorities for Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3752</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Dumping of Salmon</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the recent decision of the European 
            Commission to allow the EU/Norway agreement on the minimum import 
            price of salmon to lapse and to terminate its investigation of the 
            anti-dumping complaints against salmon farmers in Chile and the Faeroe 
            Islands without imposing any anti-dumping measures; condemns the Commission 
            for making the announcement over the Christmas and New Year holiday 
            period, effectively leaving Scottish salmon farmers less than a week 
            to make a detailed submission in response to its disclosure document; 
            recognises the importance of the salmon farming industry to Scotland, 
            particularly in the Highlands and Islands, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to support calls for an extension of the deadline for responses 
            to the Commission's disclosure document and to ensure that the case 
            put to the Commission by the EU Salmon Producers Group is given full 
            and proper consideration.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3751#</strong> <strong>George Lyon: Rural Communities 
            and Renewable Energy</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the ambitious 
            targets set by the Scottish Executive for renewable energy generation; 
            recognises the potential job benefits to be gained from a Scottish 
            manufacturing support base for renewable energy; further recognises 
            the crucial importance of communities benefiting from wind farms and 
            other renewable energy developments in their areas;<font color="#808000"> 
            </font>notes the growing<font color="#0000ff"> </font>number of wind 
            farm planning applications across rural Scotland; notes with concern 
            the hostile reception such applications have received from members 
            of the local community, who perceive no benefit to the community; 
            further notes that benefits can be delivered through community ownership, 
            rental income, reduced electricity bills or other methods, and considers 
            that the Executive should ensure that the Scottish economy and affected 
            communities benefit from the expansion of renewable energy.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3750#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Ageism in the 
            Labour Market</strong>-That the Parliament believes that it is both 
            absurd and hypocritical to advocate the need for longer working lives 
            when the labour market is infected so heavily with ageism, meaning 
            that many individuals in their 40s and 50s are denied the opportunity 
            to engage in full-time, or even part-time, work or voluntary participation 
            in their local communities; further believes that measures must be 
            adopted in the public and private sectors to deal with this economic 
            and social problem, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            set a good example by ensuring that the civil service and public bodies 
            are free of the pernicious problem of ageism in personnel principles, 
            policies and practices.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3748.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Review of Child

            of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from &quot;and supports" to end and insert 
            "calls for an overhaul of the children's hearing system which would 
            not only better deal with young offenders, but offer greater protection 
            to vulnerable young Scots, and further calls for a substantial increase 
            in the number of police officers visible within our communities to 
            deter and detect crime which would help make all sections of society 
            safer." </p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3748.2</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Review of Child 
            Protection</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3748) in the name 
            of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from &quot;and supports&quot; to end 
            and insert &quot;condemns the Scottish Executive's failure to deal 
            effectively with this problem despite almost four years in government 
            in Scotland, and commends a response based on effective, committed 
            and sustained support of mainstream, front-line child protection services, 
            in both financial and political terms.&quot;</p>
