<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1822</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>A Better Way to Work in Scotland - Unions into Schools Educational Pack</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the STUC on the launch of<em> A Better Way to Work in Scotland - Unions into Schools Educational Pack</em>; recognises the contribution made by the trained trade union representatives who have been visiting schools to ensure that young people have an improved knowledge of both their rights and responsibilities in the workplace; believes that the pack complements Determined to Succeed which encourages young people to adopt an enterprising and responsible approach to the future world of work; welcomes the fact that the pack will be circulated to every secondary school, and encourages every local authority to support the use of this pack in its schools.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1821</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that&mdash;</p>
<p>Claire Baker be appointed to replace Richard Baker as the Scottish Labour Party substitute on the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee;</p>
<p>John Park be appointed to replace Claire Baker as the Scottish Labour Party substitute on the Equal Opportunities Committee; and</p>
<p>Richard Baker be appointed to replace John Park as the Scottish Labour Party substitute on the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1820</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Committee Membership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that&mdash;</p>
<p>Charlie Gordon be appointed to replace Claire Baker as a member of the Audit Committee;</p>
<p>Richard Baker be appointed to replace Michael McMahon as a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee;</p>
<p>Patricia Ferguson be appointed to replace John Park as a member of the European and External Relations Committee; and</p>
<p>Jackie Baillie be appointed to replace Richard Baker as a member of the Subordinate Legislation Committee.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1819</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Blackridge Railway Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that West Lothian Council has granted a planning consent, subject to approval from Scottish Ministers, for housing development in Blackridge which includes financial and support infrastructure contributions from the developer toward the building of a new railway station at Blackridge; considers that any further delay by the Scottish Government in confirming that it will provide the remaining funding required will lead to the Blackridge railway station project being excluded from the Network Rail timetable for work on that phase of the Bathgate to Airdrie rail project and would result in the loss of opportunity to provide a new rail station and other beneficial infrastructure projects for Blackridge village; congratulates the local people of Blackridge on their successful community campaign which has demonstrated beyond doubt the economic and social benefits which will accrue from a new railway station, and calls on the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change to confirm that, subject to Scottish Ministers confirming approval for the outstanding planning consent, the Scottish Government will provide the balance of funding required to deliver a new railway station for Blackridge village as part of the overall Bathgate to Airdrie project, and clarification of how much that will be.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1818</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Roads in the Clydesdale Area</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Lesmahagow Community Council, <em>Carluke Gazette</em> and Lanarkshire-based businessman David Menzies on their campaign to improve the quality of roads in the Clydesdale area; believes that the number and size of potholes on key roads in the area is completely unacceptable, especially with a growing population and the importance of the road network for agricultural transport and tourist travel; welcomes South Lanarkshire Council&rsquo;s long overdue decision to consider additional funds for road maintenance, and believes that such funds should be made available as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1817</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Paisley Beer Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the Paisley Beer Festival on reaching its 21st year; notes that the festival runs from 30 April until 3 May 2008 at Paisley Town Hall; further notes that the festival is an important opportunity for small brewers, including those from the West of Scotland region, such as the Kelburn Beer Company, the Houston Brewing Company and the Isle of Arran Brewery Company Ltd, to promote their products; recognises that responsible consumption of the products and all alcoholic drinks is vital to ensure a successful festival, and wishes the festival organisers every success with this event and also in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1816</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>International Dance Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and supports International Dance Day held on 29 April 2008, which seeks to increase the awareness and importance of dance among the general public; praises the excellent work of Scotland&rsquo;s very own National Centre for Dance and its outreach programme, Dance Base, that takes children from disadvantaged backgrounds and gives them the necessary tools to regain their self-esteem, confidence and a sense of achievement through dance, and takes this opportunity to commend the hardworking individuals at Scotland&rsquo;s National Centre for Dance who, on a daily basis, inspire wellbeing and creativity and cultivate a future for dance in our local, national and international communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1815</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>2012 Olympic Games Contracts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that only 3% of contracts for the 2012 London Olympic Games have been awarded outside England, despite claims by the UK Government that Scotland would benefit from London being awarded the Games; believes that Scotland is due to see millions of pounds worth of lottery funds displaced due to the way that these games are being financed; considers the news that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been awarded minute numbers of the contracts associated with the 2012 Olympics thus far is further evidence that Scotland will see little in the way of tangible benefits from the games, and calls on the authorities awarding the contracts to assess whether they are being awarded fairly across the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1812.2</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1812) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;regrets&quot; to end and insert &quot;respects the democratic right of tenants to determine the ownership of their homes; regrets that HM Treasury will only write off local authority housing debt where local authority housing stock is transferred; believes that housing associations and other not-for-profit, co-operative bodies continue to have the lead role in providing new social housing but welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s encouragement of local authorities to augment the supply of new social housing as part of their role as landlords, and endorses the Scottish Government&rsquo;s plans to end the right to buy on new social housing and to review how right to buy applies to the existing stock of social housing.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1810*#*</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Community Radio</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the valuable and unique role of Scottish community radio in delivering small-scale, not-for-profit radio stations operated for the benefit of the general public and of particular communities; congratulates Leith FM, which celebrates its first year of broadcasting in May 2008 and which has epitomised the spirit of community radio by actively engaging with community groups and building relationships with other community stations, including Sunny Govan, Radio Awaz in Glasgow and Black Diamond Radio in Midlothian, and welcomes the continued expansion of the network of Scottish community radio stations across the country in providing a voice for Scotland&rsquo;s culturally, linguistically and geographically diverse communities.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1803.2</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Food Security</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1803) in the name of John Scott, insert at end &quot;recognises the role of Scotland&rsquo;s primary producers in ensuring the long-term capacity and capability of our food supply; and further calls on the Scottish Government to encourage the development of local supply chains through public procurement, address the imbalance in power between the big supermarkets and our food producers, reduce the regulatory burden on farmers, and ensure that our primary producers operate on a level playing field with foreign competitors.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1801*#*</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Towards an Inclusive Community</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by Lintel Trust, Glasgow, of <em>A Resource Guide For Housing Associations In Promoting Black And Minority Ethnic Participation In Governance Structures</em> building upon the findings of the previous report <em>From Rhetoric to Reality</em> which identified that, despite the existence of guidance regarding their involvement in governance arrangements, BME people were still excluded from or under-represented in such bodies, and believes that this excellent resource effectively brings together the many strands of guidance and good practice available and will serve to aid inclusive living leading to stronger local communities.</p>
