          <P><strong>*S2M-1041#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Tribute to the Women of Mining Communities</strong>-That the Parliament commemorates the struggle throughout the ages of all mining communities across the world and, in particular, pays tribute during International Women's Week to the women who have supported their menfolk in times of great adversity and congratulates the women of our country who remained steadfast during the mining strike of 1984, whose suffering and strife has been highlighted in the media during this past week in programmes that remind us of the darkest years of the Conservative Government and the brutal decimation of the coal mining industry by Ian MacGregor and Margaret Thatcher.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1035</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Proposed Closure of Midlothian Primary Schools</strong>-That the Parliament expresses concern at the proposed closure of five Midlothian primary schools and requests that the statutory consultation period of 28 days be extended to enable local communities to fully explore and comment on the proposals.<strong><em> R</em></strong></P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1030</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Voluntary GM Ban</strong>-That the Parliament considers that the proposal for a voluntary GM ban across East Lothian and the Borders is unworkable and condemns the decision to proceed with GM maize crops as showing a breathtaking disdain for the public, the Parliament, and science.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Eleanor Scott, Roseanna Cunningham, Mark Ballard, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Shiona Baird, Ms Sandra White, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Mr Mark Ruskell, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1029</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Remember Dunblane - Conservative's Insensitive Remarks</strong>-That the Parliament believes that, with the devastating outcome of the Dunblane tragedy still etched on the minds of the Scottish public, the comments in relation to the slackening of the handgun regulations attributed to Patrick Mercer MP, Conservative spokesman on homeland security, are entirely inappropriate and offensive, and further believes, following Mr Mercer's comments, that David McLetchie MSP, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, should unreservedly condemn these insensitive comments and should ensure that Mr Mercer is removed from his Tory spokesman responsibility by Michael Howard MP, leader of the opposition party at Westminster, with immediate effect.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Jim Mather, Richard Lochhead, Rob Gibson, Kate Maclean, Ms Sandra White, Mr Adam Ingram, Tricia Marwick, Roseanna Cunningham, Fergus Ewing, Alex Neil, Brian Adam, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Michael Matheson, Christine Grahame, Fiona Hyslop, Tommy Sheridan, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1028</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Protection of Aucheninnes Moss</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that Aucheninnes Moss in Dumfries and Galloway is one of the few examples of active raised bog habitat that survives in the lowlands and as such has significant conservation value at local, regional and even international level; is concerned about the decision to destroy the habitat at Aucheninnes Moss and replace it with a landfill site; is further concerned that this action threatens the extinction of two species of insect in Scotland, the bog bush-cricket <em>(Metrioptera brachyptera) </em>and the Sorrel pygmy moth (<em>Enteucha acetosae</em>) and that it will also destroy a population of the endangered large heath butterfly (<em>Coenonympha tullia</em>) and a foraging area for vulnerable nightjars (<em>Caprimulgus europaeus</em>); welcomes the report by Buglife, The Invertebrate Conservation Trust<em>, </em>showing that Aucheninnes Moss fits the EU Habitats Directive category of an &quot;active raised bog&quot; habitat and also the category &quot;degraded raised bog capable of regeneration&quot;, and, therefore, calls on the Scottish Executive to request that Scottish Natural Heritage afford Aucheninnes Moss protection by designating it a Special Area of Conservation.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1014</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Trolley Waits</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the increased trolley waits in certain Glasgow hospitals which resulted in a significant number of patients sleeping overnight on trolleys in Accident and Emergency units; further deplores the fact that severity of pressure on certain hospitals has resulted in them being regularly forced to divert GP referrals and 999 ambulances to other hospitals; considers that this places NHS trusts in an impossible position, and further considers that the failure of the Scottish Executive to engage with trusts to adequately resource acute receiving facilities will result in further deterioration in standards of patient care, clinical safety and staff morale.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Eleanor Scott, Rob Gibson, Mr John Swinney, Patrick Harvie, Carolyn Leckie, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Ms Sandra White, Murray Tosh, Christine Grahame, Frances Curran, Mr David Davidson, Bill Aitken, Michael Matheson, Tommy Sheridan, Dennis Canavan</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1013</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Threat to Call Centre Jobs in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes the proposed closure of the long-established British Airways Glasgow call centre announced on 17 February 2004, which puts 400 Contact BA jobs<strong> </strong>under threat; believes that this is only the latest in a string of threatened closures affecting Scotland's 56,000 call centre jobs; expresses grave concern over the outflow of both jobs and investment from Scotland, as identified in the Scottish Economic Policy Network report, <em>Call Centres in Scotland and Outsourced Competition from India, </em>and welcomes the commissioning of an analysis by Scottish Enterprise of threats to the call centre industry sector.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1011#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Enhancing Communities through Opposing Discrimination</strong>-That the Parliament notes the negative effects of segregated housing in preventing community unity and in diminishing the quality of life for everyone concerned and believes that the Scottish Executive should oppose all measures aimed at segregating housing in Scotland according to race, social status or occupation; expresses its concern that such measures might, whilst not being explicitly discriminatory, have discriminatory outcomes, excluding groups according to race, social status or occupation, and further believes that the Executive should promote all measures to enhance liveability and beneficial interaction throughout Scotland's communities.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Chris Ballance, Eleanor Scott, Dr Jean Turner, Shiona Baird, Patrick Harvie, Carolyn Leckie, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Tommy Sheridan, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong></P>

          <P>Supported by: Murray Tosh, Mrs Nanette Milne, Mr David Davidson, Alex Fergusson, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Mary Scanlon, Mr Jamie Stone, Dr Jean Turner, Mr Brian Monteith</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1009</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>National Science Week 12 to 21 March 2004</strong>-That the Parliament notes that National Science Week takes place between 12 and 21 March 2004; notes that the aims of National Science Week are to celebrate science and its importance to our lives; welcomes the opportunity it gives people from across Scotland to participate in science activities and experiments and to engage in science discussions; congratulates the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BA) for co-ordinating National Science Week which last year attracted hundreds of thousands of people across the UK, and encourages its members to visit the BA website www.the-ba.net/nsw and join in activities in their constituency or region.</P>

          <P>Supported by: Murray Tosh, Eleanor Scott, Mr David Davidson, David Mundell, Chris Ballance, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Alex Fergusson, Mr Kenneth Macintosh, Elaine Smith, Mr John Swinney, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Mary Scanlon, Shiona Baird, Shona Robison, Ms Sandra White, Richard Lochhead, Tommy Sheridan, Dr Jean Turner, Mr Brian Monteith, Phil Gallie<strong>*</strong>, Karen Gillon<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1006</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Erskine Bridge Tolls</strong>-That the Parliament notes with grave disappointment the statement by Trish Godman MSP on 4 March 2004 in the Parliament that she has opposed tolls on the Erskine Bridge since &quot;day one&quot; when it considers that the<em> Official Report, </em>on 6 September 2001, clearly shows that this is not so; believes that Trish Godman MSP has failed in her role of upholding the aspirations of wisdom, justice, compassion and integrity of the Scottish people for their members of the Parliament, and considers that she should set the record straight by acknowledging that in the last session of the Parliament she supported tolls and voted in favour of them.</P>
