<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4988</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>School Buildings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the Scottish Futures Trust has yet to fund a single new school building in Scotland despite the 2009 Scottish Estates Statistics revealing that around 150,000 pupils remain in schools classified as being in poor or bad condition; is dismayed that, after more than two years, the SNP government has identified only 14 schools to be built under its first school building programme, that none of these 14 schools will be open to pupils in this parliamentary term and only 55 will be built in total by 2018; further believes that the SNP government&rsquo;s claims on the number of schools that it has commissioned are unsustainable given that its own School Estates Statistics reveal that a majority of schools built or substantially refurbished in the last two financial years were legacy PPP projects, and further believes that it is hypocritical for ministers to criticise PPP schools while praising them at their official opening and that the SNP&rsquo;s record in government is falling far short of its 2007 election manifesto pledge to &quot;match the current school building programme brick for brick, and offer an alternative funding mechanism through the Scottish Futures Trust&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4987</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Civil Justice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the <em>Report of the Scottish Civil Courts Review</em> conducted under the chairmanship of the Lord Justice Clerk and the reports of the Administrative Justice Steering Group conducted under the chairmanship of Lord Philip; looks forward to the report of final appellate jurisdiction in preparation by Professor Neil Walker, and believes that the people of Scotland deserve a reformed and modernised civil justice system that is fit for purpose in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4986&diams;</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Conduct of Inquiries into Fatalities at Level Crossings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the continuing loss of life at railway level crossings, most recently at Halkirk in Caithness and, in January 2009, at Gatehead in Kilmarnock and Loudoun; notes the large number of organisations involved in the investigation of rail accidents and incidents in Scotland, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, the British Transport Police, Scotland&rsquo;s eight police forces and the Office of Rail Regulation, and considers that, following the Review of Fatal Accident Inquiry Legislation being conducted by Lord Cullen, a modernised system of fatal accident inquiries can contribute to greater coordination and scrutiny of any inquiries, including the implementation of any recommendations, by whichever agency, following such tragic incidents.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4985</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Volunteering</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and celebrates the role of the voluntary sector and volunteers across Scotland in supporting individuals, families and communities and in shaping and delivering services locally; notes the excellent work of volunteering organisations in encouraging volunteering through offering training and volunteering placements and particularly in reaching out to those who might not otherwise have the chance to volunteer; agrees, given the opportunity that volunteering provides to develop skills and build confidence, that, in this economic recession, volunteering organisations should be given adequate resources to allow them to do that important work, and further agrees that innovative organisations that create structured volunteering placements for young people, such as ProjectScotland, should be recognised and supported by the Scottish Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4984#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Happy Birthday Citizens Advice Bureaux</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Citizens Advice service on its 70th anniversary; commends the vital work that Scotland&rsquo;s 83 Citizens Advice Bureaux, 222 service points, staff and over 2,000 volunteers carry out in providing free, impartial and confidential advice to all; considers that such good quality advice on issues such as benefits, debt, employment, housing and consumer affairs is increasingly necessary in today&rsquo;s society and that bureaux are often the first point of contact for people worried about these problems; recognises the need for bureaux in communities across the country, including Drumchapel where the bureau last year obtained benefits and debt related financial gains of nearly &pound;3.5 million for its clients thanks to the hard work and dedication of its staff and volunteers; acknowledges that the use of client evidence allows Citizens Advice Bureaux and Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) to speak with authority and relevance on changing social issues from both a local and national perspective, such as the recent <em>Drowning in Debt</em> report; thanks the departing chair of CAS, the Rev Graham Blount, for his contribution over the duration of his term in office, and wishes all of Scotland&rsquo;s bureaux continued success in the years to come.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4978</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Human Development Report 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the United Nations <em>Human Development Report 2009</em>; further notes that Norway is ranked first in the human development index rankings and that its consistently high performance in the index and its desirable living standards have been attributed, in large part, to its wise use of the revenues generated by its natural gas and oil deposits; notes that Iceland and Ireland also feature in the top 10, with Denmark and Finland in the top 20, and that all these countries are identified in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s National Conversation document as being part of the arc of prosperity; notes also that the United Kingdom is ranked twenty-first; recognises that, even though the figures were compiled in 2007, before the economic downturn, the human development index does not simply take economic factors into account but also social indicators including life expectancy and poverty levels, which means that these countries can expect to maintain relatively high rankings in future publications of the index, and looks forward to the day when Scotland takes its place among the countries of the United Nations, has the normal powers of the 182 other countries featured in the index and can work towards achieving the best possible ranking in the index and quality of life for people in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4977</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>UN Human Development Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the United Nations <em>Human Development Report 2009</em>, which aims to measure a country&rsquo;s success in terms of creating an environment in which people can develop their full potential and lead productive, creative lives in accordance with their needs and interests rather than simply a narrower measurement of its wealth; further notes that Norway was ranked as the best place in the world to live; considers that this was due greatly to the discovery of offshore gas and oil in the late 1960s and the subsequent establishment of the Norwegian oil fund, and believes that these results add further weight to the argument for the establishment of a Scottish oil fund.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4976</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Reclaiming Wyndford Pitches for Community Sport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the work of the Glasgow-based After School Activities Programme (ASAP), a voluntary organisation that runs after-school sports programmes, including football, tennis and basketball; acknowledges the efforts of ASAP to entice those young people least likely to be involved in physical exercise to engage with its programme; praises ASAP for its attempts to bring sports pitches in poor condition back into use, including the successful repair of tennis courts in Milton in 2006; supports ASAP&rsquo;s attempts to repair disused blaes pitches in Wyndford for community sport activities; considers that the Wyndford area has a poor range of community facilities and has suffered due to recent school closures, and calls on Glasgow City Council to support ASAP in bringing the blaes pitches back to life.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4975</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Breaking Down Barriers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Community trade union&rsquo;s Breaking Down Barriers campaign, which highlights the need for employment opportunities for everyone in Scotland; fully supports the call for a dedicated champion for disabled workers who will ensure that officials involved in public procurement effectively use Article 19 of the EU public sector procurement directive to encourage contracts to be awarded to sheltered workshops; recognises the important role that supported factories and businesses play in getting disabled people into the labour market, and looks forward to increased protection of this vital aspect of employment and training opportunities in Scotland.</p>
