    acknowledges that many people in their middle years are keen to be usefully and fairly
    employed but are deprived of the opportunity; welcomes the New Deal for 50 plus and
    acknowledges that such measures have not had time to yield substantial results, and calls
    upon the Scottish Executive and other major employers to put more resources into the

    combat chronic ageism and insidious discrimination.</p>

    order to stress its willingness to find constructive solutions to save the 540 threatened
    jobs at Newbridge; notes that the Newbridge community is still reeling from the recent
    closure of the Continental Tyre Factory, and believes that co-ordinated action is
    necessary to put in place support services for the employees of Grampian Country Foods and
    the wider Newbridge community and ensure the availability of maximum assistance in finding
    alternative employment opportunities. </p>
