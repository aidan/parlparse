    <p align="left"><font FACE="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1073</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety: Political
    Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament endorses the
    principle of replacing section 93 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 with a
    provision placing a duty on broadcasters to draw up a code of practice as respects the
    involvement of candidates in broadcasts pending an election, and agrees that provision to
    this end in the case of local government elections in Scotland should be considered by the
    United Kingdom Parliament as part of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums
    Bill.</font></p>
    <font FACE="Arial"><p align="left"><strong>*S1M-1072</strong> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell: Government
    Resources and Accounts Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament endorses the principle of the
    creation of Partnerships UK; agrees that the Scottish Ministers should have the power to
    take a financial interest in that body to ensure that Scottish interests are safeguarded,
    and agrees that the relevant provisions in the Government Resources and Accounts Bill
    should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>*S1M-1071</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Holding Local Authority Elections in
    2002</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure that the
    next local authority elections proceed as planned in 2002, separate from the Scottish
    Parliament elections in 2003 and in line with the recommendations of the McIntosh
    Commission and the Kerley Committee; believes that this would help to ensure that local
    issues are properly aired and debated and would clarify the alternatives open to electors
    for a level of government that is responsible for a wide range of services and for
    spending hundreds of millions of pounds of public money, and further believes that such
    debate would be almost impossible to achieve if a combined Holyrood and council poll was
    held.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>*S1M-1070</strong> <strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: Bright Sparks</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament offers its congratulations to the Bathgate Academy young enterprise company
    &quot;Brightsparks&quot; on its success in the Scottish National Young Enterprise Scheme
    and wishes this team further success as the Scottish representatives in the UK finals of
    the competition.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>*S1M-1069</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Criminal Injuries Compensation</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament believes that it is manifestly unjust that victims of sexual abuse are
    denied compensation under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board scheme purely because
    that abuse occurred before 1979 and the abuse was committed by a member of the
    victim&#146;s family; believes that this distinction is arbitrary and that those victims
    of such sexual abuse, including Susan Stuart and Jake Strachan, should receive fair
    compensation, and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her
    Majesty&#146;s Government for the award of such compensation to be made on an ex-gratia
    basis.</p>
    <p align="left">Supported by: Nick Johnston<strong>*</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>*S1M-1068</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Scottish Consumer Representation for Gas
    and Electricity Markets</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the exodus of decision-making
    power with regard to consumer representation for gas and electricity markets from Scotland
    to the south of England as a result of the Utilities Bill; further notes that whilst one
    Scottish office will remain open, staff and responsibilities will inevitably be reduced;
    expresses its concern that the quality of representation may suffer; further expresses its
    concern that this change will also deprive Scotland of existing jobs, and requests that
    the Scottish Executive reconsider its position and make representations to Her
    Majesty&#146;s Government opposing the proposal in the Utilities Bill that the existing
    area electricity consumer committee be abolished and replaced with a single Gas and
    Electricity Consumer Council for the whole of the UK.</p>
