            out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;that Councillor 
            Frank Ellis has declared an interest in three contracts awarded to 
            J &amp; G Construction, in reports 1271/99, 1272/99 and 1280/99 and, 
            in fact, did not participate in three other contracts awarded to that 
            company on a lowest tender basis; is aware that, of 16 tenders submitted 
            to the council’s Housing Committee by this firm, only seven were successful; 
            understands that the only occasion a contract was awarded to J &amp; 
            G Construction without Councillor Ellis declaring an interest was 
            on 6 April 1999; is aware that the contract was awarded to that company 
            as the next lowest tenderer after the original contractors went into 
            liquidation and following an amended tendering procedure ensuring 
            best value for the council; accepts that Councillor Ellis has no pecuniary 
            interests in J &amp; G Construction; recognises that his non-declaration 
            was an oversight for which he has apologised to Angus Council, and 
            deplores any attempts to waste Scottish Executive time and money on 
            unnecessary inquiries and to slur the good name of an excellent local 
            Councillor.</a> </font></p>
