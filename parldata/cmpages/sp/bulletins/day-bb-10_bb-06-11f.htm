<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6552</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Fife Council Parks Staff</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Fife Council parks staff on creating the award-winning display at the Gardening Scotland show; notes that the team has won the gold medal and the Best New Floral Exhibitor and Sunday Post People&rsquo;s Choice awards; recognises that the display promotes Fife&rsquo;s outstanding parks and award-winning beaches as well as highlighting 150 years of the Open Golf Championship, which will be held in St Andrews in July this year; further recognises that the design and build of the display involved Fife Council apprentices, providing a valuable training experience that will benefit Fife in the future, and acknowledges that this display is a key event in Celebrating Fife 2010, showcasing Fife&rsquo;s unique environment, cultural identity and lifestyle activities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6551&#117; </strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>What Cost Afghanistan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the call by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for a public debate on Westminster expenditure and believes that the withdrawal of British forces from Afghanistan would provide a substantial saving, considering the war there wasteful both financially and in terms of lives lost and blighted, for example to military personnel and their families in Glasgow and other cities and towns throughout Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6550</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Success for Marcus Crawford Guy and the Dance School of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Marcus Crawford Guy of Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, and the Dance School of Scotland for Marcus&rsquo;s fantastic achievement in gaining a scholarship to the prestigious Juilliard School of performing arts in New York; notes that Marcus was one of only 18 students to make the final cut out of hundreds of applicants from all over America and the rest of the world; further notes that former pupils of the hugely successful school include Kevin Spacey and Robin Williams; recognises that Marcus is an example of the talent that passes through the Dance School of Scotland, which is a national centre of excellence providing students with specialist teaching to help them realise their ambitions, and wishes Marcus the best of luck as he attempts to raise the &pound;20,000 needed to fund his scholarship and move to New York to attend the Juilliard School.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6549</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Campaign to Defend Public Sector Jobs and Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the creation of the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Campaign to Defend Public Sector Jobs and Services by the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Trades Council; notes that the Conservative/Liberal Democrat government at Westminster has proposed significant cuts to UK expenditure, leading to concerns about the future of public sector workers in the employ of the UK Government and an expectation that these cuts will lead to a substantial reduction to the Scottish budget; supports the efforts of the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Campaign to Defend Public Sector Jobs and Services to raise awareness of these concerns; calls on the UK Government to follow the example of the Scottish Government and institute a policy of no compulsory redundancies; believes that, if the UK Government is so concerned about public finances, it should commit to not renewing the Trident nuclear weapons system, which, it is estimated, will cost the public purse up to &pound;100 billion, and further believes that, the UK Government&rsquo;s commitment to putting public finances in order would be better demonstrated by working to collect the billions of uncollected taxes estimated by the Public and Commercial Services Union.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6548</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Fair Trade in the Highlands and Islands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the visit of Mr Raymond Kimaro of the Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union to Scotland to conduct a tour of the Highlands and Islands promoting fair trade; notes that Mr Kimaro is a world authority in the fair trade movement, having been Chairman of Caf&eacute; Direct and Africa Representative to the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation; welcomes his recent visit to address the Parliament&rsquo;s Cross-Party Group on Fair Trade; looks forward to his visits to Oban, Iona, Skye, Wick, Thurso and Orkney before attending the first Scottish local authority fair trade conference and Scottish Fair Trade Forum AGM in Inverness; believes that fair trade products are a vital tool in eradicating global poverty and promoting a fair and just global trading system by ensuring that producers earn a fair wage, that production methods protect the environment, that child labour is not used and that female producers are treated equally; notes that in the United Kingdom sales of fair trade-branded goods in 2009 grew by 14% to &pound;800 million, demonstrating the public support for this worthwhile movement, and calls on all public bodies in the Highlands and Islands and throughout Scotland to play their part by switching to fair trade products as soon as is practical.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6547</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Diana Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all of the winners at the 2010 Diana Awards, which recognise and support young people who have made an outstanding and selfless contribution to their communities and have inspired the lives of others; welcomes in particular the awards to James Keane from Clyde Valley High School and the Peer Tutors from Coltness High School, both in North Lanarkshire, and notes the exceptional commitment and enthusiasm that they have shown in their schools.</p>
<p>Supported by: Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-6546</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>St Brendan&rsquo;s Primary School, Eco-schools Status</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Brendan&rsquo;s Primary School, Motherwell, on the award of its fourth and final Eco-school&rsquo;s flag and its achievement of permanent Eco-school status; notes that St Brendan&rsquo;s has made a commitment to continually improve its environmental performance and has raised awareness of environmental and sustainable development issues through activities linked to curricular areas, and wishes the members of the school community well in these aims.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6545</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Citizens Advice Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the ongoing and vital work carried out by Citizens Advice Scotland, which has provided impartial and expert advice on a variety of subject matters for over 70 years; considers that the work of the Citizens Advice Bureau is perhaps more important than ever before as a large number of people seek information and help regarding financial matters including handling debts, tax returns, benefit claims and repossessions during this time of economic difficulty; acknowledges that approximately 80% of Citizens Advice staff are volunteers who would cost over &pound;6 million every year if they were to receive a wage, and recognises that clients and members of the public view the Citizens Advice Bureau as an excellent service, with 98% saying that they trusted the service and 97% praising the service for helping people get fair treatment.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6544</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Scottish Hockey Threat to Island Teams</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the proposal to be put to the Scottish Hockey Union AGM scheduled for 12 June 2010 that would impose a rule on all National League matches requiring them to be played on the Scottish mainland unless both teams agree otherwise; believes that such a move would discriminate against island-based teams that already take on and accept the need to travel off their islands for 50% of their games; considers that such a rule would undermine the credibility of the Scottish Hockey Union as a national organisation in receipt of national funding, and urges the Scottish Hockey Union to reject the proposal and commit itself to being a genuine Scottish body, treating all players and teams the same, regardless of where in Scotland they are based.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6543</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Lib Dems Nuclear Self-destruction</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses disappointment at the decision by the Liberal Democrat Party to vote against an amendment to the strategic defence and security review, which would have seen the Trident nuclear weapons system included in it; notes that <em>The Coalition: our programme for government </em>published by the UK Government explicitly stated that &quot;the renewal of Trident should be scrutinised to ensure value for money&quot; and that &quot;the Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case for alternatives&quot;; further notes that the Scottish Parliament voted against a replacement for Trident, and believes that any meaningful debate on the future of defence needs and expenditure should include a review of the need for the Trident nuclear weapons system.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6542</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>25th Anniversary of the Scottish Cot Death Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament puts on record its thanks to the Scottish Cot Death Trust for the work that it has carried out over the past 25 years in supporting families who have lost babies to sudden infant death syndrome (cot death); notes that, despite the reduction in cot deaths in the 25 years since the trust&rsquo;s formation, 1,510 babies have died in Scotland from cot death and that Scotland continues to lose one baby every nine days to it; wishes to pay tribute to the trust on its 25th anniversary, and acknowledges the reduction of cot deaths brought about by the trust&rsquo;s effective work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6541</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Borders Common Ridings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the cultural and historic importance of the 11 common ridings and festivals across the Scottish Borders, including those at Hawick, Jedburgh, Selkirk, Yetholm, Kelso, Duns and Coldstream; notes both the rich traditions of these events, dating back to the 16th century and also their modern-day value in bringing communities together; further congratulates this year&rsquo;s principals on their appointment, and wishes organisers and participants every success and enjoyment during the festivities of 2010.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6540</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Achieving Smoke-free Mental Health Services in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that action should be taken to bring NHS mental health facilities into line with other NHS premises concerning smoking in the grounds; believes that the no smoking policy on NHS premises sends out a positive lifestyle message and helps protect patients, staff and visitors from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke; agrees that mental health facilities should also adopt such a policy, considering that they are currently exempt from doing so; notes with concern that smoking rates are higher among people with mental health issues in comparison with the general population; acknowledges that people with mental health issues are more likely to smoke heavily, and recognises that recent trials have proven that such policies have been introduced successfully with little or no negative impact and that fears over patient behaviour and increased aggression were not justified.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6539</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Welfare Reform and Means-testing of DLA</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has stated in his speech, <em>Welfare for the 21st Century,</em> that &quot;&hellip; for some people, the move from welfare into work means they face losing more than 95 pence for every additional &pound;1 they earn. As a result, the poor are in effect being taxed at an effective rate that far exceeds the wealthy.&quot;; is of the firm opinion that, while welcoming any reduction in taxation or benefit withdrawal rate on poor people, it should not be funded by a reduction in other benefits; believes in particular that Disability Living Allowance (DLA) should not be made means-tested, as was suggested in the paper, <em>Dynamic Benefits</em>, in its proposal for a Universal Life Credit, which &quot;would be a simple means-tested benefit that provides additional income to those on low or no earnings. It would replace Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit, Child Tax Credit and Disability Living Allowance&quot;, and is of the view that DLA is a benefit that all people who meet the relevant disability criteria should be allowed to continue receiving.</p>
