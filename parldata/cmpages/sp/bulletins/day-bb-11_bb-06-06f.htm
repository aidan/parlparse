<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section </a>the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any questions in relation to this section should be directed to the Chamber Desk, for which contact details are provided at the<a href="#end"> end of the Bulletin</a>.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00213 Elaine Smith: Southern Cross</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by reports that Southern Cross Healthcare is facing the possibility of entering administration; notes that Southern Cross is Scotland&rsquo;s largest private sector care home provider and runs Carnbroe care home in Coatbridge; considers this to be a symptom of allowing private companies to run vital public services, and calls on the Scottish Government to provide an effective contingency plan to ensure that no older person is allowed to suffer as a result.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00212 Elaine Smith: Glenboig Neighbourhood House</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glenboig Neighbourhood House on being shortlisted to go forward to the public vote as part of the Jubilee People&rsquo;s Millions; notes that, if funding is received, the NeighbourWood project aims to introduce families to the benefits and pleasure of back-to-basic play, exploration and discovery in the natural environment of local woodlands through weekly guided sessions; understands that the project would benefit around 120 people from the Glenboig area; congratulates Theresa Aitken and all the team at Glenboig Neighbourhood House, and wishes them every success for the public vote.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00211 Gil Paterson: Congratulations to Focus Scotland: The Magazine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of celebrating volunteering and congratulates <em>Focus Scotland: The Magazine</em> for its work in raising awareness of the worth of volunteering to individuals, stakeholders and parliamentarians during the European Year of Volunteering 2011 by developing and promoting innovative and cost-effective marketing of volunteering across all the communities of Scotland, notably the A Volunteering Journey and Volunteer Week Star Appeal campaigns, which have promoted the values of volunteering, community action and individual responsibility; applauds what it sees as the tremendous contribution of enthusiasm and commitment from both staff and volunteers, and hopes that this publication will continue to raise awareness of volunteering and active citizenship across Scotland during the European Year of Volunteering 2011 and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00153 Jackie Baillie: Finding Employment in West Dunbartonshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the recent report by the TUC indicating that West Dunbartonshire has the lowest success rate in the United Kingdom for finding employment; notes that the TUC looked at the proportion of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JSA) claimants to Jobcentre Plus vacancies in every local authority and that West Dunbartonshire came out worst with over 40 JSA claimants chasing every vacancy; understands that, when a similar survey was carried out in 2005, West Dunbartonshire was ranked 38th; considers that thisshows a marked decline in employment opportunities in the area; expresses further concern at the news that the Department of Work and Pensions has announced that it is closing its Clydebank call centre with the loss of 130 jobs; believes that this will further damage employment prospects in West Dunbartonshire; calls on the Department of Work and Pensions to reverse its decision, and urges the Scottish Government to take urgent action to address what it sees as the growing problem of unemployment in West Dunbartonshire.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00148 Patrick Harvie: Supporting Jubilee Scotland&rsquo;s Call for Debt Arbitration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern what it considers to be the current lack of adequate mechanisms for addressing crisis cases of sovereign debt; supports Jubilee Scotland&rsquo;s belief that arbitration should be encouraged as an effective method for resolving sovereign debt disputes and that, in particular, it should be promoted as a means of settling cases of unjust or unpayable poor country debt; is of the view that, under the Arbitration (Scotland) Act 2010, Scotland possesses a modern and robust framework in which parties can seek arbitration; believes that this framework can be applied to discussions of sovereign debt just as it can to commercial and consumer disputes, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government and Scotland&rsquo;s legal community to promote Scotland internationally as a seat of arbitration in such cases.</p>
