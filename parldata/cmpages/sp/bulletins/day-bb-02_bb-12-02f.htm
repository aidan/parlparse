Maclean: Race Equality Training</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the 
need to obtain race equality training for all its members to ensure that members 
can lead by example at a time when public sector authorities are subject to new 
statutory duties to promote race equality; considers that the Scottish Parliamentary 
Corporate Body should provide such training, and considers that the leadership

<STRONG>*S1M-3662#</STRONG> <STRONG>Helen Eadie: European Union Year for Disabled 
People</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 2003 will be the EU Year For 
Disabled People; recognises the challenges that lie ahead in tackling the major 
social and practical barriers that continue to confront people who have a disability, 
and considers that companies, voluntary organisations, non-departmental public 
bodies and the Scottish Executive should adopt mandatory criteria to ensure that 
projects supported by grants, charitable donations or other means are designed 
to remove barriers that prevent people with a disability from playing a full part 
in society. </P><P>Supported by: Rhoda Grant<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3661</STRONG>

Michael Matheson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3658#</STRONG> <STRONG>Cathie 
Craigie: Creating Linguistic Access for Deaf and Deafblind People</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Association of Sign Language 
Interpreters Training Strategy Group' s report, <em>Creating Linguistic Access 
for Deaf and Deafblind People: A Strategy for Scotland</em>; notes the report&#146;s 
findings that deaf people are currently excluded from many aspects of everyday 
life in Scotland because of a lack of linguistic access and that the chief barriers 
to inclusion are (a) a lack of personnel with appropriate linguistic skills including 
a lack of British Sign Language/English Interpreters, tutors of British Sign Language 
and lipspeakers, (b) a lack of resources and materials, and (c) the lack of awareness 
and understanding of the relevant linguistic issues among employers, service providers 
and local and national government personnel; further notes the recommendation 
of the report that, to bring about change, a long-term integrated strategy is 
needed with collaboration between the statutory and voluntary sector, and considers 
that the Scottish Executive should work with key deaf organisations to establish 
a Scottish Centre for Deaf Studies.</P><P>Supported by: Kate Maclean<STRONG>*</STRONG>,

Pledge, which states "I believe trade should work in the interests of all people. 
I promise to act with others to change the rules that govern international trade 
so that they work to eradicate poverty, protect the environment and ensure equal 
access to life in all its fullness" as a way of pressing for a major review of 
international trade rules in order to reduce world poverty.</P><P>Supported by:

<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Firefighters' Strike</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
*believes that* the Scottish Executive *should* respond to the initiative by the 
General Secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress calling for a Scottish 
lead to end the firefighters&#146; dispute and *that it* should declare that it 
will make the money available to settle the dispute and discuss with the Fire 
Brigades Union how best to improve the fire service and protect both the people 
of Scotland and the firefighters&#146; jobs. </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3654</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Ms Sandra White: Victim Support Glasgow</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
congratulates Victim Support Glasgow on the launch of its new premises in Saltmarket 
and commends the tremendous work carried out by the hard-working and dedicated 
staff there in supporting the victims of crime; notes, however, the challenges 
faced by Victim Support in terms of funding, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that Victim Support has the required 
level of funding to enable it to continue its excellent work.</P><P>Supported

World Aids Day 2002</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges that 1 December 
2002 is World Aids Day; notes the significance of this year&#146;s theme, &quot;Live 
and Let Live&quot;; recognises that the global pandemic of HIV/AIDS is now in 
excess of 42 million people infected with the virus, with countless further millions 
affected; further notes that women account for half of those infected with HIV; 
congratulates and applauds all of the agencies that work with those living with 
HIV/AIDS in Scotland, the UK and worldwide, and encourages each MSP to continue 
to raise awareness about the disease and work towards its global eradication.

<STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: Local Government in Scotland Bill - Stage 3</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament agrees that the Local Government in Scotland Bill be passed. </P><P>Supported 
by: Peter Peacock</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3651#</STRONG> <STRONG>Irene McGugan: Child 
Protection</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the opportunities afforded 
by <em>It's everyone's job to make sure I'm alright -</em> <em>Report of the Child 
Protection Audit and Review</em> to tackle the problems in child protection; further 
welcomes the recommendations of the review, which offers substantial evidence 
that there is good and effective work being carried out by a number of agencies; 
regrets that, rather than acknowledge the positives and invest in initiatives 
to promote consistent good practice across the country, the First Minister has 
chosen to deride and threaten workers in front-line child protection, while having 
done little in his administration to resource or support such workers; considers 
that these remarks will only undermine and damage the Scottish Executive's Care 
in Scotland campaign to attract people into the social care sector and serve to 
further demoralise those trying to protect children in increasingly difficult 
circumstances; notes that the report maintains that, although social workers play 
the most instrumental role in child protection, the level of vacancies in childcare 
teams remains a critical issue, a situation that is not being addressed with the 
urgency it merits and will not begin to be alleviated until at least 2008, when 
the first graduates will have completed the new training course, and believes 
that the Executive should take responsibility for this unacceptable situation, 
introduce measures to tackle recruitment and retention of front-line staff as 
a matter of priority and, as a further practical step, move as soon as possible 
towards placing child protection committees on a statutory footing, with adequate 
resources and an increased status and thereby contribute meaningfully and positively 
to child protection.</P><P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>S1M-3647#</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Jamie Stone: Wick Ambulance Service</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament recognises the vital work of the Wick ambulance service; is concerned 
at the lack of additional funding that was made available to the Highlands from 
the £22 million the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) received for modernisation; 
notes the long on-call working regime that means ambulance crews are often on 
duty for as much as 20 hours at a time and are routinely required to make long 
journeys of over 200 miles; is further concerned that crews suffer from sleep 
deprivation, possibly endangering themselves, their passengers and other road 
users, and asks the Scottish Executive and the SAS to urgently review the on-call 
working arrangements at Wick Ambulance Station, where staff are paid less than 
90p per hour for being on-call, with a view to upgrading it from part-time on-call 
to full-time. </P><P>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3646</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: Fife Country Dance Festival 2002</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament extends its best wishes to the organisers and participants in the 
2002 Fife Schools Country Dance Festival, the largest festival of its kind in 
Britain, which is being held across the Kingdom between 20 and 29 November 2002 
involving over 12,000 primary and special education pupils.</P><P>Supported by: 
Iain Smith, Mr Keith Harding, Donald Gorrie<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3642</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Firefighters' Strike</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
unreservedly condemns the Deputy Minister for Justice, Dr Richard Simpson MSP, 
for his remarks in relation to the firefighters&#146; dispute; believes that for 
a Minister in charge of the fire service to use the words, in relation to the 
firefighters&#146; dispute, &quot;fascists &#133; who would follow Mussolini&quot; 
is a disgrace and can only influence the current industrial dispute; calls on 
the Minister to apologise unreservedly to the firefighters and the trade union 
movement, and also believes he can no longer be in charge of the fire service 
in Scotland and should resign or be sacked by the First Minister.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3640</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Des McNulty: Finance Committee, Public Private Partnerships</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the 5th report 2002 of the Finance Committee, <em>Public Private 
Partnerships </em>(SP Paper 653), and commends the report&#146;s recommendations 
to the Scottish Executive.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3639#</STRONG> <STRONG>Bill Butler: 
Firefighters' Dispute</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes with deep concern 
the beginning of the second phase of the firefighters&#146; dispute which is due 
to last for eight days; acknowledges the widespread disappointment and frustration 
at the breakdown of talks between the Fire Brigades Union and local authority 
employers on the morning of 22 November 2002, talks which had come so close to 
arriving at a settlement acceptable to both sides; recognises that everyone involved 
remains very anxious, given the risk to the general public&#146;s health and safety, 
to seek an agreement that is acceptable to all sides speedily brokered, and considers 
that the Scottish Executive should make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s 
Government to urge it to do all in its power to help provide the conditions that 
would enable a settlement to be concluded and one which would recognise the aspirations 
of firefighters for professional status and pay.</P><P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>S1M-3638</STRONG> <STRONG>Brian Fitzpatrick: "Crossing Borders", the 38th 
Annual Conference of the Royal Musical Association </STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
applauds the hard work and commitment of all concerned in securing "Crossing Borders", 
the 38th Annual Conference of the Royal Musical Association hosted jointly by 
the University of Glasgow and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, in 
association with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, and to be held in Glasgow 
from 28 November to 1 December 2002; notes that the Royal Musical Association 
was founded in 1874, that the association is the second oldest learned musical 
society in the world and that this is its first annual conference to take place 
in Scotland, and recognises the sterling contribution the Conference might make 
to exploring the boundaries between research and practice, the academy and the 
profession, music and other disciplines with contributions from UK and international 
speakers and musicians and to promoting vigorous topical debate on the arts, live 
music and the best of international scholarship together with supporting world-class 
performances including the opening night of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra&#146;s 
Prokofiev series conducted by Alexander Lazarev and Haydn Trio Eisenstadt making 
their debut UK appearance, together with Lorna Anderson and Jamie MacDougall, 
in a programme marking the first modern publication of Haydn's collected Scottish 
and Welsh airs, edited by Marjorie Rycroft of the University of Glasgow Music 
Department.</P><P>Supported by: Michael Russell, Fergus Ewing, Jackie Baillie,

<STRONG>S1M-3637#</STRONG> <STRONG>Jackie Baillie: Argyll and Clyde NHS Acute 
Hospitals Trust</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the apparent difficulty 
of Argyll and Clyde NHS Acute Hospitals Trust in managing to provide a full range 
of services to meet the needs of the local population; further notes the resignation 
of key health service personnel over the last few months and the failure of management 
to recruit, which has led to instability and uncertainty over the future of service 
provision in the area, particularly at the Vale of Leven District General Hospital; 
recognises and applauds the commitment of front-line staff, doctors, nurses, auxiliaries 
and others, in maintaining excellent standards of health care for people in the 
area; notes the welcome intervention of the Minister for Health and Community 
Care in sending in a support team to consider and act on any management failures, 
and asks the Scottish Executive and Argyll and Clyde NHS Board to act quickly 
on the recommendations made by the support team to restore professional and public 
confidence in the service.</P><P>Supported by: Brian Fitzpatrick, Mr Jamie Stone,

<STRONG>S1M-3636</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Solidarity with Firefighters</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates Labour MSP Cathy Peattie for her solidarity with 
the firefighters and her remarks reported in the <em>Daily Record</em> on 23 November 
2002 that she is ashamed of John Prescott and calls on all MSPs to back the firefighters 
in their week of action to secure their just wage claim.</P><P>Supported by: Dorothy-Grace

Sheridan: Firefighters' Strike</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament condemns remarks 
attributed to a Scottish Executive minister that were reported in <em>Scotland 
on Sunday</em> on 24 November 2002 that &quot;these people aren&#146;t socialists, 
they&#146;re protectionists, they&#146;re fascists&quot; and demands that, if 
these remarks were made, the minister concerned apologises to the firefighters 
and is removed from office or that, if they were not made, the Scottish Executive 
issues an immediate statement condemning <em>Scotland on Sunday</em> for misrepresentation.</P><P>Supported 
by: Dorothy-Grace Elder, Mr Lloyd Quinan<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3634#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Ms Margo MacDonald: European Commission Directive on Food Supplements</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes that millions of people use food supplements and herbal remedies 
in the UK each year; regrets that the European Commission has published a directive 
on food supplements that will firstly reduce the numbers of supplements offered 
and secondly reduce the potency of those which remain, and, whilst noting the 
UK Government&#146;s assurances that such supplements will be treated as favourably 
as possible under UK law, considers that the Scottish Executive should do everything 
within its power to protect the right of consumers to continue to access the full 
range of supplements currently available.</P><P>Supported by: Alex Neil, Mr Lloyd

in <em>Scotland on Sunday </em>on 24 November 2002, that &quot;&#133;these people 
aren&#146;t socialists, they&#146;re protectionists, they&#146;re fascists&#133;&quot;; 
if the comments do not represent the view of the Scottish Executive, calls for

<STRONG>S1M-3508#</STRONG> <STRONG>Fergus Ewing: Osteoporosis</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes that osteoporosis is a major public health problem which 
results in more than 20,000 fractures a year in Scotland, that the cost of osteoporotic 
fractures in the United Kingdom each year is estimated at over £1.7 billion and 
that one third of women and one in 12 men over 50 will suffer an osteoporotic 
fracture; further notes that with an ageing population profile this problem will 
become even more serious; is aware that osteoporosis is both treatable and largely 
preventable; welcomes the fact that the public and health professionals are becoming 
increasingly aware of osteoporosis as a major health problem but is concerned 
that health service provision throughout Scotland is patchy and that access to 
diagnostic testing and monitoring varies around the country; believes that sufficient 
funding can be made available so that all patients have equal access to services 
for both the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and that all patients suffering 
a fragility fracture or having other risk factors for the disease should be assessed 
for the presence of osteoporosis, and further believes that public health campaigns 
should be promoting the importance of lifestyle factors as influencing bone health 
and preventing osteoporosis. </P><P>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson, Michael Matheson,

<STRONG>Bill Butler: Provision of Dedicated Mother and Baby Services for Women 
with Post-Natal Depression</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament expresses its deep 
concern regarding the lack of proper facilities within the NHS in Scotland that 
would allow women with post-natal depression (PND) to continue to care for their 
children whilst undergoing treatment; recognises that the lack of dedicated mother 
and baby services for women with PND is completely unacceptable; notes the recent 
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network report which detailed the shocking 
lack of appropriate services for women with PND, and considers that the Scottish 
Executive should ensure that NHS boards throughout Scotland take the swiftest 
possible action to remedy the alarming poverty of provision of mother and baby 
units devoted to women suffering from PND. </P><P>Supported by: Irene Oldfather,

have been left with no alternative but to take industrial action; *invites* all 
MSPs and trade unionists to give the Fire Brigades Union their backing, and *believes
