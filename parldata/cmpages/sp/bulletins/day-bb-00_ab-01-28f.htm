    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-474#</b> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Grampian Television</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises the contribution made in the past by Grampian Television to the
    regional identity of the North East of Scotland and to the social cohesion of the diverse
    communities it services; notes the threat posed to the station by the Scottish Media
    Group&#146;s proposals on re-organisation of its regional production department, which
    involve the shedding of jobs and a cut in pay levels; supports the high standard of
    regional broadcasting and the dedicated work of broadcasting professionals whose
    livelihoods are now under threat, and urges the Scottish Executive to state publicly its
    support for regional broadcasting.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Shona Robison*, Ben Wallace*, Mr John McAllion*, Kate Maclean*, Irene McGugan*, Brian Adam*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Nora Radcliffe*, Mr John Munro*,
    Mr Jamie McGrigor*, Mr David Davidson*, Lewis Macdonald*, Fergus Ewing* </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-473</b> <strong>Mike Watson: Budget (Scotland) Bill (Stage 2 order of
    consideration)</strong>&#151;That the Finance Committee considers the Budget (Scotland) Bill at
    Stage 2 in the order in which the provisions arise in the Bill except that each schedule
    be considered immediately after the section that introduces it.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-472</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Water Charges</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with concern the impact of increased water charges on low-income
    households in Scotland; calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring forward a more radical
    plan to protect low-income households which should include a cap on households on income
    support, and agrees that the increase in water and sewerage charges should be no greater
    than the percentage increase in income support.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-471</b> <strong>Fergus Ewing: &quot;Castaway&quot; Documentary</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that the BBC documentary &quot;Castaway&quot; is reported to have
    cost around £2.5 million; believes that this is a misguided commission for the BBC to
    have undertaken and that it has caused considerable offence, not just in the Western
    Isles, and notes that these funds could have been used to produce a documentary series
    presenting positively the lives of people who actually live in the Highlands and who are
    often ignored by television or to ensure that all areas within the Highlands and Islands
    receive proper reception both of existing terrestrial services and developing digital
    ones.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Mr Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-470#</b> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Crichton University Campus</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes and welcomes the excellent initiatives taken by all partners in the
    development of the Crichton University campus in Dumfries, in particular the collaboration
    between educational institutions, and urges the Scottish Executive to investigate this
    campus and this model of delivery as a basis for the development of a University for the
    South of Scotland and to give consideration to utilising the world class information and
    communication facilities available at this site by basing the Scottish University for
    Industry at the Crichton campus.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: David Mundell<strong>*</strong>, Michael Russell<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-469#</b> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Sleep Apnoea</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament recognises that a significant proportion of all road accidents resulting in
    death or serious injury are caused by sleepiness; notes the human misery caused by fatal
    road accidents, which cost an average of £1million each; notes that at least 1% of
    Scotland&#146;s adult population has a medical cause for sleepiness; acknowledges the
    Royal College of Physicians&#146; observation that untreated sleep apnoea sufferers may
    have driving impairments comparable with other drivers over the legal limit of alcohol
    consumption; acknowledges that sleep apnoea is readily treatable with a machine costing
    £300 that lasts 10 years; welcomes the launch of the British Sleep Foundation which aims,
    in conjunction with the Scottish Association for Sleep Apnoea, to increase the public and
    professional understanding of sleep related disorders, to reduce driving accidents and
    other health and safety problems related to insufficient sleep and untreated sleep
    disorders and to advocate public policy change which promotes education, research and the
    NHS treatment, and recommends that the Parliament fully support these aims.</p>
