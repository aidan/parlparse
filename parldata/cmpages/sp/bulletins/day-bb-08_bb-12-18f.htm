<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3137</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Future of BAA Airports in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent confirmation by the Competition Commission that BAA will be required to sell one of its Scottish airports, most likely Edinburgh; considers that the airports that are publicly owned and operated by Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd and the Manchester Airports Group are very successful; believes that there is considerable merit in such a public ownership model being considered for any Scottish airport put up for sale by BAA, and encourages relevant local authorities and other public bodies to examine ways in which such models could be taken forward.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3136</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>The 2008 Homeless World Cup</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scotland&rsquo;s Homeless World Cup squad and <em>The Big Issue</em> on another successful tournament, held this year in Melbourne, Australia, and believes that, although the team did not retain the trophy that it won last year in Denmark, the players and coaches have plenty to be proud of in reaching the semi-final and notching up nine straight victories en route.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3135</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Support Nil by Mouth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that financial support from the Scottish Government to Nil by Mouth, the country&rsquo;s foremost anti-sectarian charity, runs out on 31 March 2009; acknowledges the pivotal role that Nil by Mouth has played in challenging sectarian attitudes and behaviour in Scotland through its campaigns, events and educational workshops, and encourages the Scottish Government to end the uncertainty over the charity&rsquo;s future by making a commitment to continue its funding.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3134</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Oxgang Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Oxgang Primary School in East Dunbartonshire on the occasion of its 40th anniversary; notes that generations of Kirkintilloch children and the Kirkintilloch community have benefited from the work of the school in the last 40 years, and wishes the head teacher, Miss Sweeney, the staff and pupils at Oxgang Primary a happy anniversary.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3133</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow&rsquo;s New Centre of Excellence</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the groundbreaking commitment by the British Heart Foundation Scotland and Marie Curie Cancer Care to invest &pound;3.6 million in a centre of excellence in Glasgow to provide a comprehensive service for advanced heart failure patients and their families; considers that these services will create a gold standard in palliative care for patients in the advanced stages of heart failure and pioneer a model of care for patients in Scotland and across the United Kingdom, and believes that sufferers and their families will benefit greatly from the dignity and peace of mind that this investment will bring.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3132#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Opposition to Parkhead Fire Station Closure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern over the proposals of Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service management to close Parkhead fire station; believes that the communities of  Shettleston, Tollcross, Haghill, Dalmarnock, Riddrie, Carntyne and Mount Vernon, which will now be served by a new station in Cambuslang, will see response times to incidents increasing, which in turn will lead to an increase in the number of fire deaths and injuries; notes that Parkhead fire station covers some of the poorest communities in the United Kingdom and that it has been identified that the main causes of fires are related to social and economic problems, drug and alcohol abuse and areas of poverty and high unemployment, and believes that Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service management&rsquo;s proposals will be detrimental to those communities affected.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3131</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Youth for Old Bike Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its congratulations to the members and facilitators of the Youth for Old Bike Scheme, which was announced as a winner in the Phillip Lawrence Awards, a prestigious national awards scheme that celebrates outstanding contributions made by young people to their community; commends the hard work of the young citizens who help bridge the generation gap by delivering fresh fruit and vegetables by bike to older members of the community; recognises the positive role models that they have provided for their peers, and supports them in their attempts to expand and improve this service.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3130</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Premier League Working Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision to omit Kilmarnock manager Jim Jefferies from the recent Scottish Premier League (SPL) working party; agrees with Jim Jefferies that all 12 SPL club managers should have been present; recognises the considerable contribution to club management of Jim Jefferies, currently the longest-serving manager in the SPL, including winning the First Division championship with Falkirk, claiming the Scottish Cup with Heart of Midlothian and reaching the CIS Insurance Cup final with Kilmarnock as recently as 2007, and calls on the SPL&rsquo;s Executive Chairman to rely on all the experience available to him when considering changes to the SPL.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3129&diams; </strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>&pound;12 Million Third Sector Enterprise Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &pound;12 million Third Sector Enterprise Fund, which is aimed at helping voluntary organisations to increase their turnover and become more sustainable, affording organisations looking to develop social business activities the opportunity to apply for grants of up to &pound;100,000 from January 2009; notes the importance, in the current economic climate, of supporting the third sector, which contributes towards increasing sustainable economic growth in Glasgow and throughout Scotland, and echoes the sentiments of Lucy McTernan, SCVO&rsquo;s acting chief executive, that this fund &quot;will allow organisations across the sector to get the sort of investment they need to develop a more enterprising approach to their activities&quot;.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3128</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Disabled Person&rsquo;s Parking Places (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Disabled Person&rsquo;s Parking Places (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3127</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Keep the &quot;Wee Paper&quot; in Largs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern Clyde and Forth Press&rsquo;s decision&nbsp;to close the office of the <em>Largs and Millport Weekly News</em> in Largs from January 2009, with likely redundancies, and move the remaining staff to a portakabin 14 miles south in Ardrossan; believes that this will greatly diminish the quality and community linkages of an excellent local newspaper that has faithfully served the people of Largs, Cumbrae, Fairlie, Seamill, Skelmorlie and West Kilbride from Largs for 132 years and&nbsp;is known affectionately by readers as the wee paper; acknowledges that many organisations have already expressed their shock at the removal of a newspaper with which they are strongly connected,&nbsp;on the basis of a decision about which they were not consulted; is aware that the <em>Largs and Millport Weekly News</em> is, by all accounts,&nbsp;a profitable newspaper with solid income streams; appreciates the high and loyal level of readership in the area&nbsp;that&nbsp;the wee paper serves and worries that by leaving the heart of Largs it will lose its local focus and&nbsp;readers and ultimately may not remain viable, and therefore calls on Clyde and Forth Press to rescind its decision to abandon Largs, allowing <em>the Largs and Millport Weekly News</em> to flourish in the heart of its circulation area.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3126</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Postal Workers&rsquo; Walk-speed Pressure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is very concerned that postal workers are facing pressure to complete unrealistic delivery routes as a result of the Pegasus software system; believes that some delivery workers are being given delivery rounds that are too long to complete within normal hours; believes also that several postal workers have recently been injured due to treacherous conditions underfoot; notes that the Communication Workers Union (CWU) has an agreement with Royal Mail to review jointly all aspects of Pegasus, but considers that the Royal Mail is pushing ahead with changes without input from the union, leading to high volumes of complaints and a deterioration in industrial relations and service standards, and finally believes that the Royal Mail should reconsider its actions and review this system with the CWU.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3125.1</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Drink Driving</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3125) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;calls&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that the UK Government is currently consulting on road safety and related issues and that this includes an invitation for views on the current drink-driving limit; believes that a UK-wide approach on this issue is sensible; believes that Scottish ministers should engage constructively in the UK Government&rsquo;s consultation process, and believes that drink driving must be combated at all times of the year and that Scottish police forces must be properly resourced to ensure effective enforcement.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3125.1.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Drink Driving</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-3125.1) in the name of Richard Baker, leave out from third &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;further recognises the growing problem of driving under the influence of drugs, and believes that drink and drug driving must be combated at all times of the year and that Scottish police forces must be properly resourced and be in possession of the appropriate technology to ensure effective enforcement.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3084.1</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>School Budget Cuts Must Stop</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3084) in the name of George Foulkes, leave out from &quot;congratulates&quot; to end and insert &quot;; welcomes its submission to the * * consultation&nbsp;on the City of Edinburgh Council budget process; acknowledges the work undertaken by council officers and elected members to consult parents and other stakeholders on changes to the schools funding formula in preparation for setting the 2009-10 budget for the City of Edinburgh Council; notes that the City of Edinburgh Council implemented a 1.5% efficiency saving in 2008-09; considers this efficiency saving&nbsp;to be part of a package of measures to address a &pound;10 million overspend inherited from the previous Labour administration; refutes any proposition that the political administration of the City of Edinburgh Council has proposed a 2% cut in school budgets as being factually inaccurate, and welcomes the work done by the City of Edinburgh Council to ensure a more sustainable financial future for Edinburgh&rsquo;s schools.&quot;</p>
