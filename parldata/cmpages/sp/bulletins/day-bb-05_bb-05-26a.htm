          <p> <strong>S2M-2875 Ms Margaret Curran</strong> <strong>on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau</strong> :<strong> Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill, debate of groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time-limits indicated (each time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when the meeting of the Parliament is suspended or otherwise not in progress):</p>
          <p> Group 1 &ndash; 30 minutes</p>
          
          <p> Group 2 &ndash; 45 minutes.</p>
          
          <p> <em>followed by</em> Scottish National Party Debate: Student and Graduate Debt&mdash;</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2866 Fiona Hyslop: Student and Graduate Debt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern growing student and graduate debt in Scotland, which not only hinders opportunities for the individuals concerned, but also damages society and the wider economy generally; further notes the spiralling cost to the taxpayer of the expensive and bureaucratic student loan system and the growing consensus that it is unsustainable, and calls on the Scottish Executive to come forward with a constructive review, incorporating a number of proposals to address this growing problem and encompassing an assessment of replacing student loans, including the graduate endowment repayment, with a universal system of grants. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-2866.2 Mr Jim Wallace: Student and Graduate Debt</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2866) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &ldquo;notes with concern&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;agrees that the support arrangements for students ordinarily resident in Scotland should continue to be based on fairness and affordability; agrees that such a system should include free tuition, regardless of family income, and bursary support for those from less well-off backgrounds; welcomes the increased level of the Young Students&rsquo; Bursary and its extended eligibility; notes that liable graduates pay the graduate endowment in respect of the higher education benefits that they have received with the payments adding to the fund to pay support bursaries for students from poorer backgrounds, and recognises that the publication of the survey of Scottish students&rsquo; income and expenditure, later this year, will allow for a better understanding of the situation facing students and the continued development of policy to meet their needs.&rdquo; </p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-2866.1 Murdo Fraser: Student and Graduate Debt</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2866) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &ldquo;further&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;calls on the Scottish Executive to end the graduate endowment which places an increased debt burden on students; recommends that the student loan repayment threshold be raised to &pound;20,000 and that the loan value be increased to &pound;5,000 per annum at a low, but commercial, rate of interest, which will remove the necessity for students to resort to expensive overdraft and credit card borrowing, and calls on the Executive to transfer all or part of the loan book to independent providers so that higher education can expand without extra and undue burden being placed on the taxpayer.&rdquo; </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> <em>followed by</em> Scottish National Party Debate: Age Discrimination in the NHS&mdash; </p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2861 Shona Robison: Age Discrimination in the NHS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the lack of personal care and attention given to older people in some acute hospitals in Scotland and believes that the Scottish Executive should establish, as a matter of urgency, an independent inquiry into direct and indirect age discrimination within the NHS. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-2861.3 Mr Andy Kerr: Age Discrimination in the NHS</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2861) in the name of Shona Robison, leave out from &ldquo;is concerned&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;welcomes the work of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland on its 2004 review of older people in acute care and its recommendations on how to improve services; welcomes the independent inquiry set up by NHS Lothian in response to recent criticisms of its standards of care, and welcomes the fact that the Scottish Executive has commenced work on an overarching framework for healthcare and community care for older people in Scotland, having due regard to David Kerr&rsquo;s report on the future of the NHS.&rdquo; </p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-2861.1 Mrs Nanette Milne: Age Discrimination in the NHS</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2861) in the name of Shona Robison, leave out from &ldquo;and believes&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;believes that the Health Committee should consider the issue of elderly abuse in its post-legislative scrutiny of community care legislation; further believes that any neglect of the elderly reflects the current problems and workforce pressures that the NHS suffers from, and recognises that the NHS needs real reform to alleviate these fundamental problems.&rdquo; </p>

          <p> <em>followed by</em> Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
          <p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2770 Richard Lochhead: Proposed Closure of Rural and Special Needs Schools in Aberdeenshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals by Aberdeenshire Council to close or amalgamate a number of local schools; recognises the strength of feeling amongst parents and the wider community over the implications of closing those schools, as illustrated by the formation of the Garioch Schools Action Group and other local campaigns; notes in particular the proposal to close St Andrew&rsquo;s school in Inverurie, a school that is widely recognised as providing an excellent educational environment for children with special needs; recognises the opposition to the current proposals by local parents at St Andrew&rsquo;s who are genuinely concerned by the impact some of the options proposed by Aberdeenshire Council will have on their children; notes the ongoing confusion over the exact nature of the local authority&rsquo;s proposals which is causing considerable distress amongst parents; believes that Aberdeenshire Council must make available to parents all the necessary information in relation to all those schools proposed for closure as part of the current consultation process; considers that Aberdeenshire Council should recognise the strength of the arguments put forward by parents and the wider community for the retention of their local schools, and further considers that the Scottish Executive should play what role it can to ensure that Aberdeenshire Council&rsquo;s proposals do not damage the educational welfare of the children and wider interests of the community. </p>
