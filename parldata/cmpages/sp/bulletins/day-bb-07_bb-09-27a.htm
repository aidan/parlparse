          <p><strong>9.15 am&#9;</strong>Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Liberal Democrats Debate: Waiting Times&mdash;</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>S3M-545</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Waiting Times</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament  is concerned that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach to waiting times will lead to an increase in bureaucracy, placing an administrative burden on clinicians; believes that introducing a legally binding guarantee will put further pressure on health professionals leading to a litigation culture in the NHS; regrets the decision by the SNP to put political dogma before patient need in ruling out the use of the private sector to reduce waiting times; regrets the lack of commitment from the Scottish Government to invest further in primary health care facilities; calls on the Scottish Government to continue making progress in reducing the longest waits, while prioritising shorter waiting times for the most serious conditions; calls on the Scottish Government to make an early statement on how it intends to implement its maximum waiting time guarantee without impacting on those with the greatest clinical need, and believes that the Scottish Government must, as a matter of urgency, publish a comprehensive assessment identifying the additional administrative and bureaucratic burdens that these new proposals will place on the NHS, how much they will cost and where the money will come from. </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S3M-545.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Waiting Times</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-545) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to end and insert &quot;calls on the Scottish Government to build on the progress made by the last administration in reducing waiting times by establishing a new 18-week whole journey waiting time guarantee by 2011 and consulting on a Patients&rsquo; Rights Bill that will ensure a more patient-focussed NHS.&quot; </p>
                <p> <strong>S3M-545.1</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran: Waiting Times</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-545) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to &quot;on clinicians&quot; and insert &quot;calls on the Scottish Government to review the implementation proposals to ensure that the principles of <em>Fair to All, Personal to Each </em>are implemented with the least bureaucracy possible and ensure that the new waiting list system provides the highest quality support, particularly for the most vulnerable in our society&quot;. </p>

          <p><strong>5.00 pm&#9;</strong>Decision Time</p>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
          <p>&#9;Debate on the subject of&mdash; </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>S3M-338</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Warm Zones</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the excellent work of not-for-profit Warm Zones Ltd, set up with UK Government support in 2000 and operated by National Energy Action, the leading fuel poverty charity in England and Wales, working in partnership with local government, energy companies such as Transco and British Gas, European Union agencies and others; is aware that the Warm Zone project encourages a proactive approach to combating fuel poverty by going into communities to assess the energy efficiency and fuel poverty status of all households in an entire area, with a view to co-ordinating the free delivery of necessary energy efficiency improvements and related services; appreciates that the Warm Zone all area approach has been effective in reaching vulnerable households which often do not apply for available fuel benefits or grants; believes that, while so far warm zones have only been set up in England and Wales, Scotland with some 384,000 households, one in six, in fuel poverty can learn from the successes achieved south of the border; appreciates that in Gateshead alone warm zones invested &pound;2 million and warm zone teams visited 26,239 homes, carried out 21,067 assessments, surveyed 13,384 homes, installed energy efficiency measures in 9,996 homes and attracted &pound;400,000 extra in benefits for residents in the year to February 2007, attracting &pound;200,000 in European structural funding for job creation and training while reducing energy usage by an average of 40% and attaining a client satisfaction rating of over 97%, and concludes that an area like North Ayrshire, with an estimated 11,000 of 62,000 households in fuel poverty, would be an excellent place to undertake a warm zone project and ultimately supports the introduction of warm zones across Scotland, believing that discussions should take place between local authorities, Energy Action Scotland, the Scottish Government and other stakeholders about the establishment of warm zones north of the border as part of a concerted and systematic campaign to eradicate fuel poverty once and for all. </p>
