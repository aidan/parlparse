            elections, as recommended in the Kerley Report. </p>
          <dir> 
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following 
              amendment</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-2487.1</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock: Proportional 
              Representation in Local Government Elections</strong>&#151;As an amendment

              &quot;approves&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the Scottish 
              Executive&#146;s continuing commitment to the pledge made in its 
              Programme for Government to make progress on electoral reform, to 
              the principles of renewing local democracy as set out in the Kerley 
              report, including the importance of the member/ward link in local 
              government, to the need to secure general consent and wide support 
              for the system of electing local councils and to producing a timetable

          <p></p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2486</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Transport Group Pension Scheme</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            that both the Scottish Transport Group Staff Pension Fund and the 
            Scottish Transport Group Transport Operatives Pension Scheme have 
            still to be wound up some eight years after privatisation; further 
            notes that the Scottish Executive promised in December 2000 that a 
            total sum of £100 million would be distributed to the pension scheme 
            members and that this would result in a payment of an average of about 
            £7,000 for each member; recognises that the actual total surplus of 
            the pension funds is considerably in excess of £100 million; believes 
            that the level of payment proposed last December by the Scottish Executive 
            is inadequate and should be increased, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to meet representatives of the Scottish Bus Group Pensioners&#146; 
            Action Committee and to make available to them all relevant information 
            to enable them to assist the pensioners in achieving a just settlement.

              Transport Group Pension Scheme</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
              (S1M-2486) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from &quot;both&quot; 
              to end and insert &quot;Scottish Ministers have secured from HM 
              Treasury a substantial pay out for Scottish Transport Group Pension 
              Scheme former members despite the absence of any legal entitlement; 
              further notes that any change to the amount to be distributed to 
              former members is a matter for HM Treasury, and finally notes that 
              the key remaining step is the winding up of the pension schemes, 
              which is a matter for the schemes&#146; trustees.&quot; </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2436</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Digital 
            Hearing Aids and Review of Audiology Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that the Scottish Executive is conducting an audiology services 
            review; recognises that many hard of hearing and profoundly deaf people 
            are still provided with out-dated analogue hearing aids; is aware 
            that new digital hearing aids can improve the quality of life for 
            those who need them; realises that digital hearing aids are not widely 
            available on the NHS in Scotland and are expensive to purchase privately; 
            understands that the cost can be dramatically reduced by a system 
            of bulk-buying; further notes that such a scheme has been introduced 
            into 20 NHS hospitals in England, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should make a commitment to provide digital hearing aids 
            on the NHS in Scotland. </p>
