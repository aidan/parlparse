    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Iain Smith<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-1028</b> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Road Traffic Fine Revenue </strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that over the last three financial years over £23 million has been
    collected by the Scottish Courts in fines for traffic offences; further notes that this
    money is paid to Her Majesty's Treasury in London; believes that this money should not be
    redirected south of the Border but should be spent in Scotland, and therefore calls upon
    the Scottish Executive to take steps to ensure that monies collected in fines for road
    traffic offences in Scotland are made available to local government to re-invest in the
    transport infrastructure. </p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-1027</b> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: McCrone Report</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive to publish its response to the report of the
    McCrone Committee of Inquiry into the Professional Conditions of Service for Teachers and
    to confirm what additional resources it will make available to local authorities to fund
    the Committee&#146;s recommendations.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-1026</b> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Petrol and Diesel Prices</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that since 1997 petrol and diesel prices have risen in excess of 25%;
    further notes that Scottish public services are being forced to operate under ever
    increasing financial constraints; recognises that the increased cost of fuel is a burden
    which must be carried not just by motorists, but which falls on all Scottish citizens
    through rising fuel costs to the public sector; believes that it is unacceptable that
    money should be diverted from over-stretched Scottish public service budgets to the
    Treasury in Westminster, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to consider
    extending the fuel duty rebate and to examine the possibility of extending the
    availability of rebated fuel across Scotland&#146;s public services in order to ensure
    that money spent on Scottish services is spent here rather than being returned to London.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-1025#</b> <strong>Christine Grahame: Cashmere in Crisis</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the continuing threat to the Borders cashmere industry which puts at
    risk 2000 jobs directly and 40 companies with current orders worth £21 million; is not
    satisfied that all measures have been taken by Her Majesty&#146;s Government through the
    European Commission to resolve the recurring trade dispute, and urges the Scottish
    Executive to convey this message in the strongest possible terms to Her Majesty&#146;s
    Government.</p>
