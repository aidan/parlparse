<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6308</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>St Columba&rsquo;s Hospice Charity Bookshop</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming opening of the St Columba&rsquo;s Hospice charity bookshop in Goldenacre on Thursday 20 May 2010; notes that this will be the largest charity bookshop in Edinburgh, with shelf space for over 4,000 titles and reasonably priced at &pound;1 for all fiction paperbacks; highlights that an employee seconded from Standard Life for the past three months assisted in project planning and managing the opening of the shop; congratulates the incredible work carried out by all involved to raise funds for the hospice, which is about to embark on a rebuild project, and further notes that information on the hospice, bookshop and rebuild project can be found on its website at <a href="http://www.stcolumbashospicefundraising.org.uk" target="_blank">www.stcolumbashospicefundraising.org.uk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6307</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>A Year until Riverside</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the near completion of the Riverside Museum in Glasgow; notes that the Riverside Museum Appeal must raise an additional &pound;1.7 million toward its contribution to the work; hopes that the appeal reaches its goal, and looks forward to the opening of the new museum in 2011, which will celebrate Glasgow and Scotland&rsquo;s impact on the transport and technology industries on the banks of the River Clyde, famed for its shipbuilding heritage.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6306</strong> <strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Stonehaven Back in Business</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the open day being held in Stonehaven on 15 May 2010 at which the local community will be demonstrating that it is recovering from the devastation to properties and businesses that it has recently endured from recent floods and landslips; congratulates the organisers on their efforts to help boost local businesses and community spirit; encourages people to visit Stonehaven for the day to take part in the events being held, and applauds the community&rsquo;s determination to work together to recover.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6305</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Rise in Anti-Semitism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the rising trend of anti-Semitic activity throughout 2009; acknowledges that the number of anti-Semitic incidents including extreme violence, assaults, damage and desecration of property, threats, abusive behaviour, including verbal abuse, and the disbursement of anti-Semitic literature almost doubled in the United Kingdom; recognises that a majority of the incidents were arbitrary and opportunistic in nature and notes that the number of politically motivated anti-Semitic incidents is also on the rise; believes that there is never an excuse for any type of hate crime, nor should they be accepted or tolerated, and considers anti-Semitic incidents to be counterproductive as a method of achieving political aims and not conducive to an overall peace solution in the Middle East.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6304</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Youth Services Funding for West Dunbartonshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern over the lack of youth projects and services available in the West Dunbartonshire area and understands that the Community Planning Partnership Executive Group supported a Youth Review that suggested a &quot;reduction in funding for most youth projects and services&quot;; acknowledges that West Dunbartonshire has some 16,781 young people aged between 12 and 25 who, as a result, could have reduced opportunities for personal and social development outwith mainstream education; is further concerned at the lack of volunteering opportunities that this has caused, and calls on West Dunbartonshire Community Planning Partnership to secure adequate future funding for youth services in the area. </p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6303</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Will Danny Deliver?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the potential opportunities for the Highlands in the appointment of the Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey MP, Danny Alexander, as the Secretary of State for Scotland in the newly formed Conservative/Liberal Democrat government; notes the many statements from Mr Alexander since he was first elected as a Highlands MP, including demanding cancellation of Highland Council&rsquo;s housing debt and lowering the rate of fuel duty for rural areas, that could now be implemented utilising his new-found power as the UK Government&rsquo;s representative for Scotland on reserved matters; looks forward to his quick action on these and the many other issues that he criticised the previous UK Government for not dealing with in statements made in the House of Commons, in the Liberal Democrat manifesto and across the Highlands; considers that he should immediately seek to meet the key Liberal Democrat campaign pledges to provide greater fiscal autonomy to Scotland, implement the recommendations of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution on which all political parties have agreed, and ultimately abolish the Scotland Office altogether, which will save taxpayers &pound;10 million annually.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6302</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Democratic Choice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns what it believes to be the bizarre and anti-democratic comments reported by newly elected Labour MP Margaret Curran MSP in <em>The Herald</em> on 12 May 2010 when her statement implied that the SNP should not stand candidates against Labour although Labour should be able to field candidates against the SNP; considers that Ms Curran&rsquo;s reported suggestion that the SNP is somehow responsible for the creation of the Conservative/Liberal Democrat UK government by standing candidates in the same seats as the Labour Party is wholly inaccurate, undemocratic and against the right of people to vote for whom they wish; believes that if the SNP had not stood candidates in constituencies such as Banff and Buchan, Perth and Perthshire North, Moray and Angus then the number of seats won by the Conservative Party would have been even greater; also considers it arrogant to assume that if the SNP had not stood candidates in these constituencies that votes would automatically have gone to the Labour Party, and believes that Labour lost power because of its dismal failure in England, caused by years of economic mismanagement.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6301</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Brian Stewart, Award-winning Trade Unionist</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Brian Stewart from Balloch for being awarded the fifth Scottish Trades Union Congress Helen Dowie Award for Lifelong Learning; notes that Brian is the lead learning rep for Unite the Union at Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT); further notes that Brian and six other learning reps received the award for changing the lives of nearly 100 colleagues at SPT by successfully incorporating learning into core union business in the past year; further notes that, in the past year, there have been 2,138 hours of learning at SPT, 1,528 in company time and 610 in the learners&rsquo; own time, and applauds the role that Brian and his fellow learning reps have played in developing the full potential of individual workers at SPT.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6300</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Happy Birthday Drumchapel Community Credit Union</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Drumchapel Community Credit Union (DCCU) on the occasion of its 40th anniversary; notes that it is widely acknowledged as having been the first credit union in Scotland; further notes that it currently has 2,500 full and 500 junior members; observes that, throughout the recession, credit unions have provided a safe and sustainable form of saving; acknowledges the contribution that DCCU and credit unions throughout Scotland make in providing low-cost loans and encouraging regular saving; salutes the commitment and efforts of all the staff and volunteers who have made DCCU such a success story over the last four decades, and wishes Drumchapel Community Credit Union every success for the future.</p>
