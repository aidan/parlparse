    Differential Inflation Rates In Calculating Benefits and Taxes</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes that in calculations for money taken through petrol duty, Her Majesty's
    Treasury intends to use an inflation rate of 3.3%, while for calculations for money paid
    out through the state pension, an inflation rate of only 1.1% will be used; believes that
    is unfair to use two different inflation figures, selecting the lower to work out what
    increase there should be in money paid out to pensioners, yet using the higher to decide
    what tax increase motorists should pay, and condemns this type of accounting practice as a
    misleading and deceitful excuse for attacking both pensioners and motorists.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-1045</strong> <strong>John Scott: Nuclear Power in Germany</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament <a NAME="MotionText">registers its grave concern over the stated intent of the
    German government to close down nuclear power stations, believing that such action will
    have an extremely detrimental effect on Germany&#146;s compliance with the Rio Agreement
    and will increase global warming.</a></p>
