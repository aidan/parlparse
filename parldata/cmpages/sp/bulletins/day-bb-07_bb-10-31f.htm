          <p><strong>*S3M-739</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> <strong>The Environment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the important relationships among Scotland&rsquo;s natural and built environment, culture and history, which together make us who we are; recognises the achievements over the centuries of artists such as Sir Walter Scott, James Hogg, Alexander Naysmith, Robin Jenkins, Sorley MacLean, Joan Eardley and Ian Hamilton Finlay and, continuing those connections today, Angus Farquhar, Alasdair Gray, Andy Scott and Frances Walker among many others; is glad that so many artists from Scotland and from elsewhere have taken their inspiration from Scotland&rsquo;s people, landscape and natural resources and the ways of life which they support and continue to do so, and recognises the need for the Scottish Government to work closely with cultural and environmental organisations, local authorities, community groups and individuals to celebrate, explore and reveal the diversity and ever-changing nature of Scotland, its people and its place in the world.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S3M-738</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Alternative Dispute Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the need to develop a broad range of appropriate dispute resolution schemes, as alternatives to the formal court system, which can offer more flexibility, quicker resolution, less stress and reduced expense for citizens.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S3M-737</strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Global Lung Cancer Awareness Month</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Macmillan Cancer Support and the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation on their Early Diagnosis Saves Lives campaign to mark Global Lung Cancer Awareness Month and notes that early diagnosis is vital to reducing Scotland&rsquo;s lung cancer mortality rates; welcomes the decreasing rate of lung cancer in men but notes with concern that rates in women continue to increase significantly and that lung cancer remains Scotland&rsquo;s biggest cancer killer for men and women; welcomes the Scotland football manager&rsquo;s support for the campaign, and urges the Scottish Government to support a year-round early diagnosis campaign.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-736</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Renfrewshire Recycling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Paisley-based charity, Renfrewshire Recycling, on its computer recycling training; notes its recent donation of reconditioned computers to the Banrom Primary School in Thailand, which will benefit underprivileged pupils; further notes the involvement of CXS (the Paisley-based IT arm of Renfrewshire Council for Voluntary Service), Air Sea Scotland and Emirates airline in this donation, and congratulates all those involved in this generous act, which draws attention to the issue of recycling, serves as an example of responsible global citizenship and reflects well on the people of Paisley.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-725</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Employment Legislation and the Council of Economic Advisers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the recent comments from Sir George Mathewson, chair of  the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), regarding the impact of employment legislation on the Scottish economy; recognises that while there have been significant improvements in workers&rsquo; rights, such as the national minimum wage, new entitlements to paid holidays and increased maternity leave, employment in Scotland is at record levels; is further concerned that, while the World Bank ranks Scotland, in the United Kingdom, as sixth of 178 countries for ease of doing business, the chair of the CEA chooses to attack rights at work, and calls on the CEA to base all of its future advice to the First Minister on independent evidence and to concentrate on real issues facing the Scottish economy, such as skill shortages, low levels of business research and development investment and security of energy supplies.</p>
