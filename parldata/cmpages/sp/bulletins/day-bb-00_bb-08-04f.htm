            Elder: Protection of Children from Hard-core Pornography</strong>-That 
            the Parliament deplores the decision of the Video Appeal Committee 
            (VAC) of the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to uphold 
            an appeal from the distributors of hardcore pornography to allow distribution 
            of videos with a more explicit content than had previously been acceptable, 
            against the wishes of the BBFC board; notes that the BBFC lost a High 
            Court action this year against the VAC over its decision; is appalled 
            at the High Court ruling in London which brushed aside the possible 
            effects on children once this pornographic material enters homes; 
            deplores the rules since issued by the BBFC which permit even more 
            explicit hardcore pornographic videos to be sold in sex shops in Scotland 
            and the UK; calls upon all local authorities to refuse licences for 
            more sex shops which are now anticipated to open due to the ability 
            to sell even more explicit material; notes that the floodgates could 
            now be open for further hardcore pornography to enter the UK; pledges 
            to do all in its power to resist anything which could harm children 
            through viewing pornography, and supports parents in the UK who are 
            appealing for the Obscene Publications Act 1959 to be amended to include 
            new and tougher regulations.</font></p>

            Care</strong>-That the Parliament notes the publication of the NHS National

            its proposals for Scotland in the autumn and that this will include 
            the Scottish Executive's response to the <i>Report of the Royal Commission 
            on Long Term Care</i>, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to implement 
            in full the recommendation of the Royal Commission that personal care,
