              the Executive's neglect and lamentable lack of vision and strategy 
              for Scotland's railways has contributed to a deterioration of rail 
              services in Scotland to the point at which they have become amongst 
              the worst in Europe; further notes that the Strategic Rail Authority's 
              new strategic plan offers nothing new for Scotland; believes that 
              Scottish railways must be fully controlled by, and accountable to, 
              the Scottish Parliament, and therefore calls upon the Executive 
              to take responsibility for delivering a strategy for the running 
              and operation of Scotland's rail network. </p>

              to end and insert &quot;with regret the acquiescence of the Scottish 
              Executive in Her Majesty's Government's woeful handling of our railways 
              which has led to the uncertainty and chaos that now exists throughout 
              the UK rail industry and, in particular, the undermining of the

              strategic objectives for the rail network and services in Scotland, 
              how and when these are to be achieved and how they will be funded.&quot;
