          <p><strong>*S2M-495</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>West 
            of Scotland Care Centre</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to instruct a review of the screening and shortlisting 
            processes conducted by the West of Scotland Forensic Steering Group 
            in relation to the proposed construction of a secure care centre to 
            ensure that the declared selection criteria has been applied equally 
            in all the original 27 proposed sites, and notes the concerns of many 
            residents in the Renfrewshire area due to inaccuracies in relation 
            to the screening and shortlisting processes applied to the Dykebar 
            Hospital Paisley site.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-494</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Welsh 
            Assembly Stance on GM</strong>&#151;That the Parliament applauds the 
            stance of the National Assembly for Wales and the Minister for Environment, 
            Planning and Countryside in Wales, Carwyn Jones AM in adopting the 
            &quot;most restrictive policy possible&quot; over GM crops regardless 
            of the position of Her Majesty&#146;s Government and calls on the 
            Minister for Environment and Rural Development to adopt the same position 
            as his Welsh counterpart to safeguard the future of Scottish food 
            and farming.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-493</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Scotland's

            David Millar on his emphatic time trial victory at the cycling World 
            Road Cycling Championships in Canada; notes the important role of 
            cycle sport in building a &quot;cycle culture&quot; in countries such 
            as the Netherlands, and further notes the importance of building a 
            cycle culture in Scotland that will positively impact on our goals 
            for public health, transport and the environment.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-492</strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison:</strong> 
            <strong>Gaelic Language Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament warmly 
            welcomes the publication of the first ever draft Gaelic Language bill; 
            acknowledges the historic symmetry of the publication of the bill 
            and the 100th Mod; appreciates that the Gaelic language is an integral 
            part of life and work in Scotland, and recognises the importance of 
            this legislation to underpin both the language and culture of the 
            Gael in order to ensure that the language not only survives but continues 
            to thrive.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-491</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Swimminig 
            in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the work of 
            Scottish Swimming and the Bank of Scotland in launching the National 
            Swimming Award; recognises that the Scottish Executive&#146;s plan 
            to make the activity of swimming a key part in the lifestyle of Scotland&#146;s 
            population will be greatly enhanced if swimming provision in Scottish 
            schools were to improve; notes the shortage of properly qualified 
            instructors and the lack of swimming education courses for them to 
            learn appropriate teaching standards, and believes that further initiatives, 
            including the provision of more physical education teachers in primary 
            schools, should be undertaken by the Executive to help foster swimming 
            as an ideal activity for the long term pursuit of a healthy lifestyle.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-490</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Think 
            Water School Packs</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            Highland Spring on its &quot;Think Water&quot; Schools Pack, a new 
            curriculum-based schools initiative aimed specifically at 5 to 11-year-olds, 
            which gives children information on why water is essential for healthy 
            living and hopes that this material will encourage young people to 
            choose healthier drinking choices.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-489</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Layla 
            Zana</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the continued detention 
            of Kurdish MP Layla Zana in a Turkish prison; further notes that Layla 
            and her colleagues Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak were arrested 
            immediately after they took their oath in Kurdish and have been imprisoned 
            since 1994; calls for the release of these MPs and condemns the continued 
            abuse of human rights of Kurds within Turkey; further calls on the 
            Turkish Government to respond positively to the Kurdistan Freedom 
            and Democracy Congress proposal Road Map for Peace, and recognises 
            that peace will only be achieved when the legitimate rights of the 
            Kurds are recognised by the Turkish state.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-488</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>United 
            Nations International Day for the Eradication of Poverty</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises United Nations International Day for the 
            Eradication of Poverty on 17 October 2003 as an opportunity to raise 
            awareness of the issue of poverty; believes that poverty is neither 
            inevitable nor acceptable; recognises that far too many of our fellow 
            Scots still live in poverty and that throughout the world the gap 
            between rich and poor has widened, and urges the Scottish Executive 
            to do far more to tackle poverty and to ensure that Scotland plays 
            a full role in the international community to begin to close the gap 
            between rich and poor throughout the world.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-487#</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> 
            <strong>Renewable Energy and Wind Farm Guidance</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the need for the development of renewable 
            sources of energy; welcomes the work being done to ensure that Scotland 
            becomes a market leader for wave, tidal and offshore wind energy generation 
            and hydrogen fuel cells; recognises that wind farms, as the only currently 
            commercially viable new renewable technology, have an important contribution 
            to make to the mix of Scotland&#146;s energy generation; notes, however, 
            that the absence of clear, concise and coherent guidelines for the 
            approval of wind farm sites is causing anxiety in many Scottish communities 
            and uncertainty for developers; is concerned that, without such guidelines, 
            public support for renewable energy is in danger of being undermined, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive must urgently publish guidance 
            on the criteria being applied to wind farm developments, take positive 
            steps to promote and assist community-led renewable energy projects 
            including wind farm developments, engage with the Ministry of Defence 
            regarding its objections to wind farm developments on or near Ministry 
            of Defence property, and encourage developers to recognise their responsibilities 
            to local communities so that the common good of such communities can 
            benefit from developments on their door step.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Richard Lochhead, Bruce Crawford, Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-486</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Sexual 
            Health Misinformation</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            publication of pamphlets stating that condoms are not reliable in 
            preventing the spread of HIV, as discovered by BBC Panorama researchers 
            working in Kenya and other areas of high HIV prevalence; opposes the 
            spread of such misinformation in Scotland; condemns those who publish, 
            promote or endorse such life-threatening propaganda, whether abroad 
            or in Scotland; notes the opinion of the US National Institutes of 
            Health and other expert opinion worldwide that intact latex condoms 
            are essentially impermeable to even the smallest sexually transmitted 
            virus, hepatitis B; notes the intention of the Scottish Executive 
            to publish the report of the Sexual Health Strategy expert group in 
            the near future, and believes that any effective sexual health strategy 
            for Scotland will include the promotion of condom use and safer sex 
            practices among other approaches.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-485</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Nursery 
            Nurses</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the Scottish Executive's 
            declared aim to "give young people the skills they need to take an 
            entrepreneurial spirit from the classroom into a confident and prosperous 
            Scotland"; recognises that confidence grows from the very earliest 
            age and that nursery education is critical to instilling confidence 
            in present and future generations; recognises the pivotal role played 
            by nursery nurses in that process; considers that to invest in their 
            pay and career structure is to invest in our children and country's 
            future, and further considers that the Executive should declare support 
            for the nursery nurses' current grading claim and take steps to ensure 
            funding and settlement of that claim.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-484</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>1820 
            Martyrs</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses its concern that 
            &#145;more materials&#146; regarding the 1820 Martyrs, as referred 
            to by the then Deputy Minister for Education and Young People, Nicol 
            Stephen, on 5 September 2001 (<em>Official report</em>, c 2263), have 
            not yet been produced; notes that the answer given by the Minister 
            for Education and Young People, Peter Peacock, on 22 September 2003 
            to question S2W-2170 does not re-affirm that more materials will be 
            produced; calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise fully this 
            important act of civil unrest in Scottish history when working class 
            people rose against the British state to obtain a better standard 
            of living and demonstrated under the banner &#145;Scotland Free or 
            a Desert&#146;; further calls on the Executive and Inverclyde Council 
            to provide a memorial to the demonstrators, men, women and children, 
            who were shot indiscriminately by the British Army in Greenock as 
            they protested against the holding of political prisoners in Greenock 
            jail; recognises the need for Scottish history to be preserved and 
            taught to schoolchildren, and calls on the Executive to provide these 
            materials forthwith to enlighten current schoolchildren and future 
            generations of the struggle for better living conditions and independence.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-483</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Threatened 
            End of Manufacturing at Hoover, Cambuslang</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament is deeply concerned at the threatened loss of 250 direct 
            and an estimated 1,000 indirect jobs as a result of Hoover's announcement 
            that it is ending manufacturing at its Cambuslang plant, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should immediately establish a task force 
            in association with Scottish Enterprise, South Lanarkshire Council, 
            trade unions and others to explore with Hoover any options which will 
            allow the retention of a manufacturing element within Hoover, Cambuslang, 
            and to tackle the employment consequences and the human and social 
            disaster of the proposed cutback in the Cambuslang and Rutherglen 
            area.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-482#</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Development 
            of Oban Harbour</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            that Oban, the crossroads to the west highlands and islands, is being 
            economically constrained by the lack of strategic development of the 
            harbour resulting in a knock-on effect on the north Argyll islands 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should work with Argyll and 
            Bute Council, Highland and Islands Enterprise and all other stakeholders 
            to develop the infrastructure in Oban harbour in a strategic way so 
            that it can meet the future need for berthing facilities for the increasing 
            number of ferries, cruise liners, pleasure boats, yachts and fishing 
            boats that use the harbour.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-481#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Women's 
            Social and Political Union</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            that, on 10 October 1903, a group of women met in the Manchester home 
            of Emmeline Pankhurst and founded the Women's Social and Political 
            Union, which became known as the suffragette movement, with the aim 
            of recruiting more working class women into the struggle for the vote 
            and believes that this centenary year should be marked by efforts 
            to promote the participation of women in the democratic process.</p>

            numbers being given in response to inquiries made of the new 118118 
            directory inquiry service; calls upon Oftel to conduct an investigation 
            into whether these providers are up to adequate standards and, if 
            they are not, to take appropriate action, and further calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to ensure that the interests of Scottish consumers

          <p> <strong>S2M-479</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Recognising

            Parliament recognises the outstanding contribution to science of Professor 
            John Mallard and his team at the University of Aberdeen who were instrumental 
            in the development of magnetic resonance imaging technology in the 
            late 1970s and early 1980s; notes that this work was built upon across 
            the world and was of fundamental importance to the 2003 Nobel Award 
            in Physiology or Medicine being awarded to teams from the Universities 
            of Nottingham and Illinois for developing new applications for this 
            technology; further notes that Scotland has a proud record of world-beating 
            science, and calls on the Scottish Executive to redouble efforts to 
            encourage such scientific progress and to retain the benefits in Scotland 
            rather than exporting technology and commercial advantage overseas.</p>

            UK&#146;s biggest day of direct volunteering action; recognises the 
            important role the CSV plays in providing opportunities for people 
            to work together to made a difference in their communities; further

            that has the effect of helping to secure current and future investment 
            in Fife and the north of Scotland in the oil and gas industry; congratulates 
            the stakeholders including Her Majesty&#146;s Government, the Norwegian

            in partnership to bring benefit to the Scottish economy and safeguard

            to have discussions on the cessation of manufacturing at its Cambuslang 
            plant; recognises the valuable role that the workforce in Cambuslang 
            has played in the history of the Hoover company for almost 60 years; 
            urges Hoover to reconsider its decision to cease manufacturing in 
            Scotland; further expresses its particular concern that the company 
            intends to transfer some manufacturing to Wales, and calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to do everything within its power to support the 
            workforce at Cambuslang.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-474</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>Horse 
            Racing Industry in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the significant contribution that the horse racing industry makes 
            to the economy, generating up to £125 million annually and providing 
            the equivalent of 1700 full-time jobs; commends the success of the 
            racing industry in continuing to expand and develop, recognising its 
            contribution to local economies and tourism; notes that there is widespread 
            concern regarding the potential implications of the proposed Office 
            of Fair Trading (OFT) rule 14 notice on the deregulation of the British 
            horse racing industry and, in particular, on its likely impact on

          <p><strong>S2M-472#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            and Rationalisation of Maternity Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            is extremely concerned at the increasing numbers of proposed closures 
            of maternity hospitals and rationalisations of maternity services 
            with consultations held in isolation and without reference to cross-boundary 
            and pan-Scotland impact; notes that claimed benefits of centralisation 
            in relation to morbidity and mortality are unproven; is concerned 
            that there are no minimum standards for staffing establishments of 
            midwives across the service and that models for calculating staff 
            numbers and ratios are outdated and outmoded; notes that expectations 
            of staff by the public and demands of government have increased dramatically 
            over the years which has created more<strong> </strong>work for all 
            staff providing maternity services despite a declining birth rate, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should implement a moratorium 
            on maternity closures and conduct a review of the provision of maternity 
            services across Scotland that involves the public and all trade union 
            and professional organisations with the aim of establishing agreed 
            minimum staffing establishments in a safe, co-ordinated service that 
            meets the needs of all women and families across the whole of Scotland 
            and maintains the expertise and excellence already established in 
            the provision of these services.</p>

            for Health and Consumer Protection, David Byrne, on his clarification 
            that the issue of GM crops coexisting with non-GM crops and its associated 
            threat to biodiversity is a national issue under national competency; 
            welcomes this confirmation of the Scottish Executive&#146;s powers 
            on this issue, and looks forward to it using these powers to announce 
            the banning of all GM foods and crops.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-470#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            of Queen Mother's Hospital, Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the Parliament

            Maternity Working Group, chaired by Professor Margaret Reid, to close 
            the Queen Mother's Hospital and transfer services to the Southern 
            General and Princess Royal hospitals; believes that it makes no sense 
            to close down a well-functioning unit with a proven and world-renowned 
            record of care of mothers and babies; notes that the Queen Mother's 
            Hospital has won many awards for clinical excellence and delivers 
            services to communities that most need the service; further notes 
            that the expert views of Scottish paediatricians and other medical 
            staff appear to have been ignored by the working group, particularly 
            those that expressed the view that transporting ill babies would pose 
            a degree of risk that is currently not necessary; believes that the 
            prospect of closing the Queen Mother's Hospital is not just a loss 
            to women in the west of Glasgow and west of Scotland, but crucially 
            denies a critical service to mothers and ill babies throughout Scotland 
            who have relied upon the close link between the Queen Mother's Hospital 
            and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, a model of care 
            which has catered for women expecting babies that require immediate 
            medical attention; is concerned over the negative knock-on effect 
            to children's services as a result of clinicians remotely serving 
            the two retained maternity units and the uncertainty now created over 
            the future of the Yorkhill NHS Trust following the recommendation 
            of the Maternity Working Group to close the children's hospital in 
            the longer term and transfer all services to the Southern General 
            Hospital, and considers that the Greater Glasgow NHS Board should 
            reject the recommendations of the Maternity Working Group.</p>

            recognises the many economic advantages for Scotland that an expanding 
            construction industry will bring, notably in employment preservation 
            and creation, training, skills and provision of the built environment; 
            welcomes the setting up of a Cross Party Group on Construction to 
            consider and debate all appropriate issues concerning the structure 
            and operation of the construction industry in Scotland as they may 
            affect all relevant stakeholders; supports the industry&#146;s schemes 
            to register construction firms through the Construction Licensing 
            Executive and workers through approved registration schemes, thereby 
            protecting the public by eradicating rogue traders, enhancing the

            authorities and other government bodies can assist by (a) supporting 
            registration schemes by insisting that all public works contractors 
            are committed to them, (b) supporting the education and training infrastructure 
            so that it meets Scotland&#146;s construction requirements, (c) acting

            deported 174,967 people between January 1990 and April 1997; further 
            notes that New Labour now deports seven people an hour compared to 
            two deportations an hour in 1990, and believes that this illustrates
