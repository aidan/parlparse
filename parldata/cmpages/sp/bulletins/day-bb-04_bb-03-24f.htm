          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1092</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Campsie Memorial Hall Premature Closure</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the unexpected, premature closure of the Milton of Campsie Memorial Village Hall in the early hours of 22 March instead of 28 March 2004, when East Dunbartonshire Council, through the application of delegated powers, surreptitiously erected heras fencing; notes that observers witnessed approximately 10 council vehicles with 40 staff on board as well as the Commercial Strategic Director of East Dunbartonshire Council, a police chief inspector and a constable; believes that such people were all likely to be on overtime at immense public cost; further deplores the allegations made by the council that public disorder and illegal occupation of the facility would arise; notes that the council has not yet fully provided alternative arrangements for current hall users resulting in like-for-like facilities being unavailable and requiring a change of day and time for activities, and finally notes that many personal effects were locked away without prior warning to the public to retrieve such items.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1091</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>GM Crops</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the preliminary legal opinion of independent counsel that the Scottish Executive had discretion to use legal powers to refuse the next stage of GM maize commercialisation which it chose not to exercise; calls for the Executive to review its own legal advice on which its decision over GM maize was based and to reassess the extent of its discretion accordingly, and calls on the Executive to put on hold the decision on final consent to the placement of GM maize on the UK National Seeds List, at least until it has reported back to the Parliament on the outcome of such a legal review and satisfied the Parliament that the most legally-restrictive policy possible toward GM commercialisation has been used.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1090</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Protecting Communities - Reforming the Role of Non-Jury Courts</strong>-That the Parliament considers the continuing modernisation of the criminal justice system to be an important priority; notes the progress made to date to improve the delivery of a fair, efficient and accessible service for victims, witnesses and the accused; welcomes the recent report by Sheriff Principal McInnes into the operation of summary justice, and encourages everyone who wishes to do so to participate in the consultation on its recommendations.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1089</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Zero Waste</strong>-That the Parliament notes that, despite a small increase in recycling and composting, the Scottish Executive is yet to achieve any reduction in the overall production of waste; urges the Executive to adopt a &quot;zero waste&quot; approach, which has the potential to dramatically reduce waste from the design, production and use of materials and products, to boost reuse, recycling and composting rates and to cut costs for business, stimulate innovation and create more &quot;green&quot; jobs in Scotland, and recommends that the Executive produces a strategy for reaching a target of zero waste and reports back to the Parliament on the potential of that policy for Scotland.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1088#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Reasons to be Cheerful</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 7:84 Theatre Company (Scotland) on its latest production &quot;Reasons to be Cheerful&quot; which is currently touring the country; believes that it is a good example of the company's radical origins, and supports 7:84 in its application to the Scottish Arts Council for funding beyond March 2005.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1087</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Parentline Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes the fifth birthday of Parentline Scotland, the free national helpline service offered by Children 1st,<SUP> </SUP>which provides confidential help for parents and has received 50,000 calls since its inception; applauds the hard work and dedication of all the staff and volunteers that provide this excellent service, and encourages more parents to take advantage of the advice and support it offers.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1086#</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Proposed Midlothian Primary School Closures</strong>-That the Parliament notes the grave concerns of parents about the proposed closure of rural primary schools in Midlothian; acknowledges concerns about the short consultation process; recognises that, while the matter of school closure is primarily a subject for local authorities, they must act within the legislative framework of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, the Education (Scotland) Act 1981 and the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc. Act 2000, and further notes that local authorities should be informed by the Scottish Executive's policies on the importance of rural services to sustainable rural communities and the need to promote rural businesses.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Bill Butler<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1085</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>-That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business-</P>
