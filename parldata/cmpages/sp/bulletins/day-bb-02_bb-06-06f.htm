          <p><strong>*S1M-3174</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Care Provision 
            for Elderly People in Dunbar</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the reduction of care provision for elderly people in 
            Dunbar and, in particular, the reduction in the number of beds at 
            Belhaven Hospital which may result in frail elderly people being transferred 
            to facilities in Edinburgh, distant from family, friends and familiar 
            surroundings; further notes the imminent closure of the Church of 
            Scotland respite day care centre at the Old Manse, reducing the provision 
            of respite relief for carers; is concerned by the distress that this 
            will cause frail elderly people and their carers, and therefore urges 
            the Scottish Executive as a matter of urgency to correct the failure 
            to provide locally by providing adequate resources in order to ensure 
            that the elderly in Dunbar and, indeed, elsewhere in East Lothian, 
            can remain in their failing years in their home locality, that they 
            are treated with the dignity and consideration they have earned and 
            that their carers, families and friends are given practical support.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, 
            Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3173#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Loan Sharks</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament commends the excellent initiative of the <em>Daily Record 
            </em>to name and shame the "loan sharks" who prey on vulnerable people 
            living in poverty throughout Scotland; agrees with the newspaper that 
            Scotland must not be a country where it is a crime to be poor and 
            where loan sharks obtain huge profits out of other people's precarious 
            financial circumstances, and is of the firm view that the Parliament, 
            in close partnership with the UK Parliament, the police and other 
            appropriate public agencies, must take decisive action to drive these 
            predators out of their sordid "business" in the interests of their 
            victims and victims&#146; families.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3172</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Anagach Woods</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the purchase of Anagach Woods by the community 
            of Grantown-on-Spey; congratulates everyone involved in ensuring that 
            the community purchase will be successfully completed; acknowledges 
            support from the Scottish Land Fund and Highland and Islands Enterprise 
            Community Land Fund, and hopes that the safeguarding of these woods 
            will safeguard the environment and also provide opportunities for 
            Grantown-on-Spey in the years ahead.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3171#</strong> <strong>David Mundell: VisitScotland 
            Funding of Dumfries and Galloway Tourist Board Foot-and-Mouth Recovery 
            Plan</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            with extreme concern the failure of VisitScotland to allocate the 
            necessary £280,000 to fund the second year of the foot-and-mouth recovery 
            plan prepared by Dumfries and Galloway Tourist Board; believes that 
            funds allocated nationally to VisitScotland by the Scottish Executive 
            to help the tourist industry recover from the foot-and-mouth disease 
            outbreak should be targeted on those areas most affected by the disease, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should enter into urgent 
            dialogue with VisitScotland to review their funding allocation to 
            the board in the expectation that the necessary funding will be made 
            available to support the Board's foot-and-mouth recovery plan which 
            has already had considerable success in its first year.</a></p>
