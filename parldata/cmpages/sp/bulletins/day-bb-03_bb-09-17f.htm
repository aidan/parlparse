            Dr Henry Faulds in the scientific study of fingerprints; recognises 
            that Dr Faulds, who was born in Beith, Ayrshire, in 1843, first published 
            his findings on the forensic application of fingerprinting in the 
            Nature Magazine in 1880, some years ahead of contemporaries in the 
            field, and therefore should be recognised as the true pioneer of fingerprinting, 
            and acknowledges the work of the Dr Henry Faulds - Beith Commemorative 
            Society in seeking to recognise the work and achievements of Dr Faulds

            the Parliament welcomes the agreement between the City of Edinburgh 
            Council and contractors to allow the refurbishment of St. Peter&#146;s 
            Primary School, Morningside, to start immediately; notes that the 
            lack of a dedicated school bus service for the current school year 
            to take pupils to their temporary school near Tollcross has caused 
            traffic congestion at this site and overcrowding on buses running 
            on the A702 into the city, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council 
            to introduce one immediately to stop travel problems for teachers, 
            pupils, parents and commuters.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-348#</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Transport

            concern the continued traffic congestion on main routes into Edinburgh 
            from the south, including the problem of parking by city centre commuters 
            in residential streets in southern Edinburgh; further notes with concern 
            the proposal for an out-of-town football stadium at Straiton that 
            can only exacerbate existing traffic problems; considers that improved 
            transport infrastructure, such as the proposed park-and-ride site 
            at Burdiehouse, is essential to help tackle the problem, and considers 
            that the City of Edinburgh and Midlothian councils and the Scottish 
            Executive should ensure that these transport problems in southern 
            Edinburgh can be resolved with added benefit to the wider Lothian 
            and Borders region.</p>
