<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;<br />
    <br />
</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong><br />  
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00112 Alex Fergusson: Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the presentation to the UK Parliament of a draft Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill; believes that this represents a long overdue, but very welcome, first step in ensuring an equitable distribution of available resource across the food chain, and a measure of protection for the primary producer in it; accepts that the success of the adjudicator will depend on the powers available to the postholder; commends the UK Government on taking this important step, and calls on all parties in the Scottish Parliament to work with the UK Government to ensure that the eventual outcome has the best interests of the Scottish producers, manufacturers and retailers at heart.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00111 Humza Yousaf: Amnesty International&rsquo;s 50th Anniversary </strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Amnesty International on 50 years of standing up for humanity and human rights across the world; notes that the organisation has worked on 50,000 individual cases in that time; further notes that the organisation was awarded the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize for &quot;having contributed to securing the grounds for freedom, for justice, and thereby also for peace in the world&quot;; applauds Amnesty&rsquo;s successful campaigning, including for an International Criminal Court and the UN Convention Against Torture, and believes that, while it is regrettable that the world still needs human rights campaigns, it is at least fortunate that Amnesty International is alive and well, having grown to include over three million members in over 150 countries around the world, and values what it considers to be the important worked carried out by Amnesty International Scotland to ensure that the nation provides a strong voice for justice and equality in the world.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00110 Humza Yousaf: Glasgow Currys Favour</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Oceanic Group for hosting the 4th Annual Scottish Curry Award; values the contribution made by Scotland&rsquo;s curry restaurants and takeaways to the economy and the cultural diversity of Scotland; hails Glasgow as the curry capital of the UK with Glasgow&rsquo;s Balbir&rsquo;s Restaurant winning Restaurant of the Year and the city&rsquo;s Banana Leaf winning takeaway of the year, also commends Mrs Unis on being awarded the lifetime achievement award for her dedication and contribution to the industry.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00109 Kenneth Gibson: Rename Glasgow Prestwick Robert Burns International Airport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the campaign to rename Glasgow Prestwick International Airport, as Robert Burns International Airport in honour and memory of Scotland&rsquo;s national bard; believes that the life and works of Robert Burns play a significant role in attracting tourists to Scotland and, as such, believes that the international airport in Burns&rsquo; homeland of Ayrshire should be renamed to reflect this; notes that an online campaign to rename the airport has attracted 6,000 supporters, highlighting significant support for the proposal; believes that Scotland should be proud of its national icons, and calls on the owners and shareholders of the airport to rename Glasgow Prestwick in order to help promote Scotland&rsquo;s rich culture and heritage around the world and help attract more visitors to Scotland via their airport.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00108 Drew Smith: Evening Times, Streets Ahead</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the <em>Evening Times</em> new Streets Ahead campaign; considers the campaign to be bold; notes that the campaign aims to create a network of street champions who will be focused on improving Glasgow&rsquo;s communities by engaging young people in improving their local environment and all of Glasgow&rsquo;s people in creating more pleasant public spaces, parks, streets and backcourts in which, it believes, community spirit, pride and belief in the City is stronger; further notes the support of Glasgow Housing Association, Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Fire and Rescue and the City Charitable Trust for the campaign, which will run for 12 months, and encourages elected representative of all parties to work together to involve people across Glasgow and congratulates all those involved in attempting to make sure that Glasgow continues to flourish.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00075.1 Kezia Dugdale: Edinburgh Reclaim the Night</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-00075 in the name of Marco Biagi (Edinburgh Reclaim the Night), leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to &quot;centre&quot; and insert &quot;expresses disappointment at what it sees as Edinburgh City Council&rsquo;s attempt to dictate changes to the march route because of football and rugby crowds in the Grassmarket and believes that this only reinforces the need for annual Reclaim the Night marches to highlight fears that women have about public safety and promote their right to feel safe and secure in their own community&quot;. </p>
