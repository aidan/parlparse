McNeill: Glasgow Twinning with Havana</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
Glasgow on becoming the first UK city to twin with Cuba; notes that the twinning 
of Glasgow and the Cuban capital of Havana will enhance cultural, educational 
and business links between the two cities that are historically linked by their 
respective roles in the sugar and tobacco trades; applauds the efforts of Havana 
Mayor, Hector Perez, and Glasgow Lord Provost, Alex Mosson, in bringing the twinning 
to fruition; further notes the crippling difficulties that Cubans continue to 
face as a result of 40 years of US imposed economic sanctions against their country, 
and urges other cities to join Glasgow in promoting friendship and exchange with 
the people of Cuba.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3795#</STRONG> <STRONG>Donald Gorrie: Care 
Homes' Water Charges</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned at the implications 
of the Court of Session decision on <em>Scottish Water</em> v <em>Clydecare Limited</em> 
as a result of which care homes will have to pay their water charges in full, 
when they already face continuing deficits because of long-term underfunding by 
successive governments, and believes that the Scottish Executive should examine 
this problem urgently and take appropriate action. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3794#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Dennis Canavan: Safeway's Support for Scottish Football</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the bids being made to take over Safeway and asks that any 
prospective buyer give a firm commitment to continue the existing arrangements 
between Safeway and the Scottish Football Association for sponsorship of the Scottish 
football team and continue to support the development of youth football and the 
provision of a match ticket distribution network through local stores.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3784#
