          <p><strong>*S2M-1292#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Arrhythmia 
            Awareness Week</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Arrhythmia 
            Awareness Week partners, STARS, SADS UK, CMA and BCPA, for their work 
            in raising awareness of cardiac arrhythmias and their potentially 
            fatal consequences; notes that the condition occurs when the victim's 
            heart goes into an abnormal rhythm from which it may not recover naturally, 
            can strike at any age and that many people die each year due to suffering 
            a fatal cardiac arrhythmia; further notes that many people fail to 
            be accurately diagnosed and that there is a general lack of awareness 
            amongst the general public and healthcare professionals, and believes&nbsp;that 
            the Scottish Executive should initiate a national education programme 
            so that people who are at high risk of serious adverse events can 
            be identified and treated.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1291</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Thiomersal 
            in Vaccines</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that thiomersal 
            in vaccines has been banned in Japan, South Korea, Denmark, Sweden, 
            Norway, Finland, Canada and the United States of America, that in 
            1999 the institute of medicine in the USA declared that it was &quot;biologically 
            plausible&quot; that thiomersal was the cause of neurological problems 
            in children, that the European agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal 
            Products recommended &quot;it would be prudent to remove thiomersal 
            from childhood vaccines&quot;, that the World Health Organisation 
            recommended that this be done as soon as practicable and that an alternative 
            thiomersal-free DTP vaccine is available and licensed but not actively 
            promoted; is extremely concerned that thiomersal containing DTP is 
            the predominant vaccine still promoted and administered in Scotland, 
            and believes that it should be withdrawn immediately and that the 
            Scottish Executive should, at least, as is within its remit, issue 
            guidance to NHS boards and all those delivering primary care to ensure 
            that parents are informed of, and offered, thiomersal-free vaccines 
            and make the necessary funding available.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1290</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>English-Speaking 
            Union, Juniors Debating Final</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Craigmount High School, Dunblane High School, Kirkcudbright Academy 
            and Webster's High School for reaching the English-Speaking Union 
            Juniors Debating Final from the 88 entering teams; believes that there 
            are many skills to be gained from encouraging debating in schools, 
            including written and oral communication, deduction, reasoning, self-discipline 
            and humility; considers the high level of participation as very encouraging 
            for the future of school debating in Scotland, and wishes all teams 
            to have a lively, enjoyable and informative final debate on the motion, 
            &quot;This House would withdraw British troops from Iraq immediately&quot; 
            at Glasgow University Union on 22 May 2004.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1289</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Glasgow 
            Homeopathic Hospital - Centre for Integrative Care</strong>-That the 
            Parliament acknowledges the unique service offered at the in-patient 
            unit of the Centre for Integrative Care at Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital; 
            recognises the value to patients and to the NHS that the &quot;whole 
            person&quot; integrative approach offers; expresses concern at the 
            suggestion that this service will be closed as a result of funding 
            cuts; believes that such a closure would result in the loss of an 
            effective model of care and a consequent long-term increase in other 
            health care costs, and urges the Scottish Executive to promote the 
            availability of homeopathic care within the National Health Service.</P>

            Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1288</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>ME 
            Awareness Day</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Wednesday, 12 
            May 2004 is ME Awareness Day; applauds the appointment of an ME specialist 
            nurse by NHS Fife; recognises that ME is now accepted as a neurological 
            disease under World Health Organisation ICD-10, rather than as a mental 
            condition; therefore questions why benefits continue to be denied 
            on mental health grounds and why appellants continue to be referred 
            for psychiatric assessment, and regrets the lack of urgency shown 
            by the Scottish Executive in respect of NHS boards' responses to its 
            request for information on ME issues and that, two years after the 
            publication of the Chief Medical Officer's report into ME in England 
            and Wales, the research into, and treatment of, ME in Scotland has 
            failed to make any progress.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1287</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>National 
            Condom Week 10 to 16 May 2004</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            that National Condom Week, 10 to 16 May 2004, makes a significant 
            contribution in raising awareness of the importance of using barrier 
            protection in the prevention of both sexually transmitted infection 
            and unplanned pregnancy; further recognises that the Durex Report 
            2004 shows that 34% of Scottish people had unprotected sex with a 
            new partner in the last 12 months; expresses concern about the 20% 
            increase in HIV cases in the United Kingdom between 2002 and 2003, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive's forthcoming sexual health 
            and relationships strategy should address this issue and promote the 
            importance of education in improving sexual health in Scotland.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1286#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Eviction 
            of Asylum Seekers</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the recent 
            evictions of failed asylum seekers in Glasgow and notes with concern 
            the comments of David Gormley of the city's asylum seekers' support 
            team that &quot;the only way the council can assist people evicted 
            at the Home Office's request is if they have children or are in need 
            of community care. We have no funding and have made no provision for 
            the housing of people evicted by the Home Office&quot;; further notes 
            that Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees estimates that there are 
            around 170 destitute refugees in Scotland and that this number looks 
            set to rise considerably in response to the current number of evictions, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive has a duty to contact the 
            Home Office, urging it to rethink its policy of leaving failed asylum 
            seekers destitute.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1285#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Minor 
            Title Newspaper Access to Royal Mail Night Flights</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes the emergency resolution passed at the Scottish Trades 
            Union Congress (STUC) calling for steps to be taken to restore access 
            for minor title newspapers to the Royal Mail night flight to Scotland; 
            notes the resolution passed at the conference of the National Federation 
            of Retail Newsagents to fight for the continued distribution of specialist 
            titles; notes the detrimental consequences of the Royal Mail's unilateral 
            decision to cancel the service for the range and diversity of the 
            press available in Scotland, and particularly the loss of two daily 
            newspapers, the Morning Star and the Daily Jang; notes that the cooperatively-owned 
            Morning Star is supported by the STUC and most major trade unions 
            and is&nbsp;relied upon by the trade union movement, while the Daily 
            Jang is Scotland's only daily Urdu language newspaper and caters for 
            Scotland's large Urdu-speaking community; notes that the Royal Mail 
            enjoys a monopoly of night flight landings that are essential for 
            same day distribution, that this monopoly has been associated with 
            its status as a public service and that the withdrawal of access to 
            minor titles represents a breach of this status, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive&nbsp;should raise these issues, both directly 
            with the Royal Mail and with the Department of Trade and Industry, 
            and press for the urgent restoration of access by the minor titles 
            to Royal Mail night flights to Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1284#</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes:</strong> <strong>Carers' 
            Week</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its admiration for the 
            estimated 600,000 people in Scotland who provide unpaid help and support 
            to a relative or friend who could not otherwise manage because of 
            frailty, illness or disability; is concerned that large numbers of 
            these carers are unknown to the statutory agencies; therefore welcomes 
            Carers' Week, being held this year from 14 to 20 June 2004, including 
            parliamentary events on 15 June, with the theme of carers and health; 
            promotes the principle that carers be treated as key partners in community 
            care and welcomes legislative progress such as the introduction of 
            a right to an independent assessment for all carers including, for 
            the first time, carers under 16; is concerned, however, that two-thirds 
            of carers who provide care for more than 50 hours per week say that 
            their health has been affected by caring; notes that, while carers 
            are frequent users of general practitioners and primary care services, 
            there is much work needed in primary care to identify patients who 
            are carers; further notes that the unpaid work carried out by carers 
            saves the taxpayer a substantial amount of money each year, and considers 
            that there should be provision of further support and services for 
            carers.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1283#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> 
            <strong>Recognition of Skin Disease as a Chronic Condition</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that skin diseases are disfiguring and highly 
            distressing with one-in-four of the Scottish population affected by 
            skin diseases that would benefit from medical treatment; further notes 
            with concern that skin diseases are one of the main reasons for an 
            individual being certified as unfit to work and impact directly on 
            a child's ability to attend school, while accounting for 15% of primary 
            care consultations and 7% of all referrals to hospital out-patient 
            clinics; welcomes the Scottish Innovation and Redesign Collaborative 
            for Dermatology under the auspices of the Centre for Change and Innovation 
            as the first step in the process of giving dermatological services 
            the priority they deserve, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should, as the next step, recognise skin diseases as chronic conditions, 
            thereby giving skin conditions and those individuals affected by them 
            the priority and treatment they deserve by assisting them with prescription 
            charges and making access to the most efficacious drugs easier.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1282#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Regulation 
            of Care</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its shock and disappointment 
            at the alleged abuse suffered by residents of nursing homes as detailed 
            in recent newspaper reports; expresses concern at the apparent disregard 
            of the appropriate vetting procedures on prospective care workers 
            before commencing employment; notes that there are many private care 
            companies providing care for elderly and disabled people, both in 
            their own homes and in residential care homes; considers that such 
            agencies should ensure that staff in their employment are appropriately 
            trained for the tasks that they undertake; recognises, however, that 
            the vast majority of care workers are suitably qualified and experienced 
            and treat elderly and disabled people with the care, dignity and respect 
            that they are rightly due; acknowledges that the Care Commission is 
            responsible for regulating standards of care, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should take measures to increase awareness amongst 
            the general public of the National Care Standards and the Care Commission's 
            role in monitoring adherence to these standards.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1281#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Breakthrough 
            Breast Cancer's Decision to Reject Nestl&eacute; Deal</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates Breakthrough Breast Cancer on the charity's 
            decision to reject a £1 million promotional deal with Nestl&eacute; 
            due to ethical concerns surrounding the company's promotion of formula 
            milk in the developing world; recognises that studies indicate that 
            a bottle-fed child living in poverty is up to&nbsp;14 times more likely 
            to die of diarrhoea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia 
            than breastfed infants; notes that companies such as Nestl&eacute; 
            make massive profits from artificial milk which they strive to make 
            as like mothers' milk as possible whilst the manufacturers of the 
            real thing, women, remain amongst the world's poorest and most oppressed; 
            believes that breastfeeding is the best way to feed babies; supports 
            the protection and promotion of breastfeeding, and considers that 
            Nestl&eacute; should adhere to the International Code of Marketing 
            of Breastmilk Substitutes as adopted by the World Health *Assembly* 
            in 1981.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1280#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>National 
            Breastfeeding Awareness Week 2004</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the vital role that National Breastfeeding Awareness Week, 9 to 15 
            May 2004, plays in the promotion and support of breastfeeding throughout 
            the United Kingdom; congratulates those health sector workers, volunteers 
            and mothers whose dedication and hard work have contributed to an 
            increase in the uptake and duration rates of breastfeeding in Scotland 
            in recent years, in particular, NHS Lanarkshire who, as one of the 
            first NHS boards to devise a breastfeeding strategy in Scotland, has 
            this week launched a comprehensive review to build on its previous 
            work; accepts that continued support and investment is needed at a 
            national level to move Scotland closer to the national breastfeeding 
            target of 50% of mothers still breastfeeding their babies at six weeks 
            of life by 2005; acknowledges the importance of empowering Scotland's 
            people and communities to make better and healthier lifestyle choices, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should do everything within 
            its power to support, promote, protect and encourage breastfeeding

            marking National Epilepsy Awareness Week; recognises the need for 
            greater education training in epilepsy awareness; considers that the

            foul of penalty charges introduced by the Health Act 1999; believes
