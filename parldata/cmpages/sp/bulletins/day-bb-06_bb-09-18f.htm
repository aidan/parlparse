<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4807</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>The Loch Lomond Food and Drink Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the second Loch Lomond Food and Drink Festival being held at Lomond Shores from 17 to 19 September 2006; congratulates the organisers for the success of last year&rsquo;s event which was visited by 25,000 people; believes that the wide range of activities including whisky tasting, the real ale festival, the chocolate extravaganza, the Loch Fyne oysters and champagne bar, the farmers&rsquo; market and cookery demonstrations from some of the country&rsquo;s top chefs, will attract more visitors than before, and acknowledges that festivals such as this are vital to our tourism industry and promote the best that Scotland has to offer in food, drink and scenery.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4806</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>The Future Starts Here - The Route to a Low Carbon Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report, <em>The Future Starts Here: The Route to a Low Carbon Economy</em>, based on research commissioned by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research; recognises the report as the United Kingdom&rsquo;s first comprehensive roadmap to a low-carbon economy which would deliver on government commitments to keep temperatures from rising beyond a critical point; acknowledges the report&rsquo;s conclusion that the UK Government has only four years to implement a major new programme of action to cut carbon emissions if the UK is to play its part in keeping global temperatures below danger levels; notes that UK carbon emissions have not fallen since 1990 if emissions from international shipping and aviation are taken into account; notes that, as a first step towards a low-carbon economy, Friends of the Earth is calling for a climate change bill to be introduced at Westminster which would commit the Government to reducing the carbon dioxide emissions by at least 3% year on year; recognises the parallel proposal by Mark Ruskell MSP for a climate change bill in the Scottish Parliament, and calls on MSPs of all parties to back calls for Scottish Ministers to commit to a 3% annual reduction in climate change emissions.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4805</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Hidden Cost of Nursing Grants</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the scheme to offer grants to internationally qualified nurses to overcome NHS skill shortages in rural areas but notes the damaging impact on developing countries of losing skilled doctors and nurses; further notes the example of Ghana, where life expectancy is 57 years and there are only nine doctors per 100,000 citizens, which since 1999 has lost more than it has trained, and believes that greater assistance must be offered to developing countries so that the healthcare of the most vulnerable people worldwide does not suffer as a result of the recruitment activity of wealthier nations.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4794.1</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Standard Life</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4794) in the name of Jim Mather, insert at end &quot;but notes that on 31 March 2004 Alex Salmond MP described the demutualisation of Standard Life, without which it could not have joined the FTSE 100, as &quot;a sad, bad day for the Scottish financial sector&quot;, and calls on the SNP to state whether this remains the official view of the party.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4793#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>John Thomson</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that September 2006 is the 75th anniversary of the tragic accident when John Thomson, a Protestant, the young Celtic goalkeeper aged 22, lost his life during a game; hopes that the people of Scotland will support the Parliament&rsquo;s call that John be admitted to the Scottish Football Museum Hall of Fame first and foremost on his merit in that he won four international caps, he was a goalkeeping legend and a Celtic regular at 18 years old having made 188 appearances for Celtic, his talent was recognised by so many and his following was evident when over 30,000 supporters joined the mourners at Bowhill Cemetery; considers that John Thomson is an abiding figure in Scotland&rsquo;s footballing history: a decent, modest young man who enjoyed the love and affection of his family and the respect and admiration of scores of thousands of Scots and that today we would describe him as an exemplary role model for youngsters; sends its best wishes to the people of Cardenden and a strong message of support to the Scottish Football Museum when it deliberates this month over the 2006 inductees to the Scottish Football Museum Hall of Fame, and, as it does so, asks for the view of the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport to be taken into account and for Sam English to be admitted at the same time.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4792</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>School Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the arbitrary rules set by local authorities by which the mileage limits for school transport are set; further notes that these rules can fail to take into consideration local geography and traffic conditions whereby school pupils may have to walk along busy main roads where school transport is denied, and calls on the Scottish Executive to advise local authorities to set school transport rules which take local geography and traffic conditions into consideration and are based on pupil safety.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4790</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Organic Aid Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that, out of 314 applications to the Organic Aid Scheme in 2006, only 157 applications were approved, of which only 55 were for ongoing maintenance payments as compared to 102 for conversion from conventional to organic agriculture; compares and contrasts this 50% approval rate with 97% for the preceding year; questions whether this decrease in the approval rate can be reconciled with the aspiration in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s <em>Organic Action Plan</em> &quot;to see Scottish organic products grow in market penetration so that they can meet at least 70% by value of overall Scottish consumer demand for organic products which can be sourced in Scotland&quot;, and calls on the Executive to take immediate action, both to support farmers and to meet market demand for Scottish organic produce.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4789</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of US and UK Governments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, on the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, notes the US Senate report which concludes that there was in fact no connection between Al Qaeda, the organisation responsible for the outrage, and Iraq&rsquo;s Saddam Hussein; notes that another of the alleged reasons for the illegal war in Iraq, namely that Saddam was responsible for the 9/11 attacks or was acting in conjunction with Bin Laden, has been exposed as being utterly bogus; believes that the slaughter of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of innocent Iraqis, which followed the deaths of thousands of innocent Americans on 9/11, means that both the US and UK governments stand condemned in the eyes of the peoples of the world, and supports the Time to Go protest outside the Labour Party conference in Manchester on 23 September 2006, organised by the Stop the War Coalition and others demanding the immediate withdrawal of UK troops from Iraq and opposing any US attempts to attack Iran.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4785</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Record Prisoner Numbers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuous increase in prisoner numbers in Scotland&rsquo;s prisons from an average of 5,362 in 2000-01 to an actual number of 7,178 as at 1 September 2006, an increase of over 33.86%; recognises that the record increase in prisoner numbers over the last six years has taken place during a period of sustained operational efficiency cuts that have resulted in significant reductions in the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) staff complement at all SPS establishments; acknowledges the additional strain placed on staff and the prison system by such record prisoner numbers; recognises that such overcrowding in Scotland&rsquo;s prisons is having a detrimental effect on the health and safety of staff and prisoners, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review urgently the current operational budget allocation of the SPS.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4783</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Action on Anti-Semitism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of Westminster&rsquo;s All Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism which was established to investigate the nature and extent of contemporary anti-Semitism throughout the United Kingdom; is disturbed at the rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the UK and the fact that this has been exacerbated by the war in the Middle East, and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement the group&rsquo;s recommendations, including applying the same victim-orientated standard to identifying anti-Semitic incidents as to other racist incidents,  better education about anti-Semitism in schools, a crackdown on anti-Jewish activity on university campuses, action to prevent the spread of anti-Semitic material online,  the provision of funding for physical security measures at minority places of worship and the provision of funding for projects that aim to develop good interfaith and intercommunal relations.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4781</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s 10-Year Health Failure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the review of the Scottish Diet Action Plan which has found that, despite numerous high-profile and costly information and advertising campaigns, the Scottish diet is today just as bad as it was 10 years ago; further notes that the bright spot on the horizon is the suggestion that healthier school meals and the introduction of free fruit in schools is beginning to alter children&rsquo;s eating habits but it is not enough as less than half our children take school meals; believes that the introduction of free healthy schools meals for all pupils 10 years ago would have had a big impact on the eating habits of a new generation; considers that the evidence is there internationally that Scotland needs less talk and more action; further considers that the introduction of free healthy school meals for all children would be a first important step to improving the health of our children and the next generation of adults, and believes that MSPs need to support this initiative now as we are running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4778</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Ferry Fares to the Western Isles</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that a study by the Highlands and Islands Transport Partnership in Scotland (HITRANS) estimated that 700 jobs and &pound;22 million a year in tourism revenue could be generated by cutting ferry fares to the Western Isles by 30%; believes that cutting ferry fares is environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial in terms of increased jobs and decreased costs for islanders, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide funding to allow a 30% cut in ferry fares as suggested by HITRANS.</p>
