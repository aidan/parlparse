              <strong>Drugs Courts</strong>—That the Parliament recognises the complex nature 
              of the drugs problem in Scotland; accepts that addressing the problem 
              requires effective law enforcement working in partnership with well 
              resourced rehabilitation and treatment strategies; acknowledges 
              the role that a system of specialist drugs courts could play in 
              dealing with drug-related crime; notes that the Scottish Drugs Forum 
              and CoSLA support the establishment of drugs courts, and calls upon 
              the Scottish Executive to develop an appropriate pilot scheme with 
              a view to moving towards the establishment of drugs courts in areas 
              of Scotland where adequate rehabilitation and treatment resources 
              exist, as proposed in the Scottish National Party’s 1999 Election 
              Manifesto. </font></p>
