<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4491</strong> <strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Vocational Qualifications Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the second annual Vocational Qualifications (VQ) Day on 24 June 2009 to celebrate vocational achievement and the many paths to success available to Scottish learners; congratulates Edge, the education foundation, and the wider vocational qualifications community on this initiative; recognises the value that vocational qualifications bring to Scotland&rsquo;s businesses, particularly in the current economic climate, and the need for re-skilling to assist eventual recovery, and welcomes the fact that VQ Day acknowledges the efforts and hard work of millions of learners of all ages with the national recognition and celebration that they deserve.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4490</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Calman Commission Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution&rsquo;s report, <em>Serving Scotland Better: Scotland and the United Kingdom in the 21st Century</em>, which is based firmly on evidence and engagement with the people of Scotland; thanks the chair and members of the commission for their work on behalf of the Parliament and the UK Government; agrees that the commission&rsquo;s report is a comprehensive response to the remit approved by the Parliament on 6 December 2007; welcomes the establishment of the steering group to take forward the report&rsquo;s recommendations to strengthen devolution and enable the Parliament, through new powers and responsibilities, to serve the people of Scotland better in the United Kingdom; calls on the Scottish Government to make fully available the resources of the Scottish administration to cooperate in this respect, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to continue to allocate appropriate resources and funding to enable the Parliament to support the work of the steering group and consider the recommendations that apply to the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4489</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>National Library?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes and deplores the decision of the National Library of Scotland to remove Saltires and items of tartan from workplaces across the organisation; notes further the implication in a string of internal emails by senior management that these items may be considered racist and may offend non-Scottish colleagues; considers that such attitudes and actions have not been evident in Scotland since the purging of tartan and other identifiable symbols of Scotland under the 1746 Disarming Act introduced by the Westminster Parliament, and calls on the National Library of Scotland to issue an unreserved apology over this apparent slur to the national flag of Scotland and other Scottish iconography.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4482</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>A New View for the Scottish Premier League</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the difficulties that the broadcaster, Setanta, has suffered; notes the decision of the Scottish Premier League (SPL) to take back from Setanta the rights to broadcast SPL games in the United Kingdom from the 2009-10 season onwards; further notes the decision of the SPL to seek a new television contract; believes that Scottish football fans and clubs would be best served by a free-to-air broadcaster winning the rights to these matches and urges free-to-air networks to make realistic attempts to secure the rights to more Scottish football television; further notes that the BBC has a firm form of funding through the licence payers&rsquo; money and a duty to the public in what it broadcasts; urges the BBC to recognise the cultural importance of such an opportunity to the Scottish viewing public, and asks it to make a competitive bid for the rights.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4481</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Suspected Ongoing Genocide in Sri Lanka</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave concern about the conditions suffered by Tamil civilians detained in camps in Sri Lanka; notes reports of human rights abuses suffered by the detainees, such as murder, rape, torture and deliberate denial of access to food, water and medicine; condemns Sri Lanka&rsquo;s refusal to allow independent observers and journalists to inspect the camps, noting its recent expulsion of Canadian MP Bob Rae and refusal of a visa to Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt, and believes that if the international community is denied access it should conclude that the government of Sri Lanka is perpetrating genocide and take appropriate action.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4480</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Jobcentre Plus Failing Job Seekers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the UK Government to address the disturbing conclusions of the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) report, <em>Now It&rsquo;s Personal: Personal advisors and the new public sector workforce</em>, which highlights significant inadequacies in the role of personal advisors and asserts that an upskilling of the advisor workforce is needed to increase service effectiveness; is concerned that soaring levels of unemployment have resulted in more people receiving back-to-work support from personal advisors at Jobcentre Plus than at any point since its creation in 2002; worries that major gaps exist in specialist training, including in relation to childcare, homelessness, drug and alcohol misuse and mental health problems, and that the needs of the most vulnerable groups in society are not being adequately addressed by personal advisors, and is concerned that, despite a &pound;1.7 billion allocation to the Department of Work and Pensions to increase the personal advisor network, evidence continues to suggest that low pay amongst Jobcentre Plus staff is resulting in a loss of skilled advisors and high levels of staff turnover, which means a lack of continuity in support for job seekers.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4479</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>New Homes at Garelochhead</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of Smiddy Court at Whistlefield, Garelochhead, the first ever housing development built by Argyll Community Housing Association; considers that these new-build houses are a welcome addition to the Helensburgh and Lomond area, which currently has almost 1,300 applicants on the housing waiting list; regards these four new completed homes and the further eight in development as a testament to the success of housing stock transfer in Argyll and Bute; believes that these new homes, built by local builder Callum Williamson, will assist in regenerating the community, creating jobs and building a sustainable future; congratulates all those who worked tirelessly to make this project happen, and calls on the Scottish Government to increase Housing Association Grant funding to ensure that developments such as this can be successfully delivered in the future.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4478</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Girlguiding Scotland 100th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 100th anniversary of Girlguiding Scotland (GGS) in 2009-10; recognises GGS, with 58,000 members, as the leading organisation for girls and young women in Scotland, with the first company in Scotland formed in Peebles in 1910; applauds the life-changing opportunities that GGS gives and has given to over a third of women all over Scotland, enabling them to unleash their potential and so serve their communities; acknowledges GGS as an inclusive, relevant organisation being open to any girls, regardless of creed, colour or class; notes that GGS embeds youth participation in planning and delivery and is committed to giving girls a voice, particularly through research reports, such as <em>Girls Shout Out</em>; praises GGS on its recent commitment, Change the World, by influencing its members to work with 18 charity partners and the &pound;750,000 raised; looks forward in anticipation to the centenary celebrations in 2009-10, and wishes Girlguiding Scotland every success in the future.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4476</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Child Safety Week, 22 to 28 June 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the beginning of Child Safety Week from 22 to 28 June 2009; recognises that unintentional injury is the most common cause of emergency hospital admissions and second only to cancers as a cause of death for Scottish children; recognises that the recently published 2009 <em>Child Safety Report Card</em> gave Scotland only a fair grading for progress toward reducing child injuries and injury-related death; accepts that too many Scottish children are unnecessarily hurt or killed each year through unintentional injuries that are largely preventable, and calls on the Scottish Government to provide stronger leadership, improved effort and increased resources for child injury prevention and child safety initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4475</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>The Mary Leishman Foundation&rsquo;s Dander for Mary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of the Mary Leishman Foundation, which is seeking to raise &pound;100,000 to support people with debilitating illnesses and help young people to achieve their full potential; congratulates the foundation on organising the hugely successful Dander for Mary, a sponsored walk along 81 miles of the Fife Coastal Path between 17 and 21 June 2009; pays tribute to all those who took part in the walk and in particular to their sponsors; wishes the foundation the very best for future fundraising, and notes with appreciation the ongoing work of the foundation to improve the quality of life and life chances for people across Fife.</p>
