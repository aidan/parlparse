          <p><strong>S1M-2575#</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Recruitment and 
            Retention Crisis in Social Work</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with concern that the crisis of recruitment and retention in the social 
            work profession is now acute, as evidenced by the fact that 78% of 
            local authorities who responded to a recent SNP survey highlighted 
            this as a serious concern; further notes that there has been an increase 
            in referrals and statutory obligations to childcare social work without 
            resources to meet the needs and that, where child poverty and deprivation 
            is highest, the crisis worsens, with some areas recently recording 
            a vacancy rate of 24% with 29% of cases unallocated; is concerned 
            that there has been a steady fall in applications to social work departments 
            over the last five years and that in consequence Scotland's most vulnerable 
            children and young people are being failed at a time when they are 
            most in need of support, and considers that the Executive should take 
            action to ensure that the role of childcare social workers is valued 
            and should as a matter of urgency make a commitment to a comprehensive 
            review of the terms and conditions of social workers which will address 
            the particular circumstances of the profession and improve the current 
            poor public image of social work for the benefit of all children in 
            need.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2574</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Imprisonment 
            of Ngawang Sangdrol</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the plight 
            of Buddhist nun Ngawang Sangdrol who, along with her fellow nuns from 
            the Garu monastery, was arrested and imprisoned in August 1990 for 
            attending a pro-independence demonstration in Lhasa; notes reports 
            which indicate that Ngawang Sangdrol is currently due to be released 
            in 2013 by which time she will be only 36 years old and yet will have 
            been imprisoned for 21 years, and expresses its support for Amnesty 
            International's campaign to have Ngawang Sangdrol released from prison 
            in Tibet.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson*, Brian Adam*, Mr Duncan Hamilton<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2571</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: F&egrave;isean 
            nan G&agrave;idheal</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates F&egrave;isean 
            nan G&agrave;idheal, the National Association of Gaelic Arts Youth 
            Tuition Festivals, on its work in the last year in involving over 
            3,600 young people in Gaelic cultural events, and commends the hard 
            work by all in the organisation in order to involve a new generation 
            of young people in Scotland's Gaelic heritage despite the present 
            range of difficult circumstances which face Gaelic, not least the 
            fact that the present shortage of Gaelic teachers results in the language 
            relying heavily on the goodwill of volunteers, such as those in F&egrave;isean 
            nan G&agrave;idheal.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson*, Brian Adam*, Mr Duncan Hamilton<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2570</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Act of Settlement</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the resolution of the House of Commons on 19 
            December 2001 giving leave for the Introduction of a Bill by Kevin 
            McNamara MP, and to be supported by Alex Salmond MP, which would abolish 
            the deeply offensive anti-Catholic provisions of the Act of Settlement; 
            congratulates the sponsors of this proposed Bill and is pleased that 
            they have paid tribute to the Scottish Parliament for its resolution 
            of 16 December 1999 on this matter and to the <em>Guardian</em> and 
            <em>Scotland on Sunday</em> newspapers for actively promoting the cause 
            for repeal; regrets that Her Majesty's Government has taken no action 
            on this matter despite indicating general support, and renews its 
            call for UK legislation at the earliest possible date.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson*, Brian Adam*, Mr Duncan Hamilton<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2568</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: International 
            Year of Mountains</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 2002 is 
            the International Year of Mountains; supports the event's aim of raising 
            public awareness of the high ecological value and wider socio-economic 
            significance of mountains; recognises the global importance of Scotland's 
            mountainous areas, particularly their role in shaping the nation's 
            image and culture, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to support 
            the year's celebrations by fostering debate between local communities, 
            farming interests, rural businesses, public bodies, and non-governmental 
            organisations on how to maximise the mutual benefit from activities 
            aimed at safeguarding, enhancing and promoting enjoyment of Scotland's 
            mountain heritage.</p>

            Mr Duncan Hamilton<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2567</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie: Death of Stuart 
            Adamson</strong>-That the Parliament notes the untimely death of Stuart 
            Adamson; acknowledges the invaluable contribution he made to contemporary 
            popular music in Scotland, particularly as lead singer with Big Country 
            and guitarist with The Skids; recognises the part he played in promoting 
            his home town of Dunfermline, and sends its condolences to his family.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2565 Margaret Smith on behalf of the Health and Community 
            Care Committee: Report on Hepatitis C</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to act upon, the recommendations 
            contained within the 17th Report 2001 of the Health and Community 
            Care Committee<em>, Report on Hepatitis C</em> (SP Paper 398). </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2564</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Citizens of a Multilingual 
            World</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the findings in the report 
            by the Action Group on Languages<em>, Citizens of a Multilingual World 
            </em>and the supportive statements made by Jack McConnell MSP when 
            Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs; notes however 
            the concerns of the Scottish Association of Language Teaching and 
            others regarding the delay in making the revised 5-14 curriculum guidance 
            available, which has hindered progress and much needed development 
            in modern languages in both the primary and secondary school sectors; 
            recognises that this regrettable delay in responding to the Group's 
            report, and the publication of Circular 3/2001<em>, Guidance on Flexibility 
            in the Curriculum</em>,<em> </em>in advance of this response, have led 
            to widespread speculation and misinterpretation of the principle of 
            "entitlement" as it is described in the Group's report, and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to end this uncertainty and pursue the 
            proposals in the report by means of a strategic implementation plan 
            without further delay and to provide local authorities and schools 
            with the responsibility and opportunity to improve language learning 
            throughout Scotland, so that each pupil and student is enabled to 
            fulfil his or her potential as a citizen of this multilingual world.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Ms Sandra White*, Mr Duncan Hamilton<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2563</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Education (Disability 
            Strategies and Pupils' Records) (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the 
            Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Education (Disability 
            Strategies and Pupils' Records) (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Nicol Stephen, Ms Margaret Curran</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2557#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Citizens Advice 
            Bureau, Greater Pollok</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the opening 
            of a Citizens Advice Bureau in Greater Pollok; notes that it has received 
            a remarkable number of enquiries already, 370 in its first month of 
            being open; further notes that local people have come forward to volunteer 
            and currently form 90% of the workforce in the bureau; congratulates 
            Greater Pollok Social Inclusion Partnership and Citizens Advice Scotland 
            on their partnership approach in working together to provide the necessary 
            funding<font color="#ff0000">, </font>and believes that the bureau 
            will complement the excellent work of the seven other bureaux in Glasgow 
            in tackling social exclusion through the provision of independent 
            advice, assistance and representation services.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2556#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Sheep Farming 
            around Loch Katrine</strong>-That the Parliament notes West of Scotland 
            Water's decision to cease its sheep farming operations around Loch 
            Katrine; recognises the potential effects this could have on the Trossachs 
            community; further notes the discussions that West of Scotland Water 
            is now having with local community groups, and urges West of Scotland 
            Water to work with all organisations, including the Scottish Executive, 
            to fully investigate the environmental, social and economic impact 
            this decision will have on the area and to use the integrated catchment 
            management plan as a basis to find solutions to sustain the local 
            community.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Brian Monteith, Mr Jamie McGrigor</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2553</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: First Aid 
            in Schools</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to make basic first aid a compulsory part of the school curriculum, 
            as it is in several other European countries; believes that secondary 
            school pupils could be a major new force in life saving and recognises 
            that even two hours training in a lifetime has led to lives being 
            saved; agrees with the ambulance service that lives are being wasted 
            because of a lack of rudimentary first aid in the first few minutes 
            after cardiac arrest; cites the splendid example of a 17 year-old 
            first aider, Scott Gavin of Holyrood RC Secondary School in Glasgow, 
            who rushed to the aid of a maths teacher, Brian Innes, when he collapsed 
            during a lesson and kept him alive until an ambulance arrived, and 
            applauds all voluntary training offered by the Red Cross and youth 
            organisations while believing that a national programme instilling 
            skill and confidence in every secondary pupil in the country is needed 
            and that this could be accomplished with minimal time and expense.

            group in proposing an additional 700 or more houses in the Bridge 
            of Don area despite a lack of adequate roads and other infrastructure; 
            welcomes the Group's incompetence in failing to persuade all its colleagues 
            to vote for the proposal, and calls on the Scottish Labour Party to 
            investigate the practices of its councillors in Aberdeen.</a></p>
