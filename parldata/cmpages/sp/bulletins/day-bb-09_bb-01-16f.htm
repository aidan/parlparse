<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3237</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Democracy in Belarus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the European Parliament&rsquo;s resolution on the EU strategy towards Belarus, aimed at achieving greater democratisation in the country often branded Europe&rsquo;s last dictatorship and which sets out the conditions that Belarus is required to meet in order to end the country&rsquo;s self-imposed isolation from the rest of Europe, urging the Belarusian Government to respect human rights, including guaranteeing freedom for political prisoners, freedom of expression for the media and political parties, and the legal establishment of non-governmental organisations (NGOs); condemns the Belarusian Government for continuing to deny its people the basic right of freedom of speech, and urges the European Union not to renew the period of six months during which travel restrictions imposed on certain Belarusian Government officials have been lifted, unless positive steps towards greater democratisation are clearly visible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3236</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>GHA Tenant&rsquo;s Back Queens Cross Housing Association</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Queens Cross Housing Association on the results of a tenant survey conducted by IBP Strategy and Research showing that almost 70% of tenants surveyed in the Dundasvale, South Maryhill and Hamiltonhill areas are in support of transferring ownership of their homes from Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) to Queens Cross Housing Association (QCHA); welcomes the series of local meetings organised by QCHA to consult further with tenants and hopes all tenants will engage in this process; notes that this important part of the process of second-stage transfer (SST) comes in the wake of the five successful SST ballots in Parkhead, Cassiltoun, Ardglen, Glasgow West and Shettleston, and welcomes this as further evidence that tenants continue to see GHA as a temporary organisation for the delivery of community ownership through second-stage stock transfer to community-based housing associations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3235</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Appointment of Chair of the Board of the Scottish Qualifications Authority</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning on Monday 12 January 2009 of the appointment of Councillor Graham Houston as chair of the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA); also notes that Councillor Houston also holds a high profile political position in a local authority and that in this role he will be called on to participate in national and local meetings where matters relating to national qualifications will be discussed; further notes that as chair of the SQA he will be called on to make decisions relating to individual schools and local authorities, including on charging policies and performance-related issues; expresses concern about the direct conflict of interest that occurs should one individual hold these two positions, this conflict arising regardless of the abilities, experience and party affiliation of the individual and which would be particularly inappropriate in the context of the management and delivery of examinations and qualifications, which should be independent of party politics, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to recognise this direct conflict of interest and to review the appointment as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3234</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Hears All About It</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its commendations to <em>The Talking Glaswegian</em>, an excellent project that has been running for almost 18 years, whereby articles are selected from <em>The Glaswegian</em> newspaper, recorded and subsequently compiled as a tape and mailed on a weekly basis to over 300 visually-impaired people across the city and recognises and extols the hard work of the organiser of the Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme, Clare Morgan, and volunteers who make this service available, ensuring that local news is made accessible to those who are visually impaired.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3233</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>University of the West of Scotland Nursery Provision</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) to close its on-site nursery at Paisley; notes that out of 10 other Scottish universities surveyed only two do not currently provide on-site nursery places; regrets that up to 30 jobs are threatened across the Paisley and Hamilton campuses; notes that student parents fear being unable to complete their courses; calls on UWS to appreciate that substitute financial assistance may not necessarily be an answer, given that many external nurseries have constraints that do not align with the university&rsquo;s course timetables, and, in consequence, urges the UWS to review the closure proposal, re-examine the existing costs and fee structure and explore other means of generating income before any decision is taken.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3232</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Dwelly&rsquo;s Gaelic Dictionary Online</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Mr William Robertson and Mr Michael Bauer on making <em>Dwelly&rsquo;s Gaelic Dictionary</em> available online for the first time at www.dwelly.info with both English to Gaelic and Gaelic to English search facilities and expresses its support for their continuing work to create <em>Am Faclair Beag</em>, a modern, comprehensive online English-Gaelic dictionary including sound clips, examples of word usage and strong involvement from the Gaelic community.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3231</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Central Citizens Advice Bureau</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow Central Citizens Advice Bureau on its 70th anniversary; notes that this service, which was officially opened on 15 January 1939, was the first Citizens Advice Bureau in Scotland, and recognises that its highly trained volunteers and salaried staff continue to offer advice and guidance on a wide variety of subjects.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3230</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>War of Terror is Mistaken and Misleading</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of an article in <em>The Guardian </em>on 15 January 2009 by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Miliband MP, in which he argues that the notion of a war on terror is mistaken and misleading; believes, however, that the millions of people across the world who marched against the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 could have told Mr Miliband this at the time; agrees that the use of rhetoric about a war on terror has in fact helped to fuel the extremism and terrorism that it was supposed to combat, and calls on Mr Miliband to take steps to introduce the ethical foreign policy first promised by his New Labour predecessor, Robin Cook, in 1997.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3229</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>New Clydesdale Year of Homecoming Banknotes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the terms of motion S3M-01214 (Commemoration by the Scottish Clearing Banks of the 250th Anniversary of the Birth of Robert Burns), lodged by Willie Coffey MSP on 24 January 2008; welcomes the announcement by the Clydesdale Bank, which has been producing banknotes since 1838 and is currently Scotland&rsquo;s largest supplier of banknotes, that it is to issue a new family of banknotes celebrating the best of Scotland&rsquo;s heritage, people and culture to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns and the Year of Homecoming; welcomes the continued recognition of Robert Burns on the &pound;10 note and of other prominent Scots, including King Robert the Bruce, suffragette and surgeon Elsie Inglis, architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh and scientist Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, on other notes, and further welcomes the fact that the commemorative notes will remain in issue for years after as a continuing reminder of the Year of Homecoming.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3228</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Naming of New Prison</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the ongoing debate within the community of Bishopbriggs regarding the naming of the new prison; acknowledges the fact that the prison is to be built using public money and not the discredited PPP/PFI scheme, saving the taxpayer millions of pounds; notes that the title HMP Bishopbriggs is described as a working title being used by the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) and that a final name has not yet been decided; calls on the SPS to consider as a matter of urgency the working title of the prison, and recommend that the new establishment be called HMP Low Moss, both as a working title and once it is complete.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3228.1</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Naming of New Prison</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3228) in the name of Stuart McMillan, leave out from &quot;the fact&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the delay caused to the start of construction is due to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s failure to introduce the Scottish Futures Trust as a funding mechanism, and recommends that the Scottish Prison Service changes the working title to HMP Low Moss and that this should remain the name of the new prison when it is finally built.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3227</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Reverse Vending Recycling Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Stagecoach Bluebird and Aberdeenshire Council for the roll out of Scotland&rsquo;s first reverse vending recycling project; notes that, as well as providing an easy recycling point, the scheme actively encourages recycling by giving green points for each item deposited in the machine; welcomes that these green points can then be used to claim eco vouchers, giving recyclers money off their bus travel, and therefore hopes that more transport companies and local authorities will follow this example and commit to encouraging recycling while promoting the use of public transport.</p>
