            Timber Industry</strong>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges the 
            value of timber as a primary product within rural Scotland and the 
            11,000 jobs which are dependent on that industry; recognises the very 
            real difficulties faced by some rural local authorities in maintaining 
            and improving minor roads for timber extraction, and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should meet COSLA&#146;s Rural Affairs Committee 
            and representatives of the forestry industry to determine a satisfactory 
            way forward, recognising that the placing of weight restriction orders, 
            which effectively landlock large areas of mature timber, is not a 
            realistic solution. <strong><em>R</em></strong></p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2951</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Eigg's Ferry 
            Terminal and Pier</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            that the cost of the ferry terminal and pier at Kildonnan in Eigg, 
            approved by the First Minister, will be £260,000 of public money for 
            each of the 30 residents&#146; cars on Eigg; further notes that only 
            the cars of Eigg residents may use the car ferry due to the traffic 
            order that prevents non-residents taking cars to Eigg, and believes 
            that mainland taxpayers, who have contributed so generously to the 
            ferry terminal and pier, should be granted the use of it and that 
            the traffic order which prevents them driving their own vehicles in 
            Eigg should be withdrawn.</p>

            the United Nation&#146;s Special Session on Children 2002 which will 
            take place in New York on 8 - 10 May 2002; commends the recognition 
            accorded by the summit to the need for adults to listen to the views 
            of young people; considers that the Scottish Executive should regularly 
            monitor and report on the implementation of commitments by Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government that arise from the Special Session and relate to Scotland&#146;s

            fit for children&quot; event in Edinburgh to coincide with this summit, 
            and believes that a &quot;Children and Young People&#146;s Summit&quot;

            to end and insert &quot;and competitor European economies over the 
            post war period; further notes that the efforts of enterprise development 
            agencies and initiatives within the uniform UK economic policy regime 
            have had no apparent effect on our relative economic decline throughout 
            the period and that the gap in performance would appear to have widened 
            more recently; believes that the policy and debate in Scotland has 
            so far been focused on dealing with the symptoms of this relative 
            economic decline rather than its root causes, and calls for a refocusing 
            of the political debate in Scotland on the potential for the acquisition 
            and use of the range of financial and economic powers available to 
            competitor states such as Ireland and Finland and the optimal policy 
            mix required to place the Scottish economy at the competitive advantage 
            required to achieve faster growth, higher living standards and an 
            improved revenue stream to resource sustained investment in public

            for sustained success in relation to our key objectives: global connections,

            that the Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive has failed to reverse 
            these damaging Tory policies, and further regrets that the Scottish 
            Executive&#146;s latest transport strategy publication, <em>Scotland&#146;s 
            Transport: Delivering Improvements</em>, provides no programme, no
