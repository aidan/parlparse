          <p><strong>*S1M-3278</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Classification 
            of Cannabis</strong>-That the Parliament, recognising the change in the 
            classification of cannabis and the potential of this change to impact 
            on recreational drug use in Scotland, urges the Scottish Executive 
            to appoint a Commission on Cannabis, which would monitor and research 
            the drug's use by socio-economic, age and geographical classifications 
            and compare its effect on public behaviour and its demands on public 
            services with those of alcohol use.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3277</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Levenmouth 
            Drug and Alcohol Project</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 
            Levenmouth Drug and Alcohol Project in Fife for its much valued services 
            and enthusiastic and dedicated commitment shown by the staff, particularly 
            its work on drug and solvent abuse with younger members of the local 
            community.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3276#</strong> <strong>George Lyon: Gourock to Dunoon 
            Ferry Service</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the Executive 
            proposal to restrict Gourock to Dunoon ferry services to passenger-only 
            in the draft Invitation to Tender for Clyde and Hebrides ferry services 
            currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne; further notes that this 
            proposal undermines action to upgrade Dunoon pier and transport links 
            at Gourock pier; further notes the total opposition of the local community 
            to this proposal, and considers that the Executive should find an 
            alternative proposal that includes a vehicle-carrying ferry and satisfies 
            European competition rules.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3275</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Presbytery 
            of Jedburgh</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed 
            closure of Leslie House, the Church of Scotland's eventide home in 
            Fife; further notes that the Presbytery of Jedburgh agreed the following 
            deliverance: "(i) The Presbytery of Jedburgh believes the Scottish 
            Executive is neglecting responsibility in adequately funding the care 
            of elderly people in residential homes; recognises that it is this 
            situation and that of increased regulation which has forced the decision 
            ratified by the General Assembly of 2002 to close Leslie House; and 
            urges the Scottish Executive to attend to the plight of the elderly 
            in residential care homes and to make provision for the adequate funding 
            of their care and (ii) Presbytery instructs the Clerk to transmit 
            this deliverance to the Scottish Executive, to local MSPs and to the 
            Board of Social Responsibility"; fully supports the Presbytery of 
            Jedburgh in this deliverance, and accordingly calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to address the care gap as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3274#</strong> <strong>George Lyon: Organic Farming 
            Action Plan</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">welcomes 
            the introduction of an "Organic Scotland" label; believes that Scotland 
            can benefit from increased promotion of its quality farmed goods, 
            including organic goods; notes that an Organic Action Plan is urgently 
            needed to address marketing and supply chain difficulties in the Scottish 
            organic sector, and believes that organic farming can operate as part 
            of a sustainable and market-oriented Scottish agricultural industry.</a></p>
