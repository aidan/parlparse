          <p><strong>S1W-19445</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
            what impact the level of Aggregates Tax will have on local government

            of all of the provisions of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) 
            Act 2000 are outweighed by the continued possession of powers of feudal

            of Minutes of Waiver.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-19449</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive
