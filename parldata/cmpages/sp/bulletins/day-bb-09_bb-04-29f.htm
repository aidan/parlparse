<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4007</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, on the second anniversary of the election of the Scottish Government, the index of its broken promises contains more references to education than any other area of public policy; believes that the failures of the SNP on teachers and teaching are potentially the most damaging to the long-term interests of Scotland; notes the drop of 1,000 in the number of teachers in Scotland&rsquo;s schools despite the SNP promise to maintain numbers; regrets the microscopic progress on class size reductions; recalls the failure to offer ongoing job opportunities for newly qualified teachers and laments the pressure on teacher training places when demand for such places from talented graduates remains high, and calls for the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to publish, by the end of the school year and in time for September, a detailed workforce plan for teaching that can restore teacher numbers, increase training places, get newly qualified teachers into work in schools and provide assurance that the Scottish Government is prepared to learn from the mistakes of the first half of its term of office as it embarks on its second.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4006</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>The Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the UK Budget and the plans to increase fuel duty; recognises the high premium over the national average paid for fuel at filling stations in remote rural and particularly island areas and the financial and social impact that this has on individuals and businesses; believes that increased fuel duty will have a damaging effect on the economy and competitiveness in these areas, not least due to the limited public transport alternatives; notes that current EU law allows fuel duty to be cut by up to 2.4p per litre and that this power is already used in France, Portugal and Greece, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the UK Government and the European Commission before the final passage of the Finance Bill to construct a derogation under the EU energy products directive, or otherwise, to permit variable rates of duty for specified remote rural areas to bring down the price of fuel at the pump to that available in other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4005</strong> <strong>Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Tenth Anniversary of the National Minimum Wage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that April 2009 marks the tenth anniversary of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 coming into force; further notes that the introduction of the Act resulted in an immediate wage increase for some two million people; believes that the Act represents one of the most important pieces of social justice legislation of the 20th century, which complimented the policies pursued by the new Scottish Executive following its election later the same year; considers that the experience of the national minimum wage confounded predictions by the Conservative Party, including several members of the current UK shadow cabinet, that it would cost jobs, and regrets the fact that, despite their rhetoric before and since, not one Scottish National Party member voted for the legislation when it was finally passed in the House of Commons.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4004</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Budget Implications for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the contents of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s Budget last week; recognises that this is a product of poor financial management of the UK economy in recent years that will leave unprecedented burdens of debt for many years to come; acknowledges the significant pressure that the reduction of planned budgets of &pound;500 million will have on public services, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward budget proposals for 2010-11 that will support a sustainable economy and effective public services and include an assessment of the carbon impact of its budget.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4003&diams; </strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Supporting Our Local Newspaper Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Local Newspaper Week, 11 to 17 May 2009, and recognises the crucial role played by Scotland&rsquo;s local newspapers in providing a news service to their local communities; particularly notes the work of northern papers including <em>The Inverness Courier, Highland News, North Star, The Northern Scot, Ross-shire Journal and West Highland Free Press, </em>which serve, at times, a scattered and remote population; further notes the benefits to community engagement and the democratic process of the traditional local newspaper industry; acknowledges the increased pressures faced by the local newspaper industry due to falling circulation, loss of advertising revenue and increased competition from internet-based services, and considers that printed newspapers have served for centuries as a source of information on community affairs.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4002</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Adult Learners&rsquo;  Week 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Adult Learners&rsquo; Week 2009, running from 9 to 15 May, and notes that National Learning at Work Day, the biggest annual celebration of workplace learning, will take place on Thursday 14 May; believes that lifelong learning should be available and accessible to all; endorses the work of trade unions in making lifelong learning a reality for workers; notes the importance of partnership in delivering successful workplace learning projects and, in particular, the excellent work of the Lowlands and Uplands Scotland trade union education projects, in providing flexible, shift-friendly courses to union members in a familiar and relaxed environment; commends all those involved in delivering the projects for their hard work and commitment in making adult learning accessible in companies across Scotland; notes that from April 2008 to March 2009 there were Lowlands and Uplands Scotland courses involving 566 students in a diverse range of workplaces across Scotland, including Rolls Royce plants at Inchinnan, Dalgety Bay and East Kilbride, Remploy plants at Clydebank, Stirling and Cowdenbeath, NHS Tayside, Dounreay Power Station and Yoker and Ayr railway stations; further notes that, in the last quarter alone, the projects have provided personal advice and guidance on learning to 926 individuals; celebrates the learning achievements of all those involved, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that workplace learning receives the sustainable funding it needs to ensure that lifelong learning is accessible to every Scottish worker.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4001</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Wake-up Call for the Scottish Government</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the open letter on student hardship sent to the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning and signed by Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat MSPs, further and higher education spokespeople, Gurjit Singh, NUS president, and 25 other student leaders at colleges and universities across Scotland; highlights that the letter criticises the Scottish Government for its focus on reducing graduate debt to date, ignoring the growing student hardship crisis in Scottish colleges and universities; further highlights that the letter calls for the Scottish Government to take a new direction by focussing the existing resources for student support on reducing student hardship; considers that student support levels in Scotland have fallen far behind the rest of the United Kingdom, with a maximum of &pound;4,510 for most Scottish students compared to a maximum of &pound;6,200 for students from England; believes that the Scottish Government should use the open letter as a wake-up call to come forward with new priorities for the &pound;30 million allocated to the student support budget next year to tackle student hardship, based on the principles of reaching a minimum income of &pound;7,000 for the poorest students, increasing student loans and bursaries to address students&rsquo; continuing reliance on commercial credit and providing additional funds for hardship and childcare funds, and calls on the SNP to rethink its priorities, to begin finally to listen to students and to work with opposition parties and NUS and student leaders to bring forward new policies, using existing resources, to begin to tackle student hardship in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3997</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Helensburgh and Lomond Community Spirit Awards 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Joan Mulroy on winning Citizen of the Year at the Helensburgh and Lomond Community Spirit Awards 2009; notes that Joan has worked tirelessly to further the cause of people with learning disabilities in the community since 1988; acknowledges that Joan led the development of the Changed Days Advocacy Project and the Good Life Positive Attitudes Group as well as being vice-chair of the local branch of Enable; applauds all her efforts and the hard work and determination of all the other winners in their individual categories, and thanks the <em>Helensburgh Advertiser</em> and the Rotary Club of Helensburgh Garelochside for organising a fantastic event, which deservedly recognised the achievements of the many talented individuals and groups in Helensburgh and Lomond.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3996</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Israel&rsquo;s Militarised Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Jewish Voice for Peace for drawing attention to what it considers to be the Israeli Government&rsquo;s&nbsp;harassment of Israeli peace activists belonging to New Profile, involving the confiscation of their computers, their being called for interrogation and their subsequent release on condition of promising not to contact their political friends for 30 days; agrees with New Profile that Israel need not be a militarised society and that the recent acts of the Israeli Government confirm that the militarism of society in Israel harms the sacred principles of democracy, freedom of expression and freedom of political association, and calls on the Israeli Government to cease the harassment of peace activists immediately, to recognise the right of conscientious objection and to release all those imprisoned for refusing to serve in a military capacity in support of the ongoing occupation of Palestinian territory and in support of the continued violation of the human rights of both Palestinians and many Israelis.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3995</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>The Human Cost of Alcohol Misuse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges BMA Scotland&rsquo;s recent report, <em>The human cost of alcohol misuse: Doctors speak out</em>, which highlights the local and national statistics on alcohol and its impact on people&rsquo;s health, showing that between 2007 and 2008, 42,430 acute general discharges from hospital with an alcohol-related diagnosis were registered in Scotland and that 1,687 alcohol-related deaths were registered in 2007 alone; considers that these are worrying figures that demonstrate that Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol is in need of radical change, and welcomes BMA Scotland&rsquo;s recommendations, which very much reflect the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals for tackling alcohol misuse, including the introduction of minimum retail pricing, improved product labelling and the regulation of irresponsible promotions.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3994.1</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3994) in the name of Alex Neil, leave out from &quot;10 years&quot; to end and insert &quot;30 years; urges the Scottish Government to engage proactively with the 26 local authorities yet to transfer their housing stock with a view to effecting stock transfers to community-based housing associations with the consent of the tenants of these homes, thus achieving the write-off of Scotland&rsquo;s estimated &pound;2 billion housing debt and facilitating further investment in affordable housing in Scotland, and rejects the further restrictions on the right to buy proposed in the draft Housing (Scotland) Bill as being unfair and failing to meet the aspirations of many of today&rsquo;s tenants.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3994.2</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3994) in the name of Alex Neil, after &quot;financial sector&quot; insert &quot;; further recognises the particular need for more high quality affordable housing in the rental sector and the economic imperative of action to support Scotland&rsquo;s beleaguered building industry&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3994.3</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3994) in the name of Alex Neil, leave out from &quot;the steps&quot; to end and insert &quot;with concern the latest Scottish Government housing statistics showing a 29% decline in the building of housing association houses in the first three quarters of 2008 compared to the previous year; believes that affordable house building has been&nbsp;damaged by the SNP government&rsquo;s decision to cut the Housing Association Grant&nbsp;at a time when borrowing from the financial sector is particularly challenging; further notes the latest available figures showing that all but one council house built since May 2007 have been by Midlothian Council in a programme that commenced prior to the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections; further believes that the Scottish Government has failed to put in place adequate measures for financial and legal protection for householders facing repossession; further notes the proposals outlined in the consultation on the draft Housing (Scotland) Bill to reform the right to buy as well as the existing restrictions introduced by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 but believes that these proposals are in themselves no substitute for building affordable energy-efficient houses, and&nbsp;therefore calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the &pound;45 million in Barnett consequentials for Scotland arising from housing spending in the UK Budget are allocated in full towards more affordable housing for Scotland.&quot;</p>
