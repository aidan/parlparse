          <p><strong>*S2M-598#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Co-operative 
            Group Fair Trade Coffee</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Co-operative Group on the launch of its fair trade coffee; notes 
            that all Co-op brand coffee is now from fair-traded sources; recognises 
            that no other retailer in the UK has taken this important step; acknowledges 
            the longstanding, pioneering and courageous role of the Co-op and 
            the Co-operative movement in promoting fair trade; applauds the decision 
            of the Co-op to extend its fair trade range and continue to put its 
            founding principles and values into practice, and considers that other 
            retailers should reflect and act upon the lead taken by the Co-op.<strong><em>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-597</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Compulsory 
            National Identity Cards</strong>-That the Parliament does not support 
            the principle of compulsory national identity cards.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-596</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Fairtrade 
            Initiative at the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the plight of coffee-growing communities across the world, largely 
            caused by a collapse of global coffee prices; notes that the Fairtrade 
            contract guarantees a high, stable price to grower co-operatives in 
            return for high standards of quality and environmental care and pays 
            growers a social premium on top of the basic price to be used democratically 
            for community projects; welcomes initiatives to promote Fairtrade 
            coffee and other Fairtrade products, and encourages MSPs to attend 
            the coffee morning organised by the Scottish Co-op in conjunction 
            with the Fairtrade Foundation and Oxfam at the Friends Meeting House 
            in Edinburgh on Thursday 13 November 2003 from 10.00 to 11.30 am at 
            which a major new Fairtrade initiative will be announced.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-595#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>MMR 
            Vaccine</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned that the number 
            of children who have been immunised against measles, mumps and rubella 
            is too low; acknowledges that the weight of current scientific evidence 
            does not establish a link between the MMR vaccination and autism but 
            recognises that many parents are still concerned about the safety 
            of the vaccine, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make 
            the single vaccine available to those parents who request it in order 
            to ensure that the level of immunisation against measles, mumps and 
            rubella is maintained at a level which protects children against these 
            dangerous diseases.</P>

            <strong>Celebrating 150 Years of Public Libraries in Scotland</strong>-As

            leave out from &quot;and, in particular&quot;, to end and insert &quot;; 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to secure funding for the People's 
            Network beyond the cessation of New Opportunities Fund support in 
            April 2004; recognises the important part that local authorities have 
            played, and continue to play, in providing library services, and urges 
            the Executive to enable local authorities to reverse the recent trend 
            of a decline in the proportion of funds spent on libraries.&quot;</P>

            Scotland's librarians but notes with concern falling visitor numbers 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to do all it can to reverse this 
            situation; notes that libraries have great potential as community 
            hubs and that their outreach and social inclusion functions are vital 
            and often overlooked and applauds those libraries that are imaginatively 
            tackling these important issues, and further congratulates those libraries 
            that have put their catalogues online and engaged fully with new technology, 
            enabling more of the population to access them.&quot;</P>

            Child Protection in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-593) 
            in the name of Peter Peacock, insert at end &quot;; acknowledges the 
            findings of Susan O'Brien QC's inquiry into the death of Caleb Ness, 
            and as a result calls for greatly improved co-operation and communication 
            between agencies along with new arrangements that encourage greater 
            responsibility and accountability within the child protection system.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-593.2</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Reforming 
            Child Protection in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-593) 
            in the name of Peter Peacock, insert at end &quot;; notes the continuing 
            shortage of social workers, particularly in the child and family teams 
            and that the current initiatives will not produce sufficient new workers 
            to fill these vacancies and replace those due to retire; recognises 
            that the current situation of local authorities competing with each 
            other to attract staff is counter-productive; notes that there is 
            a need to invest significantly to retain and attract future staff; 
            regrets the continuing scapegoating of social workers when things 
            go wrong which only serves to undermine the confidence of staff and 
            contributes to the difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff, 
            and recognises the extremely valuable work that social workers carry 
            out every day making significant contributions to the lives of children 
            and their families.&quot;</P>

            scale, pace and range of staff recruitment in social work and child 
            care and protection to ensure there are sufficient, well-paid staff 
            to meet current and projected needs, and agrees to review the role 
            and powers of the Social Work Services Inspectorate in this area.&quot;</P>
