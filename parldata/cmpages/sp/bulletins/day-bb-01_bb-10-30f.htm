          <p><strong>*S1M-2377</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Asylum Seekers and Refugee Integration</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive's commitment to work 
            in partnership with the public, private and voluntary sector to welcome 
            and integrate asylum seekers and refugees to Scotland and further 
            welcomes the Executive's commitment to build improved dialogue with 
            asylum seekers and refugees and host communities and, through partnership 
            working, enable the provision of more accessible, co-ordinated and 
            good quality services, protection from the threat of racist attacks 
            and harassment, and the sharing of good practice to assist the integration 
            of refugees.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2376</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Use of Cannabis</strong>-That 
            the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to establish a commission 
            of experts and lay persons to examine and report on the social and 
            medical factors affecting the use of cannabis, following the recent 
            announcement by the Home Secretary regarding reclassification of the 
            drug. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2375</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Literature on Scottish History, 
            Heritage and Culture</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Professor 
            Michael Lynch, his editorial team, contributors and the Oxford University 
            Press on the publication of <i>The Oxford Companion to Scottish History</i>; 
            notes that 10% of the half million or so words in the companion are 
            devoted to Scots overseas; asserts that this book will provide an 
            indispensable and invaluable addition to the growing academic but 
            accessible literature on Scottish history, heritage and culture, and 
            expresses its gratitude to all those who are working to ensure that 
            the study and practice of these subjects overcomes generations of 
            mainstream neglect, indifference and hostility and, by so doing, contributes 
            greatly to the re-emergence of a confident, outward looking nation 
            which is more than capable of taking its independent place in the 
            world.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2374</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Close the Cattle Incinerator 
            at Carntyne, Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">totally 
            opposes dead cattle being incinerated in the built-up area of Carntyne 
            in Glasgow, under the national BSE Surveillance Scheme; believes that 
            such an operation, involving fallen stock at official &quot;high risk&quot; 
            of BSE and which involves the heads of hundreds of animals being removed 
            and the carcasses incinerated before brain stem tests for BSE are 
            returned from laboratories should never take place within a city; 
            is shocked that the incinerator at Carntyne, which is in the built-up 
            area of the East End of Glasgow, next to housing and playing fields 
            and near schools, is undergoing tests prior to re-opening; notes that 
            residents have already been subjected to smoke and smells which caused 
            the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to close the burner temporarily; 
            supports the aims of the BSE Surveillance Scheme in discovering how 
            much BSE remains in British herds; believes that it is intolerable 
            that part of this operation is being inflicted on Glasgow when it 
            could be moved to an area where there is little pollution risk to 
            people, and supports the current united efforts of East End Community 
            Councillors, Glasgow City Councillors and MSPs from all parties who 
            demand that the cow burner at Carntyne is closed permanently and the 
            interests of the local people put first. </a></p>
