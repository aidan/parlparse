<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4833</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Allan Thomas on Winning Bighearted Scotland 2009 Fundraising Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Allan Thomas on winning the Fundraiser of the Year award at the Bighearted Scotland 2009 Awards for his efforts in support of Cancer Link Aberdeen and North (CLAN); notes that CLAN is an independent charity that supports those affected by all types of cancer, from diagnosis onwards, whether affected personally, as a family member, carer or friend; also notes that, from its base in Aberdeen and services in Ballater, Inverurie, Kirkwall, Peterhead and Stonehaven, CLAN offers support to people in Grampian, Orkney and Shetland; further notes that CLAN&nbsp;offers a wide range of services including information, support, counselling, complementary therapies, family support, social events and activities and accommodation; notes that Mr Thomas, supported by the exceptional fundraising efforts of others, has raised almost &pound;50,000 to date; also notes that part of the fundraising effort involved Mr Thomas climbing 29,029 feet to the summit of Mount Everest; further notes CLAN&rsquo;s 123 campaign, which was launched in March this year, whereby the one (1) charity alone has two (2) years to raise three (3) million pounds; commends the work of CLAN to date and the efforts of the fundraising team members, and wishes them all the best in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4832</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Diageo&rsquo;s Social Responsibility</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by Diageo that it is intent on closing its plants at Port Dundas and Kilmarnock; regrets that this decision was made in spite of widespread support for the campaign to save jobs at both sites and the loyalty and commitment of its workforce; believes that Diageo must recognise its continuing responsibility to the workers at both plants, and asks the Scottish Government to indicate what it will do to ensure that Diageo recognises and honours that commitment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4831</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>110 Years of Mackintosh in Maryhill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 110th anniversary of the opening of the former St Matthew&rsquo;s Free Church of Scotland at Queen&rsquo;s Cross in Glasgow; recognises this important example of the work of its architect, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the only church designed by him to be completed; congratulates the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society for ensuring the building&rsquo;s sympathetic renovation, and wishes the society well as it celebrates this important landmark.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4830</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Island Emigrants</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Islands Book Trust on organising the Island Emigrants - Emigration from the Outer Hebrides three-day conference taking place from Thursday 10 September to Saturday 12 September 2009 in Leverburgh, Isle of Harris; notes that this official Year of Homecoming event and conference follows a number of successful conferences organised by the Islands Book Trust with the aim of bringing together knowledgeable speakers from different backgrounds to further understanding and enjoyment of the history of the Scottish islands in their wider context, and welcomes the aims of this conference to bring together outstanding speakers, local people, visitors to the islands and descendants of families who left from the Outer Hebrides over the last 250 years to consider the remarkable story of emigration from the islands to places such as Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
