          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2206</strong> <STRONG>Trish Godman:</STRONG> <STRONG>Abolition of Tolls on Erskine Bridge</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the abolition of the tolls on the Erskine Bridge would help to relieve congestion and pollution problems on other river crossings; further considers that the local economies on either side of the Clyde would be likely to benefit, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to move quickly to complete the work needed so that the tolls on the bridge can be removed.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Des McNulty<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Jackie Baillie<STRONG>*</strong></P>
          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2205</strong> <STRONG>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</STRONG> <STRONG>Free Christmas Trees</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the Jerusalem Municipality&rsquo;s free distribution of Christmas trees which will take place today, 23 December 2004; recognises that the Christmas tree distribution is a long-standing tradition of the Jerusalem Municipality which has taken place for dozens of years and which is symbolic of the way that Jerusalem unites all three monotheistic religions; welcomes the generosity of the Jewish National Fund which donated the trees, and echoes the sentiments of the mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, in wishing a merry Christmas to the Christian residents of Jerusalem and a year of peace, tolerance and brotherhood.</P>
          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2204</strong> <STRONG>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</STRONG> <STRONG>Ritalin Concern</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply concerned at the 10-fold increase in Ritalin prescribing found by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland; notes that 13% of all prescriptions for 6 to 14-year-olds in Fife were for Ritalin; does not believe that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder occurs at these levels amongst children, and calls for an urgent review to be conducted into why Ritalin prescribing has been adopted as a blanket response to adults&rsquo; difficulties with children&rsquo;s behaviour and into the long-term effects on mental health of medically-induced drug dependency in young children.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Frances Curran<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Roseanna Cunningham<STRONG>*</strong></P>
          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2203</strong> <STRONG>Donald Gorrie:</STRONG> <STRONG>The Parliamentary Restaurant</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to set the objectives of removing the subsidy to the Members&rsquo; dining room by increasing prices to a more realistic economic level and maximizing its use and availability for all people working in the Parliament while, at the same time, providing booking arrangements for MSPs and their guests to enable them, with due notice, to be accommodated and provided with a speedier service than currently exists.</P>
