<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7670 Michael Matheson: Green Bus Fund Good for Jobs in Camelon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the creation of the &pound;4.4 million Scottish Green Bus Fund established by the Scottish Government; considers that this will contribute to Scotland&rsquo;s world-leading climate change targets through the manufacture of low-carbon buses, and also notes that 46 of the 50 buses will be built by Alexander Dennis Ltd based in Camelon, which will be of economic benefit to the Falkirk area.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7669 Kenneth Gibson: The Prosperity of Europe&rsquo;s Smaller National Economies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the reports in <em>The Economist</em> publication, <em>The World in 2011</em>, that per capita income at purchasing power parity (PPP) in each of Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and even what it considers to be the much maligned Republic of Ireland is higher than each of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom; acknowledges that in Norway&rsquo;s case PPP is 64% higher than in the UK; recognises that the population of each of the more prosperous nations ranges from 4.1 to 9.5 million and that medium-sized nations such as Belgium and the Netherlands and tiny countries such as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg all have PPP higher than the five larger nations, each of which has 46 to 83 million inhabitants; agrees therefore that there is no reason to believe that an independent, resource-rich Scotland could not be as prosperous as so many of our small European neighbours that enjoy less child and pensioner poverty, lower crime levels and better quality of life than in the UK, and calls on unionist politicians to stop what it views as decrying other nations and the ability of Scots to successfully run an independent Scotland better than it is run from London.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7668 Bill Butler: England Ashes Win</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the England cricket team on its emphatic Ashes series win; acknowledges the record-breaking performances of the team; notes that cricket participation in Scotland continues to rise, particularly among younger players, with 468 schools competing in Cricket Scotland&rsquo;s 2010 school cup tournaments, and acknowledges the role that cricket can play in creating a healthier Scotland and promoting community relations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7667 Rhoda Grant: Supporting Local Forums&rsquo; Involvement in Delivering Community Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the value of supporting local forums&rsquo; involvement in delivering community care; notes the research undertaken by the Inverness and Highland community care forums that highlights the vital role that lunch and social clubs play in supporting older people in the Inverness area; believes that these groups provide a vital service in creating and maintaining social networks and alleviating the effects of social isolation; considers that, when funding for the Highland Community Care Forum ceases in June, local forums will be left without any support and will not survive, and therefore calls on both NHS Highland and Highland Council to extend Highland Community Care Forum&rsquo;s present contract to cover the gap between the old contract and the new to ensure that local forums continue to have a part to play in the delivery of future localised community care services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7666 Hugh Henry: Gerry Rafferty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is saddened by the death of the Paisley-born musician, Gerry Rafferty; offers condolences to his family and friends; considers that his Paisley roots had a huge influence on his artistic development; recognises his contribution to music in Scotland; further recognises his influence on musicians and music fans throughout the world, and believes that he has left a musical legacy that will continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7665 Patrick Harvie: Cuts to Glasgow Bus Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of FirstGroup to discontinue a number of bus routes in Glasgow and make what is considered to be a severe reduction in service levels across many others; considers that it is not too late for FirstGroup to rethink these plans and put its responsibility to passengers ahead of that of shareholders, and calls on the Scottish Government to increase the powers of local authorities to regulate the operation of bus companies and impose requirements on them as well as to refocus its own national transport spending priorities away from major new road developments and toward creating a properly funded Scottish public transport system that is fast, reliable, affordable and fit for a low-carbon 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7664 Christina McKelvie: Montenegro</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament distances itself from comments made by Iain Gray MSP in the chamber on 23 December 2010 that Montenegro regained its independence in &quot;40 days, two world wars, the Balkan conflict, ethnic cleansing, a war crimes tribunal and a United Nations peace-keeping mission&quot;; apologises to the Montenegrin people for this being said in the Parliament, and calls on the Member concerned to make a personal statement, with the permission of the Presiding Officer in line with Rule 13.1, correcting his previous assertion and apologising to Montenegro.</p>
<p>Supported by: Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-7567# Cathy Jamieson: Freight Facilities Grants</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the contribution of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Freight Facilities Grants (FFG) in moving freight to rail and sea, and the contribution that this makes to reducing carbon emissions and congestion; notes that 37 FFG awards totalling &pound;68.9 million have been made to projects in Scotland and understands that this reduces the need for 33,573,500 lorry miles per year; recognises that Transport Scotland is in advanced discussions with a number of bidders to the fund, including a proposal by a social enterprise in South Ayrshire for a railhead at Grangestone by Girvan; believes that a Grangestone railhead could provide great economic and environmental benefits to South Ayrshire; regrets the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals to reduce support for the freight industry from &pound;10.3 million in 2010-11 to &pound;2.9 million in 2011-12, including the closure of the FFG scheme for projects which will incur expenditure after 31 March 2011, and expresses great concern that this would put in jeopardy the work that has been done on the Grangestone railhead scheme and similar proposals across Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7353# Bob Doris: Paying Tribute to Scotland&rsquo;s Irish Diaspora</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Scotland celebrated the Year of Homecoming in 2009, welcoming the Scottish diaspora back from around the world to celebrate Scottish connections; notes that many European nations have experienced similar demographic movements, both inward and outward; celebrates the contribution from inward migration to Scotland both historical and present, such as it considers is seen in the thriving Irish music, sporting and cultural scene in the city of Glasgow; congratulates Scotland&rsquo;s Irish community on what it considers the dedication and commitment that it has shown in keeping Irish culture thriving and in the good work that Irish groups do in the wider community, and believes that a confident, outward-looking, modern Scotland must have at its heart the appreciation and celebration of the multiple cultures that contribute to Scotland&rsquo;s national life.</p>
