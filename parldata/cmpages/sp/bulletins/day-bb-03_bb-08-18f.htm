          <p><strong>*S2M-265</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Queen 
            Mother&#39;s Hospital and Yorkhill Hospital, Glasgow</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the threat to maternity and children&#39;s 
            services in Glasgow as a result of the maternity services review currently 
            ongoing by NHS Greater Glasgow; further notes the excellent reputation 
            of the Queen Mother&#39;s Maternity Hospital Glasgow and the special 
            link between it and Yorkhill Children&#39;s Hospital, and calls upon 
            the Scottish Executive to support the retention of these hospitals.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-264#</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> 
            <strong>Defence Aviation Repair Agency, Almondbank</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes the continued speculation about the impact of the 
            Ministry of Defence&#39;s &#39;End to End Review&#39; on the future 
            of the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) in Almondbank; is concerned 
            about the threat to the 325 jobs at the facility; recognises the important 
            and specialised skills of the workforce there which are significant 
            to both Perthshire locally and Scotland as a whole; acknowledges the 
            massive local economic impact of DARA in Almondbank as evidenced by 
            the Mackay Consultants&#39; report of August 2003; further notes the 
            cross party and multi-agency Welsh campaign to defend DARA jobs in 
            Wales, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that 
            a similar campaign is organised in Scotland in order to protect and 
            defend the continued existence of defence jobs at DARA in Almondbank.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-263</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Fuel Cell Technology</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            SiGEN on the success of the BOC Gh2ost in the Shell Eco-Marathon in 
            Alford, Aberdeenshire, travelling for 1,200 miles on one gallon of 
            hydrogen; calls upon the Scottish Executive to provide greater support 
            for all forms of renewable energy research; agrees with David McGrath, 
            the managing director of SiGEN, that oil companies should move towards 
            becoming energy companies, investing a substantial proportion of their 
            profits in renewables, and recognises that Scotland, as a centre of 
            excellence in renewables research with its pool of engineering expertise, 
            will only become a world leader in this field if the Executive plays 
            a full part in financing and integrating efforts in this direction.</p>

            consideration of the draft Scotland Act 1998 (Transfer of Functions 
            to the Scottish Ministers etc.) (No.2) Order 2003, recommends that

            Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.5) (Scotland) Order 2003</strong>-That

          <p><strong>*S2M-258</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Harviestoun 
            Brewery Champion Beer of Britain Award 2003</strong>-That the Parliament 
            extends its warmest congratulations to Clackmannanshire&#39;s Harviestoun 
            Brewery in Dollar after its &#39;Bitter &amp; Twisted&#39; ale won 
            the prestigious Champion Beer of Britain Award and the Champion Bitter

          <p><strong>*S2M-257#</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Mountain Rescue Service</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the valuable life-saving work performed by the mountain rescue service 
            in attending an estimated 400 incidents each year; notes that each 
            mountain rescue team receives &#163;6,000-7,000 via local police boards, 
            which accounts for only a fraction of the average &#163;30,000 annual 
            running cost of each team, and commends the fundraising work by the 
            teams, but reflects that a tiny proportion of the &#163;500,000,000 
            underspend by the Scottish Executive in 2002-03 would have equipped 
            and maintained the teams in full for many years to come.</p>
