          <p><strong><a name="3914"></a>*S1M-3914</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: 
            Fisheries</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the Executive's commitment 
            of up to £50 million in aid to assist fishermen, on-shore fisheries 
            businesses and fishing communities throughout Scotland as a very substantial 
            response to the outcome of the EU Fisheries Council in December 2002; 
            welcomes the result of quota negotiations in the nephrops fishery 
            and the progress made in reforms to the Common Fisheries Policy at 
            that Council; endorses the need for sustainable economic development 
            of Scotland's fishing industry and communities; recognises this can 
            best be achieved through healthier fish stocks; acknowledges this 
            implies further restructuring of the white fish sector; welcomes the 
            provision of up to £40 million for further decommissioning; welcomes 
            the provision of up to £10 million in transitional support to facilitate 
            rational economic planning and adjustment by those who wish to remain 
            in the sector; notes that such transitional support will be conditional 
            upon, for example, non-diversification into other valuable fisheries, 
            such as the west coast and North Sea nephrops fisheries, and supports 
            the Executive in its negotiations to secure a more economically realistic 
            EU legal framework initially through amendment to the current interim 
            EU regulation and thereafter through a successor regime.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3909</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: War with Iraq 
            - Not in Scotland's Name</strong>-That the Parliament, mindful of 
            its duty to faithfully reflect and promote Scottish opinion internationally 
            and following the demonstrations against war with Iraq on 15 February 
            2003, reminds Her Majesty's Government that any decision to initiate 
            war with Iraq will be taken not in our name.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3908</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: Not In Our Name</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the overwhelming feeling in Scotland against 
            unilateral or bilateral military action in Iraq; notes the scale of 
            the anti-war demonstrations across the world on Saturday 15 February 
            2003 and, in particular, notes that almost 100,000 people took to 
            the streets of Glasgow to express their opposition to the inevitable 
            path to war currently being taken by the Governments of the United 
            Kingdom and the United States of America; supports the role of the 
            United Nations and the rule of international law in dealing with this 
            crisis, and shares the contempt felt by the people of Scotland towards 
            the murderous Iraqi regime but recognises the overwhelming view of 
            the people that the rush to war must be halted in the name of peace 
            and world security. </p>
