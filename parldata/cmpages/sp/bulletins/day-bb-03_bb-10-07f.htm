          <p><strong>*S2M-457</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>US 
            Treatment of Human Shields to Iraq</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            condemns the actions of the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
            Control in imposing fines and custodial sentences on individuals who 
            travelled to Iraq to act as human shields and commends those individuals 
            on their humanitarian actions during the recent war.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-456</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Fire and Rescue Service - Proposals for Legislation</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s commitment to 
            working with stakeholders to develop a fire and rescue service that 
            is modern and effective with the principal aim of reducing risk; notes 
            that the consultation paper <em>The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service: 
            Proposals for Legislation</em> builds on the responses received to 
            the first policy paper, and notes that the Executive will engage with 
            stakeholders to modernise the service and work together to provide 
            greater impetus to protect the public from fire to reduce Scotland&#146;s 
            poor record of fire fatalities.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-455#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Pension 
            Credit</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the introduction of 
            Pension Credit a new means-tested benefit for senior citizens; recognises 
            the cost of implementing another mean-tested benefit and the complicated 
            and demeaning process of applying for this benefit for senior citizens; 
            agrees that a decent state pension is a right for our senior citizens 
            and should not have to be supplemented with means-tested benefits, 
            and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should urge Her 
            Majesty&#146;s Government to deliver on Gordon Brown&#146;s pledge 
            nine years ago to abolish means-testing and introduce a state pension 
            which provides all senior citizens with a reasonable quality of life, 
            with the link to earnings restored to provide a greater economic stability 
            to those senior citizens.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-454</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>The 
            Draft Agricultural Holdings (Consequential Amendments) (Scotland) 
            Order 2003</strong>&#151;That the Environment and Rural Development 
            Committee recommends that the draft Agricultural Holdings (Consequential 
            Amendments) (Scotland) Order 2003 be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-453</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Number 
            of Deportations by Her Majesty's Government Between 1990 and 2002</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that the New Labour Government deported 255,413 
            people between May 1997 and December 2002 while the Tory Government 
            deported 174,967 people between January 1990 and April 1997; further 
            notes that New Labour now deports seven people an hour compared to 
            two deportations an hour in 1990, and believes that this illustrates 
            clearly New Labour&#146;s negative attitude to immigrants seeking 
            to build a new life within the UK.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-452#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Science 
            and the Parliament Event 12 November 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the &quot;Science and the Parliament 2003&quot; event being 
            held on 12 November 2003, organised by the Royal Society of Chemistry 
            in association with Scotland's leading science organisations; notes 
            the contribution of Scotland's 40,000 scientists to our economic, 
            environmental and social development including those working in the 
            public sector; further notes the contribution of science to the development 
            of new technologies in renewable energy and waste management and supporting 
            a sustainable environment; notes the importance of a well-resourced 
            science research sector to allow Scotland to be a world leader in 
            the &quot;green&quot; technologies, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should increase investment in science research and support 
            greater industrial research.</p>
