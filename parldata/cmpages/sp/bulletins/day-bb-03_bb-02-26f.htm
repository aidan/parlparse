Disabled People and reaffirms our commitment to ensuring equality of opportunity 
for disabled people; recognises and celebrates the European Year of Disabled People 
and the contributions that disabled people make to Scottish society at all levels; 
recognises the role of the arts, culture and sport in promoting social inclusion

Des McNulty<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Dr Elaine Murray<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3955</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Janis Hughes: Reorganisation of Post Offices</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes the value of sub-post offices to local communities, particularly in deprived 
areas; welcomes Her Majesty's Government&#146;s decision to provide funding to 
compensate local sub-postmasters for the cost of closures and to improve remaining 
post offices; acknowledges that, whilst there is not enough business to sustain 
the current number of post office branches, cognisance must be taken of local 
need and a growing elderly population, and urges the Post Office to ensure that 
full consultation takes place, taking into account the needs of local communities 
and involving local residents and elected representatives, over changes to local 
provision.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3954</STRONG> <STRONG>Murdo Fraser: Effective Deer 
Management</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of a new 
working agreement between the Association of Deer Management Groups, the Deer 
Commission for Scotland, the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage 
that will enable all four bodies to work together to provide a framework for good 
communication and mutual understanding in the interests of effective deer management; 
notes the necessity of bringing Scotland's deer populations into sustainable balance 
with their environment, and believes that the new arrangements represent a major 
contribution towards that end.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3953#</STRONG> <STRONG>Dr Richard 
Simpson: New Forth Road Bridge Crossing Near Kincardine</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament welcomes the completion of the A907; notes the current intention of 
the Scottish Executive to reopen the Stirling to Alloa and Kincardine rail link 
by 2005 and construct a new Forth road bridge crossing by 2007; further notes 
the benefits to the economy of Clackmannanshire that will result from these infrastructure 
improvements; notes, however, that the recent decision for the favoured site of 
a new acute hospital for Forth Valley to be at the Royal Scottish National Hospital, 
Larbert, will have significant implications for the road networks to the south 
of the Forth road crossing, and considers that the Executive should ensure that 
the design of this network and its date of completion are expedited in order to 
ensure the safety of patients in Ochil and Stirling constituencies as well as 
those from the west of Fife.</P><P>Supported by: Scott Barrie<STRONG>*</STRONG>,

2 Committee by 10 March 2003 on the Births, Deaths, Marriages and Divorces (Fees) 
(Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2003 (SSI 2003/89).</P><P>Supported by: Euan 
Robson*</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3945</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: Education 
(Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill - Consultation</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive has published the draft Education 
(Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill with the express purpose of 
modernising the framework that provides pupils that need additional support for 
learning with that support and that the bill has been put out to consultation 
with parents, professionals and other stakeholders for a ten-week period ending 
on 28 March 2003; further notes that the draft bill proposes that the Record of 
Needs be discontinued and replaced by a new Co-ordinated Support Plan &quot;for 
children with complex or multiple barriers to learning who require additional 
support from outwith the education authority&quot;; believes that this bill represents 
significant and fundamental changes to the existing service built up over the 
last 20 years and that for it to be successful it must enjoy the support of those 
parents whose children already have a Record of Needs; notes that the Executive&#146;s 
main method of communicating the bill&#146;s proposals to such parents is to send 
a copy of the document to all schools, asking them to pass it on to these parents 
and, in addition, is holding a number of seminars that parents can attend; further 
notes that many parents are expressing ignorance of the draft bill, its contents 
and the consultation process and that attendance by parents at these seminars 
is worryingly low and often in single figures, compared to the large number of 
well-informed professionals, and therefore supports the extension of the consultation 
period until after the summer recess of the next parliamentary session so that 
all parents have ample opportunity to consider the merits and demerits of these 
radical changes and communicate their views to the new Executive which, in turn, 
will be able to assess its consultation in a more considered manner and with an 
accurate response from parents.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3944.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Malcolm 
Chisholm: Health</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3944) in the name 
of Mary Scanlon, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes 
the further increases in the Scottish Executive&#146;s investment in health and 
health promotion announced earlier this month; notes that these extra resources 
must be balanced by reform in the NHS for full benefits to flow to service users; 
supports the on-going work to put patients at the centre of service planning and 
quality improvement in the NHS; supports the strengthening of the primary healthcare 
sector and decentralisation of decision-making; is concerned about waiting times 
for some out-patients; agrees with the priority given to tackling unacceptably 
long waits; commends the new maximum hospital waiting times guarantees for NHS 
patients given by the Executive; looks forward to further reductions in the number 
of patients waiting longest for treatment; welcomes the recent reduction in the 
number of delayed discharges from Scottish hospitals and the active collaboration 
between health and community care services in achieving this, and congratulates 
staff across the NHS in Scotland on their hard work and dedication to a highly 
regarded public service.&quot; </P><P>Supported by: Mr Frank McAveety<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Mrs Mary Mulligan<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3943.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Irene 
McGugan: Educational Attainment for Looked After Children</STRONG>&#151;As an 
amendment to motion (S1M-3943) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from &quot;the 
use&quot; to end and insert &quot;funding and other initiatives to improve attainment 
of looked after children; regrets, however, that progress has been so slow, particularly 
as the Scottish Executive has brought this and associated issues with regard to 
looked after children to debate in the Parliament on no less than four previous 
occasions; recognises that the issues cannot be resolved without adequate qualified 
staff in the system; supports wholeheartedly better integrated children&#146;s 
services but suggests that the Executive desist from blaming local authorities 
and local authority staff for the problems caused by its own and previous governments&#146; 
policy failures, and therefore urges the Executive to acknowledge and address 
the financial and staffing pressures that local authorities face every day in 
attempting to meet their statutory duties.&quot; </P><P>Supported by: Michael
