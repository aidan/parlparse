          <p><strong>*S3M-847</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Competition, Regulation and Business Structures in the Scottish Legal Services Market</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Office of Fair Trading&rsquo;s response to the super-complaint by <em>Which?</em> on restrictions on business structures and direct access in the Scottish legal profession and the Law Society of Scotland&rsquo;s consultation on alternative business structures; believes that the regulatory and business structures of the Scottish legal profession should reflect Scottish circumstances and support improved access to high-quality legal services in a competitive and appropriately regulated market in accordance with competition law, and notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach of working closely with the legal profession to secure reforms that will allow the Scottish legal profession to compete internationally while enhancing access to justice in local communities.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S3M-846</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Mark Lynch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Mark Lynch from Glasgow on winning the Apprentice of the Year 2007 award by the Federation of Master Builders at its Master Builder of the Year awards ceremony; notes the substantial contribution made by City Building (Glasgow) LLP in taking on and training modern apprentices over the years and calls on all building and construction firms likewise to support young people through apprenticeships as fully as possible; notes the exceptional opportunities currently open to the industry in both private and public sector building projects, and applauds Mark&rsquo;s efforts in beating competition from across the United Kingdom to win his award.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-836#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Apprentice of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow carpenter, Mark Lynch, on being crowned Apprentice of the Year at the Master Builder of the Year Awards 2007 after fighting off competition from hundreds of apprentices around the United Kingdom; echoes the sentiments of the judges who described Mark as having all the qualities we want to see in all apprentices, including commitment to his trade and employer, along with the willingness and ability to continue to learn; considers that the construction industry&rsquo;s future will be assured through the development of young people such as Mark Lynch; believes that Mark, who has shown an exceptional interest in his career from an early stage, taking part in Glasgow&rsquo;s school vocational programme and spending half a day a week at Queenslie Training Centre learning a variety of construction trades before being accepted for an apprenticeship in carpentry and joinery with City Building (Glasgow) LLP, serves as a great example to others and demonstrates the benefits that apprenticeships bring to young people and Scotland as a whole, and hopes that these schemes will be developed to ensure that they play a central role in the new employment opportunities brought about as a result of Glasgow&rsquo;s successful bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-835</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Rural Fuel Prices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the disproportionate cost of fuel in rural areas, in particular the south of Scotland, where in many towns and villages people are reliant on cars as an essential method of transport; notes with concern the proposed two pence per litre increase in fuel duty in spring 2008; considers that this will place unbearable pressure on individuals in the south of Scotland as well as hauliers and other businesses nationwide, and calls on the Scottish Government to press the Chancellor of the Exchequer to freeze any further increases in fuel duty and to redress the imbalance between rural and urban fuel prices.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-833</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Gourock Primary School Choir: BBC Songs of Praise Junior Choir of the Year Competition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Gourock Primary School Choir in successfully reaching the last six of the prestigious BBC Songs of Praise Junior Choir of the Year competition; notes that, from a total of 173 entries from throughout the United Kingdom, Gourock Primary School Choir is Scotland&rsquo;s sole representative which exemplifies the great talent and enthusiasm of the choir and recognises the hard work and dedication of the music staff; further notes that the school reached the last 20 of the BBC&rsquo;s UK-wide Joseph Choir search and impressed Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, and wishes the choir every success in reaching the Junior Choir of the Year finals being held in Manchester in February 2008.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-832</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Free Central Heating Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the uncertain winter faced by many older people across Scotland who are currently waiting to have central heating installed under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s free central heating scheme; considers the lengthy delays facing many old people, leading to the prospect of a winter without central heating or hot water, to be unacceptable; believes that the &pound;3,500 cap on the scheme, which has led to older people in rural areas only being given the option of an electric system which is expensive to run, should be lifted, and further believes that the Scottish Government should take urgent action to ensure that older people in Scotland receive their new central heating systems as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-830</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Diabetes UK Scotland World Diabetes Day Report 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Diabetes UK Scotland report, <em>Getting our act together - supporting young people with diabetes in Scotland</em>; recognises that Scotland has one of the highest rates in the world for Type 1 diabetes and that more than 90% of young people with diabetes in Scotland are at risk of serious health complications because they lack the information and support to manage their condition properly; acknowledges the report&rsquo;s action points on sustaining  paediatric services for children with Type 1 diabetes, providing structured education, psycho-social support and information about living with Type 1 diabetes and its consequences, informing patients about their treatment options, educating people working with young people in schools and elsewhere about Type 1 diabetes, improving transition from paediatric to adult services and improving communication among professionals; furthermore recognises that the report is part of a year-long worldwide campaign to raise awareness of the rising prevalence of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, and calls on the Scottish Government to make a response to the report and the campaign.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-829&diams;</strong> <strong>Charlie Gordon:</strong> <strong>Changes to the National Concessionary Travel Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the national concessionary travel scheme should be urgently reviewed to extend eligibility to disabled people in receipt of the lower rate of disability living allowance, including those in Glasgow, and to older and disabled people using community transport in rural areas such as those in Clydesdale and that there should be consultation on other desirable changes to the scheme.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-828</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>100th International Cap for Julie Fleeting</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kilwinning-born Julie Fleeting, of the Scotland international women&rsquo;s football team, on scoring her 100th international goal and achieving 100 international caps for Scotland; welcomes this achievement as an example and inspiration to other female footballers, and wishes Scotland&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s team every success in its current UEFA cup campaign.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-827</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Availability of Insulin Pumps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the concerns of Diabetes UK that it is estimated that less than 1% of people with Type 1 diabetes use insulin pumps in Scotland; further notes that this compares very unfavourably with rates of use in other European countries; notes that a greater use of insulin pumps would benefit the NHS through a reduction in primary care contacts, and calls on the Scottish Government to consider what steps might be taken to further increase access to insulin pumps for people with diabetes in Scotland.</p>
