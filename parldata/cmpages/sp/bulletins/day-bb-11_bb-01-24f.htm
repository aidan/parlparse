<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>

<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;<br />
    <br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong><br />
        <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;<br />
    <br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7775</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Joint Services for Victims of Sexual Abuse in Kirkcaldy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Kingdom Abuse Survivors Project (KASP) and the Fife Rape and Sexual Assault Centre for providing services for survivors of sexual abuse in Kirkcaldy and the surrounding areas; notes that the two agencies have moved into joint premises in Kirkcaldy in order to achieve greater efficiency and further opportunity for joint working; recognises that, in total, the two agencies were spending &pound;20,000 per annum in rental costs but that, having moved into premises together, they are now spending &pound;5,000 jointly; commends the fact that this saving has resulted in more money being directed to client services and that being under one roof has enabled both groups to support each other and to deliver joined-up services; believes that the services offered by the two agencies are important frontline services, and commends both KASP and the Fife Rape and Sexual Assault Centre for cutting costs but protecting client services while under financial pressure.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7768</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Scottish Produce at Le Bocuse d&rsquo;Or</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Tuke family and the staff at Hardies Mill Farm in the Borders on being selected by Quality Meat Scotland to supply produce for the 2011 Bocuse d&rsquo;Or taking place in Lyon from 22 to 26 January 2011; recognises that Le Bocuse d&rsquo;Or is widely considered to be the culinary version of the Olympic Games, attracting top young chefs from around the world; considers this to be a tremendous vote of confidence in the quality of produce available from farms in Scotland, and welcomes the opportunity for local produce to be on show at such a highly regarded and influential event.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7767&diams; </strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>BBC UK Network Fails Devolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that there ought to be an end to what it considers to be the misleading and distorted coverage on the BBC news and current affairs network that is continuing to fail to accurately reflect the constitutional changes resulting from the introduction of devolution 12 years ago; considers that presenters and news reports from London broadcast on the UK-wide network regularly fail to make clear that policy changes to issues such as education, health, justice and social services among others relate only to England and are often not relevant, or are completely different, to policy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where devolved issues and the public policy agenda are for the most part completely different to that occurring in England; believes that this causes confusion to Scottish audiences such as those in the Scottish Borders who are given the impression that changes to England only will affect and impact on services across the UK, and believes that consideration should be given to establishing main news output from Scotland, covering accurately policy changes in the nation and that also gives a Scottish perspective on international affairs and issues.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7766&diams; </strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Potential Adoption of the International Criminal Court&rsquo;s Definition of the Crime of Aggression</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the sacrifice made by members of the armed services from the West of Scotland and other parts of the country in theatres of war such as Iraq and Afghanistan; acknowledges debate about the legality of such conflicts; is aware that the International Criminal Court (Scotland) Act 2001 incorporated the offences contained in the 1998 Rome Statute for the Establishment of an International Criminal Court into Scots law on a unanimous vote in the Parliament and that this was done the year before the Rome Statute came into force; welcomes the resolution passed at a UN conference in Kampala in June 2010, with the consensus of all States Parties present, to incorporate into the Rome Statute a definition of the crime of aggression; notes the advice provided by legal experts in the field at a meeting held in the Parliament on 18 January 2011 that there is no legal impediment to Scotland incorporating this definition into its legislation immediately, and believes that such a move would avoid Scotland being involved in illegal wars in the future, to the benefit of armed services personnel from Scotland and the citizens of other countries, set an excellent example to the rest of the world and send the clear message that Scotland respects international law.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7765</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Breast is Best</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s new strategy to improve maternal and infant nutrition; recognises that the Scottish Government has adopted as its policy the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s guidance recommending exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of an infant&rsquo;s life; believes that the benefits of breastfeeding are well documented for both mother and child and that breast milk provides babies with the essential nutrients that they need for healthy development and contains antibodies that help protect from common childhood illnesses; is concerned that there has been negative publicity surrounding a recent report in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> questioning the best time to introduce solid foods into a baby&rsquo;s diet; understands that Baby Milk Action states on its website that three of the authors of the report in question receive funding from the baby food industry; therefore welcomes the new advertising campaign to promote the benefits of breastfeeding, and urges NHS Lanarkshire to develop a fresh action plan to take forward the implementation of the strategy.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7764</strong> <strong>Charlie Gordon:</strong> <strong>Fight to Retain BMI&rsquo;s Glasgow/Heathrow Air Link</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regards the threatened reduction in the frequency, or complete withdrawal, of BMI&rsquo;s air service between Glasgow International and London Heathrow airports as a potentially serious blow to the Scottish economy; notes that the catalyst for doubts over the service&rsquo;s future is the proposed increase in landing charges from April 2011 that has been made by Heathrow&rsquo;s owners, BAA, of around &pound;10 per passenger; further notes BMI&rsquo;s intention to lodge a formal complaint under section 41 of the Airports Act 1986 regarding this; calls on the Scottish Government to add its weight to the efforts of other stakeholders to bolster the service, and calls on BAA to agree to impose a moratorium on its proposed increase in landing charges.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7763</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Potential Disadvantage for Scottish Egg Producers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that EU animal welfare legislation introducing a ban on the use of conventional cages for laying hens might not be enforced equally across the EU member states from 1 January 2012; believes that this will be disadvantageous to the Scottish and British egg industries, which it understands have already incurred significant costs in meeting the requirements of the legislation by investing in enriched cages or non-cage systems of egg production; notes that the United Kingdom is already the largest free-range egg producer in the EU; further notes that eggs produced to a lower animal welfare standard are cheaper to produce and might be allowed access to Scottish and British markets post-2012, and is of the view that, once again, Scottish and UK farmers will be put at a competitive disadvantage by producing eggs to the highest EU-agreed animal welfare standards while farmers in other member states are unlikely to be able to meet the deadline and that they might be allowed additional time to phase out the use of conventional cages post-2012.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7762</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Insecticide Hazard to Bees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the report by the <em>Independent</em> newspaper on 20 January 2011 that raises the potential that honeybee colonies in Britain are being poisoned by the use of neonicotinoid insecticides; further notes that this discovery follows on from research conducted in the US Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Bee Research Laboratory that found that neonicotinoid insecticides may be causing colony collapse disorder throughout the world; acknowledges that more than 1.4 million acres were reported to have been treated with these insecticides in 2008, and calls on the UK and Scottish governments to suspend the use of these chemical compounds as a precautionary measure to allow for further clarity to be sought on their effects.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7759</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Proposed Waste Incineration Plant at Loganswell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern in respect of the proposal to establish a waste incineration plant at Loganswell near Newton Mearns in  Eastwood covering some 29 hectares and which is anticipated to burn some 1.5 million tonnes of raw waste a year, a proposal which would arguably turn Eastwood into the ashtray of the west of Scotland; further notes the evidence of Duncan McLaren of Friends of the Earth Scotland who advised the Transport Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee on 23 November 2010 that it &quot;would be insane to build Europe&rsquo;s largest incinerator in East Renfrewshire&quot;; believes that an urgent rethink of this project is essential, and urges the Scottish Government to demonstrate its support for the wider local community, which it considers is resolutely opposed to this proposed development.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7758</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Michelin Stars</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the top-rated Scottish restaurants that have retained their Michelin stars in the latest edition of the world-renowned food guide; believes that The Kitchin, Restaurant Martin Wishart and Plumed Horse all fly the flag for quality cuisine in Leith and Edinburgh; notes that the Michelin star awards are recognised worldwide, and believes that such recognition brings with it important business, economic and tourism opportunities for the city.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7756#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Healthy Living Centres and Community Empowerment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the work of healthy living centres such as the Annexe in Partick, Glasgow, in their promotion of community-led approaches to health improvement in disadvantaged communities; notes the publication of <em>Health in Scotland 2009 Time for Change: Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer,</em> which suggests a more community-based approach to health promotion that focuses on empowering people in society to cope with everyday stresses as opposed to the current deficit-model of healthcare which, the report argues, tends to produce high levels of dependence on hospital and welfare services; believes that healthy living centres have been hugely successful in promoting the self-empowerment of local communities, allowing them to identify and respond to their specific needs; believes that, in turn, this increases the sense of health and wellbeing in communities and decreases their reliance on external support, and would welcome proposals being brought forward to ensure that healthy living centres remain at the heart of community empowerment.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7754</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Mountain Rescue Debt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the UK Government to treat mountain rescue teams fairly and refund or remove VAT from mountain rescue services, which is estimated to cost teams in Scotland between &pound;150,000 and &pound;200,000 per year; notes that, on 4 May 2010, two days before the UK election, Danny Alexander said that, as part of the debt owed to mountain rescue teams, they should be refunded their VAT; believes that the UK Government owes mountain rescue teams more than a debt, it owes them hundreds of thousands of pounds in VAT, and calls on the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, to deliver for Scotland&rsquo;s mountain rescue teams and provide them with a VAT refund.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7723</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Scottish Enterprise Puts Commonwealth Games Legacy at Risk</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply concerned by reports that Glasgow&rsquo;s 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy is under threat; is concerned that Scottish Enterprise is cutting 46% of support to six firms that are charged with driving forward urban regeneration in Scotland and that this will have a detrimental effect on the ability of Clyde Gateway to carry out Commonwealth Games legacy commitments, and urges the Scottish Government to intervene with Scottish Enterprise and request that it review the proposal to reduce funding commitments to Clyde Gateway and other urban regeneration companies in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7722#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Hunter House Museum, East Kilbride</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the value of local history museums to Scotland&rsquo;s communities; is concerned at the potential closure of museums such as the A-listed Hunter House Museum in East Kilbride, the birthplace of the famous medical pioneers, William and John Hunter, which houses interactive displays telling the story of their lives and medical discoveries; understands that the museum is one of the few places in East Kilbride where people are able to discover more about what it sees as the town&rsquo;s rich history and heritage, and believes that a potential way forward for such facilities, should local authorities decide to close them, would be for them to be given over to community groups and trusts that show the commitment and ability to preserve such precious resources for community benefit.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7721</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Bus Service Withdrawals Affecting Duntocher, Hardgate, Faifley, Bearsden and Milngavie</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the decision by First Bus to withdraw services on the 118 route between Duntocher and Glasgow except during morning and evening peak times from Mondays to Fridays; notes that services from Glasgow will terminate at Baljaffray shops at all other times; is further concerned at the withdrawal of all services from Monday to Saturday after 7pm and all Sunday services on the route and the introduction of an hourly instead of half-hourly service on the 119 route; believes that insufficient consideration has been given to the people who will be adversely affected by the changes; is of the view that working people, schoolchildren and pensioners in the Duntocher, Hardgate, Faifley, Bearsden and Milngavie areas will be greatly inconvenienced by these changes by First Bus; believes that vital routes must be protected, and supports the reregulation of bus routes in Scotland as an urgent priority.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7720</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Tackling the Gaps in Extracurricular Reading</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment<em> </em>(PISA) report, <em>PISA 2009 Assessment Framework - Key Competencies in Reading, Mathematics and Science</em>, that examined 15-year-old students&rsquo; performance in reading, mathematics and science concluded that 43% of the pupils whom it surveyed in Scotland do not read for enjoyment; expresses its concern at PISA&rsquo;s report that 27% of students read for enjoyment for 30 minutes or less per day and that boys were less likely to say that they enjoy reading than girls, and calls on the Scottish Government to take measures to improve the levels of extracurricular reading among pupils and close the apparent gender gap as a means of tackling what it believes to be Scotland&rsquo;s ongoing battle with illiteracy.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7718</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Bus Service Withdrawals in the East End of Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the decision by First Bus to withdraw what it considers to be the vital 43 service in the evening and the 64 service after 7 pm on weeknights and on Sundays; believes that insufficient consideration has been given to those adversely effected by the changes; is of the view that the east end of Glasgow cannot afford to lose any more bus services; is troubled by what it considers as the easy discarding by First Group of its undertaking, made when awarded its contract, not to withdraw services; understands that this decision will disproportionately affect some of the most vulnerable people in Glasgow, and considers that bus providers should be obliged to protect all vital routes and that this serves as a further indication that the regulation of bus routes in Scotland is in need of major reform.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7717.1</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Discards</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7717) in the name of John Scott, insert at end &quot;; considers that most North Sea fish stocks, especially cod, have been at an all-time low for at least a decade due to relentless overfishing and that most proposals from the European Commission have been successfully undermined year on year by an alliance of EU politicians and fishing interests, and urges the Scottish Government and all EU partners to cooperate in reducing the catching capacity of the entire EU fishing fleet as a precursor to the landing of all catch and the development of a more sophisticated strategy that will allow for the introduction of further targeted conservation policies to be introduced, understood and properly implemented&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7715</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>M&agrave;nran</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the new Scottish Gaelic band, M&agrave;nran, made up of Norrie MacIver, Ross Saunders, Scott Mackay, Gary Innes, Calum Stewart and Ewen Henderson, has today released its first single, Latha Math, through a large number of online retailers in an attempt to become the first Gaelic band of the 21st century to make it into the UK top 40; considers that M&agrave;nran is helping to create the new sound of a modern Gaelic Scotland, and wishes the band every success for the future.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7619#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Coastguard Centre Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the public consultation document launched by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency that envisages what are believed to be drastic reductions in the number of maritime operations centres in the United Kingdom; notes that the proposed reductions would leave only two 24-hour centres operating, based in Aberdeen and in Southampton/Portsmouth; further notes that these would be supported by seven sub-centres and only one would be in Scotland at either Shetland or Stornoway; notes that this would result in the five operations centres in Scotland being reduced to two; believes that this raises serious questions about the future operation of the coastguard given that centres will now be covering what it considers to be such huge areas and that this has clear implications for many members of staff, and believes that these proposals require to be rethought.</p>
