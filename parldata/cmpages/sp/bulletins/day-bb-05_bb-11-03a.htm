                  <p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
                  <p><i>followed by</i>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Business: Children with Special Needs&mdash;</p>
                  <p><b>S2M-3490</b> <b>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</b> <b>Children with Special Needs</b>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that many children with additional support needs draw educational and social benefit from being educated in a mainstream setting; acknowledges, however, that in order for such children to flourish, appropriate resources and support must be available; further believes that the educational and social development of some children with multiple and complex needs can best be promoted through the concentrated support provided in special schools; notes with concern that 33 special schools have been closed since 1997; believes that there should be no presumption, statutory or otherwise, in favour of or against mainstreaming and that parents should be able to make a genuine informed choice between mainstream schools and special school provision, so that they can decide on the educational provision that is best suited to the needs of their child, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put in place a moratorium on the closure of special schools until the series of assumptions behind the mainstreaming policy is reviewed. </p>
                  
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
                    <p><b>S2M-3490.3</b> <b>Robert Brown: Children with Special Needs</b>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3490) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from &quot;; acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;and that, prior to the enactment of the Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools etc. Act 2000, many children were denied access to such benefits; acknowledges that meeting the needs of the individual child is of paramount importance and that a range of mainstream, specialist and mixed provision will always be necessary; notes that there has been a net increase of 28 special schools and units since 1997, which demonstrates the continuing commitment of local authorities and the Scottish Executive to specialist provision where appropriate, and believes that, following the Parliament&rsquo;s recent approval, the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 will, when it comes into force on 14 November 2005, strengthen the rights of children and their parents to ensure that their additional support needs are met fully, whatever the school setting.&quot; </p>
                    <p> <b>S2M-3490.2</b> <b>Mr Adam Ingram: Children with Special Needs</b>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3490) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the fundamental principle of inclusion that was introduced into our education system with the presumption of mainstreaming; recognises the widespread concerns that the resources made available to implement the policy have been inadequate, and calls, therefore, for a review of the operation of the policy to establish what additional means are required to ensure that every pupil with additional support needs has the opportunity to fulfil his or her potential, either within the mainstream setting or in a special school depending on their individual circumstances.&quot; </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p><i>followed by</i>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Business: The Decline of Scottish Manufacturing&mdash;</p>
                  <p><i>&#9;</i><b>S2M-3497</b> <b>Murdo Fraser:</b> <b>The Decline of Scottish Manufacturing</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the value of the manufacturing sector fell every year between 1997 and 2002, having previously risen year-on-year between 1992 and 1997, and that nearly 100,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since 1997; further notes with concern the recent findings of the Scottish Council for Development and Industry that exports have fallen below &pound;15 billion in value for the first time in a decade; believes that Scotland can benefit from a solid manufacturing base as part of a diverse and modern economy, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to take the action required to increase the competitiveness of the sector by taking measures such as reducing red tape and the size of the public sector, privatising Scottish Water, encouraging greater participation in vocational training at further education colleges and bringing forward the promised business rates cut to April 2006. </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    
                    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
                    <p><b>S2M-3497.3</b> <b>Allan Wilson: The Decline of Scottish Manufacturing</b>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3497) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;the important role that manufacturing plays in creating a diverse and growing Scottish economy and supports Scottish manufacturers adopting innovative and modern approaches to face the challenge of global competition; supports the move to higher value and quality products, and further notes the range of measures brought forward by the Scottish Executive to support manufacturing: investing in transport infrastructure and the skills of our people, creating the right environment by reducing business poundage rates and establishing a Scottish Manufacturing Advisory Service to support and encourage Scottish manufacturing industry to adapt to the global competitive environment.&quot; </p>
                    <p> <b>S2M-3497.1</b> <b>Jim Mather: The Decline of Scottish Manufacturing</b>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3497) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;having previously&quot; to end and insert &quot;considers that this was partly the result of the failure of earlier policies which attracted many foreign direct inward investors who did very little research and development in Scotland and which on their own were neither sufficient nor a substitute for real economic power and the full ability to compete, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise this fact and the evidence that makes the status quo untenable and damaging to Scotland.&quot; </p>
