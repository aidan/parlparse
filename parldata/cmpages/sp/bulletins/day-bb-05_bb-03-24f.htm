          <p><strong> * S2M-2649</strong> <strong>Colin Fox: Three Cheers for Chomsky</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh University and its Palestinian Solidarity Campaign Society for hosting two outstanding lectures by the highly-respected political scholar and dissident, Professor Noam Chomsky; notes that more than 2,000 people crowded in to hear his views on US imperialism and international affairs and were enthralled at the extent of his wisdom and advice on world affairs; regards his visit to Edinburgh as both a considerable success and a highlight of the year, and thanks Professor Chomsky himself for ably standing in for the late and much-missed Professor Edward Said who had originally been invited but who died recently.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2648# Richard Baker: Tackling Antisocial Behaviour in Grampian</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Grampian Police on its use of new antisocial behaviour laws; believes that antisocial behaviour is a blight on too many communities in the north east; notes that particular problems in the north east relating to under-age drinking and antisocial behaviour by drivers at Aberdeen&rsquo;s Beach Boulevard have been successfully targeted by Grampian Police through the new powers; welcomes the fact that Aberdeen has had amongst the highest numbers of antisocial behaviour orders granted in Scotland, and also welcomes innovative schemes to offer young people alternative activities, such as Grampian Police&rsquo;s &ldquo;Give the Broch a Break&rdquo; initiative.</p>
          <p> Supported by: Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong>, Dr Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2648.1# Mike Rumbles: Tackling Antisocial Behaviour in Grampian</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2648) in the name of Richard Baker, leave out from &ldquo;congratulates&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;deplores the misapplication of the dispersal powers contained in the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 which has resulted in the Beach Boulevard area of Aberdeen effectively being declared a curfew area; considers that anyone who contravenes any of the road traffic Acts should be prosecuted under those Acts and that anyone causing a breach of the peace should be prosecuted, and furthermore states that the use of dispersal powers is no substitute for traditional policing.&rdquo;</p>
