          <p><strong>*S2M-364#</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Children's 
            Panel Membership</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the 
            huge contribution made to public life by volunteers; notes that the 
            children's hearing system has now been in operation in Scotland for 
            over 30 years; applauds the dedication and commitment of children's 
            panel members in undertaking a difficult and demanding task; recognises 
            the Scottish Executive's current recruitment campaign for additional 
            panel members, and encourages people from all sections of the community, 
            but in particular men, to consider applying for membership of the 
            children's panel in their local area.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-363</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Hi-Arts 
            Broadband Britain Challenge Award</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            congratulates Hi-Arts on winning the public sector category of the 
            Broadband Britain Challenge Awards; notes the diversity of the arts 
            and their pivotal role in our cultural identity and our economy, and 
            welcomes the potential that broadband offers to offset some of the 
            difficulties faced by arts makers and other small businesses in remote 
            and rural areas and thereby support sustainable development in those 
            areas.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-362</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Tartan 
            Day, Paris, 4 April 2004</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            Tartan Day is now celebrated in France as well as in the United States 
            of America and urges the First Minister to attend the Tartan Day celebrations 
            in Paris on 4 April 2004, thereby cementing the Auld Alliance and 
            our historic and ongoing friendship with Old Europe.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-361#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Lack 
            of Affordable Rural Housing in North East Scotland</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament is concerned by the lack of affordable housing available 
            for renting or buying in rural communities in the north east and elsewhere 
            in the country; notes that in Aberdeenshire alone 6000 households 
            await suitable housing; further notes that local people are often 
            priced out of their own communities due to the rising and exorbitant 
            cost of property and land, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should bring forward radical and innovative measures to address those 
            issues at the root of this situation such as a review of planning 
            regimes, diversification of land ownership, appropriate funding mechanisms 
            and the need for more compulsory purchase orders.</p>
