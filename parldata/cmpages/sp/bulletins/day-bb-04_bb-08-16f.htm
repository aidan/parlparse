          <P><strong>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks in the text show the extent of alterations made.</strong></P>
          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1612#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Assault on Fire Brigades Union</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets that the fire service employers have withdrawn from the agreed settlement reached with the Fire Brigades Union (FBU); notes that COSLA has the funding to implement the agreement in full and was willing to do so; believes that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government is preparing and inciting a showdown with the FBU with the intention of breaking its organisation and strength; notes the takeover of the fire brigades&rsquo; training college by the armed forces in Moreton-in-Marsh, England; notes that members of the armed forces continue to be misused, overstretched and lack basic equipment in deployments and occupations, including Iraq, where the basis on which Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government went to war has been shown to be false as there were no weapons of mass destruction; believes that the preparation of the armed forces for industrial action by the FBU is a further misuse, setting men and women from similar backgrounds against each other due to the deliberate failure of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to implement an agreed settlement with the FBU; believes that the Scottish Executive and COSLA are in a position to pressurise Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government by making clear their intention to implement the agreement, averting any further industrial action or misuse of armed forces, and therefore considers that it is incumbent on both parties to do so with the utmost urgency.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1611</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Grampian Police Funding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that &pound;1.5 million of this year&rsquo;s budget for policing in Grampian is allocated for national policing duties such as &pound;1.2 million for royal protection and &pound;0.25 million for offshore policing; regrets that royal protection is considered five times more valuable than the security of the oil and gas industry; finds it unacceptable that the Scottish Executive has taken no steps to ascertain these costs and reimburse Grampian Police for them, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring its police funding review to a rapid conclusion taking these matters into account and to seek to recover United Kingdom security costs from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1610</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Climate Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee&rsquo;s report <em>Budget 2004 and Energy</em> which concludes that action on climate change is &quot;seriously off course&quot;; notes the likelihood of failure in achieving UK carbon emission reduction targets and the complete absence of any targets in Scotland; recognises with growing concern the damage that climate change is inflicting on Scotland&rsquo;s people, environment and economy; is appalled that Scotland lags behind the rest of the United Kingdom in reducing emissions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to &quot;climate-proof&quot; all spending and policy decisions and, in particular, to address the growing pollution from rising traffic levels and the Executive&rsquo;s massive road building plans which are making the situation worse.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1609</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Dumping of Human and Industrial Sludge at Ben Bain, Dalmellington</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament accepts that the proposed dumping of human and industrial sewage sludge at Ben Bain, Dalmellington, is unacceptable and should not be permitted; notes with strong disapproval that there is no requirement for planning permission in spite of the fact that the proposed amount of sludge to be dumped is 33,000 tonnes over the next six to twelve months, thus raising the ground level by up to one metre; further notes that any requirement to risk assess the effects of increased traffic on the roads or possible seepage into a tributary of the River Nith has thereby been disregarded, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put an end to the undemocratic practice of not requiring planning permission for such developments.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1608</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>The Draft Housing Grants (Assessment of Contributions) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Communities Committee recommends that the draft Housing Grants (Assessment of Contributions) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2004 be approved.</P>
