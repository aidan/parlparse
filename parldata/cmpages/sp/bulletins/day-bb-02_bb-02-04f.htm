          <p><strong>*S1M-2690</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: "Scottish Six" 
            News Bulletin</strong>-That the Parliament supports a &quot;Scottish 
            Six&quot; main evening BBC television news bulletin, produced and 
            edited in Scotland rather than in London and mixing an appropriate 
            blend of Scottish, UK and international news, similar to the excellent 
            format of BBC Radio Scotland; notes that the Broadcasting Council 
            for Scotland is in favour of a &quot;Scottish Six&quot;, that 51 BBC 
            Scotland journalists have publicly supported this important broadcasting 
            reform and that opinion surveys show that a &quot;Scottish Six&quot; 
            is supported by 69 per cent of the people of Scotland; believes that 
            it is absurd that, in post-devolution Scotland, viewers north of the 
            border are still subject to London-based stories about English health 
            and education issues, which are very often misleading for a Scots 
            audience, while Scottish health and education are ignored by the BBC's 
            London-centric output, and expresses astonishment that Tom Harris 
            MP should describe Scottish-based news programming as &quot;parochial&quot; 
            (<em>The Herald,</em> 1 February 2002), regarding this as a slur on 
            the professionalism, editorial judgement, and abilities of BBC Scotland 
            journalists and management. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2689</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Radio Borders</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates Radio Borders on celebrating its 12th 
            anniversary and recognises the important service provided by local 
            radio stations in airing matters of concern to their broadcasting 
            constituencies, thus making them integral to the political and democratic 
            process.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2688</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes: Public Concern at 
            Work</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of an 
            office in Scotland by Public Concern at Work, congratulates the charity 
            on the launch of a dedicated Scottish helpline number (0141 550 7572) 
            offering confidential advice to Scottish workers about malpractice 
            in the workplace; urges employers from all sectors in Scotland to 
            work constructively with Public Concern at Work, and calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to recognise the role that public interest whistleblowing 
            can and does play in increasing openness and accountability in the 
            workplace.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2687#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: Untenable Position 
            of Independent Assessors</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the untenable position of the 12 new Independent Assessors appointed 
            on 29 January 2002; believes that none of the 12 can command public 
            confidence and that these appointments should be annulled, and considers 
            that it should investigate this shoddy process and, in particular, 
            should examine (a) why half the Independent Assessors appointed were 
            active Labour Party members and (b) why only 27 people applied for 
            these vacancies.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2686</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Scottish Qualifications 
            Authority Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees to the general 
            principles of the Scottish Qualifications Authority Bill.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Nicol Stephen<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2685#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Funding the 
            Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes with concern that the level of funding to be given by the Scottish 
            Executive for the first year of operation of its proposed Loch Lomond 
            and Trossachs National Park at £2.8 million is half the amount of 
            <br>
            £5.6 million required by the Park's interim committee; further notes 
            that this contrasts sharply with the £14 million of taxpayers money 
            which is being spent on landscaping the new Parliament building at 
            Holyrood, and believes that the Scottish Executive should, without 
            delay, reconsider its grant aid to the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National 
            Park and should commission research to establish how many additional 
            tourists and what impact on traffic flows there will be following 
            the creation of the National Park, so that any further demands on 
            the local transport infrastructure can be determined.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2684#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie: Draft Guidance 
            on the Circumstances in which Parents may Choose to Educate their 
            Children at Home</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish 
            Executive's consultation on the draft <em>Guidance on the Circumstances 
            in which Parents may Choose to Educate their Children at Home</em>; 
            believes that this will provide an opportunity for the views of children 
            and parents, who clearly have concerns about the content of the draft 
            guidance, to be taken into account, and further believes that the 
            right to choose education outwith school should be facilitated with 
            due respect for data protection and human rights legislation and that 
            the guidance should not discriminate unreasonably between those children 
            who have never attended and those who are removed from state schools.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2683</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Scottish Veterans 
            of the International Brigade</strong>-That the Parliament offers warm 
            greetings to the very small band of Scottish veterans of the British 
            Battalion of the International Brigade; notes that they and their 
            late Scottish comrades formed a full 25% of the British Battalion; 
            acknowledges their courage and radical determination to assist the 
            democratically elected Spanish Government in stemming the ugly tide 
            of fascism so many years ago, at a time when some European governments 
            sought to appease the fascists in Spain, Germany and Italy; recalls 
            that these Scottish veterans, along with other veterans of the International 
            Brigade, were honoured by the Spanish Government on the 60th Anniversary 
            of the Spanish Civil War with honorary Spanish citizenship, and offers 
            its best wishes to these distinguished Scottish veterans of a distant 
            war against fascism.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2682</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: The Co-op and Labelling 
            in Braille</strong>-That the Parliament commends the Co-operative 
            Society (Co-op) on the introduction of labelling in braille for products 
            sold in its retail stores and shops; believes that this initiative 
            will be welcomed by blind and partially-sighted customers of the Co-op, 
            and urges other large retailers to follow the example set by the Co-op 
            in providing this kind of assistance to such members of the community, 
            whose needs are too often ignored.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Dorothy-Grace Elder<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2681</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Rural Postal 
            Services</strong>-That the Parliament notes the decision by the Postal 
            Services Commission to bring an end to Royal Mail's monopoly over 
            letter deliveries; expresses its concern over the threat that this 
            may pose to postal services in rural areas, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to do all that it can in order to ensure that these services 
            are protected.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Dorothy-Grace Elder<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2680</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Funds Paid to 
            the Third Age Group</strong>-That the Parliament notes with grave 
            concern the most recent allegations regarding links between the constituency 
            office of former First Minister Henry McLeish in Glenrothes and the 
            Third Age Group and regarding the payment of £40,000 in grants by 
            Fife Council to the charity for two years after it ceased to exist; 
            believes that, once again, activities in the constituency of the former 
            First Minister are likely to cast a deep shadow over his activity 
            as a member of the Scottish Parliament, and calls for an independent 
            inquiry into relations between Fife Council, the Third Age Group and 
            the former First Minister's constituency office in order to determine 
            who was responsible for granting such funds to the Third Age Group 
            and what they were used for.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2679</strong> <strong>Iain Gray: The Draft Town and Country 
            Planning (Fees for Applications and Deemed Applications) (Scotland) 
            Amendment Regulations 2002</strong>-That the Transport and the Environment 
            Committee recommends that the draft Town and Country Planning (Fees 
            for Applications and Deemed Applications) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 
            2002 be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2678</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: Community Care 
            and Health (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that 
            the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry, Mrs Mary Mulligan</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2677</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Widening Access 
            Accolade for Stirling and other Universities</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates the University of Stirling on coming first in <em>The 
            Times Higher Education Supplement's</em> &quot;Access Elite&quot; list 
            of universities in the UK that perform best at widening access to 
            pupils from poorer backgrounds, based on four criteria, namely (a) 
            inclusive access, (b) low dropout rates, (c) quality of teaching and 
            (d) research and applauds the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow School 
            of Art, Heriot-Watt University and the University of Dundee for taking 
            the next four places to give Scotland a clean sweep of the UK's top 
            five higher education institutions in this survey.</p>

            Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2676</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Freemasons</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the declaration of Mr Keith Harding MSP as a 
            Freemason in the register of members' interests on 31 January 2002 
            and encourages all other MSPs who are members of the craft, a body 
            of men dedicated to charitable good works, to make similar voluntary 
            declarations in support of the Consultative Steering Group's principles 
            of openness, accountability and transparency.</p>

          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2674</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Budget (Scotland)

            (No.3) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jack McConnell, Mr Jim Wallace, Patricia Ferguson, 
            Peter Peacock</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2673</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: OECD Programme 
            for International Student Assessment: Scottish Report</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the OECD <em>Programme for International Student 
            Assessment: Scottish Report </em>which confirmed that Scotland's young 
            people have the potential to be the best in the world in terms of 
            school attainment but that they have not yet reached that position; 
            congratulates students and teachers on their performance in the light 
            of continual interference from a Scottish Executive which is not meeting 
            its own targets in education, and notes that the report specifically 
            states that &quot;the performance in reading literacy of students 
            (at age 15) varied substantially with the amount of time they read 
            for enjoyment&quot;, thus confirming the importance of enjoyment and 
            personal satisfaction in educational attainment in contrast to imposing 
            the treadmill of over assessment which remains the Scottish Executive's 
            policy.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2672</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Mansfield Place 
            Church</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Mansfield Traquair 
            Trust for its success to date in restoring the fabric of the Catholic 
            Apostolic Church at Mansfield Place, Edinburgh, which is an excellent 
            example of romanesque style by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson and home 
            to the most uplifting, scintillating and luminescent murals from the 
            arts and craft movement by Phoebe Anna Traquair, completed in 1901, 
            but now, sadly, in great need of careful restoration; notes that the 
            Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations has already agreed a 
            long term lease to use the building as its new headquarters, thereby 
            providing a secure basis for the future, and calls upon Historic Scotland, 
            national lottery organisations and other public agencies to continue 
            to give the Mansfield Traquair Trust every assistance so that the 
            building and its superior decorative illuminations are available for 
            the enjoyment of the Scottish people and art lovers world-wide.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2671</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Perth Bid 
            for New SNH Headquarters</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that 
            Scottish Natural Heritage intends to move its headquarters out of 
            Edinburgh; notes previous commitments by the Scottish Executive on 
            the dispersion of civil service and other public sector jobs, and 
            welcomes the submission from Perth and Kinross Council highlighting 
            the suitability of a number of sites in Perthshire.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2670</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Asylum Policy of 
            Australian Government</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the Australian 
            Government for its inhumane asylum policy which has led directly to 
            over 300 desperate and imprisoned asylum seekers embarking on hunger 
            strikes to highlight their case for asylum and their appalling treatment 
            by the Australian Government; finds this inhumane treatment particularly 
            offensive having recently witnessed Holocaust memorial services across 
            Scotland; regards it as a shameful fact of history that, had those 
            seeking asylum from Nazi Germany been allowed into neighbouring countries, 
            many lives could have been saved, and therefore urges the Scottish 
            Executive to make representations to the Australian Government to 
            register our opposition to its asylum policy.</p>

            the United Nations on its co-ordination of the International Year 
            of Mountains; believes that an appropriate way to celebrate the year 
            would be to ensure that the Cairngorm Mountain Range, the largest 
            continuous area of high ground above 1,000 metres in Britain, is designated 
            a World Heritage Site, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should speedily propose discussions with Her Majesty's Government 
            to achieve the ultimate international acclaim of World Heritage Status 
            for this beautiful and environmentally unique part of our heritage.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2668</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant: Campbeltown - Ballycastle

            Scottish Executive of the call for tenders for the Campbeltown - Ballycastle 
            ferry; recognises that this announcement is the product of joint working 
            between the Scottish Executive, the Northern Ireland Executive and 
            the Scotland Office, and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that 
            the tendering process is concluded as soon as is practically possible 
            to ensure that the Campbeltown area can benefit from a ferry link 
            with Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2667</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Freedom of Information 
            (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Justice 1 Committee considers the 
            Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 in the following 
            order: sections 1 to 3, schedule 1, sections 4 to 8, sections 10 and

          <p><strong>S1M-2666</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Innovative Philosophy 
            Classes at Sunnyside Primary School, Alloa</strong>-That the Parliament 
            warmly congratulates the headteacher, Paul Cleghorn, and the teaching 
            staff at Sunnyside Primary School, Alloa, Clackmannanshire, for being 
            the first school in the country to introduce an innovative programme 
            of philosophy classes aimed at developing pupils' thinking and questioning 
            skills.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding, Mr George Reid</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2665</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: New Hospitals</strong>-That 
            the Parliament, whilst welcoming the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, 
            notes that it will cost £184 million to build and will cost taxpayers 
            some £1 billion to rent over its lifetime; agrees with the report 
            by NHS consultant Dr Matthew Dunnigan, <em>The Downsized Hypothesis: 
            Value for Money</em>, that the outdated analysis of patients needs 
            in the Lothian area used to determine the hospital's size has resulted 
            in an underestimate of the number of acute beds required; regrets 
            that the Scottish Executive has adopted the policy of previous Conservative 
            Governments in Westminster which enriched the private sector and impoverished 
            the NHS, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to review its 
            opposition to establishing a Scottish trust for public investment 
            to fund future projects similar to the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.

          <p> <strong>S1M-2664</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: UK Life League</strong>-That 
            the Parliament condemns unreservedly the tactics employed by the UK 
            Life League, particularly in terms of the horrific practice of using 
            photos of aborted foetuses and the personal tragedy of individuals 
            in the public eye, for extremely dubious political ends; regrets that 
            any group can deliberately misuse such material, particularly with 
            the specific intention of inducing fear, misinformation and confusion 
            amongst women; notes that the UK Life League website is a haven for 
            such propaganda, which is almost entirely based on falsehood and lies, 
            including the appropriation of other groups' logos and misrepresentation 
            of them to imply their support for the &quot;values&quot; of the UK 
            Life League, and reaffirms its commitment to freedom of speech for 
            all pressure groups, including legitimate pro-life organisations, 
            while remaining absolutely committed to the principle that it is a 
            woman's right to choose.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2663</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Mike Tyson</strong>-That

            Commission in the United States of America not to approve an application 
            from Mike Tyson for a licence to box in Las Vegas; expresses its concern 
            at speculation that the fight might be re-arranged to a UK venue; 
            recollects the anger that was caused by the Home Secretary's decision 
            to allow Mike Tyson, a convicted rapist, to enter the UK for a fight 
            in Glasgow on 24 June 2000; further notes that Mike Tyson has at no 
            time expressed public remorse for the crimes of violence for which 
            he has been convicted; expresses the hope that boxing promoters and 
            venue managers will resist suggestions that a second Tyson fight be 
            held in Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make a 
            firm commitment that it will oppose the licensing of any boxing match 
            involving Mike Tyson in Scotland and that it will make representations 
            to oppose any visa application that might be made.</p>

            &quot;Stop Now!&quot; campaign which is designed to put a stop to 
            unscrupulous sales tactics used by some gas and electricity companies 
            which are on the increase and which, customers report, can include 
            lying, bullying, misleading requests and intimidation; supports the 
            demands made by energywatch to ensure that the gas and electricity 
            companies' house is put in order by (a) the Office of Gas and Electricity 
            Markets (Ofgem) keeping and strengthening the operating licensing 
            conditions which the energy companies must comply with and which are 
            due to expire in March 2002, (b) Ofgem using its power to fine unscrupulous 
            energy companies, (c) the energy companies establishing a &quot;rogues' 
            register&quot; of sales agencies and individuals who fail to meet 
            acceptable standards, (d) the energy companies paying proper compensation 
            to consumers for any distress and inconvenience caused by their sales 
            malpractices and (e) the establishment of a standard format for energy

            urges the Scottish Executive to work in partnership with Scottish 
            energy companies to improve consumer relations, and commends energywatch

            rising trend of complaints against energy supply companies for malpractice 
            and maladministration relating to their sales techniques and transfer 
            processes; welcomes the launch of the energywatch &quot;Stop Now!&quot; 
            campaign aimed at tackling this trend, and calls upon the energy supply 
            companies to co-operate fully with energywatch and for the Office 
            of Gas and Electricity Markets to use its available powers to ensure 
            that customers are no longer transferred from supplier to supplier

            at the European Union Convention on the Future of Europe and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's

            now started to treat patients and was completed on time and within 
            budget; notes that this essential development would not have proceeded 
            without the foresight of successive Conservative Secretaries of State 
            for Scotland nor without the use of the innovative PFI scheme, and 
            calls on Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust to retain the historic

            young people with visual impairment in mainstream education through 
            the use of the innovative and much-praised RNIB equipment, Digital 
            Audio in Visual Impairment Education (DAVIE); celebrates the work 
            of the staff involved and the benefit experienced by all pupils in 
            Darnley because of this project; notes that RNIB revealed in a recent 
            research report, <em>Shaping the Future,</em> that, while 70% of blind 
            and partially-sighted pupils in Scotland attend their local primary 
            school, almost a quarter of such pupils do not receive the support 
            they require; further notes the support of Scottish Power plc in underpinning 
            the start of the Scottish roll-out of this initiative through the 
            award of a £132,000 grant, following an initial £42,000 grant awarded 
            by the Scottish Executive, to pilot DAVIE in Darnley Primary School, 
            and urges the Executive and the appropriate committees of the Parliament 
            to consider how this crucial work in the integration of, and support 
            for, visually impaired pupils and students in mainstream education 
            might best be supported and developed across Scotland.</p>
