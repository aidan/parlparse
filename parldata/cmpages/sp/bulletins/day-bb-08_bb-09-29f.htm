<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2617&diams; </strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Protection for Buyers of New-Build Homes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that in 2007 Helen Eadie MSP submitted a proposal for a Member&rsquo;s Bill, which would require a builder and a developer of a new-build home in Scotland to specify an entry date in the missives for the sale of that property and, if that entry date were missed, to enable buyers of that property to withdraw from the contract without penalty and to have returned to them any deposit or fees paid in advance together with interest and provide for compensation for delays should the purchaser wish still to continue with the contract; recognises that such delays were experienced by an individual in Kingseat who was forced to pay over &pound;4,000 in additional costs for living expenses, shelter and storage pending completion of his home and that similar experiences of high costs have been documented throughout Scotland; regrets that the Minister for Communities and Sport has yet to agree a date for a meeting on this issue or respond to the substantive issues around housing strategy raised during Health and Wellbeing question time on 26 June 2008 (<em>Official Report</em>, c. 10290); hopes that the Scottish Government will clarify whether it will support a proposed legislative change and examine the Court of Appeal decision of R (Khatun) v Newham LBC [2004] EWCA Civ 55, [2005] QB 37, which held that contracts relating to land are not within the scope of Council Directive 93/13/EEC and regulations; acknowledges that while C7 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 reserves those matters specified in that section (consumer protection) to Westminster, in this instance the Court of Appeal decision held that contracts or missives relating to land were not within the scope of the Directive or the Regulations, and considers that legislative changes proposed by Helen Eadie MSP, which will offer protection to home purchasers who currently have, according to the Scottish Consumer Council, more protection buying a video than buying a house, should be supported.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2616</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>National Deaf Children&rsquo;s Society Scotland&rsquo;s Pick a Number Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the National Deaf Children&rsquo;s Society (NDCS) Scotland&rsquo;s campaign report, <em>Pick a Number</em>, which highlights gaps in data collection on deaf children in Scotland; notes with concern that the number of deaf children in Scotland is currently unknown; acknowledges that this information, broken down by local authority area, would make it easier for partners in health, education and social care to plan effective interventions in a deaf child&rsquo;s life; is further concerned that, in the absence of this data, it is also difficult for the Scottish Government to monitor accurately the progress of deaf pupils in Scotland&rsquo;s schools; is disappointed that no national information has been collected on the number of children in Scotland diagnosed with a hearing loss at birth since the introduction of Universal Newborn Hearing Screening tests in 2005; further notes that the annual Scottish pupil census, Pupils in Scotland, collects data only on those deaf children who have a statutory support plan in place, where hearing impairment has been stated as a reason for additional support; acknowledges the NDCS&rsquo;s concern that parents of deaf children in Scotland are having difficulties in accessing such statutory support plans for their deaf children; notes that while <em>Pupils in Scotland, 2007</em> records 905 deaf pupils in Scottish schools, the NDCS estimates that there are at least 1,800 school-aged children in Scotland with a severe to profound hearing loss, with many more who have mild to moderate losses, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to improve data collection mechanisms on deaf children from NHS and education sources to form the basis of a nationally agreed register of deaf children in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2615</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Alness for Fifth Britain in Bloom Gold Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the volunteers and businesses whose efforts and contributions have resulted in Alness winning a gold award in the 2008 Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Britain in Bloom competition and notes that this latest success is the town&rsquo;s fifth gold award in Britain in Bloom and its 39th award in different competitions, putting Alness once again firmly on Britain&rsquo;s floral map.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2614</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Aileen McGlynn</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates cyclist Aileen McGlynn and her tandem pilot, Ellen Hunter, on securing two cycling gold medals in the 2008 Paralympic Games; notes that Paisley-born Aileen McGlynn broke her own world record to secure the 1km tandem time trial as well as capturing gold in the 3km pursuit tandem and recognises that the efforts of the Johnstone Wheelers Cycling Club member will provide inspiration to all young athletes.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2613</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Impact of Rising Fuel Costs on Community Transport Organisations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the vitally important work that many thousands of volunteer drivers undertake in taking patients to and from hospitals, GP surgeries and day centres; notes that the increasing cost of fuel is putting many of these services at risk as the fuel allowance for volunteer drivers remains at 40p per mile while the cost of fuel has escalated; is concerned about the impact on local health services if volunteer drivers can no longer afford to help their communities; welcomes the cross-party support&nbsp;at Westminster for the petition to ask HM Revenue and Customs to raise the rate at which it permits charities to reimburse volunteer drivers from 40p to 50p per mile for their fuel costs, and urges the Scottish Government to work constructively with the UK Government to ensure that Scottish interests are fully represented.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2612</strong> <strong>Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Supermarkets in the Highlands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Highland consumers have a limited choice of supermarkets to shop at; regrets the impact that the dominance of a few supermarkets has on consumers, both in terms of choice and value for money, and believes that local authorities and government, when considering applications for new supermarkets, should take into consideration consumer choice as well as the negative impact they may have on the sustainability of small and independent outlets before granting applications.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2610</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Action for Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the launch of Action for Children and Action for Children in Scotland, formerly NCH and NCH Scotland; notes the publication of <em>As long as it takes: a new politics for children</em> to coincide with the launch; congratulates NCH and its predecessor organisations for all their work on behalf of children since 1869; welcomes Action for Children&rsquo;s commitment to building on all of that work, and wishes it well as it continues its work for children and young people for as long as it takes.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2609#</strong> <strong>Christopher Harvie:</strong> <strong>The Kingdom of Fife and Fife in the World - A Platform of Partnership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament greets the Year of Homecoming and envisages the pioneering of a &quot;platform of partnership&quot; using the Kingdom of Fife as a trial project involving the creation of worldwide internet links between places with Fife names, affected by Fifers or twinned with Fife communities and involving schools, churches, community groups and associations, and hopes that the resumption of the Rosyth to Zeebrugge ferry can make this virtual bond a real one.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2608</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Scottish Community Councils and Community Empowerment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in organising the recent regional meeting of the Association of Scottish Community Councils in Glasgow City Chambers, which included a question time session with parliamentarians chaired by broadcaster John Mackay; notes that this gave community councillors the opportunity to question politicians on a number of matters of concern, including their views on devolving greater responsibilities, for example financial responsibilities, to community councils; welcomes the fact that 82 of the 129 MSPs elected to the Scottish Parliament were elected on a platform that promised to empower community councils; considers that the Labour Party was the only party not to do so and hopes that it will join the political consensus and support the devolving of further responsibilities to communities, including community councils, and looks forward to cross-party support for any Scottish Government pilot for empowering local communities.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2544#</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Missed Out, Missing Out</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by Quarriers of <em>Missed Out, Missing Out</em> and shares Quarriers&rsquo; concern that service provision for adults with learning disabilities is inconsistent in Ayrshire and across Scotland, especially for those 12,500 adults with learning disabilities who live at home, and considers that there should be a review of data collection, planning services and the current eligibility criteria used to determine service provision for these vulnerable individuals and that all disabled adults should be provided with the proactive support required to achieve their lifestyle aspirations, including appropriate housing options, advocacy and short breaks.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2544.1</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Missed Out, Missing Out</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2544) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, insert at end &quot;and further considers that this review should include single outcome agreements and the extent to which they make provision for adults with learning disability a priority.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-2539#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Aircraft Noise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that increased protection is needed for communities directly under airport flight paths, such as Whitecrook, Linnvale and Drumry in Clydebank, which are affected by aircraft noise, a problem which also affects adjacent areas such as Drumchapel, Bearsden and Milngavie, and considers that there should be an examination of what fresh legislative or administrative steps might be taken to prevent any forced sale of Glasgow Airport leading to a worsening of noise pollution experienced by local residents.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2539.1</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Aircraft Noise</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2539) in the name of Des McNulty, after &quot;Milngavie,&quot; insert &quot;Johnstone, Elderslie and other parts of Renfrewshire,&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2482#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Action on Thrombosis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that, according to provisional figures from the Scottish Government, the total number of deaths from thrombosis in 2007 was 12,275, which represents 21% of all deaths in Scotland; further notes that in 2006 thrombosis killed more than fifty times the number of people who died from MRSA and Clostridium difficile combined, and therefore considers that action should be taken to increase awareness of thrombosis among the public and health professionals and establish an effective prevention strategy for thrombosis in Scottish hospitals, such as some sort of screening regime, to help save valuable NHS resources from treating a disease that can often be prevented if a patient knows they are at risk in the first place and to help avoid tragedies like that of Katie McPherson from Langbank, who died as a result of deep vein thrombosis.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2419#</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Alloa to Fife and Edinburgh Rail Link</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the South East of Scotland Transport Partnership has proposed that a feasibility study into a rail passenger service between Alloa or Stirling and Edinburgh via Fife should be sought; believes that the upgrading of the Charlestown Junction would allow a direct rail service between Alloa and Edinburgh and improve direct freight operations from the west coast via Stirling-Alloa and into Rosyth; notes that the usage of the newly reopened Stirling-Alloa rail service has greatly exceeded the forecast passenger numbers, and believes that there is a strong case for early work to explore the opportunities to increase the sustainable transport options available to people in the Stirling, Fife and Edinburgh areas.</p>
