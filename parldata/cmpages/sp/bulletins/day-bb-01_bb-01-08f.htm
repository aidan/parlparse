            <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Save Our Small Shops</strong>—That the Parliament 
            supports the small shops and family businesses of Scotland and honours 
            their contribution to the individuality of towns and villages; calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to have a strategy to protect locally 
            owned shops against unrestricted development of out of town shopping 
            centres, which have devastated existing trade in many areas and contributed 
            to the closure of many small shops in Scotland, and to carry out an 
            audit of remaining family-run shops and hold talks with owners and 
            staff over their urgent concerns that Scotland does not have enough 
            shoppers to justify unrestricted growth; recognises that the individuality 
            of shops and the hard work of shopkeepers form a community service 
            as well as contributing to tourism and does not want our high streets 
            to be taken over completely by the same giant chains which operate 
            everywhere.</font></p>

            <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Recognition of the Work in Clearing Snow</strong>—That 
            the Parliament thanks profoundly the &quot;true grit&quot; workers 
            of Scotland who battled against the blizzards to keep the country 
            running; acknowledges that these workers, many of whom were from local 
            authorities and were in dispute recently over poor pay and conditions, 
            turned out in the public interest and performed a heroic task; moreover, 
            believes that that the gritting crews and snow shovellers everywhere 
            proved that the &quot;the breakdown of civilisation as we know it&quot; 
            would not occur if the grand and titled or politicians ceased to exist, 
            but that civilisation would breakdown in days without the dedicated 
            work and public spirit of manual workers, whose recent labours showed 
            the fallacy of over concentration on high technology; notes that it 
            was not IT but the human hand and brain which beat the weather, and 
            furthermore, not only formally thanks these workers for their contribution 
            but believes that they should be financially rewarded as Scottish 
            business would have lost millions more had people of courage and stamina 
            not come to the country’s rescue.</font></p>

            its regret and sadness following the recent death of Sir Jimmy Shand 
            at the age of 92; records its thanks for his outstanding and unique 
            contribution to the promotion of Scottish dance music since his first 
            recording in 1933; notes that he was recognised as an outstanding 
            exponent of Scottish accordion music throughout the world; commends 
            his sterling work in maintaining and reviving interest in this important 
            aspect of Scottish culture against fierce competition from new forms 
            of contemporary music from the 1950s throughout to the 1990s and offers 
            its sympathy and condolences to his wife and family and his many friends.</font></p>

            on its increasing success in winning orders and on its plans to recruit

            notes the recent studies which have shown that a skills shortage is 
            likely to develop in the labour force in the Scottish Borders in the 
            next few years, creating particular challenges for traditional industries 
            such as textiles and also for the construction industry, and therefore 
            urges all relevant agencies to develop plans for training, retraining 
            and upskilling, which will also assist in attracting high technology 
            inward investors to broaden the base of the Borders’ economy and in 
            expanding attractive job opportunities for young people near their 
            home localities.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Snowmen</strong>—That the Parliament agrees with 
            Raymond Briggs, author of the book <i>The Snowman</i>, that it is 
            absolute rubbish to suggest that snowmen are racist and sexist; believes 
            that the paper produced by Dr Tricia Cusack claiming that the snow 
            sculptures are phallic symbols which help oppress women and represent 
            greed, nationalism and capitalism is so out of touch with the innocence 
            and joy experienced by children of all ages who build snowmen; further 
            believes that such a publication is not worthy of academic endorsement, 
            and calls upon children throughout Scotland to build as many snowmen

            of the Highland regiments during the First World War and that they 
            inspired Scottish troops into battle on behalf of our country, and 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to consider what action can be taken 
            to erect a suitable and lasting national memorial as a mark of respect

            on setting up an independent review of the appeals process for the 
            2000 diet of school examinations, and calls upon the Minister to ensure

            last four years whereas the increase in state benefits for the same 
            period is less than 10%; believes that the proposed transitional scheme

            intervention before the recess to investigate and alleviate the crisis

            since the service was privatised in November and others are threatening 
            to resign and where some prisons could face a possibly life-threatening 
            situation over the holiday season if locums without experience of 
            prisons or of the risk of suicide at this time of year are used to

            claim that some of them are being asked to service distant prisons 
            more than half an hour away from their own prison which would make 
            it impossible to arrive in time for emergencies and that the crisis

            are deplorable and which the private company Medacs, operating from 
            Yorkshire, is proposing for Scottish prison doctors; believes that 
            the shortage of recruits is worsening while experienced prison doctors 
            leave in anger and that overall conditions for doctors, prisoners 
            and staff, have worsened since the service was privatised, and accordingly

            tax in Glasgow has risen by 36% since 1996-97, compared to the Scottish 
            average of 25.1% over that period, taking it from the third highest 
            to the highest in Scotland and that, according to the City Council 
            itself, council tax will have to rise by twice the rate of inflation

            students who carried out that stirring and symbolic act at Christmas

            post war era; considers that their daring action sprang from the purest 
            of motives and was one of great courage, as they risked their futures 
            in those harsh times to alert the world to Scotland’s needs; believes

            from closure in November as they are unable to pay their £11,000 wage

            case of care in the community running into funding problems and that 
            closure would mean that, of the 71 clients, an estimated 20 to 30

            years of age, are able to remain in their own homes only because of 
            the existence of the threatened day care services and that local doctors, 
            clergy and families all appeal for the service, which was founded 
            in 1992, to be saved as a matter of the greatest urgency, and considers

            <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Establishment of a Children's Fund</strong>—That 
            the Parliament applauds the decision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer 
            to establish a Children’s Fund south of the border as a way of providing 
            funding to local organisations and communities to tackle child poverty; 
            believes that such a fund will go a long way to help young people 
            develop their own projects and solutions to everyday problems, fund 
            existing initiatives, support voluntary and local community projects 
            and help promote children’s involvement in services; is concerned 
            that the Scottish Executive appears hesitant about establishing a 
            Children’s Fund in Scotland, and calls for consultation with community 
            children’s organisations and young people on the establishment of 
            an innovative and creative Children’s Fund, without the complex system 
            of partnerships and funding mazes that bedevil so many other of their 
            strategies.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Voluntary Sector Access to Criminal Record Information</strong>—That 
            the Parliament welcomes plans to introduce detailed criminal record 
            checks on people working with children under 18 from July 2001; notes, 
            however, that many voluntary organisations are deeply concerned at 
            having to pay to obtain enhanced criminal record certificates; believes 
            such costs place an extra burden on groups working with children; 
            accepts the consensus position within the voluntary sector that it 
            should not have to pay for access to vital child protection information; 
            understands that financial barriers placed in the way of organisations 
            working with children mean fewer safe environments for children and 
            create a barrier to social inclusion, and asks the Scottish Executive 
            to ensure that the voluntary sector free access across the board to 
            criminal record information. </font></p>

            <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Discrimination Against Teaching Centres of Artistic 
            Excellence</strong>—That the Parliament notes the decision of the Department 
            for Education and Employment to introduce Dance and Drama Awards for 
            students to study at institutions in England and Wales; is aware that 
            Scottish students compete on equal terms for places at such institutions 
            with their counterparts from other parts of the United Kingdom and 
            the European Union (EU); is concerned that tuition fees are only paid 
            if students study in England and Wales and regrets that no parallel 
            funding scheme exists for students who wish to study in Scotland; 
            believes that this discrimination against Scottish institutions can 
            only harm them and in the case of Ballet West may force it out of 
            business or to relocate from Taynuilt to outwith Scotland, to the 
            detriment of the local economy and employment; notes that Ballet West 
            attracts students from across the United Kingdom, the EU and as far 
            afield as Guatemala, Japan and Malaysia and outperforms competitor 
            schools from south of the border in ballet competitions and quality 
            of training; is puzzled by the Minister for Children and Education’s 
            view that &quot;there is no evidence of significant demand for Dance 
            and Drama training for young people aged 16 and over in Scotland&quot; 
            when 613 applications were received by Ballet West for 23 places; 
            regrets that 34 students withdrew or rejected offers from Ballet West 
            due to lack of funding, compared with only two students doing so at 
            English institutions; notes that the Excellence Fund supports and 
            encourages talent secondary school dancers in Scotland but that the 
            only progression into tertiary training encouraged by the Scottish 
            Executive is in England; is concerned that Scotland will become denuded 
            of teaching centres of artistic excellence and be drained of artistic 
            talent as a result of this discrimination; believes the current position 
            of the Scottish Executive on this issue contradicts its own cultural 
            strategy that has as its key themes &quot;widening opportunities, 
            promoting education, developing and celebrating excellence&quot; and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should act in order that students 
            from across the UK can choose where to study dance, drama or stage 
            management based on the quality of course offered rather than on whether 
            or not tuition fees will be paid.</font></p>
