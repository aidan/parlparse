            and dedication of Scotland's 115,675 unpaid carers, a workforce comparable 
            to the total NHS workforce in Scotland; acknowledges the role of Scotland's 
            carer population as partners in the provision of care; recognises 
            the measures outlined in <em>Partnership for Care: Scotland&#146;s 
            Health White Paper</em> and in the Community Care and Health (Scotland) 
            Act 2002 to increase partnership working across the health and social 
            care services; notes that the health and well-being of many carers 
            are affected as a direct consequence of the physical and emotional 
            strains of caring; welcomes the dedication of care assistants across 
            Scotland in providing vital respite services to carers and their families;

            carers in Scotland and that, for appropriate support to be administered, 
            these carers must be identified; further welcomes the publication

            carers - Good Practice Guide </em>by the Princess Royal Trust for 
            Carers and the strategies for identifying carers contained therein, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should target resources 
            specifically on identifying and supporting carers in order that the 
            vision underpinning recent legislation can be realised. </p>
