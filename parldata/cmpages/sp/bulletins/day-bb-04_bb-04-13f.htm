          <p><strong>*S2M-1159#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Rosehill 
            Housing Co-operative</strong>-That the Parliament notes the excellent 
            Communities Scotland Pathfinder Inspection Report secured by Rosehill 
            Housing Co-operative in the Glasgow Pollok parliamentary constituency; 
            acknowledges the huge efforts of the staff and tenants at Rosehill 
            in creating excellent socially-rented housing in the community and 
            supporting broader community initiatives; welcomes the commitment 
            of the Scottish Executive to the greater involvement of tenants in 
            developing community housing plans, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should consider further how it can best support the further 
            development of fully mutual housing co-operatives.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1158</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>Yellow 
            Flag Seaside Award for Broughty Ferry</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the award of the prestigious Yellow Flag Seaside Award for Broughty 
            Ferry beach for the first time; congratulates the people of Broughty 
            Ferry and the members of the community council on their work towards 
            this achievement; acknowledges the contribution made by Dundee City 
            Council and other local organisations in this award, and recognises 
            the role played by investment in wastewater treatment made possible 
            by the Tay Wastewater project.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1157</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Torryburn Primary School</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            excellent follow-up report by HM Inspectorate of Education on Torryburn 
            Primary School, published on 21 March 2004; acknowledges the hard 
            work of the staff, pupils, parents and school board since the first 
            inspection in spring 2002; notes the involvement of both Newmills 
            and Torryburn Community Council and High Valleyfield Community Council 
            in this process; pays particular tribute to the work of the new head 
            teacher who took up post at the beginning of this academic year, and 
            congratulates all concerned and wishes the current staff and pupils 
            every success for the future.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1156#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Siting 
            of New Transport Agency in Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament supports 
            Glasgow as the location for the headquarters of the proposed Scottish 
            transport agency, Transport Scotland; recognises the employment benefits 
            that locating the agency in Glasgow would bring to the city; notes 
            the significance of Glasgow to Scotland's rail and road transport 
            networks; acknowledges the transport expertise currently within the 
            city, which includes the existing staff in the headquarters of Strathclyde 
            Passenger Transport and in Glasgow City Council, which currently runs 
            the National Driver Information and Control System (NADICS) network 
            on behalf of the Scottish Executive, and believes that the Executive 
            should give serious consideration to Glasgow as an ideal location 
            for Transport Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1155</strong> <strong>David Mundell:</strong> <strong>Launch 
            of the Gretna-Lockerbie-Annan Economic Regeneration Prospectus</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the launch of the prospectus published by 
            the Corridor Regeneration Strategy Steering Group outlining key objectives 
            and a number of themes to stimulate economic growth in Gretna, Lockerbie 
            and Annan to address the impact on the area of the cessation of power 
            production at Chapelcross in March 2005; notes that the regeneration 
            strategy, with its four principle themes of wealth, diversity, inspiration 
            and inclusion, recognises not only the challenges that the Gretna-Lockerbie-Annan 
            corridor now faces, but also the opportunities to be seized; congratulates 
            the steering group on its genuine joined-up and cross-party working 
            to date, and looks to the Scottish Executive to provide all the support 
            it can to the steering group's work and to the regeneration of the 
            Gretna-Lockerbie-Annan corridor.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1154</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Kenny 
            Richey, a Scot on Death Row</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            Kenny Richey, a British citizen who grew up in Edinburgh, has spent 
            16 years on death row in the State of Ohio, despite being described 
            by Amnesty International as a &quot;compelling case of apparent innocence&quot;; 
            notes that following the case having been heard at the sixth Circuit 
            Court of Appeals on 7 May 2003 a final decision is expected imminently 
            on whether he should face execution; notes that important forensic 
            and eye witness evidence has come to light since the original verdict 
            was reached which casts serious doubt on its safety; notes, however, 
            that this new evidence has not been heard by a court of law, and considers 
            that the First Minister should urge the UK Government to make direct 
            and robust representations to the state authorities in Ohio on behalf 
            of Kenny Richey.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Colin Fox<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1153</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for the Scots Language</strong>-That the Parliament urges the Scottish 
            Executive to set up a board to promote the use and study of the Scots 
            language similar to the Ulster-Scots Agency, set up under the Good 
            Friday Agreement, which advises ministers and co-ordinates activities 
            relating to the promotion of Ulster-Scots as a living language and 
            to respond to international criticism such as &quot;That Scots language 
            in Scotland is very clearly under-funded, under-researched, under-maintained 
            compared to Gaelic, Irish or Ulster Scots&quot; by providing greater 
            support for the Scots language.</P>
