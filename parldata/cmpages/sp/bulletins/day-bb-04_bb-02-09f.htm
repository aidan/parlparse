          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-884</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Fife Council on Increased Recycling</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent Audit Scotland report which shows that Fife Council recycled 5.2% of waste during 2002-03, that this is more than double the recycling rate in the previous year and that Fife Council figures show that nearly 17% of waste is currently recycled; further notes that Fife Council has instituted kerbside collections of recyclable waste with assistance from the Scottish Executive's Strategic Waste Fund; congratulates Fife Council and the people of Fife for their success in moving from a situation where barely a fiftieth of waste was recycled to one where almost a fifth is; trusts that this positive trend continues, and hopes that local authorities across Scotland will be encouraged to follow Fife's example.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-883</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Police Recruitment in Forth Valley</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the three local authorities of Clackmannanshire, Falkirk and Stirling that form the Central Scotland Police Board to provide the chief constable with the funds to recruit an additional 70 police officers over the next year and believes that this will be a welcome boost to combating crime and anti-social behaviour in Forth Valley.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-882</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Scottish Affairs Select Committee - Election of MSPs</strong>-That the Parliament notes the report by the Scottish Affairs Select Committee published on 3 February 2004; further notes the motion that the Parliament passed on 27 March 2002 on the size of the Scottish Parliament; believes that any modification to the number of the Parliament's elected representatives and the system by which they are elected should be a matter for the Parliament, and considers that, until such time as this Parliament has sovereignty for all matters related to its operation, the House of Commons should not amend the Scotland Act 1998 unless such changes have the consent of the Parliament.</P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-881</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Chinese Army Invite to Military Tattoo</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the invitation to the Chinese People's Liberation Army to attend the Edinburgh Military Tattoo in view of continuing human rights abuses carried out by the Chinese Government, especially in Tibet.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-880</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Miss X: Chief Inspector of Social Work Report</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that following the conviction of James Mercer, Alexander Maben and Ross Douglas in July 2002 of serious assaults on Miss X, there have been three reports into Scottish Borders Council Social Work Department's handling of the case, the Stallard Report, published in October 2002, the Black Report, published in June 2003 and the Bates Report, published in September 2003 and that thereafter the Minister for Education and Young People announced an inspection of the case by the Chief Inspector of Social Work on 13 June 2003; further notes that the final report with recommendations was sent to Scottish Borders Council on 21 November 2003 and according to the council returned to the inspectorate in December 2003; notes that since December 2003 several senior managers in the council's Social Work Department with involvement in the case have negotiated early retirement packages which would see them leave their positions by March/April 2004, and therefore, in all the above circumstances, calls on the Scottish Executive to inquire of the Chief Inspector of Social Work the reasons for the delay in publication, with a view to securing publication now.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-879</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Hydro Aluminium Extrusion</strong>-That the Parliament notes with regret the decision by Hydro Aluminium Extrusion Ltd (HAE) of Sanquhar to close in July 2004 with the loss of 76 jobs if no alternative can be identified; further notes the vital importance of medium-sized companies such as HAE to the local economies of areas such as Upper Nithsdale and the devastating effect which the loss of 76 jobs will have on the community, given the poor transport and IT links which exist in that part of the Dumfries and Galloway region, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward specific proposals for improving the A76 in order to increase the competitiveness and sustainability of those companies which depend on that route.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-878</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Death of Ron Thompson</strong>-That the Parliament notes with deep sadness the death of the much admired journalist Ron Thompson who, for over fifty years, dedicated his life to the media; recognises his great contribution to journalism through the <em>Dundee Courier, Daily Herald, Sunday Mail </em>and<em> Sunday Express</em> and his outstanding record as an interviewer with Grampian TV, and extends its sympathy to his wife Mima and son Alastair.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong>, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, Kate Maclean<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-877#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Livestock Improvement Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the considerable success over the last few years of the Livestock Improvement Scheme and, in particular, the Bull Hire Scheme in providing quality bulls to crofters at reasonable prices; notes with concern changes to the scheme that will require crofters to pay in advance for bull hire and wintering costs; fears that these changes will deter crofters from obtaining high quality bulls with quality assurance and thus run against the committed aims of both the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department and the Crofters Commission of increasing the quality of the Scottish beef herd, and believes that the Scottish Executive should improve the efficiency of the current scheme rather than introducing upfront payments for bull hire that would put a severe financial strain on scheme members.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-876</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No. 2) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>-That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No. 2) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/43) be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-875#</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Palliative Care in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the initiative of overnight palliative care nurses in Lanarkshire that enables patients with end-stage cancer to be cared for and die at home if that is their wish; recognises the value this work brings to the lives of vulnerable people and their families and the efforts made to take a multi-disciplinary approach; believes that this will encourage a culture of cooperation rather than competition; recognises the need for similar schemes to be rolled out across Scotland while having regard to the different needs in different parts of Scotland, and notes the gaps in the system which need to be addressed such as care for adolescents who do not fall under the care of either adult or paediatric specialists.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-874</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Support for Scottish Community Drama Association</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the considerable contribution made to community arts throughout Scotland by the Scottish Community Drama Association (SCDA); notes the key role played by SCDA in fostering the development of new dramatic talent; profoundly regrets the decision by the Scottish Arts Council to withdraw SCDA's core funding of &pound;50,000, and calls on the Scottish Executive to secure the reinstatement of funding to ensure that the excellent, value for money service provided by SCDA is supported and made secure.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Pauline McNeill<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-873</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Millennium Development Goals</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the commitment of Her Majesty's Government to the Millennium Development Goals and to increase its aid budget to 0.4% of its GDP by 2006; notes with concern, however, that the United Nations (UN), the World Bank and others have warned that these goals, which include the goal of reducing by 50% the number of people in the world who live in absolute poverty by 2015, will not be met without significantly increased development assistance; congratulates Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Luxembourg for achieving the UN aid budget target of 0.7% of their respective GDPs; welcomes the commitment of Ireland, Belgium and France in setting clear timetables for reaching that target by 2007, 2010 and 2012 respectively, and believes that Her Majesty's Government should follow the example of these countries and likewise commit to the UN aid budget target.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-872</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Homelessness in East Lothian</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the Pathfinder Inspection Report in January 2004 regarding the performance of East Lothian Council in its functions as a social landlord, particularly in relation to its homelessness obligations; further notes the indictment of services delivered to homeless people, that the council (a) operates a quota system for the allocation of re-lets to homeless people so that only one in four is so allocated, resulting in a high number of households being placed in bed and breakfast accommodation for &quot;significant periods of time&quot;, (b) is failing to offer any accommodation to a small number of households to whom it owes a statutory duty, and (c) could not provide inspectors with reliable figures on the provision of permanent accommodation for homeless people; recognises that the report recommends, <em>inter alia</em> that the council (a) provides access to suitable temporary accommodation for all homeless people to whom it has a duty, (b) must publish a policy setting out its rules for allocating houses to homeless people to whom it has a duty and ensure that that policy complies with statutory requirements, and (c) should ensure that homeless applicants are always referred to an appropriate officer for assessment and that any discussion of an applicant's circumstances is appropriate, adequate and is conducted in private; further notes that the report found &quot;a general lack of enthusiasm on the part of the council to consider any change to its current approach to the allocation of permanent accommodation to homeless people&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Executive, as a matter of some urgency, to take appropriate steps to ensure that the council complies with its statutory obligations in the interests of the vulnerable homeless people in East Lothian.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-871</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>End to Nursery Nurses Pay Dispute in Stirling</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that nursery nurses in Stirling are to end their industrial action following an agreement over pay with Stirling Council; notes that as a result they will take no further part in the national pay dispute; believes local bargaining of this nature is best for all stakeholders involved, and commends it to other parts of Scotland.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Murdo Fraser, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong>, Mr Ted Brocklebank<strong>*</strong>, Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong><a name="870"></a>S2M-870#</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> <strong>The Institute for Science Education in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes the widespread concerns about the future of science education in Scotland; believes the declining popularity of science subjects in schools and at further and higher education levels has consequences for economic development; welcomes the establishment of the Institute for Science Education in Scotland, a unique network of scientists working with science teachers to support excellence in science teaching throughout Scotland; notes that the aim of the institute is to work with the thousands of people in the Scottish science community who are determined to reverse the decline in the popularity of science at schools, colleges and universities; further notes the priority set by the Scottish Science Advisory Committee in its recent report, <em>Why Science Education Matters</em>, on development of the institute; notes that the institute has the support of all Scotland's universities, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the General Teaching Council for Scotland; further notes the creation of a National Centre for Excellence in Science Education in England with support from the Wellcome Trust and the Department for Education and Skills, and considers that the Scottish Executive should support the development of the institute.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Murdo Fraser, Mr Brian Monteith</P>

          <P>Supported by: Michael Matheson</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-868</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Ally MacLeod</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the immense contribution made to Scottish football by the late Ally MacLeod as a player with Third Lanark, St Mirren, Hibernian, Ayr United and Blackburn Rovers and as a manager with Ayr United, Aberdeen, Motherwell, Airdrieonians, Queen of the South and the Scottish international team, and extends its condolences to his wife Faye, his family, and to the many friends he made in Ayr, Scotland and throughout the world.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon, Mary Scanlon<strong>*</strong>, Jim Mather<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-867</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Recycling Figures</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the disappointing figures on waste and rates of recycling published by Audit Scotland on 5 February 2004; notes the very poor overall increase in recycling and composting rates; is concerned by the fact that 200,000 tonnes more of Scotland's waste has gone to landfill in the last year than in the previous year; urges the Scottish Executive to show the necessary leadership to local authorities to ensure that they dramatically increase the amount of kerbside recycling and composting currently carried out in order to reach the target of 25% by 2006, and calls on the Scottish Executive to move immediately to adopt a policy of zero waste, with timetables, in order to stem the flow of waste being produced.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Robin Harper, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Rob Gibson, Mr Mark Ruskell, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-866#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Asbestos-Related Illnesses</strong>-That the Parliament notes with deep concern recent projections regarding the increasing prevalence of asbestos-related illnesses in Scotland; notes that the historic concentration of heavy industry on Clydeside has left a devastating health legacy, affecting many former shipyard and engineering workers and their families; notes that although former shipyard communities show the highest incidence of asbestos-related disease, evidence now shows that ever-increasing numbers of workers from other parts of Scotland have also become victims of asbestos-related illnesses due largely to the past use of asbestos in construction; considers that the Scottish Executive should give urgent consideration to bringing forward an integrated strategy to assist all those affected by asbestos-related illnesses, which should combine screening and testing people who may have been at risk in order to ensure early diagnosis, counselling and support for victims and their families, and the provision of specialist palliative care, and further considers that the Scottish Executive should work along with COSLA, NHS boards and other key bodies, including the Health and Safety Executive to ensure that necessary information is made available to potential sufferers from asbestos-related illnesses and all those professionals in health, local government and other services who may be in the position of assisting victims and their families.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Jackie Baillie, Stewart Stevenson, Johann Lamont, Mr Duncan McNeil<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-865#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Challenge to Voting System</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the recent interference by a Westminster committee to change the voting pattern for the Scottish Parliament; believes it is yet another blow to the autonomy of Scottish governance; recognises that two elections for the Scottish Parliament have now taken place where the electorate have voted in 56 list MSPs; considers, therefore, that it would appear that the Scottish electorate understand the current system; suggests that the current system in Westminster where Scottish MPs vote on English legislation is confusing to voters in England, and considers that it would be more prudent and efficient to give greater fiscal power to the Scottish Parliament resulting in cost savings to taxpayers by reducing the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Colin Fox<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-864</strong> <strong>Iain Smith on behalf of the Procedures Committee:</strong> <strong>Oral Questions and Emergency Bills</strong>-That the Parliament notes the Procedures Committee's recommendations for changes to the format of Question Time and other aspects of oral questioning in its 2nd Report, 2003 (Session 2), <em>Oral Questions in the Chamber</em>, and about the timing of First Minister's Question Time and Question Time in its 1st Report, 2004 (Session 2), <em>Oral Questions and Time in the Chamber</em>, further notes the Committee's recommendations for changes to the procedure for Emergency Bills in its 2nd report, 2004 (Session 2), <em>Report on</em> <em>Emergency Bills</em>, and agrees that the changes to standing orders set out in Annexe A to the 2nd Report, 2003 (Session 2) and in Annexe A to the 2nd Report, 2004 (Session 2) should be made with effect from 13 February 2004.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-863</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Parliament Electoral System</strong>-That the Parliament notes the report of the Scottish Affairs Committee<em>, Coincidence of Parliamentary Constituency Boundaries in Scotland and the Consequences of Change</em>, proposing an electoral system for Scottish Parliamentary elections that would undermine the principle of proportionality set out in the Scotland Act 1998 and overwhelmingly backed by a referendum of the Scottish people; condemns this irrelevant proposal to move back to an undemocratic first past the post system, and recommends the use of the single transferable vote applied to multi-member constituencies as the most democratic way to address any problems with the current additional member system.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone, George Lyon, Mike Rumbles, Nora Radcliffe, Mike Pringle, Mr Keith Raffan, Donald Gorrie, Dennis Canavan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-862#</strong> <strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing:</strong> <strong>Epilepsy Scotland - Golden Jubilee</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Epilepsy Scotland on its Golden Jubilee; notes the role it has had in influencing public policy and raising awareness to combat dicrimination and social stigma; wishes them every success in planned projects such as &quot;Scotland's Employer of the Year&quot;, and considers that all MSPs should encourage awareness of all matters relevant to the needs of both those who have epilepsy and their carers.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Ms Sandra White, Brian Adam, Mr Bruce McFee, Alasdair Morgan, Linda Fabiani, Stewart Stevenson, Robert Brown, Mary Scanlon, Mrs Nanette Milne, Johann Lamont, Susan Deacon, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-861#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Use of Electoral Register in Edinburgh Referendum on Congestion Charging</strong>-That the Parliament considers that the full electoral roll should be made available to the City of Edinburgh Council for use exclusively in a referendum on congestion charging, in order to save Edinburgh taxpayers an estimated &pound;100,000 in encouraging residents who have opted out of the published electoral register to participate in the referendum; notes the legal decision of <em>R (on the application of Robertson)</em> v <em>Wakefield MDC</em>, that the use of electoral rolls for such referenda may be inappropriate under the current legislation, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should consult with the Secretary of State for Scotland and Her Majesty's Government to seek a legislative dispensation to use the full electoral roll for a congestion charging referendum in Edinburgh.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Robin Harper, Eleanor Scott, Patrick Harvie, Margaret Smith, Mike Pringle, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-860#</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Development of Cavalry Park</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals for a housing development in the historic Cavalry Park in Kilsyth, North Lanarkshire; recognises the importance of preserving this greenfield site which the Scottish Covenanter Memorials Association has declared unsuitable for development as it understands part of the site is the graveyard of many covenanters killed in 1645 at the Battle of Kilsyth; notes that development of this green belt area is contrary to the local structure plan, would make the area less attractive for tourism development and would severely compromise the integrity of the landscape setting of the neighbouring B-listed Colzium House and Estate resulting in the destruction of the ecologically balanced wildlife habitat; further notes that the area is not suitable for development as it is at high risk of flooding with downstream displacement; is concerned that the disturbance of the peat bog could lead to pollution by the release of carbon dioxide at an estimated 8 tonnes per hectare per annum, and, in light of this, believes that North Lanarkshire Council or the Scottish Executive, or both, should reject any planning application to develop the site.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Ted Brocklebank, Mrs Nanette Milne, Phil Gallie, Ms Sandra White, Mary Scanlon, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-859</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Scottish Infantry Regiments</strong>-That the Parliament disapproves of the suggestion that there should be a reduction from six to four in the infantry regiments of the Scottish Division by disbandment; notes that two of the regiments likely to be disbanded are The Highlanders and The Royal Scots which have a long and honourable history central to Scotland's military identity; recognises the important local loyalties for each of the regiments across Scotland; recalls the magnificent campaign to save The Queen's Own Highlanders, which was ignored by Westminster in 1994, and calls on all Scotland, including the Scottish Executive, to campaign for the retention of all Scotland's infantry regiments and to protect Scotland's military identity.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-858#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Approval of Inward Delegation</strong>-That the Parliament believes that delegations representing governments and states throughout the world should be welcomed by the Parliament in general; recognises, however, that there may be regimes abhorrent to members that such members believe it inappropriate to welcome; is concerned to note that members may debate, in the chamber, the merits or otherwise of going to war on a state but currently have no facility to debate whether it is appropriate to welcome the representatives of that state to the Parliament; believes that these contradictions undermine the integrity of the Parliament and further believes that, where a member expresses an objection to a delegation, the Parliament should be able to vote on the matter.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Frances Curran, Colin Fox, Chris Ballance, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Tommy Sheridan</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-857#</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon:</strong> <strong>Livingston Football Club</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the news that Livingston Football Club has been placed in administration; recognises the considerable success that the club has achieved both on the field and in promoting West Lothian; hopes that all relevant parties work to bring the club out of administration at the earliest opportunity, and believes that the Scottish Executive should enter into discussions with the Scottish Premier League and other relevant bodies to identify ways in which the current crisis situation facing many Scottish clubs can be resolved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Richard Baker, Karen Gillon, Mark Ballard, Scott Barrie, Mike Pringle, Michael McMahon, Paul Martin, Des McNulty, Mike Watson, Fiona Hyslop, Trish Godman, Maureen Macmillan, Pauline McNeill, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Colin Fox, Brian Adam, Christine May, Johann Lamont, Elaine Smith</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-856#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Topless Hairdressing Salons</strong>-That the Parliament deplores plans by Urban Group to establish a topless hairdressing salon staffed by young women in the Paisley area; notes with concern the lack of legislation to prevent such an establishment from opening, and considers, therefore, that the Scottish Executive should introduce legislation to enable local authorities to address the opening of such establishments in Scotland's towns and cities.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Pauline McNeill, Brian Adam, Mr Jamie Stone, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Christine Grahame, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Elaine Smith<strong>*</strong></P>

          <P><strong>S2M-850#</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Tackling Debt</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes recent research into debt by Citizens Advice Scotland, published in <em>On the cards - Scottish Citizens Advice Bureaux clients experiences of debt</em>; notes the findings of the report such as the increasing level of debt stress experienced by clients highlighted by the fact that the average debt client owes &pound;22 for every &pound;1 of monthly income, the prevalence of consumer debt across every income group and the role of changes in circumstances such as job loss, illness and relationship breakdown in creating debt problems; further notes the implications of this research for the debt arrangement scheme brought forward under the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Act 2002, particularly the low levels of surplus income available to many debtors to make repayments to their debts and the unacceptable levels of pressure and harassment experienced by some debtors as creditors compete to get repayment of their debts, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take action to ensure that all debtors, even those with limited surplus incomes, are able to access the debt arrangement scheme to gain protection from undue creditor harassment and unnecessary debt enforcement action and recognise and support the valuable role played by citizens advice bureaux in advising those with debt problems.</P>
