<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3270</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Borrowing Powers for the Scottish Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that one of the major aims of any government is to facilitate sustainable economic growth; acknowledges that the current lack of fiscal powers limits the Scottish Government&rsquo;s ability to react to changing conditions in a way that is attuned to Scotland&rsquo;s distinct circumstances; notes that the Northern Ireland Assembly can borrow up to &pound;2 billion, and calls on the UK Government to listen and respond to the growing demands from both inside the Scottish Parliament and beyond for borrowing powers and to take any action necessary to put those powers into place so that Scotland can emerge from the current economic downturn in a strong, competitive position.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3269</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>The Murison Burns Collection</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dunfermline Carnegie Library on its promotion of the Murison Burns Collection in the year of the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns; acknowledges the importance of the collection of 1,500 books and many items of memorabilia connected with Burns&rsquo;s life and work that was presented to Dunfermline in 1921, and further acknowledges that the collection continues to be of interest and benefit to the people of Dunfermline and to the worldwide community of Burns enthusiasts and scholars.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3268</strong> <strong>James Kelly:</strong> <strong>Loss of Jobs at Vion, Cambuslang</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by the Vion Food Group that 150 people are to be made redundant at the Grampian Country Foods factory in Cambuslang; recognises that this announcement has resulted from a reduction in orders from Marks and Spencer, and calls on the Scottish Executive and all other public agencies to work together to ensure that every assistance is being offered to the company, trade unions and the workforce at this difficult time.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3267</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>NESTA and UKERC Carbon Crucible</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the second of the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) Carbon Crucible programme workshops will be held in Edinburgh from 2 to 4 February 2009; also notes that the programme, which is run in partnership with the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), brings together 30 academics hoping to spark new and innovative solutions to tackle the big issues in energy research, such as demand reduction and environmental sustainability; hopes that the group has a series of productive sessions; congratulates NESTA and UKERC on running the Carbon Crucible programme, and hopes that it will stimulate and foster interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers working in diverse fields within science, technology and the social sciences.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3266</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to St Michael&rsquo;s Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Michael&rsquo;s Primary School in West Dunbartonshire for the excellent HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) report that it received; notes that in the report St Michael&rsquo;s received five very good ratings, and further notes that the support for children with additional support needs, efforts made by staff to get it right for every child and the visionary leadership of the head teacher were also praised in the report.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3265</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>70th Anniversary of the Sinking of the Royal Oak</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 14 October 2009 will be the 70th anniversary of the loss of HMS Royal Oak when the German U-boat, U-47, penetrated the defences protecting Scapa Flow and torpedoed the battleship, sinking her with the loss of 833 lives; notes that many boy sailors aged between 15 and 17 were drowned that night and that, as a result, Churchill ordered that boy sailors were no longer to serve on ships on active service, a point drawn out vividly in the recently published book on the sinking, <em>Last Dawn</em>; further notes that the sinking is remembered every year at a service held over the site of the wreck when Royal Navy divers replace the white ensign that still flies on the submerged wreck, and remembers the sacrifice of those who lost their lives that night in the defence of Britain.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3264</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Bridgeton Family Learning Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Bridgeton Family Learning Centre in Glasgow on its report from HM Inspectorate of Education and the Care Commission; notes that children who attend the pre-school centre are making very good progress in their development and learning; extols the centre on receiving commendable evaluations of its strengths, which include programmes for numeracy and literacy, and considers that the centre can act as an example to other pre-school educational centres in Scotland for its excellent staff and very good quality of education.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3263</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Recreational Fishing - Article 47</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern Article 47 of draft EU regulation SEC(2008) 2760/61, which would bring recreational sea fishermen under the direct control of the Common Fisheries Policy; understands that it would require recreational fishermen to register their boats, that their catches would be counted against the fisheries quota for that country and that each country would be required to allocate the share of its quota for each fish species that would be available for commercial and recreational fisheries use; believes that these proposals would create enormous administrative problems and would be effectively unworkable in a Scottish context; further believes that they will contribute little to the conservation of fishing stocks, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to make representations to the European Commission opposing the provisions of Article 47 of the draft EU regulation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3262</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Call to Suspend Military Trials at Guant&aacute;namo Bay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the significance of the President of the United States of America calling for a 120-day suspension of military court proceedings for inmates at Guant&aacute;namo Bay; welcomes his intervention so early in his presidency, and calls for all detainees who are held at Guant&aacute;namo Bay to be brought into the mainstream of the USA justice system in order that the rest of the world can be confident as to the methods used to obtain a confession and that justice is not only done but is seen to be done.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3261</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell on behalf of the Equal Opportunities Committee:</strong> <strong>Unpaid Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes evidence gathered by the Equal Opportunities Committee on unpaid carers at its meetings on 25 March and 7 October 2008, which highlighted that there were around 660,000 unpaid carers in Scotland, a figure that represented one in eight of the population; recognises the valuable contribution that unpaid carers make in saving the Scottish economy &pound;7.6 billion a year; further notes that around 40% of unpaid carers surveyed reported that their access to services was poor or that available services did not meet their needs, and calls on the Scottish Government to take into consideration the evidence gathered when developing the forthcoming Scottish Government/COSLA carers strategy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3260</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Lewis Congratulates Island Connection for New President</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the inauguration of Barack Obama as 44th President of the United States of America; notes the welcome tradition of new American Presidents identifying their ancestors around the world, and further notes the particular pride in Ness on the Isle of Lewis that President Obama has ancestors from the township of South Dell.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3257.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government&rsquo;s Response to the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers&rsquo; Annual Report</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3257) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, insert at end &quot;and in particular notes the commitment to an independent assessment of the full economic costs and abatement potential of the various energy options, including nuclear power, which are open to Scotland.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3257.3</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government&rsquo;s Response to the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers&rsquo; Annual Report</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3257) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, insert at end &quot;notes the Council of Economic Advisers&rsquo; recommendation that the Scottish Government &quot;raises the overall level of infrastructure spending within Scotland&quot;, and believes that the Elgin bypass should be included in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s transport infrastructure investment plans.&quot;</p>
