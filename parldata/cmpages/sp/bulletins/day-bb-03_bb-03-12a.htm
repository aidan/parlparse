              in the Bill, the pre-emptive right to buy has undermined them; notes 
              that there are indications that land to let is already becoming 
              unavailable; believes that the present arrangement of allowing greater 
              flexibility in the detail of leases between landlord and tenant 
              is imperative for the tenanted sector, and considers certain provisions 
              within the Bill are contrary to the interests of that sector and 
              fail to provide opportunities for the next generation of farming 
              tenants, thus failing to reinvigorate the tenanted sector of agriculture 
              in accordance with the Bill's stated intention.&quot;</a></p>

            Forth Road Bridge Crossing Near Kincardine</strong>-That the Parliament 
            <a name="MotionText">welcomes the completion of the A907; notes the 
            current intention of the Scottish Executive to reopen the Stirling 
            to Alloa and Kincardine rail link by 2005 and construct a new Forth 
            road bridge crossing by 2007; further notes the benefits to the economy 
            of Clackmannanshire that will result from these infrastructure improvements; 
            notes, however, that the recent decision for the favoured site of 
            a new acute hospital for Forth Valley to be at the Royal Scottish 
            National Hospital, Larbert, will have significant implications for 
            the road networks to the south of the Forth road crossing, and considers 
            that the Executive should ensure that the design of this network and 
            its date of completion are expedited in order to ensure the safety 
            of patients in Ochil and Stirling constituencies as well as those 
            from the west of Fife.</a> </p>
