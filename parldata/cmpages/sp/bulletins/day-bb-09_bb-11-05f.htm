<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5136</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Committee Membership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Christina McKelvie be appointed to replace Bill Wilson as a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5135</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Sir John Crofton</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is united in sadness at the death of Sir John Crofton and considers that Scotland has lost one of its most inspirational health pioneers; further notes his many achievements, such as the development of a new and effective way of treating tuberculosis (TB) in the 1950s that reduced TB in Edinburgh to almost zero in six years; commends his contribution to raising awareness about the harm caused to public health by tobacco, arguing for policies to control smoking and tobacco and calling for smoke-free legislation long before it became law in Scotland, knowing the important contribution that it would make to future public health; recognises the pivotal role that Sir John and his wife, Dr Eileen Crofton, also played in founding ASH Scotland in 1973 and believes that the ban on smoking in public places implemented by the previous Scottish Executive is a fitting tribute to his lifetime work, and welcomes the launch, earlier this year, of the Crofton Award by the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland in partnership with ASH Scotland to recognise the achievements of young people in reducing tobacco and smoking-related harm in Scotland and in honour of Sir John and Lady Eileen Crofton&rsquo;s tireless work over the decades on tobacco control.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5134</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Commonwealth Games Fitness Challenge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Playbusters on developing Connecting Generations Commonwealth Games Fitness Challenge, a programme that aims to bring together both old and young for sporting activities; recognises its efforts to increase fitness levels, break down generational barriers and raise awareness of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow; further recognises the Big Lottery Fund for its generous grant to start the programme, and wishes Playbusters well in the continuing good work it does in the east end of Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5133</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Britain Needs Better Banks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the small concession announced by HBOS that a &pound;10 buffer zone will apply before the proposed new flat fee is charged on authorised overdrafts but believes that this does not go far enough; considers that most customers who need to use their overdraft facility will be worse off as a result of the change from charging interest to a daily fixed fee of &pound;1; notes that a &pound;1 fee on a &pound;100 overdraft is the equivalent of 365% APR; welcomes the <em>Britain Needs Better Banks</em> campaign being run by consumer magazine <em>Which?</em> to highlight unfair practices in banking, and calls on the partially state-owned HBOS to stop punishing customers on lower incomes and reconsider the decision to introduce these unfair charges.</p>
