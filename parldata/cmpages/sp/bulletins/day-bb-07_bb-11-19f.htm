          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>

          <p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-871&diams; </strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Carers&rsquo; Respite and Short Breaks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 7 December 2007 is Carers&rsquo; Rights Day; applauds the huge contribution made to society by more than 600,000 unpaid carers in Scotland; welcomes the work done by organisations such as Grangemouth Carers and the Falkirk Carers Centre; recognises the enormous benefit that the provision of respite and short break services can make to both the carer and the cared for; notes with concern the inequalities of access to respite provision recently highlighted by the Scottish Society for Autism; believes that regular updates should be made available, detailing progress towards the provision of an additional 10,000 weeks respite per year, as well as a guaranteed annual entitlement to breaks from caring by 2011; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation on its new respite care guidance; is concerned, however, that this guidance does not contain a duty on local authorities to develop specific respite strategies; believes that such a duty is vital to strengthen the development of respite services and to achieve equality of access across Scotland, and believes that, in the absence of a duty on local authorities, measures should be taken to ensure that the impact of any additional resources for respite services is not undermined by weaknesses in local respite planning.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-870</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Failure to Invest in Higher Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the vitally important contribution made by Scottish universities in equipping our people with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in an increasingly competitive world; expresses disappointment that as a result of the spending review statement universities will face a real-terms cut in their funding in the coming year; notes that this is the first such cut in the history of devolution; believes that this will place Scottish universities at a competitive disadvantage to other universities in the United Kingdom and abroad; supports a full review of the long-term future of the higher education sector and its contribution to Scotland; considers the proposed higher education budget to be inadequate, and pledges to work for a more equitable funding settlement to ensure that our university sector remains world class.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-869</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Discrimination Against Women in Saudi Arabia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of an appeal court in Saudi Arabia to double the number of lashes and add a jail sentence as punishment for a woman who was gang-raped; expresses its serious concern at the ongoing legal discrimination against women in Saudi Arabia and believes this to be a violation of their fundamental human rights; further believes that it is inappropriate for heads of western democracies to associate themselves with the Saudi regime while such state-sanctioned discrimination and abuse exists, and calls on government at all levels in the United Kingdom to use its diplomatic influence to promote equal rights and democracy in Saudi Arabia.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-868&diams; </strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Standing United with Glasgow&rsquo;s Pakistani Community</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is united with members of the Glasgow Pakistani community who protested outside the Pakistan Vice-Consulate&rsquo;s office in Glasgow in November 2007; shares their concerns over the emergency rule imposed by General Musharraf in Pakistan; joins in their calls demanding that the rule of law is adhered to, the judiciary is reinstated and free and fair elections are held as scheduled in January 2008, and considers that representations should be made to Westminster on their behalf and that appropriate pressure be applied to General Musharraf to comply with the democratic wishes of the Pakistani community.</p>
