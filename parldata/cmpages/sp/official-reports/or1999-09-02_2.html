That is an increase of 40 per cent above the planned level. I would, however,

be stored, because the EU regulation lays down that it should be incinerated.
Unfortunately, at the time of that regulation-this is an important point
to make-while there was sufficient incinerator capacity to deal with the
animals that were already suspected of having BSE, there was insufficient
capacity in Scotland and in the United Kingdom to deal with animals in
the over-30-months scheme. The intervention board, which acts on our behalf
in dealing with this, has now placed three contracts with incinerators.

I think that for me to accept that invitation would be a sign of arrogance,

than riding around the country spreading doom and despair, and running
scare stories at every possible opportunity.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

would clarify the SNP's position on such matters. After all, in August

road-pricing"</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and that</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"support focused road pricing to help develop

that he will put that right in the future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>It is open question
time, but I can help the First Minister by saying that our opposition to
his toll tax proposals has been well ventilated in recent months, otherwise
he would not be so concerned about the campaign.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If he will not answer the question on his
views of private companies collecting his toll tax, can he elaborate on
section 4.3.2 of the consultation document "Tackling Congestion", which

to place a limit on the maximum charge or levy which can be imposed"?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

as far as toll taxes are concerned?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister:</strong> No, it does
not mean that the sky is the limit and, as Mr Salmond well knows, the aim
of the consultation is to gather opinions and to decide what is practical
and right and what will tackle the problems of urban congestion and gridlock.
If any scheme goes forward, it will be on the basis that it is appropriate
and that there has been proper local consultation, and with the approval
of the Administration. I say again very seriously that this is a very big
area and while I accept that there is a great deal of room for political
mischief making, if there is any truth at all in what is said by the nationalist

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire
and Kincardine) (LD): </strong>Will the minister ensure that civic bodies in
our rural areas outside the central belt are consulted with regard to the
funding of the civic forum?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell:</strong> Yes, I will raise
that issue with the representatives of the forum. It is important that
whatever arrangements we establish with them and with other bodies, we
ensure that the whole of Scotland is represented in the consultations and
the engagements that take place over the coming four years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands)
(SNP): </strong>On a point of order. Is it in order for the First Minister to
refer to my party by the wrong name, which he has a bad habit of doing?
If it is in order, we could all play this game and a wrong name for his
party springs to mind-the ex-socialist party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>Ministers
are responsible for their own answers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Ewing: </strong>On a point of order. With
all respect, that is not a proper answer. We are in parties in this chamber
and the parties have names. We could start playing funny games with this
if you do not rule that it is out of order for the wrong name to be given
to a party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I cannot
rule it out of order because there is nothing in the standing orders that
says that parties should be called by their proper names, but I would have
thought that it is obvious that they should be.</font></td>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):</strong>
We now move on to the debate on motion S1M-107, in the name of Mr Sam Galbraith,
on a national cultural strategy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">15:16</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Children and Education
(Mr Sam Galbraith): </strong>I am pleased to open this debate on the national
cultural strategy for Scotland. I believe that there has never been a better
time for us to have such a cultural strategy. We face the future with the
confidence of a nation with its own new Parliament. It is the intention
of the Scottish Executive to prepare a cultural strategy so that we can
properly promote and develop Scotland's diverse cultural interests in the
new millennium.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Over the years, various aspects of cultural
life have been subjected to scrutiny, review and research. Most recently,
there has been the excellent work carried out by the Scottish Arts Council
under the chairmanship of Ruth Wishart. The process on which we are embarked
is different in that it is intended to be the first in which we draw together
all parts of the cultures and arts in Scotland and go further in examining
all aspects of our cultural life.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At this stage, nothing is ruled out and
nothing is ruled in. We shall listen to what the people tell us in the
consultation. However, it would be disingenuous not to make my starting
point clear. The aim of this process is to establish a clear strategy and
set of objectives, which we can all work together to achieve in the years
to come.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This process is not about a wholesale restructuring
of the arts and heritage sector. Some changes might be needed, but the
focus is firmly on the arts and what they can do for individuals in our
society. This is not an exercise in re-engineering bureaucracy. The strategy
will recognise the richness and diversity of our culture and seek to harness
it for the benefit of all our citizens. It will encompass all the arts,
including music, dance, theatre, writing, sculpture, architecture, painting,
design crafts, television, film, photography and video. The strategy will
embrace the most recent developments in multimedia and the creative industries
with their important associated economic effects.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The strategy will embrace Scotland's cultural
heritage, our museums, galleries, libraries and the built heritage. It
will celebrate the past, while preparing for the future. It will embrace
the old and the new, the traditional and the modern. We also recognise
that the Gaelic and Scots languages and traditions are each important and
that the cultural wealth that other languages and traditions&nbsp;</font></td>

has a contribution to make.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My colleague, Rhona Brankin, launched this
process a few weeks ago in Inverness. Copies of the national cultural strategy
are now available in print as well as on the internet and in this Parliament.
Our aim is to ensure that the process is as inclusive as possible. To that
end, we are planning a series of meetings throughout the country, from
north to south and east to west. Those meetings will be open to the public
and will be held during September, October and November.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>I have asked this question before in relation to another matter. Mr
Galbraith is talking about consulting throughout the country. When we talked
about the education improvement bill, he said that he would consult young
people. I have to say that the efforts at consultation have not been inclusive
of young people. Will Mr Galbraith assure us that consultation on the cultural
strategy will be better than that on the education bill, whose website
has received only 24 messages?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>I must explain to
Fiona that it is in the nature of consultation for responses to be submitted
in a rush at the end, rather than at this stage. It is not true to say
that the consultation has not been inclusive-it has been very inclusive.
We are only at the start of the process-we have September and October still
to come-and we should resist rushing to judgment while it is still in its
infancy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I can assure members that everyone will
be included. This strategy will not belong to anyone in particular-it will
belong to the people of Scotland. It will not be the property of the Scottish
Executive or of the Scottish Parliament; we want ideas from everyone. We
want to reach as many people as possible, whether they be arts professionals,
amateurs, large organisations, neighbourhood groups, multinational organisations
or small businesses. We anticipate a healthy debate and even some argument.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This Parliament, as the assembly of elected
representatives of the people of Scotland, has its own role to play. We
can reach people in all parts of Scotland and conduct debates with our
constituents. I hope very much that that will happen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are now at the start of the intensive
process that I have described. Once the initial consultation is over, we
will consider the responses that we have received. Certain themes or strands
may then emerge on which we want to seek further views and advice. Our
strategy will then be drawn up, taking into account the views of those
who have responded. We intend to produce a strategy document by the middle
of next year. It is&nbsp;</font></td>
