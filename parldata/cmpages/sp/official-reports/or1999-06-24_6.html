<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George
Reid): </strong>The next item of business is an Executive debate on motion S1M-68
in the name of Henry McLeish, on the economy of Scotland, and on amendments
to that motion. I intend to take amendments S1M-68.1 and S1M-68.2. I draw
members' attention to a typographical error in Mr David Davidson's amendment
as printed in the revised daily business list. The second line should read:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"not to increase the tax and regulatory
burden".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">15:45</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning (Henry McLeish): </strong>I will set out the key principles of our
approach to the economy and to economic development. We will create a modern,
knowledge-based economy in which enterprise can flourish. An enterprise
economy is the key to generating wealth, sustaining high employment and
ensuring good-quality public services. To grow new jobs and new skills,
the new Scotland requires stability, investment in education, the development
of new technologies, greater innovation and a business tax environment
that is supportive of business development and growth. As the motion notes,
we will build on Scotland's economic success by investing in jobs and skills,
promoting a stable and competitive environment for enterprise, and encouraging
the growth of new businesses. We intend to do that by working in partnership
with business, trade unions and the rest of Britain. The new Scotland will
be built within a strengthened United Kingdom.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important to say at this point, in
an overture to Mr Swinney, that we want to work with the Enterprise and
Lifelong Learning Committee. Business will look to the committee, and I
want to work closely with it in the spirit of the new politics. There will
be an important role for the committee in work on the Scottish economy
and on higher and further education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr John Swinney (North Tayside) (SNP):
</strong>I am grateful to the minister for his comments about the Enterprise
and Lifelong Learning Committee, which got off to a good start at its first
meeting yesterday. In my capacity as convener of that committee, I want
to ensure that the work of all the parties represented on it is effective,
and that the minister has the opportunity to engage in dialogue. In particular,
I want to ensure that we have the opportunity to involve people from the
business community, and people with expertise in lifelong learning and
enterprise. I welcome the opportunity that the minister has given me to
put that on the record.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish:
</strong>I welcome those comments and embrace their implications. I am sure
that members of all parties will welcome what Mr Swinney said. It is vital
that the positive message of partnership goes out to the business community.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important to build on the strong,
stable macro-economic policy that has been delivered for Scotland at the
UK level-Scotland and Britain will be all the stronger for that. Since
1997, Labour's overriding economic purpose has been to secure long-term
economic stability, with low inflation and sound public finances, so that
families and businesses can plan for the future. Our ambitions have become
achievements. Inflation is now low and stable-in May it was at its lowest
for nearly five years. Interest rates are at their lowest since 1997, and
mortgage rates are at their lowest since 1966.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Public finances are under control, and
massive extra funding for key areas has been delivered. In Scotland, we
will be spending an additional &pound;1.8 billion-that is &pound;1,800
million-on health and &pound;1.3 billion on education. The capital modernisation
fund, announced in Gordon Brown's budget this year, provides an extra &pound;165
million for Scotland. That is about investment, jobs and national prosperity.
In Scotland we have many strengths on which to build a prominent position
in key sectors.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>Earlier today, the minister commented on a number of Scottish companies
that are adding greatly to Scotland's prosperity. To some extent, he boasted
of them. Does he agree that most of those companies were previously trapped
as nationalised companies, and that he opposed their privatisation? Those
companies are now offering much to the Scottish economy and to the figures
that he is using in his boasts about Scotland's current economy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>With the greatest
respect, I shall not give a ringing endorsement to 20 years of near-economic
failure under the Conservative party. Suffice it to say, the politics of
the past are less important than the prospects for the future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In my comments on Scottish Widows, Lloyds
TSB and other companies, I was illustrating that when the nation is successful,
we should pride ourselves on that success, and that-as Mr Swinney suggested-we
should work with all concerned to ensure further success. Scotland has
many strengths on which to build a prominent position.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>As
someone who represents the Lothians, I listened with great interest to
what Mr McLeish said about Lloyds TSB and Scottish Widows. It would be
helpful for the staff employed by those companies-many of&nbsp;</font></td>

constituency-if he could tell us whether there has been any guarantee of
long-term employment, particularly from Lloyds TSB, which has said that
it is still hungry for further takeovers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>I am grateful to
Fiona Hyslop for making that point. The headquarters and brand name are
crucial, but jobs are critical as an integral feature of the Scottish economy.
In the discussions that the First Minister and I had with the chief executives
and chairmen of the two companies, that point was put to them and we were
reassured that the matter that she mentioned was being confirmed. The Parliament,
the Executive and political parties will be ever watchful of what is happening
in the Scottish economy, whether internally or in link-ups such as that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We want to build on the strength represented
by our prominent position in key sectors such as oil and gas, electronics,
whisky, tourism and financial services. There are opportunities for further
growth and success in new industries and the emerging technologies. Scotland
has been successful in attracting inward investment. Since 1 April, J P
Morgan, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, BPS Teleperformance, One 2 One, Quintiles
Scotland Ltd, Absolute Quality, NFU Mutual Direct and Level 1 Communications
have announced plans to create new jobs in Scotland totalling more than
2,500.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unemployment in Scotland is falling and
is low by historical and international standards. Employment has risen
by 7,000 over the past quarter. Unemployment is 5.5 per cent-its lowest
since 1977.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tricia Marwick (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(SNP): </strong>Mr McLeish will know that yesterday Scottish Power announced
the closure of Methil power station in his constituency, which will cost
70 jobs. He will also know that the Methil and Levenmouth area is one of
the country's unemployment black spots. Unemployment is not falling in
the Levenmouth area-in fact, it has been increasing over the past two years.
Can Mr McLeish assure the people of Methil and Levenmouth that in the short
and the long term he will work to secure jobs for them?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>I was tempted to
decline the intervention and perhaps I should have done so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I take Tricia Marwick's point-in certain
parts of Scotland there is still high unemployment that needs to be tackled,
and that will be done. On the local issue that she mentioned, Methil power
station has served Scottish Power well over many years. Economic circumstances
have changed and raw material for the plant is in short supply, but the
72 employees are being offered the possibility of enhanced voluntary redundancy

other Scottish Power plants. I understand that there is a close working
relationship between Scottish Power and the work force. I hope that the
resulting discussions will satisfy all concerned. In the longer term, all
of us-including the local list and constituency members-will need to work
hard to ensure that, while unemployment is low throughout the country,
it is lower still. The dignity of work should not elude our constituents.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The new deal continues to provide support
for the long-term unemployed and for young Scots to improve their skills
and experience and help them find work. Unemployment in the new deal groups
has fallen over the past two years. Youth unemployment has been cut by
54 per cent since May 1997 and long-term unemployment has fallen by 49
per cent. Scottish manufacturers and exporters have performed resiliently
in the face of tough global trading conditions. Output in the manufacturing
sector in Scotland increased by 2.1 per cent in 1998, compared with an
increase of 0.3 per cent in the UK as a whole. The level of Scottish manufactured
exports increased by 6.7 per cent in real terms in 1998, despite difficult
global and European conditions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We know that much remains to be done in
putting Scotland to work and keeping Scots in work. There have been job
losses and closures. The global downturn has slowed industrial activity
in all the major European countries and we cannot expect to be immune from
that. However, there have also been more hopeful signs, most recently in
the April Confederation of British Industry survey for Scotland, which
said that manufacturing output and orders are expected to be back on a
growth path over the next quarter.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am also encouraged by the Fraser of Allander
Institute's quarterly economic commentary, released this morning, which
suggests that there will be an earlier upturn-driven by the electronics
sector-in manufacturing output in Scotland than in the UK.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Growth across the economy as a whole will
be lower this year than last, but global turbulence has eased and interest
rates have fallen. The latest independent forecasts suggest that growth
will accelerate from 2000, in line with the UK.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, we now need to look forward. In
terms of manufacturing strategy, there is no point in simply standing back
and hoping for better times. We know that manufacturing industry will continue
to face aggressive global competition, and I am determined that we should
look with renewed vigour at how we support our manufacturers and at the
opportunities for us to extend that support. Therefore, in consultation
with manufacturing industry and the Scottish Trades Union Congress, I want
to develop a strategy for the manufacturing&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">sector in Scotland.
Currently, about 300,000 people are employed in manufacturing and about
1.7 or 1.8 million in services; both sectors are crucial to the future
of the Scottish economy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The group that is considering the manufacturing
strategy will build on the work of the pathfinder group, take into account
the Department of Trade and Industry's activity and complement our support
for the service sector. I plan to make real progress on that over the summer.
We will progress the pioneering work of the pathfinder group to ensure
that its voice and the ideas of businesses are heard. Through the Enterprise
and Lifelong Learning Committee, every party in the Parliament will also
be heard.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>If the minister is committed to listening to industry, will he listen
to what many manufacturing industries are saying about the potential impact
of high energy taxes? A number of critical industries in Scotland are fearful
about how those taxes will affect their prospects. Will he offer them any
comfort?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>That was a constructive
intervention about a matter that is of considerable importance to industry.
I know that representations are being made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer
by a wide variety of bodies, and I reassure the honourable gentleman-I
have fallen back into Westminster habits for the second time today-that
those concerns will be voiced to the people who need to listen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Education and lifelong learning are crucial
and, since 1997, we have put them at the heart of enterprise policy. Skills
policies bridge education and employment. We are improving jobs skills
and training skills, both of which are central to growing jobs, boosting
competitiveness and building social inclusion. Our plans for lifelong learning
will allow working people to balance the responsibilities of family life
and employment with the need constantly to upgrade skills. The mere fact
that we have linked enterprise and lifelong learning is a powerful message
to all concerned that we take the matter very seriously. The link has not
happened at Westminster and very few countries in Europe have linked the
two subjects. Again, I like to think that Scotland is leading on the issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is much to be said about job skills
and training skills, but suffice it to say today that we must focus on
ensuring that people receive a basic grounding before they enter the labour
market and that the necessary frameworks for education and qualifications
are in place. We must also play a role in addressing market failures, by
providing support or a co-ordinating role in seeking solutions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">programmes, which
are often very successful. One area in which we have not made as much progress
is employer-based training; that is highlighted by what is happening in
Japan, Germany and the States. We need to have a boost for such training
in the workplace and we hope that the infrastructure that we have established
will help. The Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee will want to
consider how we can encourage the work force to demand skills training
and employers to respond positively.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Most of these measures are set out in "Skills
for Scotland". The Scottish university for industry and individual learning
accounts will help, because they will have a major impact on learning and
skills development. The Scottish university for industry will help individuals
and businesses to identify the learning that they want and enable them
to access it, where and when they need it. The individual learning account
is about self-ownership of skills in education. From the earliest possible
age after leaving school, why should not people want to acquire, develop,
own and renew skills and knowledge? As people's careers develop and their
adaptability becomes paramount, that will become a crucial issue. Individual
learning accounts are the first step in making that process a reality.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The knowledge economy is also crucial.
A knowledge-driven economy is one in which the generation and exploitation
of knowledge rather than physical assets plays the predominant part in
the creation of wealth. The concept is not simply about pushing back the
frontiers of knowledge; it is about the more effective use of all types
of knowledge in all types of economic activity-not just in those that are
sometimes classified as high-tech or knowledge-intensive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A wide programme of work is under way in
Scotland and the rest of the UK following the publication of the white
paper, "Our Competitive Future: Building the Knowledge-Driven Economy".
I want to acknowledge and take forward the tremendous work of Gus Macdonald
and his task force. We should establish a group involving all sectors of
business, to ensure that we advance the knowledge economy as quickly as
possible. There are various initiatives in that area, but I do not have
enough time to outline them today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The knowledge economy is about knowledge,
understanding, competencies and skills. We have to acknowledge that, in
a fiercely competitive world, people can provide factories, finance and
a one-door approach, but it is the development of human capital-the knowledge
economy-that will make the difference. I hope that the Parliament will
sign up for that idea. I am sure that the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning
Committee will want to take it further.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

nodding constructively in my direction.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a raft of policies that we will

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tourism is crucial to our objectives. I
can announce today that I have asked the Scottish Tourist Board to prepare
a new strategy to replace the original strategy that was published in 1994.
Tourism will be an important issue to which everyone can contribute. It
is worth around &pound;2.5 billion, even though it has had two difficult
years, and we have not been able to extend the season. We are losing visitors
from within the UK and there has been a diminution of the number from abroad,
but tourism has a great future. We need a strategy that combines the customer-is-right
approach to customer care with aggressive and positive marketing abroad.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Rural areas will also play a key part in
our economic strategy. This Parliament is a reflection of the new politics
in Scotland. We have already had a constructive debate on Mr Mundell's
motion on Dumfries and Galloway. We are working in the Borders and in the
Highlands. I say to all MSPs-both list and constituency-that we want to
ensure that this Parliament and its economic approach are for the whole
of Scotland, not just for the central belt.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In conclusion-thank you for your tolerance,
Mr Reid-the question is also about social inclusion. We still live in an
era in which social inclusion is fundamentally about the self-worth of
having a job; it is about being able to structure one's life, and have
an independent life, an income and a quality of social life. If we accept
that social inclusion underpins everything that we do, we will be well
on the way to grasping a collective ideal on which we have prided ourselves
in Scotland for more than a century. We now have a great opportunity to
achieve that as well as to implement policies for a prosperous economic
future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

his speech, as it let me place on record the involvement of the Enterprise
and Lifelong Learning Committee. For the remainder of my speech, I will
speak in my capacity as Mr McLeish's shadow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a whiff of complacency in the
text of Mr McLeish's motion. In his 1996 budget speech, Kenneth Clarke
boasted about falling unemployment figures and said that they were an indication
of the Conservative Government's success. He was challenged by the then
Leader of the Opposition-the current Prime Minister-who made various criticisms
of what the Government had said which were based on other economic indicators.
I find myself in much the same position.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There has undoubtedly been a fall in unemployment.
However, if Mr McLeish were to get out of his ministerial car in the Shettleston
area of Glasgow, he would find male unemployment at 16.7 per cent. That
situation is disguised by the motion that we are debating today. Unemployment
in Scotland has fallen, but only to the levels that we had at the tail
end of 1997. In 1998, unemployment rose, relatively speaking, because of
a number of factors. We must acknowledge the difficulties that that has
created for people. We are not yet back to the level of employment that
we had a year ago. The Government must present Parliament with more comprehensive
measures to deal with unemployment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I should like to highlight other economic
indicators. The number of new businesses created and operated in Scotland
declined in 1998 from the figure in 1997. We await the performance of that
indicator with interest because the number of business failures in 1998-99-more
than 16 per cent-was worrying. The stability of the business sector has
to be addressed by Government policy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many reports, such as the Fraser of Allander
Institute report that was published today and to which the minister referred,
comment on the Scottish economy. The Royal Bank of Scotland, in its June
monthly assessment of the Scottish economy, said that it expected the Scottish
economy to grow more slowly that that of the rest of the United Kingdom.
Although I accept that it is important for this Parliament to conduct this
debate on its own measures, we must look at the performance of the Scottish
economy in relation to other economic units and determine how we can differentiate
the economic performance of Scotland from that of other units to intensify
the rate of growth of the Scottish economy. None of us can be proud of
the rate of growth that we have experienced until now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

They have come down recently, which has made a major difference, but they

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scottish Council Development and Industry

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We ignore the strength of sterling at our
peril.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Having heard Mr McLeish's
words about the wonderful performance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
does Mr Swinney agree that one of the greatest problems that the economy
faces-and the fundamental cross that Scotland has to bear-is the strength
of the pound, which was brought about by the fact that, in 1997, the chancellor
increased interest rates totally unnecessarily?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>The chancellor has not
increased interest rates; he has passed the responsibility to the Bank
of England monetary policy committee. As a result of that decision, economic
measures were applied in Scotland although there was no discernible reason
why they should have been. The Scottish Council Development and Industry
paper said that there was no reason to believe that there was an inflationary
threat to the Scottish economy, which would have suggested that any action
to increase interest rates was inappropriate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A factor that will affect many of the rural
areas to which Mr McLeish referred is petrol duty. It will have an impact
on the competitiveness of individuals and companies in the rural economy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a great deal on the agenda about
economic development and enterprise in Scotland. The minister referred
to the "Pathfinders to the Parliament" report, which was presided over
by Lord Macdonald. The report contains a vast number of suggestions that
I hope will be taken seriously by the Executive. There are a few thorny
suggestions that I am sure the Executive will find rather uncomfortable

from the minister about the small business sector. Anyone who examines
the performance and composition of the Scottish economy cannot fail to
realise the implicit importance of delivering for the small business sector.
I want the Government to produce a positive strategy to relieve the business
rates burden on smaller companies, a measure that will give a competitive
advantage to companies in Scotland. As part of that, we must recognise
that a large proportion of the tourism industry is driven by the small
business sector. I welcome the minister's announcement of a refocused strategy
for the tourist board, but it is important that we examine the structures
for the delivery of tourism support in Scotland, because they have not
served us as effectively as they could.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I
am impressed by the scope of Mr Swinney's remarks, his fine words and the
language of the amendment. How does he think that that squares with the
tone of this morning's debate, which was a long diatribe by SNP members
against privatisation and revealed their deep-seated hostility to business
in the private sector? Is it not the case that the Scottish National party
speaks with forked tongue on such matters?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>I am happy to endorse
everything that my colleagues said this morning. They were talking about
the sell-off of public services and I have never advocated-and never will
advocate-the selling-off of public services carried out by the previous
Government and by this Administration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important that we deliver competitive
conditions for Scottish companies. We have a long track record; my colleague,
Mr Ewing-who I hope will speak later on-has fought many valuable battles
for the small business sector in Scotland and has delivered real progress.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are tripping over economic development
agencies in Scotland. I hope that the minister will tell us the attitude
that the Government is taking towards refocusing and refining the number
of agencies that are cluttering the delivery of economic development services
in Scotland. We want to advance the arguments that we made in the election
campaign for the drawing together of tourism, inward investment, export
development and support for indigenous companies into a sharply focused
economic development agency that addresses the needs of companies in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We recognise the Government's commitment
to tackling the problem of youth unemployment, but it is time that it started

kindly offered to visit the region of my colleague, Mr Mundell, to see
how it is suffering. The minister had better start clearing his diary because
he will be getting an awful lot of invitations in the next few weeks. Has
he noticed the thousands of job losses in the north-east in the oil-related
industries? Confidence in those industries is wobbly. If there is no further
investment, what measures will the minister take to give support or confidence?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Duncan McNeil (Greenock and Inverclyde)
(Lab): </strong>As someone who was born and brought up in a shipbuilding community
and saw the shipbuilding industry destroyed by representatives of the Conservative
party-just as it destroyed the steel industry-I find that hard to take.
Enough is enough. I do not want any lectures from David Davidson on jobs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Interestingly, since
problems have arisen because of the lack of control from the Westminster
Labour Government, the oil industry has really started to suffer locally.
A year ago, I formally asked the industry minister Lord Macdonald to come
and look at the north-east for himself. I asked him to set up a task force
to look at the knock-on effects across the economy in addition to the oil
task force that was already in place. The response that I got left me cold.
We have to move on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Business confidence is low, and we must
give business the confidence that it needs to invest, as the economy of
Scotland cannot grow without that investment. The minister talked of promoting
a competitive environment for enterprise and for the growth of new business,
but there was no mention of support measures for indigenous business. He
talked very briefly about small business-90 per cent of our businesses
are very small-but what does he have to offer them in practical terms?
Does he really understand their needs?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our rural economy is on its knees. Despite
that, at the Royal Highland Show at Ingliston, a proud industry with the
highest production standards in Europe is today flying the flag for Scotland.
The motion gives no support to that industry, which shares the bureaucratic
burden imposed on business. Farmers should be ploughing the soil, not ploughing
through paperwork, but what is the minister offering our rural areas for
the future?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is talk today of a tourism strategy,

and in detail at the structure of tourism support systems, including the
involvement of local authorities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of the future and our young people, what is being proposed to ensure that
our children leave school with the basic skills of reading and writing?
Day after day, we hear that the low skills level with which pupils leave
our schools amazes people in industry and business. I hope that the minister,
and his colleague the Minister for Children and Education, will give us
an assurance that that problem will soon be tackled seriously. If children
do not have the basic skills, they cannot be employed and they cannot enter
training courses. We have not heard many statistics about that from the
ministerial team. We must quantify our skills needs and resource them accordingly
and I welcome a review of workplace training. Before the election, all
the parties had fine words, but we now need an action plan. Today, we have
had the minister's vision, but we need a practical strategy for developing
and supporting the skills base of our industry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must also examine locally available
training that is appropriate to the needs of our young people, which is
not necessarily what we have at present. Does the minister agree that the
new deal is almost past its sell-by date? I share Mr Swinney's views on
that point. The new deal needs a drastic review, as it has failed the young
people of Scotland. We have a common interest in holding an investigation

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">according to Craig
Campbell, was &pound;1.2 billion? That was when the uniform business rate
was in force and so it had nothing to do with local authorities of other
hues. The uniform business rate amounted to a 20 per cent tax on every
business in Scotland. That was not a tartan tax for each of those five
years, but a London levy of 20 per cent on every Scottish business and
small shop that Mr Davidson is now purporting to defend.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>If Mr Ewing had been
listening to us during the election campaign, he would have heard us talk
about what Mr Swinney has just been discussing. In our manifesto, we said
that we were investigating schemes to relieve the rates burden on small
businesses and to encourage them-and small industrial units-to move back
in to and reinvigorate our town centres. We have moved on a bit from Mr
Ewing's history lesson.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Does Mr Davidson recall
that it took a fair number of years for the Conservative Government to
achieve a uniform business rate in Scotland? Is he aware that other members

taxes, which would destroy that Government's achievement of the removal
of the burden to which he referred?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands)
(SNP): </strong>Surely one of the interesting aspects of this morning's debate
was the repeated insistence that the SNP was short on specifics. However,
this debate demonstrates the interesting comparison between the woolly
and wan comments in Mr McLeish's motion and the specific, dynamic proposals
in the SNP's amendment. We have detailed four key areas where we believe
the Scottish economy can grow faster and further.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the three minutes that I have kindly
been given, I will consider two of those key areas. Although I recognise
the global context rightly set out by Mr McLeish, I think that it is right
for this Parliament to pay tribute to the role of small business as the
driver of growth in the Scottish economy. Perhaps small business is also
the way in which we can insulate ourselves against the kind of global economic
downturn that we have seen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is a continuing fact of economics that
most goods and services are produced and consumed locally, so it would
seem reasonable to promote indigenous industry. We should bear in mind
the fact that, because about 99 per cent of Scottish businesses employ
fewer than 50 people, most of Scottish business is small business. If we
promote that sector, we insulate our economy against global downturns.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There has been much talk about how to promote
the small business sector and I think that we are all clear on the need
to reduce the rates burden on it. That is certainly the SNP's standpoint.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

we can make a cultural change in banking in Scotland, which has thus far
been risk averse. Banks have been determined not to take any risk with
small companies. That is in stark contrast to some of our-shall we say-international
cousins. We should consider the example of America, where a business that
starts up and fails does not get the same damning indictment as it would
in this country. The belief in America is that people who have tried and
failed know more about business, and their credit rating is not affected
as it would be here. Perhaps we need to have a more imaginative banking
structure and a more imaginative attitude. I hope that the banking sector
in Scotland will become partners in the creation of the growth that we
all want.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Swinney referred to the downturn in
new businesses in Scotland over the past year. According to the most recent
statistics, that downturn has been about 8.4 per cent. That suggests that
we have our work cut out. I want to put my weight behind encouraging growth
in indigenous small business sector.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The other area that I will consider-very
briefly Mr Reid, as I see your knowing nod-is that of inward investment,
to which lip service if often paid. During the global downturn, inward
investment was one of the few areas of the market that continued to grow
year on year. The foreign direct investment market and inward investment
in Scotland have been important for many years. I think that the entire
chamber will join me in praising the work of Locate in Scotland. However,
we can do a great deal more. The issue now is the quality of jobs that
inward investment provides. We do not want to see the high-tech, low-skill
jobs that we have seen so often. We want to embed high-quality jobs and
learning in the economy through marketing and management and through keeping
Scottish graduates in Scotland-or at least giving them the option to stay.
Although we have done well on inward investment, we must do better still.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the importance we attach to the extra spending on public services. We must
also realise that we have to generate the wealth, as that is what allows
us to deliver good public services. As he rightly said, there are tremendous
opportunities for the Scottish Parliament to exploit Scotland's industrial
and entrepreneurial strengths, but I suggest that we are rather narrowly
focused at the moment. We need to widen the range of industries in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The appointment of a Minister for Enterprise

cynicism about its substance. To propose, as the Government does, motorway
toll taxes, city entry charges and employee parking taxes is a curious
way of promoting skills, of promoting a stable and competitive environment
for enterprise and of encouraging the growth of new business. That all
comes on top of the already crushing weight of tax increases that the Labour
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, has imposed by way of fuel taxes.
As Scottish products have to be distributed over large distances, the increases
in fuel taxes and the recently announced penalties for using Scotland's
roads will further threaten the health of the Scottish economy. That seems
to strike at the heart of the motion. The health warning is clear: Labour
taxes will seriously damage job prospects.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is extraordinary that the minister did
not allude to the Manpower Employment Services report that was published
this week. Its quarterly survey of employment prospects indicated that
Scotland was unlikely to prosper as much as England. It seems that business
is scared by the arsenal of stealth taxes that Scottish Labour intends
to unleash on the Scottish business community. That relentless pounding
will presumably intensify when Labour creates the minefield of permitting
local councils to reintroduce a variable business rate. I applaud Mr Hamilton's
contribution but, perhaps unlike him, I know the pain of such measures
because I have been in small business. I am deeply concerned about the
implications of the Government's proposals for that sector.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

who have been without jobs. The Labour party hypocritically trumpets loudly
its stolen slogan, "Scottish solutions for Scottish problems". Why then
did it mess up a good and improving series of skills development programmes

as such, but it is posturing. Deeds mean a lot more. Judged on its legislative
programme, this Government is a "spend" Government. It is neglecting the
enterprise base-the very base on which we rely to produce the generated
taxation and Exchequer funding that we need before we can consider what
we can spend within that allocation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am pleased to be able to speak in this
debate on unemployment, and to note that in May this year the seasonally
adjusted rate of claimant count unemployment has fallen to 5.5 per cent-although
that is admittedly a small decrease over the year. I was also pleased to
observe in a Scottish Parliament information centre publication on unemployment
in Scotland in May 1999 that the figures for my constituency-which was
referred to as Mr Mundell's region-bear out the statement I made last week
on the economy of Dumfries and Galloway. I said that Dumfries is not an
unemployment black spot. It has an unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent and
is ranked 36<sup>th</sup> out of 73 constituencies in terms of unemployment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Morgan's constituency-has an unemployment rate of 5.7 per cent, but is
ranked 40<sup>th</sup> out of 73. As a former scientist, I thought that
I understood numbers, but perhaps I do not. The unemployment rate in Dumfries
has fallen by more than a quarter since 1996.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am much more concerned-and this is a
matter for concern-to observe that the unemployment rate in my constituency
suffered the fourth worst change over the past couple of months due to
a couple of high-profile manufacturing jobs losses. Unemployment in the
constituency has increased in the past year. That is why I particularly
welcome the wording of the motion: it does not congratulate the Government
and it is not self-satisfied.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alasdair Morgan (Galloway and Upper
Nithsdale) (SNP): </strong>Does Elaine agree that although the employment figures
in the south-west of Scotland are bad, they actually mask a worse situation?
Many people have emigrated from the area because they cannot get jobs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Murray: </strong>The training count and
unemployment rates are ways of monitoring unemployment, but they do not
always represent the entire situation. Female unemployment always appears
to be less than the male rate because to many women who are seeking work
there is no financial benefit in making a claim for benefits. Interpretation
of unemployment figures must be done carefully, but the figures can represent
a trend as long as the parameters remain the same. The trend at the moment
is downwards.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The motion says that things must get better
and that we must build on successes to make things better. There must be
determination to build on economic success, to invest in jobs and skills
and especially to provide a stable environment for enterprise and encourage
the growth of new businesses. My colleagues and I can take that back to
our constituents as a message of hope. We need to give that message of
hope and we need to articulate the intention to not only bring jobs to
our constituencies, but to ensure that employment is here to stay. Would
you like me to wrap up, Mr Deputy Presiding Officer?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

will continue to be available for the existing work force and their children.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

agree with Mr Swinney: we need to require organisations that are funded

documents produced in attractive offices are all very well, but what matters
to those of our constituents who are out of work or who fear that they

great concern to me for a considerable time. Would either party-or both
parties-give consideration to insuring vulnerable areas of historically
low employment against the cruel blows that are dealt to them when inward

and sound public finances, the Government is setting the climate to deliver

29,000 jobs for young people and has given them skills and experience.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>I am sorry that Henry McLeish is not here to hear me say that I welcome
much of what he said this afternoon, including the tone in which he addressed
the debate. I will make some points about some of the content, but I thought
that his vision statement was fair and positive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The picture that the minister painted of
an improving economy, however, rattles back a little further than the past
two years. This Government came in against a background of falling unemployment
and inflation, as all members will be aware.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The new ingredients that this Government
introduced, which hardly anyone in this chamber welcomed, are the way in
which interest rates are treated and the way in which the pound has been
allowed to escalate, putting many of our industries and communities in
a highly uncompetitive position. The Westminster Government has been unable
to put that right and, although it may be outwith the powers of the people
in this chamber, it remains one of the most important priorities for our
pressured economy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Conservatives were accused earlier
of selective-indeed total-amnesia. I recollect three things in which the
Conservative Government was involved. One was the agreement at Rio to cut
emissions to combat global warming. We are now reaching the stage at which
those agreements are starting to hit hard. Earlier, I mentioned the impact
of the energy tax. It is causing real concern for many of our important
industries.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

hope that that means that he will do more than listen. There is also the
question of high fuel taxes in general and the burdens being put on road&nbsp;</font></td>

come to the point at which that is crippling for many companies and many
regions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second thing that the previous Government
was involved in was roads, into which the Conservatives put a lot of money.
We thought that roads were important and that many of our problems stemmed
from our relative isolation and the fragility of much of our manufacturing
industry. We still earn an awful lot from moving goods. We developed a
roads programme which, on the M74, was heavy. A rolling programme was to
follow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Robin Harper </strong><i>rose-</i></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Tosh: </strong>Yesterday, Sarah Boyack
acknowledged that that programme had virtually been axed and that it is
unlikely that the new Scottish Government will restore much of it. This
Parliament must take the issue of roads seriously if it wants to do something
about the more isolated economies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The third important thing that the Conservative
Government did was to address the entire structure of enterprise. For examples,
members can look at Scottish Enterprise and Locate in Scotland. We tried
to streamline the process of attracting inward investment. Scottish Enterprise
faces a decline in its budget and spending allocations. It believes that
it could spend more and that, if it were given the resources, it could
generate employment. Surely we must use the enterprise agencies to breathe
life into some of the areas of our country where the enterprise structure
is weak. We must examine that again and consider the boundaries between
local government and the enterprise agencies, what more we can do to promote
the economies of peripheral areas and the issues of energy and roads. Subject
to those criticisms, I accept much of the message in the minister's speech,
but we have a lot of practical work to do to flesh it out.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

difference for the better. So far, we have heard only one proposal in the
Government's programme that will make a difference-a difference for the
worse-and that is the toll tax.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

tone earlier on, but I wonder whether he will take the advice of the pathfinder
document to which he referred, particularly the section that the retail
sector submitted. It states:</font></td>

has the net effect of forcing lorries off motorways onto rural roads and

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is an excellent proposal. I recommend
that the minister takes it up, as I believe he suggested, and that he now
follows the advice to ditch the toll tax.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">SNP members want to make-and have made-some
constructive suggestions. It is much easier for a Government to do harm
than good, easier for it to create unemployment and make things worse than
magic new employment out of the air. I will mention, briefly, five barriers
to increasing economic success in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the burden of business rates, will the
minister involve the Federation of Small Businesses and all other small
businesses organisations in the revaluation process rather than leave contact
with them until after the result has been completed? If he does not involve
them, I believe that we will get the wrong results, as we did last time.
I hope that he will consider banding, net asset value, transitional relief
or a combination of those measures.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Will the Executive lift the weight of bureaucracy?
In the Highlands, it is virtually impossible to have development off any
trunk routes because of the design restrictions that are imposed by the
Scottish Office. Will the minister make a specific commitment to review
that? I could mention many constituency cases had I the time to do so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On late payment, will we explore the possibility
of reducing the subby-bashing problem by mandating payment directly from
the client to the sub-contractor so that the sub-contractor does not face
sequestration or liquidation? It is an option that is perfectly possible,
so let us consider it. I hope that the ministerial team will.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On access to capital, will the minister
restore the small business development loan scheme that mysteriously disappeared
without any proper explanation or announcement from Westminster about why
it should end?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, will the minister give the electronic
sector the value of fifth freedoms, which Alex Salmond mentioned earlier
in the Parliament's deliberations?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many of the more serious problems that
affect the Scottish economy are within Westminster's power. Does any member
think that the highest fuel tax in Europe is anything but an unbearable
burden? I believe that that burden is forcing many hauliers out of business.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Lifelong Learning (Nicol Stephen): </strong>In the main, we have had a good

and politicians in our economy and in supporting enterprise and business
will always be controversial, and one that is rightly debated, but all
of us in the chamber will agree that there is a role to play and that we
want it to be positive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome John Swinney's constructive comments.
I wish him well as the Convener of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning
Committee and look forward to working closely with him and other members
of the committee. I welcome his support for the "Pathfinders to the Parliament"
report, which makes many detailed and constructive suggestions, and for
the Scottish Enterprise strategy. He asked about the need for refining
and refocusing the work of the economic development agencies in Scotland.
We do not see the need for major upheaval, but his suggestion of refining
and refocusing should happen. The roles of tourism, inward investment,
business support and other aspects of the agencies should always be looked
at constructively.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Swinney spoke about competitive advantage
and particularly about small businesses and rating, which was commented

situation of small businesses, having been a small businessperson. We are
conscious of the pressures on small businesses and we are meeting representatives
of the small business sector later this week. However, I do not necessarily
agree with Duncan Hamilton that we can isolate the small business sector
and look only at internal demand. We are part of a global economy and our

We got short shrift and the plight was greater than it is now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>Nicol Stephen talks
about competitiveness. As a member of the Administration, does he believe
that the current value of sterling is too high or too low, and what does
he think that the level does to the competitiveness of Scottish companies?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> The value of sterling
is affected greatly by interest rates, which are now a matter for the Bank
of England. Mr Swinney will know that on many reserved and economic matters
the Liberal Democrats will continue to have debates, and sometimes disagreements,
with the Labour party, but in relation to the issues that are being discussed
by his committee and by all of us in this Parliament, we want to continue
to be forward-looking and constructive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The value of the pound creates some severe
problems for the manufacturing sector throughout the United Kingdom. That
causes me some concern, but having a strong currency is a good thing for

inward investment and global companies. Does he agree with me-and, I presume,
all other members in this chamber-that we do not need companies such as

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>We need both inward
investment and the growth of indigenous companies. Indeed, inward investment
encourages and leads to the growth of indigenous small companies. However,
I agree that we need the right sort of inward investment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the area of enterprise perhaps more
than in any other, working together in partnership-not only across the
political parties, but in close association with business and industry-is
crucial. We can achieve a great deal for Scotland and Scotland's economy
if we take that approach. If we get it right, we will develop a strong
relationship with business in Scotland, similar to that which is found
in places such as Catalonia and Bavaria, where industry values and fiercely
defends its local democratic institutions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There will always be areas that are outside
our control. As has been mentioned, many economic measures are reserved
to Westminster, but many more matters are now decided on a European and
a global level that individual Governments often find difficult to understand,
far less control. However, the Scottish Parliament and our new Government
in Scotland can still do a huge amount. The challenge to us is to get it
right-to use the considerable powers that will now be available to us to
help business and to give Scotland a real competitive advantage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we are to thrive as a nation in the
next century, it will be through our knowledge, our skills and our creativity.
Scotland has no ambition to compete with low-skill, low-margin, low-value,
high-volume ventures. One of my great hopes is that through the development
of the Scottish Parliament we will become more international in our outlook.
If we want to be world class, we must benchmark with the best, wherever
they may be.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is why a foundation of excellence
in education is so crucial to our economic future. Traditionally, our schools
and universities have had a world-class reputation, but reputation on its
