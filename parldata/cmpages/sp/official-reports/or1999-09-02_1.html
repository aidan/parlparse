Officer (Sir David Steel): </strong>The first item of business this morning
is a debate on motion S1M-109 in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, which proposes
that the Mental Health (Public Safety and Appeals) (Scotland) Bill be treated
as an emergency bill. I remind members that this debate will be followed
immediately by a decision on the motion. In fact, decisions will follow
all items of business that will be taken this morning in accordance with
the business programme that was agreed yesterday. I give notice that the
debate will last for one hour and 30 minutes and that the decision will
be taken at the end of that period. Members will be expected to be in the
chamber for the decision. If there is a vote, the voting period will be
the usual 30 seconds. To protect time for the important debates today,
there will not be the normal 10-minute notice of votes. As no extra time
will be allowed, it is important that members are in the chamber when decisions
are made today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The occupants of the chair will allow a
wide-ranging debate on motion S1M-109, which is the debate that we are
about to have on the need for an emergency bill, but during the second
debate, which is on the bill itself, we will strictly apply the rule that
the debate will be about the contents of the bill and will not hark back
to the events that we are about to discuss. The timings throughout the
morning will be four minutes for each speech from the back benches. I call
Mr Jim Wallace to speak to and move the motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">09:32</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy First Minister and Minister
for Justice (Mr Jim Wallace): </strong>On 2 August, Sheriff Douglas Allan reached
a decision in Lanark sheriff court on an appeal under sections 63 and 64
of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 that led to the absolute discharge
of Noel Ruddle.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That decision exposed a serious flaw in
the 1984 act. Until 2 August, Mr Ruddle was one of 144 restricted patients
who were detained in the state hospital at Carstairs. Patients there suffer
from a range of mental disorders, including depression and mental impairment.
Some patients have convictions for grave offences, others have lesser convictions
and some have no convictions&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at all. There is
a small group of patients in the state hospital whose release would give
rise to serious and enduring concern for public safety. Noel Ruddle was
in that category.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The facts of Noel Ruddle's case are now
well known. He was convicted in 1992 of culpable homicide and sent to the
state hospital on a combined hospital and restriction order. In March this
year, he appealed to the sheriff against his continuing detention. Scottish
Office ministers instructed officials to oppose the appeal on the basis
of medical evidence that Noel Ruddle was appropriately detained. Ministers
also had regard to the broad definition of treatability that the House
of Lords had set out in a judgment in December 1998 in the case of Alexander
Reid v the Secretary of State for Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At hearings in April this year, the sheriff
considered reports from forensic psychiatrists. Those reports agreed, by
and large, that Ruddle was mentally disordered and that he presented a
risk to the public. They disagreed on whether he was being treated in a
way that alleviated his condition or stopped it deteriorating.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On 2 August, in a long and considered judgment,
the sheriff found that Noel Ruddle was not in receipt of any treatment
that was capable of benefiting his mental disorder. The sheriff was not
permitted by the law as it stood to have regard to the issue of public
protection so, under the law as it relates to people with personality disorders,
Ruddle could not be further detained.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ministers urgently considered whether there
were any steps that could be taken to keep Mr Ruddle in the state hospital,
but the law provided no help. There was no right of appeal. The sheriff's
judgment was combed with a view to judicial review, but the unequivocal
legal advice, which ministers accepted, was that such a step offered no
prospect of continuing Noel Ruddle's detention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The stark truth is that once Sheriff Allan
had decided that Ruddle was no longer detainable, no other legal restraint
could have been applied: not an interim interdict to continue his detention;
not a civil power to section him; not a conditional discharge. To suggest
otherwise is just wishful thinking, misunderstanding or, conceivably, political
posturing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It would be equally wrong to suggest that
leaving the law in such a state was acceptable. The only way to guarantee
public safety in future was to change the law.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On 2 August, urgent consideration of emergency
legislation was instructed. On 4 August, I announced that we would bring
forward emergency legislation to plug the loophole in the Mental Health
(Scotland) Act 1984, and that we&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">would aim to do
so shortly after Parliament's return from the summer recess. We never made
any secret of the difficulties and we did not underestimate the challenge,
but never did I or the Executive waver from that aim. It was our objective,
it remained our objective and today we are delivering.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have been criticised for failing to
plug the Ruddle loophole before it appeared. That argument is fanciful.
It is true that the case of Alexander Reid raised the possible argument
that someone might be released from detention if they were not treatable,
but it must be remembered that the secretary of state won that and a subsequent
case. Moreover, the House of Lords, in its ruling on Reid, gave a very
wide definition of treatment. In the Ruddle case, the sheriff decided on
the basis of the evidence before him that Ruddle's position fell outside
even that wide definition. It was only then that the loophole and its precise
nature were exposed. Our actions since then have been aimed at closing
the loophole as soon as possible and, more important, before any other
patients could avail themselves of it. This legislation does that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Reid judgment made it clear that the
law relating to offenders with personality disorders needed fundamental
review. That is why the Government set up the MacLean committee within
weeks of the Reid judgment and why we have made a commitment to comprehensive
legislation once the MacLean and Millan committees have reported.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Noel Ruddle's abrupt and unconditional
release must concern us all. We stand ready to act and seek Parliament's
help today, in the interests of public safety, to plug the loophole before
personality-disordered patients in a similar position follow him.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The legislation that we seek today has
been prepared urgently, but with great care, to tackle the loophole that
allowed Noel Ruddle's discharge. The legislation will put public protection
at the heart of the decisions that sheriffs take in considering appeals
for absolute discharge and will allow ministers to appeal against decisions
when, in the ministers' view, public safety concerns have not been adequately
dealt with. Other steps are to clarify the importance of public safety
in ministers' decisions on restricted patients and to include personality
disorders in the statutory definition of mental disorder. We want those
powers to be in place for current and future appeals. It is intended that
the new test will come into effect for any appeals that are heard after
1 September.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">framed the bill
with that in mind. Acting on independent legal advice, you, as Presiding
Officer, have sanctioned the introduction of the bill as a competent measure.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This emergency legislation has not been
the Executive's only response to the Ruddle judgment. At our request, the
Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland is examining aspects of care and
treatment in Mr Ruddle's case and in similar cases. The commission is focusing
on psychological interventions that might have been considered appropriate,
and will report by the end of the year.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I have said, the MacLean and Millan
committees are working to modernise and improve our legal framework, and
are consulting widely on the steps we should take.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the first months of next year, we should
have advice on the sentencing of serious offenders with personality disorders.
By next summer, that will be followed by comprehensive proposals to modernise
Scotland's mental health legislation. I am sure that I speak for the Parliament
when I say that I am grateful to Lord MacLean and to Bruce Millan for leading
this important work. That is why I have made it clear that I consider today's
emergency legislation to be an interim measure. I promise that full and
well-conceived legislative proposals will be presented during this parliamentary
session.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP): </strong>We
all welcomed the establishment of the Millan and MacLean committees. In
view of the nature of the legislation, will the minister guarantee that
those committees, having been established by Westminster, will report to
the Scottish Parliament? Will he also guarantee that all members will have
an opportunity to examine their recommendations in detail?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I am grateful for that
intervention because it allows me to confirm that both those committees
will report to this Parliament. Their reports will be the subject of considerable
consultation in this Parliament and its committees. Through that process,
the Parliament will discharge its responsibility in what is recognised
to be a difficult but important sphere of public interest and concern.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We await those proposals and we look forward
to the subsequent legislation, but today's legislation is no less vital;
in the interests of public safety, we had to find a quicker way of plugging
the loophole exposed by the Ruddle case. That is why we are pressing colleagues
to agree to treat this bill as emergency legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

is a risk that, without this bill, a small number of mentally ill patients,

Cunningham (Perth) (SNP): </strong>The emergency legislation that is before
us today is undoubtedly an example of what can be achieved by this Parliament
and of the speed with which we can achieve it in comparison with Westminster.
It is also an example, however, of what happens when a Government does
not do its job.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is a tragedy that the first piece of
legislation before this Parliament has to be passed under the emergency
provisions contained in the standing orders. I understand that the process
has uncovered one or two deficiencies in the standing orders as they pertain
to emergency legislation-happily, that will be a matter for the Procedures
Committee and not for me.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">More than the standing orders are deficient,
however. The verdict of many people, not just in this chamber but throughout
the country, is that the Executive has been found seriously wanting in
its handling of the matter.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should remember that, on Monday 2 August,
Noel Ruddle's release from Carstairs did not come as a bolt out of the
blue, either to the Minister for Justice or to the First Minister. Apparently,
they had a conversation on the Sunday about the forthcoming release. Astonishingly,
they did not consider public confidence to be an issue that they had to
address; they cannot have done so, otherwise the matter would not have
been handled in such a cack-handed way during the days and weeks since
then.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">entirely forgetting
their responsibilities as politicians and as members of the Executive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The minister seemed totally unprepared
for the storm that broke over his head. Why was that? The question remains
unanswered by him. Based on the evidence of that first week following Ruddle's
release, the answer is probably that he would not recognise a real political
issue if it got up and bit him on the nose.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the Justice and Home Affairs Committee
meeting on Tuesday afternoon, the minister said that he was not told of
the problem that was likely to be posed by the Ruddle case until 14 July-almost
two months after he took office. That raises questions about the quality
of the advice to ministers. Receiving that information on 14 July would,
however, still have given him two weeks to get to work on the problem before
the outrage hit the fan. What happened between 14 July and 2 August? We
should be told.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the evidence of the publicity at the
time, the First Minister seems to have packed his bags to head off on a
wee holiday. I do not begrudge him that holiday, although I notice that
he is not in the chamber today, which is a pity. I wonder, however, whether
the timing of that holiday was entirely apt in the light of the advance
warning that had been given.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Minister for Justice must also have
cleared off somewhere, because a junior minister initially handled the
furore and was left blinking like a bewildered rabbit in the studio lights,
haplessly and hopelessly defending the indefensible until the Minister
for Justice rode to the rescue some days later. Meanwhile, Ruddle had been
doing some bag packing of his own.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When the minister reappeared, it was to
a hastily arranged meeting with me and the leader of the Conservative party.
No doubt, he hoped that that meeting would stop the uproar. It is a pity
that, when he was pressed on whether there were any cases in the pipeline
similar to Ruddle's, he answered with an unequivocal no. Lo and behold,
that was not strictly true. The minister now tells us that the facts of
one of the cases about which he did not advise us were not intimated to
him until some hours after the meeting on 4 August-we must accept his word
on that. However, I still do not accept the explanation that was given
for withholding information about the other case that was due to come up-the
Tonner case.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_8"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Jim
Wallace: </strong>I must answer that point. It has been explained to Roseanna
Cunningham that, in the first case in question, the intimation of the appeal
was made only on the day of the meeting. Even if the appeal were to succeed
in that case, the applicant would be transferred to prison.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">careful consideration
of the cases, was that the other case was materially different from Ruddle's.
It therefore did not fall into the same category as the handful of cases
on which our discussions focused. I did not mislead her.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>The minister
knows that the explanation that was subsequently given on 27 August was
not accepted either by me or by Mr McLetchie.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It transpired that the appeal was made
on precisely the same point but that, at an early stage, a view was taken
of the quality of the evidence. The minister was therefore going to advise
us that the cases were not the same. However, to say that a different view
was taken of the quality of the evidence is by no means the same as saying
that the Tonner case was not similar to the Ruddle case.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was disingenuous in the extreme for
the minister to have taken that position on the Tonner case, and I think
that he knows it. The matter has damaged his credibility. His credibility
was not helped any further by his saying before the Justice and Home Affairs
Committee on Tuesday that he was not there in 1997 and 1998 during the
events that led up to the case.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>It is true that I was
not there.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_11"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna
Cunningham: </strong>The minister may say that it is true that he was not there,
but that does not help his case.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The phrase that he used at the committee
meeting seemed vaguely familiar to me, and then I remembered why. There
are three well-known defences in Scots law. The first I had better not
repeat for fear of incurring the Presiding Officer's wrath, but I will
let him in on the secret afterwards. The second is that a big boy did it
and ran away-that is clear enough, I suppose. The third is, "It wisnae
me; I wisnae there," and that is what the minister is saying about his
position.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Obviously, the minister remembers that
defence well from his years at the Scottish bar-so well that he thought
that he would try it out for himself when he got into a corner. As a plea
in this case, it is a total non-starter. Whether Mr Wallace likes it or
not, he took the job, he took the money and now he has to take the responsibility.
That leaves him swinging gently in the breeze-no doubt that is where his
coalition partners would like to leave him.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the figure skulking in the long grass. It is the First Minister-who is
not here-hoping that no one will spot him or his involvement in the whole
affair leading up to 1999. I do not think that he should be let off quite
so easily. He certainly cannot pretend that he was not well warned of the
effect that the release would have on public opinion and confidence. A
previous high-profile case-mentioned by the Minister for Justice and similar
in its facts-had generated major publicity. The Reid case was covered extensively
by the press after the sheriff court decision in 1997 and again in 1998.
Indeed, it led to a front page <i>Daily Record</i> headline on 23 August

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The MacLean committee was set up after
a successful intervention in the House of Lords. Apparently, the success
in the sheriff court appeal a year earlier had not set the alarm bells
ringing, but the success in the House of Lords had. I would like to know
why, in the middle of 1998, given that Ruddle had then come into the queue,
the then Secretary of State for Scotland did not hear the alarm bells ringing
loudly enough to have done something about it. We have lost a great deal
of time in dealing with the issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The problems posed by the Mental Health
(Scotland) Act 1984 had been growing for some time. There are other issues
to do with treatability, which take us back to 1994, but other members
will deal with that. The unpalatable truth is that the current Minister
for Justice is responsible for the debacle-he is on the hook, but he is
not the only one. The previous Secretary of State for Scotland, now the
First Minister, must take some share of the blame. The fact that he is

to treat the matter with the urgency that it deserves since the sheriff's
decision in the Ruddle case was first announced on 2 August. Mr Ruddle
was released from Carstairs notwithstanding the fact that his state of
mental health was such-whether treatable or untreatable-that he represented
a danger both to the public and, lest it be forgotten, potentially to himself.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is a matter of urgency that we close
the loophole in the law used by Mr Ruddle to gain his freedom and which
others might seek to exploit in pending cases-other cases that might come
before our courts before we have the comprehensive review of mental health
legislation following the reports of the MacLean and Millan committees
and any subsequent legislation that we might enact. However, although we
welcome and support the motion, it provides an opportunity for the Parliament,
in plenary session, to consider the way in which both the minister and
the Scottish Executive have handled the matter. There are lessons to be
learned from this affair in terms of the conduct of the Government and
the relationship between the Executive and the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first charge that we lay at the door
of the minister is one of complacency. Mr Wallace and Mr Dewar failed to
pull out all the legal stops to try to keep Mr Ruddle in detention. It
was open to them to seek a judicial review in the Court of Session of the
decision to grant Mr Ruddle his freedom, coupled with an interim suspension
of the discharge order, pending consideration of that application. I fully
accept that there was no guarantee that such an application would have
been successful and have resulted in the detention of Mr Ruddle, but it
should at least have been attempted. In the opinion of experts, such as
the former Lord Advocate, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon and the former Solicitor
General, Paul Cullen QC, there was a stateable case for a review, based
on the failure of the sheriff to explain in his judgment why he discounted
the evidence of one of the psychiatrists who believed&nbsp;</font></td>

condition was treatable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I find it very difficult to believe that,
given the time that the Executive had to consider the matter and the legal
advice at its disposal, the minister could not have instructed the presentation
of a stateable case to the court. As Ms Cunningham said in her speech,
let us not forget that the Ruddle decision did not come out of the blue
on 2 August. The hearing before the sheriff was concluded in May. The minister
told the Justice and Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday this week that he
was advised of the pending decision on 14 July.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>That is not true.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>I believe that
it is correct. The minister told the committee on Tuesday that he was advised
of the background to the case and the pending decision on 14 July. That
is in the <i>Official Report</i>.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_13"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace:
</strong>I want to clarify that point. I was advised of the circumstances of
the case and that there was a decision pending. I was not advised of the
nature of the decision. Obviously that was not known until the sheriff's
judgment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>I think that Mr
Wallace will accept that he was advised that there was an important pending
decision and that an adverse decision might have led to the release of
Mr Ruddle.<a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_15"></a> That was a serious possibility,
which was brought to his attention on 14 July. Moreover, the minister,
as I am sure he will confirm, told the committee that</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"allowing for the possibility that Mr Ruddle
might have been discharged, efforts were made to put a care package in
place before that Monday"-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">that is Monday 2 August.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If efforts were being made to prepare for
defeat in terms of Mr Ruddle's care on discharge, why were contingency
plans not being made at the same time to challenge that decision in a higher
court? That was a massive failure of political leadership on the part of
the Deputy First Minister. He constantly jumped to conclusions and was
far too keen to accept the advice that was given, when he should have been
doing everything that he could to ensure public safety.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second charge relates to the minister's
failure fully to disclose the position in relation to other cases in his
dealings with Opposition parties-part of which has already been covered
in his exchange with Roseanna Cunningham.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I accept that one case that subsequently
came to light is not relevant. However, that is not true of the case of
Mr Tonner. The minister justified his failure to disclose-he confirmed
it this morning-on the ground that it was</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is legal hair-splitting and I have
to ask: "found" by whom and "appeared" to whom? It certainly was not the
sheriff, who has not even heard the evidence yet.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was Mr Wallace's advisers who were making
a judgment on the evidence and how it would be assessed by the sheriff.
The truth is that the minister did not know then, and does not know today,
what judgment will be passed on that evidence, because it is not his decision.
Given the minister's proclaimed commitment to openness and freedom of information,
I find it astonishing that he should take the approach that he has in dealing
with Ms Cunningham and myself.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The third charge to be examined is that
of foot-dragging in introducing this new legislation. The minister maintains
that his response has been rapid, set in train by his statement of 4 August,
following our meeting. However, studying his statement, I see not one word
in it about emergency legislation. Instead, there is simply a reference
to Lord MacLean being asked to accelerate the work of his committee. It
was Ms Cunningham and myself who pressed the issue of emergency legislation,
whereas-as the notes of the meeting will confirm, and the Deputy Minister
for Community Care, Mr Iain Gray, should be able to confirm it as well
because he was there-the minister's response was guarded, to say the least,
and contained no suggestion that legislation would be brought to this Parliament
on anything like the accelerated timetable that we are now being asked
to approve.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>That is not correct.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

If you look at the notes of the meeting-your advisers were there-you will
find the suggestion that legislation would not be in place until at least
October. I am sure that Ms Cunningham will confirm that that was the clear
impression you gave on those discussions. All we heard about were the difficulties
with the legislation; we did not hear about any decisive intent on your
part to act at that time. I am quite happy, if you are, for the notes of

clarify things.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>I want to clarify the
points that Mr McLetchie made. Does he not agree that-at the meeting to
which he referred-we discussed clearly with him and Ms Cunningham the possibility
of laying emergency legislation before the Parliament immediately on its
return after the recess, which is what we are doing? There followed a discussion
on how long that process would take. We now know that it will take a week,
but that was not clear at the time of the meeting. We said that we would
bring the legislation to the Parliament when it returned. Ms Cunningham's
response, as I recall, was that the Scottish National party had never asked
for Parliament to be recalled. Is not that Mr McLetchie's recollection
of the meeting?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>My recollection
is that the whole subject of emergency legislation was initiated in that
discussion by Ms Cunningham and myself, and that most of the initial discussion-led
by Mr Gray and the Deputy First Minister-related to a review of the Ruddle
case and why certain actions had or had not been taken. The complexity
of any new legislation in relation to human rights was also discussed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I accept that the ministers said that legislation
might be introduced, but what we are talking about now is the timetable
and the speed of response. The indications that were given at that meeting-and
Ms Cunningham and the notes will confirm this-were that we were unlikely
to have legislation on the statute book until at least October. As he said
in his statement of 4 August, Mr Wallace was going to make a prior referral
of the matter to the MacLean committee. That is in his statement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of the public outcry and the political pressure that has been brought to
bear. When it was put to its first test, the Scottish Executive flunked
the examination. The report card for this lot will read: leadership, failed;
openness, failed; responsiveness, failed. However, of all those failures,
it is the failure of political leadership and the failure to pull out all
the stops to protect the safety of the public that are by far the most
damning. Instead of a minister being in charge of his department and offering
decisive leadership in the public interest, we have a minister being run
by his department, meekly accepting the advice proffered and being unable
to see the big picture. The Ruddle affair is a nightmarish Scottish version
of "Yes Minister", with one crucial difference-in&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire)
(LD): </strong>I welcome the introduction of the bill. Mr Ruddle's release exposed
a loophole in the law and it is important that that loophole be closed.
It is also important to emphasise that, within a month of the loophole
being exposed, Parliament is to consider emergency legislation, which has
been drafted quickly despite having to take into account the complexities
of the European convention on human rights. I suggest to Parliament that
we should not underestimate those complexities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In contrast to David McLetchie, I believe
that the Executive has demonstrated its commitment to public safety. Otherwise,
we would not be here this morning. With your permission, Sir David, I would
like to put on record the sympathy of the Parliament to the relatives of
Mr Ruddle's victim. It must be difficult for them to have to live with
this nightmare, which they will have seen repeated several times in the
press.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As we heard in the Justice and Home Affairs
Committee, the bill will be an interim measure, pending the reviews that
are in train. The Executive has confirmed that there will be further legislation
if necessary, after Lord MacLean and the Mental Welfare Commission for
Scotland have considered aspects of the Ruddle case. Those aspects were
immediately referred to them on 3 August.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is difficult for laymen to tread in
this complex legal area; perhaps it difficult also for recently retired
solicitors. However, the problems with the legislation that was introduced
in the second term of Mrs Thatcher's Government have been apparent for
some time. During the meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee on 16 July
1996, while discussing this very problem, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton-who
is with us today, of course-said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

existing criteria give sufficient prominence to the protection of the public.

that it was important that that review should take place, but after nine
months nothing had happened, and no loophole such as has been exposed by
Mr Ruddle's case came to light. It is perfectly clear that there have been
difficulties with the legislation for a while and that this interim measure
is important. However, the general review that will take place after the
MacLean committee has reported is equally significant.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Government was right to rely upon successive
successful appeals in the Reid case. It was important that it did so. What
else should it have done? As soon as the Reid case was finished, the MacLean
committee was set up within about six weeks, over the Christmas period.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):
</strong>Mr Reid's case was first dealt with in the Scottish sheriff courts
in around 1994. It then went through appeals before finally reaching the
House of Lords in 1998. The MacLean committee was instructed shortly afterwards.
Therefore, there were four years during which the case was considered.
It took four years for the previous Administration, and now this Administration,
to get their act together and instruct Lord MacLean.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>But is Mr MacAskill
suggesting that the Government should initiate a committee of inquiry during
the course of legal proceedings? That would probably be unprecedented during
a series of appeals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to point out that the legislation
that we are being invited to enact will affect cases that have already
been lodged and are still to be heard. Mr Robson asks whether the Government
can initiate a committee of inquiry while the case is pending, but this
legislation will change the law while the case is pending, which is far
more fundamental.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>I take Mr McLetchie's
point. That is a clear legal issue which should be addressed; presumably
it has been addressed in relation to the European convention on human rights.
It is important that the interim legislation stands the test to which it
will be subjected in further appeals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How would Mr McLetchie have reacted had
the Minister for Justice ignored the law officers' advice? I suggest that
he would have been one of the first to criticise the minister for doing
so. Mr Wallace has suffered some unfair and hostile criticism recently
and I commend him for his courage and fortitude during this difficult period.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands)
(SNP): </strong>I also feel very strongly for Mr Wallace, because he has taken
a terrible pounding over this issue. Perhaps there was a subclause in the
partnership agreement that said, "In the event of a political hospital
pass, a Liberal Democrat minister will take the lead on this and other
issues." The entire Executive has to take some responsibility for an issue
that involves the justice department and the health department. Although
I support the need for emergency legislation, I will focus on two key areas
that might have stopped us getting into this mess; I would appreciate it
if the minister would address the position in which we find ourselves when
he sums up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My first point concerns the treatability
test. As Mr Wallace rightly pointed out, the sheriff was put in the position
of handing down an absolute discharge, because Mr Ruddle was not receiving
the appropriate treatment to alleviate his condition. However, why was
not Mr Ruddle receiving such help? Why was that treatment not available?
We need to ask questions about the provision of mental health care in our
establishments, and those answers must come, not just from Mr Wallace,
but from the health department, so that we find out exactly what went wrong
in this case. It is not that the treatment does not exist; it simply did
not exist in this instance and we have to ask why.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the Justice and Home Affairs Committee,
Mr Wallace said that the matter would be referred to the Mental Welfare
Commission for investigation. However, the question is not that difficult:
the treatment either did or did not exist. We do not need another inquiry
punted into the long grass before we can find out whether adequate provision
was made. There is a crucial difference between a condition that is not
treatable and the unavailability of treatment-that point will be raised
time and again in the debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We also need to find out why the sheriff
could not have considered the wider context. Is it possible to have a legal
system that says that treatment is available and which tries to find a
way of getting it, instead of a system that takes the narrow definition
which means that, in the specific case in Carstairs, Mr Ruddle goes free
because treatment is not available? That suggests a lack of clear thinking
and we need to discover how to prevent such a situation in future. I look
forward to that point being addressed in the summing-up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of simply locking up the patient and throwing away the key.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My second point moves the focus away from
the unfortunate Mr Wallace to the rest of the Executive and particularly
to the Secretary of State for Scotland, as he was, and the First Minister,
as he now is, as the time frame takes in several Administrations. We need
to find out the position of the responsible medical officer. The responsible
medical officer is obliged to provide regular reports to the First Minister-the
then secretary of state- on the treatment that is received by patients
in such a position. The secretary of state is also obliged to make sure
that the patient is receiving adequate care on the recommendation of the
responsible medical officer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Were such regular medical reports received;
and, if so, were they read and understood? Did those reports recommend
additional treatment and highlight the lack of provision of adequate mental
health care? If so, we are faced with two options. Either the Executive
or the then Government decided that it would not do anything about the
situation, which makes the entire Government culpable; or there was a problem
with the reporting mechanism from the RMO upwards. We must resolve such
a problem, because the RMO's reports provide the major check in the system
to ensure the provision of proper medical care. If that system breaks down,
we will have serious problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

in the same boat.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The new Scottish Parliament was supposed
to herald a new era of open democracy, including more opportunities for
pre-legislative scrutiny, which we hoped would lead to better-quality legislation.
Yesterday, the business manager, Mr McCabe, told us that the bill had been
produced after intensive discussion and preparation, but he failed to tell
us with whom that discussion had taken place. As it is part of the business
manager's job to ensure that the Parliament has adequate time to scrutinise
legislation, it is ironic that Mr McCabe-who has been issuing press statements
all week telling us how we should be doing our job-seems to be failing
in that aspect of his job. I do not think that the time available to scrutinise
the legislation is by any means adequate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Parliament (Mr Tom
McCabe): </strong>I do not know whether Mr Canavan is purposely forgetful, but
he will be aware that the Parliament's provisions for emergency legislation
allow for such legislation to be taken in one day. The business motion
that the Parliament agreed to yesterday spread consideration of the legislation
over two weeks, to allow maximum scrutiny of the bill while getting the
legislation on the statute book and answering public safety considerations
as soon as possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>Nevertheless, if
members read the timetabling motion, they will learn that there is by no
means enough time for adequate scrutiny of the bill. The Executive says
that there are over two weeks for scrutiny. For heaven's sake, we have
today and one day next week for consideration of this emergency bill. That
is not adequate by any means.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Later there will be an opportunity-albeit
limited-to discuss the content of the bill. I am concerned about certain
aspects. There is, understandably, great concern about public safety, but
there is also concern about the implications for human rights of the legislation
and about the reference to personality disorder and its definition.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What exactly is a personality disorder?

hundreds of amendments at a later stage to ensure that the legislation
was effective. A little word of caution to all of us is to ensure, when

of my interest in people with special needs, that many organisations have
made strong recommendations and expressed strong concerns about the motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I echo the point about defining personality
disorders. I am sure that people in the press gallery look down and say,
"Those 129 people must have personality disorders or they would not be
there." According to some of the articles that I read in the tabloid press,
we are all here for some very strange reasons.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is a personality disorder? It is a
difficult definition. From my training in special needs, I know that every
case is an individual case. I do not think that blanket legislation can
define a personality disorder, and that is where I have a huge problem
with the overall direction of the bill. Unless we look at the definition
in terms of individual cases and of our ability to treat those cases, we
will have to revisit the issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the Millan and MacLean reports come before this assembly, they will be

other things. They should not be referred to a specific committee because
it is essential that the boundaries are crossed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I thank the ministers for keeping me informed of developments.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As is obvious, people who work and live
in and around the state hospital have considerable concerns about this
case and the implications for future cases. Some of the reactionary, inaccurate
comments made by Opposition members in the press during the summer did
nothing to help those people or to progress the debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My concern now is that the legislation
that this Parliament introduces should not only be in the best interests
of the public, but give patients in the state hospital the care that they
need and deserve; that balance is very important.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the immediate aftermath of Mr Ruddle's
release, I went to the state hospital with my colleague, Jimmy Hood MP,
to meet the staff and patients. Morale among the staff was very low and
people felt that they were being blamed. We need to examine that situation.
The staff work hard in very difficult circumstances and, if anything comes
out of this debate, it should be our support for staff who work in places
such as the state hospital and how we can help them in their jobs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

which was on the Monday or Tuesday of that week. During my visit, I asked
the staff about other releases. They gave me a categorical assurance that

high. What we have read in the press during the past few weeks has been
very unhelpful. It is particularly unhelpful that today's debate has been,
to some extent, a ritual slagging-off, with people determined to have a
go at individuals rather than attempting to focus on what needs to be done

keep children in secure accommodation. I do not see why adults should be
treated any differently. That is the point at issue this morning.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Common sense says that the loophole should
be closed and that the First Minister should have a method of appealing
against the decision of a sheriff where that decision is clearly not in
the public interest. Common sense says that we need a definition of mental
illness, but not so that we can sweep people with personality disorders-including
some of us here-off the streets and lock them up. It is not proposed that
the bill should do that-I would certainly not be in favour of it if it
did. What is proposed is that we should deal with the current situation
of a number of people and a loophole in a particular piece of the law.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The nature of an emergency is that we have
to act quickly. I share some of Dennis's views about time for scrutiny,
but if we are not seen to be taking some action we could be open to further
criticism. Common sense says that we should get on with debating the principles
of the bill and ensuring that it gets on to the statute book as quickly
as possible. There will be checks and balances to consider and we have
committees and other people who will deal with them. The bill will solve
a particular problem on a particular issue. Let us get on with that and

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):
</strong>I speak as a fully paid-up member of the critics' trade union, but
some recent remarks in the press have brought criticism into bad repute.
There has been an extraordinary amount of hype and personalisation of the
argument. That is bad in two ways: if the argument is hyped up, serious
criticism on other issues is devalued and the chance of a serious examination
of the subject is removed. The same applies to personalisation. If we go
in for attacks on a minister, we reduce the amount of serious discussion
of the issue. Duncan Hamilton made some good points on that issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are important points, such as those
that the previous two speakers made, that need careful consideration, but
extraordinary criticisms do not help. Roseanna Cunningham has expounded
a new doctrine that would terrify any football manager. Her doctrine is
that if one is a team's recently appointed football manager, one is responsible
for all the defeats suffered by that team before one took office. That

(Con): </strong>If this unhappy episode has demonstrated anything, it is that
whether the Executive likes it or not, this has been the political issue
of the Parliament since its inception. That may not be palatable to the
Executive, but it is the reality, not only to the Opposition parties but
to the public.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In response to Mr Gorrie, I must say that
during the whole debate, from early August until now, I did not detect
any attempt to personalise attacks. All that we-and the Scottish nationalist
party-were saying was that it is not for us, or for ministers or advisers,
to become judge and jury. If we wish to test a law, we must ask a court
to undertake that task. That dramatically illustrates the relevance and
significance of the role of Opposition. It is not for the Opposition to
go around kowtowing, apologising and promising not to be unpleasant or
nasty. It is for the Opposition rightly to consider any given situation,
particularly one of the gravity of the Ruddle case, and to determine whether
the Executive has fully, responsibly and openly discharged every obligation
upon it and explored every avenue available to it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In that respect, there is one question
to which I, personally, have not received an answer. I listened with interest
to Mr Wallace's remarks. In his preliminary observations, he said that
there was "no appeal, no interim interdict". Did Mr Wallace receive advice
that, within a judicial review application, it is competent to include
a conclusion for interim suspension of a sheriff's interlocutor?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We in the Conservative party have made
it clear that we support in principle this welcome attempt to plug the
loophole, and we certainly support the motion that it should be treated
as emergency legislation. We shall co-operate in so far as we can in the
enactment of this bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

were elected to look after the best interests of the public, and they failed.
Smart-arse lawyers just used the law to win Mr Ruddle's case. You, Mr Wallace,
were represented and you have lawyers-two are sitting next to you. Ruddle's
lawyers won, your lawyers lost and the public in Scotland and elsewhere
paid the price. A legal loophole? This matter has been discussed and debated
for 40 years, and it was debated in 1984 when the Mental Health (Scotland)
Act was debated. It is not a legal loophole-it is a huge abyss that has

through some of the facts. As Lord Hardie will wind up for the Executive,
I produce what I will call Opposition production No 1-the sheriff's decision
from Lanark. The report clarifies that Mr Ruddle was of above-average intelligence
and had no previous history of mental illness. I think that the Tories
should take some cognisance of that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 1991 and in 1992, Mr Ruddle was allowed
to be sent to the state hospital, as opposed to being prosecuted, and no
stops were pulled out. That was despite the fact that, at one stage while
he was on remand in Barlinnie awaiting possible trial and consideration,
he was seen by a psychiatrist and presumed to have no mental illness. Indeed,
all the medical evidence is that he did not have a history of mental illness-he
had a history of psychopathic disorder.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As well as Conservative members saying
that Labour should have tried harder in 1998 and 1999, their law officers-Mackay,
Cullen or whoever their predecessors were-should have tried harder in 1991
and 1992. Perhaps it is coincidental that this evil man's parents were
both psychiatric nurses. Did that not flag up a problem for the Conservative
Administration? Should not the Conservatives' medical or legal teams have
monitored that?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will continue to run through what went
on. The fact is that the sheriff made it clear that this man should have
been monitored, yet he was not. He seems to have made an improvement while
in Carstairs. He makes such an improvement that he gets himself a girlfriend
and has a party during his incarceration. The psychiatrists examine him
and it becomes clear that he fits the criteria for release.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

you seem to have dealt with the situation through your legal team and to
have done nothing. It was clear that Mr Ruddle met the criteria for discharge,
and that is why it was granted. You gave no consideration to an attempt
to alleviate the problem by offering a conditional discharge, which, I
understand, would have been acceptable to Mr Ruddle and his advisers. We
could, at least, have seen some restrictions placed on him. What happened?
In August of this year, he was released at two minutes past 10, and you
did not even have a bed available for him. He was able to go walkabout.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This situation is categorised and classified
by total mismanagement, starting in 1991 and 1992, in terms of how Ruddle
was prosecuted and dealt with at that time, continuing through the Labour
Administration in post-election 1997, to April 1998. Lord Hardie, you were

did nothing. In February of this year, you were notified that Ruddle was

been suggestions in the past few weeks-they were repeated today- that the
Executive showed no concern for the situation until it was spurred into
action by the media, or perhaps by members of Opposition parties, after
the issue of the judgment on Monday 2 August. Indeed, Mr McLetchie even
accuses us of complacency. Nothing could be further from the truth.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Before I deal with what we did to protect
the public, I would ask this Parliament what the Conservatives did in that
regard. Despite the promises Lord James Douglas-Hamilton made to the Scottish
Grand Committee in July 1996-which were referred to earlier-to ensure that
the arrangements for discharge of patients from psychiatric hospitals took
due account of public safety, nothing was done. Nor is there any evidence
of demands by the Conservatives for urgent action prior to, or even after,
the House of Lords decision in the Reid case-not even from the previous
law officers. Where were they then?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>On a point
of order, Mr Presiding Officer. I would like to point out that the Lord
Advocate-presumably an independent law officer-appears to be making a highly
politically partisan speech. [<i>Applause.</i>] I appreciate the difficult
position that the Lord Advocate is in, but is it entirely correct for someone
who is a law officer, and therefore presumably independent, to make such
a speech?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>That is a
point of argument; it is not a point of order for me.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians)
(Con): </strong>Does the Lord Advocate accept that in the 10 years during which
I was involved with home affairs there was not a single case in which a
prisoner-a patient-was released in the same way that Ruddle has been?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Lord Advocate:</strong> I accept that,

law officers for failing to introduce legislation prior to their losing
the case in the inner house. Doing so would have been as absurd as the

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Lord Advocate:</strong> Prior to Ruddle
lodging his appeal, another similar appeal had been defended by the secretary
of state and was ultimately refused. Ruddle was defended on the basis of
evidence similar to other cases, which had been successfully defended.
All of them involved conflicting evidence that the sheriff was required
to assess. Until the decision was issued there was no basis for anyone
to conclude that Ruddle would succeed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What about events after the Ruddle decision
became known? It is not customary to reveal the extent of the law officers'
involvement in particular legal questions, but we have made an exception
in this case. I hope to address the point raised by Miss Goldie in this
regard. An embargoed copy of the sheriffs judgment was issued to the Scottish
Executive and to Mr Ruddle's solicitors on Friday 30 July, in accordance
with normal practice. The solicitor to the Scottish Executive immediately
sent a copy of the judgment to my legal secretary, and to the counsel who
had conducted the appeal on behalf of the secretary of state-obviously
to consider its implications.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I take great exception to the suggestion
that we did not realise that this was a public confidence issue. Of course
we realised the significance of the decision. On the Friday, my legal secretary
and a principal solicitor in the Scottish Executive experienced in such
cases and I each independently considered the judgment-independently from
each other. Our primary concern, and my instruction to the other solicitors
involved, was to look at it from the point of view of the protection of
the public. We sought any lawful means by which Mr Ruddle could be detained
after 2 August. We each concluded that there was none and, moreover, we
separately concluded that there was no basis on which we could successfully
seek a judicial review. To answer the specific point, ministers were advised
that it would be possible, in the context of a judicial review, to seek
an interim order.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>I accept that the
advice you gave the minister in good faith was that an application for
judicial review might not have been successful. Was it your advice that
there was no stateable basis for a review? Was that your advice-that there
was no stateable basis, no remotest possibility that the Crown would win?</font></td>

The advice was that there was no prospect of a success in the appeal.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>As you perfectly
well know, that was not the question. That is an assessment of the prospects
of success.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Lord Advocate: </strong>The advice given
was quite clear. There was no prospect of any success and no merit in going
ahead with a judicial review. As a result of that-as a precaution-the police
were alerted by the Crown Office on Friday to enable them to take special
precautions to secure the protection of the public after Monday. I was
not content to leave matters there, and the Solicitor General was asked
to consider the judgment on his return home on the Saturday. A meeting
was arranged on the Saturday, with the Solicitor General, me and the legal
secretary, and the same conclusion was reached.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I note that Mr McLetchie referred to the
fact that his advice is that there could be no guarantee that this would
be successful. Our position-and the position of all lawyers involved in
the case until the Monday-was that there were no prospects of a successful
judicial review and that there was no lawful basis for securing the detention
of Ruddle after the Monday.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our view was confirmed on the Monday in
a note of preliminary views of counsel. Five people independently reached
the same conclusion. Members should bear in mind the fact that we were
seeking legitimate means of continually detaining Ruddle.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister was advised on Sunday
1 August. Since then, there has been prompt action. I am not prepared to
act without a sound basis in law. Nothing that could have been done would
have secured Ruddle's detention, even if one were to put in a bogus judicial
review petition.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

(Public Safety and Appeals) (Scotland) Bill, and that it would be one for
which we would be using emergency powers. Because of the concerns expressed

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is an opportunity
for us, as a Parliament, to debate in principle the purpose and provisions
of this four-section bill. Although we are proceeding on an emergency basis
by agreement, this stage 1 debate is no different from that for other bills
that will come before Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would like to start by setting out clearly
the intention and principles behind this bill. Experience has shown that
when the courts come to interpret legislation, it is enormously helpful
to them to understand clearly what was in Parliament's mind when passing
it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The main aim of the bill is to close a
loophole that may allow a restricted patient who is detained in hospital
to appeal successfully against his detention on the grounds that, although
he continues to have a serious mental disorder and may be considered a
serious risk to the public, he is not, in a legal sense, treatable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the most recent interpretation of the
relevant sections of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984, the House of
Lords judgment in the case of Alexander Reid, about which we have already
heard a number of comments this morning, the treatments which may define
treatability were defined to be broad. However, treatability was established
as the first test which a sheriff has to consider in an appeal from a patient
suffering from a mental disorder. Public protection may be considered,
but only once this first test is met. If, as in the Ruddle case, the sheriff
finds that the patient is not treatable, the law, as it stands, does not
allow the sheriff to proceed to consider issues of public safety. The purpose
of this bill is to reverse that and to put public safety first.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The main principle of this bill is that
public safety will become the first and paramount test when mentally disordered
patients who are subject to restriction orders appeal to the courts for
discharge. That will be achieved through having a clear direction to sheriffs
on the face of the bill. There are also flanking provisions with the same
broad aim. Ministers will apply the same public safety test that they have
used for many years. Ministers of the Scottish Executive and restricted
patients will have a new power of appeal against the sheriff's decision,
and there will be a new power to detain patients in hospital for 14 days
pending consideration of whether there will be an appeal. If there is an
appeal, they may be detained thereafter until the appeal is concluded.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is the broad picture of the bill.
I shall now examine the sections one by one.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section 1 provides that, where a restricted
patient appeals against his detention, the sheriff must first consider
whether the patient suffers from a mental disorder that makes it necessary
to continue detention to protect the public from&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">serious harm. If
the answer is yes, the sheriff must continue the patient's detention. The
burden of proof will rest on Scottish ministers. Section 1 applies a similarly
worded requirement of Scottish ministers when they consider the discharge
of a restricted patient. The amendments are applied to existing appeals,
when the hearing takes place on or after 1 September 1999, as well as to
future appeals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section 2 creates a new right of appeal,
against the decision of the sheriff, to the Court of Session and the House
of Lords. The appeal, which may be on a point of fact or of law, may be
made by Scottish ministers or by the detained patient. The Court of Session
will be able to order the continuing detention of the patient until the
appeal is decided.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section 3 clarifies that the definition
of mental disorder in the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 includes personality
disorder. Section 4 contains the short title and the commencement of provisions.
The main part of the act will come into effect immediately upon royal assent,
but the new right of appeal will be brought into force by a separate commencement
order, to allow time for the procedures to be agreed. We anticipate that
that will be done promptly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Parliament knows, this bill has been
prepared at speed, but we have crafted it carefully by applying three key
tests. The first test is whether the bill is essential. We believe that
it is. If appeals for absolute discharge by mentally disordered patients
whose release could be dangerous to the public are to be effectively opposed,
we need this bill. The debate earlier today made the parliamentary will
on that plain.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second test is whether this bill will
be effective. We believe that it will, as it is precisely targeted on the
reasons why the sheriff allowed, and we could not prevent, Mr Ruddle's
release a month ago. The third test is whether this bill complies with
the European convention on human rights. I assure Parliament that we have
taken every step to ensure that that is so. Our judgment is that the bill
goes as far as we can in securing public safety powers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I stress again that we will revisit Scotland's
mental health legislation during this Parliament. Armed with the MacLean
and Millan recommendations-and taking the point that was made by Mrs Ewing
previously-we will ensure a full opportunity for the committees of this
Parliament to consider these proposals. We plan a substantial revision
of this complex area of law. I assure members that, if we find that the
measures in this bill will bear improvement in the longer term, there will
be an opportunity for change.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

a week between stage 1 and the other two stages so that there is time for

need to maintain the assurances that we have given on compliance with the
European convention on human rights.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Speed of preparation has ruled out formal
consultation, but I was able to brief the principal Opposition spokesmen
late last week on the provisions of the bill. I record my appreciation
of their willingness to help us to deal with this legislation on a fast
track. In accepting the general principles of the bill, they reserve the
right to examine it in detail and to provide the kind of parliamentary
scrutiny that we expect from responsible Opposition parties.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As well as informing Lord MacLean and Mr
Bruce Millan of our proposals, we have been able to brief key expert bodies:
the Law Society of Scotland, the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland,
the Scottish Association for Mental Health, and the Scottish division of
the Royal College of Psychiatrists. We have assured them that, although
we are determined to close the Ruddle loophole, this bill will not encroach
further into territory where the MacLean and Millan committees are already
at work. That assurance has been strongly welcomed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That outlines the principles of the bill

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ruddle in Carstairs.
Pages 6 and 7 of that judgment make it clear that Mr Ruddle and his doctors
were seeking treatment for what they considered to be his problems. In
their view, treatment was out there somewhere; the problem was that it
was not available in Carstairs. That issue was raised over a period of
years by the medical officer who was responsible for Mr Ruddle. At one
point, the possibility was raised of a transfer to Broadmoor, where it
was considered that there was an appropriate unit for Mr Ruddle's treatment.
That again emphasises the fact that treatment was available, and that the
problem was one of access for Mr Ruddle.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Carstairs hospital did not have the means
to treat Mr Ruddle. Nevertheless, he could have been treated even if that
treatment had to be elsewhere or bought in. It was the lack of available
treatment that led to Mr Ruddle's release, not the fact that he was untreatable.
It is from that perspective, bearing in mind the need for compliance with
the European convention on human rights, that I view the legislation before
us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section 1 proposes to amend the powers
that are available to sheriffs and ministers under section 64 of the Mental
Health (Scotland) Act 1984. It includes a new test of public safety that
must be satisfied when deliberating on the release or continued detention
of restricted patients.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SNP has no problem with that and I
am sure that there is widespread agreement and relief across the chamber
that the bill addresses that point. My concerns, however, are whether the
bill actually tackles the key issue of availability of treatment, because
it seems to be absent, and whether therefore it is compliant with the European
convention on human rights. There is no mention in the bill of any measures
that would ensure that patients have access or the right to access treatment
where that treatment exists. Indeed, there is no real health input into
the bill, which is curious, since in the Ruddle case it seems that it was
a failure in the provision of mental health services rather than the actual
law that led to the appeal and, subsequently, to today's legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The responsible medical officer assigned
to Ruddle had sought for five years to arrange suitable treatment and only
failed to do so because of a lack of resources. The bill is silent on what
mental health resources, if any, will be made available to patients detained
under the new legislation. Will the minister now give an absolute assurance
that where medical treatment is requested and is available, the mental
health authorities will accede to that request?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

legislation. Yet the bill is changing the goalposts for those who were
convicted before 1 September this year. The rules governing appeals and
discharge will be much tighter following the new legislation than they
would have been at the time of such a person's conviction. I seek the reassurance
of the minister that that aspect of section 1 does not amount to a breach
of article 7.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section 1 may further open the bill to
challenge in that it effectively authorises preventive detention. Let us
say that a person suffering from a mental disorder commits an offence and
is dealt with by way of a hospital order; he is then cured of that disorder
and would normally expect to be discharged. The bill means that if the
same person suffers from a second but different mental disorder, he can
be detained if it is deemed that he presents a danger to the public, even
though he had not committed a second offence. The key phrase is "presenting
a danger to the public". That may be considered to be an appropriate way
to proceed when someone has already shown a propensity for violence. We
would probably all agree on that. Again, I seek an assurance from the minister
and an explanation of the advice given on whether that situation, where
someone is detained even though he has effectively served his time and
committed no new offence, is in contravention of article 5 of the ECHR,
which states that everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section 2 amends the Mental Health (Scotland)
Act 1984 by introducing a new right of appeal to the Court of Session against
the decision of a sheriff. I question why that part of the legislation
is to be enacted at some point in the future at the discretion of the minister
and not at the same time as the other sections of the bill. Perhaps a further
explanation could be given.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am also concerned that section 3, in
extending the definition of mental disorder to include personality disorder,
makes it too wide. As has been said, a lot of personality disorders do
not exhibit themselves in aggressive or violent behaviour. Would it not
be appropriate to qualify personality disorder with that kind of phrase
in order to ensure that we do not end up in a situation where people suffering
from any personality disorder feel threatened or vulnerable? We would not
want to cause fear and alarm when it was unnecessary.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the eagerness of the Executive
to tackle the loophole in the law in order to provide protection for public
safety. I regret, however, that the first bill is emergency legislation.
I hope that the extensive advice on the human rights implications has been
taken and I trust that the minister will be able to provide the specific
reassurances that I have asked for.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>My party will certainly support the bill and ease its way as far as
possible. That does not mean that we have no reservations. I give notice
that we will almost certainly lodge several amendments that could be taken,
in Westminster terms, as probing amendments. However, our main aim will
be to clarify and give backing to the bill as it goes through.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why do we need the bill? Our belief is
that the law is about the protection of the public first and foremost.
People must have confidence in the law. There have been far too many incidents
where public confidence has been lost and where we could say that people
have taken the law into their own hands: for example, the situation last
week with an Aberdeen farmer, or in Kilmarnock a year or two ago when a
man was jailed effectively for protecting his property, and very sadly
a situation in Norfolk where someone has died.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Such incidents all have an effect on the
public perception of the law, and we as politicians are charged with dealing
with that. We look at the technicalities of the law, but there is a role
for lay opinion. Today, many people have spoken who are practised in administering
the legal system. I make no apologies for not being as well equipped as
Lord Hardie or others who have spoken on the detail of the law. The way
of the great legal minds is to interpret, we are told, the intentions of
the politicians. I feel that sometimes the findings in our courts are in
contrast to that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is no doubt that great anxieties
were caused by the release of Mr Ruddle. Although I frequently criticise
them, I would commend the media for that. They may not have got it all
right and they may have been over the top in some of the criticism, but
I think that, with the help of Opposition politicians, they built up a
head of steam that added urgency to how ministers dealt with the situation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Despite all the comments about a fast track
and it always having been the intention of the Executive to bring in something
at the beginning of this parliamentary session, in an article of 26 August
the Lord Advocate said that there was no guarantee that a fast track would
be used. That backs up some of the points made by David McLetchie when
he suggested that there was some confusion between 4 August and today on
the approach to be taken. That was the issue that was addressed in earlier
debate and I will try to focus-as you would expect me to, Mr Reid-on the
bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

bill is in part a stopgap measure to address an urgent need. I welcome
the fact that the members of the Parliament have given it full backing.
We must remember, however, that the MacLean and Millan committees are currently
meeting, and I believe that it is important that the Parliament lays down
the criterion that protection of the public comes first, as the Minister
for Justice has said, and that the committees take that on board in their
findings. When they report, perhaps there will be a need to get rid of
this bill and provide another; perhaps we can build upon it from what we
learn from MacLean and Millan. I say to them to take regard of the message
coming from Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Parliament has greater difficulties
than Westminster would have in putting through a bill such as this, because
the European Court of Human Rights is far more restrictive in regard to
legislation than at Westminster. There, legislation can be progressed and
ultimately be compared against the implications of the European Court of
Human Rights' findings.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Regarding the bill itself, I have concerns
over some points. Proposed subsection (A1), in section 1 of the bill, states
that an appeal shall be refused:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"in order to protect the public from serious
harm".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is serious harm? Can it be defined?
Will this in future create another confusion in the mind of a sheriff?
I would like clarification on that, if not today, in the debates that follow
next week.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The burden of proof lies with the Scottish
ministers. Who will they rely upon to provide the evidence for that burden
of proof? I suspect that they will rely upon those with medical knowledge,
and perhaps those employed at Carstairs, if a situation like the Ruddle
case develops again. However, there may be some need for an independent
medical mind to be brought to bear on this matter, so next week we will
be seeking further clarification on whom the ministers will obtain information
from.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A possible fundamental measure could be
a return to a situation that existed before the 1984 act was enacted, when
secretaries of state took decisions on the release of individuals like
Mr Ruddle from Carstairs and other institutions without reference to the
courts. There may be some merit in re-examining that situation. It may
contravene the European convention on human rights, but I feel that, given
that the public wrath in the Ruddle case was turned against ministers and
not against the sheriff, there is some merit in recognising that if ministers
are to be the fall guys, they should take responsibility. Perhaps they
are in a position to judge who should come out of institutions like Carstairs.

that we cut across the ECHR, because that would cut across the premise
upon which this Parliament is built. I said that it would be totally dependent
upon the link to the ECHR. In this case, I am suggesting that the courts
have already made a judgment in determining where an individual should
go, and to what extent a crime has been committed, and on that point there
may be a case for a minister taking a decision on the ultimate in public
protection. However, I repeat the point that this measure is one for debate.
We will make the proposal, and it will be up to others in this Parliament

believe he should have been. After the death of that child the community
was desperate for reassurance on the safety of its children. It welcomed
the measures that were introduced in the Crime and Punishment (Scotland)
Act 1997 and in the Sex Offenders Act 1997 to restrict the liberty of sex
offenders. I believe that it will also welcome the principle of this bill,
in making public safety adequate grounds for continuing detention, in order

law was to protect the public. That is true as far as it goes, and it is
a major duty, but the first duty of this Parliament is to protect the liberty
and the safety of the public. We should have particular concern for liberty.
There has been some suggestion that the European convention on human rights
is some sort of inconvenient addition to the hoops through which we have
to go in this matter. I welcome the fact that the European convention is
now effectively incorporated into Scots law; it is an intrinsic part of
our domestic law and this Parliament has to have regard to that. We should
be looking to deal with the spirit and the letter of the convention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When Mr Wallace referred to the bodies
that he had consulted, I did not hear whether he had consulted anyone in
the human rights field outside the Executive-the Scottish Human Rights
Forum and Professor Alan Miller, for example, who are experts in this matter.
I seek an assurance that people outside the Government who have expertise
and who may take a critical view will be consulted, if they have not been
already. It is important that the Executive sets a standard in this matter
that will be followed in future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The point has been made that most people
with mental illness are not a danger to anyone. That is an important, because,
in dealing with people at the extreme end of the spectrum, we do not want
to create human rights problems for others who may or may not be a nuisance
to the public.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to consider how personality disorder
is defined. There is no definition of it in this amending bill and I am
not certain that there is one in the original Mental Health Act (Scotland)
1984. We should consider closely what the phrase covers and exactly what
we intend to deal with.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Roseanna Cunningham mentioned treatment.
The availability of treatment is one side of the coin, but another question
is whether treatment is compulsory. In professional practice, I came across
the disturbing results of people being treated with psychotic drugs. As
an unpleasant side effect of those drugs, they ended up suffering from
a problem called tardive dyskinesia, which is a sort of spasticity. It
is important that we consider the fact that people who are detained under
mental health legislation to some extent have their rights taken away.
We must ensure that we strike the right balance in determining how they
are dealt with under those semi-custodial arrangements.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those are all major issues and we must
get the balance right. Some good points have been made in the debate and

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>A number of members have highlighted the importance of public
safety. That is reflected by the fact that the minister has chosen to include
public safety in the title of the bill. However, we must ensure that we
achieve a balance between public safety and the human rights of the individual.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The bill is a major departure from the
thinking that was current when the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 was
introduced. If we create additional legal measures to detain people in
hospital, it is essential that we provide those people with treatment while
they are in hospital. I recognise that there is considerable tension between
ensuring public safety and protecting the rights of the individual. There
is also considerable tension between assessing risk and maintaining public
confidence. Those may be difficult issues, but it is important that they
are addressed during the bill's passage through Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A number of important issues have been
raised, both in the earlier debate and by several speakers in this one.
One issue was that Mr Noel Ruddle had for some time been recommended for
a specific form of treatment, yet did not receive that treatment during
the years in which he was in hospital. There would be a public outcry if
that happened to someone who was waiting for a hip replacement in the Edinburgh
royal infirmary. Too often services provided to those who have a mental
illness are seen as second class and of a lower priority. I hope that the
Minister for Health and Community Care will address that when she sums
up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The role of the responsible medical officer
is essential in the process of ensuring the protection of someone's right
to treatment while they are detained in hospital. In the Noel Ruddle case,
the responsible medical officer seems to have recommended for some time
that Mr Ruddle should be provided with a particular form of treatment.
Is the process whereby the responsible medical officer has to inform formerly
the secretary of state and now the First Minister being adhered to? Is
notice being taken of what the medical officer is stating? I want an assurance
from the minister that the specific form of treatment recommended by the
responsible medical officer will be provided during a person's detention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

establishment for the required treatment. As it has been decided to allow
the Mental Welfare Commission to examine treatment within Carstairs, I
ask the minister to confirm that appropriate resources will be provided
to implement any recommendations that the commission makes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A number of members have raised concerns
about the definition of personality disorder. The definition is extremely
general in the bill. Does the minister intend the bill to cover all individuals
who have a personality disorder? As has been highlighted, many people who
have a personality disorder pose no risk to society or to themselves. It
is essential that individuals who suffer from a personality disorder do
not find themselves on the wrong side of the law as a result of the powers
in this bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>This
is a sensitive and difficult issue of great complexity. This Parliament
has a number of duties, which it has to meet. We have the clear duty to
have in place legislation that protects the public from those whose mental
disorder-whether it is mental illness, personality disorder or mental handicap-is
manifest in seriously violent and aggressive behaviour. We also have a
duty to ensure that those who have such a mental disorder should be treated
humanely-I will come back to Mr Matheson's point about treatment, which
was well made. We have a duty to ensure that the civil liberties and human
rights of our citizens are protected.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The law has been amended since 1984 with
the introduction of hospital directions, which should deal with the substantial
majority of the problematic cases. As I understand it, the bill is intended
to deal with a small and dangerous minority of mentally disordered patients
who are currently detained in the state hospital and whose release would
pose a danger to public safety.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those patients have hitherto been regarded
as being treated within the state hospital. Their right to appeal under
the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 has existed since the act was passed-the
act gives them a right to an annual appeal. Appeals up to and including
the Reid appeal were turned down on the grounds that the patients were
receiving treatment and that their conditions were regarded as treatable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Since 1984, psychiatry's view of personality

of a regime within the state hospital is no longer a sufficient ground
to constitute treatment, unless that regime can be shown to be beneficial
to the patient and not simply to the protection of public safety.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have no difficulty with the definition
of personality disorder as a mental disorder, but psychiatrists have great
difficulty with it being placed in the category of mental illness, as is
proposed in the bill. However, there is no alternative at this time. Any
other course of action would pre-empt the outcome of the MacLean and Millan
committees, which would be inappropriate. Although I welcome the bill,
I am reassured by the Minister for Justice's assurance that it is an interim
measure and will not preclude the full review by MacLean and Millan.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The definition of what constitutes a mental
disorder is changing, and will continue to change as society's culture
changes. We are dealing not with absolutes, but with things that are culturally
based. I will give members an example. When I was a medical student, the
laws on homosexuality were changing, but the medical profession-and psychiatry-still
regarded it as a treatable medical condition, to which it applied various
pretty horrific therapies. Society has moved on, thank God, and recognised
that homosexuality is not an illness.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Let us hypothesise that somebody discovers
that personality disorders that are manifested in a dangerous, violent
and aggressive form have a genetic basis, and that at some point in the
future gene therapy is able to treat them. At that point, society will
need to amend its laws again to take into account the fact that personality
disorder has become a treatable condition. I am trying to say that we must
make laws for now, and recognise that those laws may need to change.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the bill. It is the appropriate
measure to ensure the protection of the public, which is what this chamber
is trying to achieve. However, the Millan and MacLean committees may choose
to take a somewhat different view. As Mr Gallie suggested, they will have
to examine this matter closely and to recommend that we incorporate into
law adequate public safety measures, while giving absolute assurances that
people with personality disorders, or those who are regarded merely as
odd or difficult, will not be locked up by the state.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am not convinced that this legislation
is not driven by incompetence in the handling of the Ruddle case. Section
1 of the bill refers to medical treatment. I hope that, as a result of
this legislation, which is subject to amendment, people who are placed
in Carstairs are not denied medical treatment. Let us make this clear:
Ruddle was treatable, he simply did not get treatment. I hope that the
minister will listen to that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would like an answer from the Lord Advocate
on Dr White's role in the case, which has been mentioned. In April 1998,
Dr White came back to Carstairs to find that the medical sub-committee
had informed Ruddle of its decision that he should be discharged. Dr White
was at first opposed to that, because he had been trying-unsuccessfully-to
get the man treated for five years, in the face of resistance from the
regime at Carstairs. He then changed his mind. It is my understanding that
he did so on the legal advice of the office of the Secretary of State for
Scotland. I would like to know whether that was the case. Ruddle was able
to exploit what is euphemistically called a loophole in the legislation.
He would not have been able to do anything if he had been receiving treatment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would have raised a second point if I
had been allowed to intervene earlier. Although I welcome the retention
of the conditional discharge-a halfway house-I would like to know whether,
during the hearing on the Ruddle case, Mr Ruddle's legal team made any
offer of a conditional discharge to settle the matter, and whether that
offer was rejected out of hand by the Crown.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the right of appeal both ways-that
is essential to create a balance. I also welcome what has been said about
the rights of an individual who is placed in an institution such as Carstairs;
either people need treatment and should be in an institution, or they should
be in prison. In too many cases, the reverse is true: we have people with
mental health problems in prison, and people who appear not to have mental
health problems-because they obtain discharge-in Carstairs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Generally, the legislation is to be welcomed.
I know that the SNP is considering amendments to the bill to protect rights
all round. No doubt that will be addressed later.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Gordon Jackson (Glasgow Govan) (Lab):
</strong>I, too, welcome this bill in principle. I do so for a number of reasons.
First, it is an appropriate and prompt response to an issue of public safety.
We all agree that public safety is of great importance. More important,
the bill begins to tackle something that has needed to be tackled for a
long time. We are beginning to address how the law and the courts deal
with mental health issues and, in particular, with mentally disordered
offenders.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is fair to say that the way in which
we have tended to deal with people who are mentally disordered has been
something of a disgrace. Part of the problem has been that when psychiatrists
and the courts have applied the law, they have been speaking different
languages-there has been no meeting of minds. Richard Simpson is right:
psychiatrists have moved on. Sometimes I think that they have moved on
towards the next century, while the courts are still trying-on this issue-to
get out of the last century. This is not simply a technical matter; on
occasions, it has caused real injustice, as proper disposals have not been
granted and cases have not been properly dealt with.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This, then, is a step in the right direction.
I very much welcome the minister's assurance that the bill is an interim
measure. The problem is difficult, as the Lord Advocate acknowledged-plugging
this so-called loophole is not easy-and it is particularly difficult to
deal with in isolation. I agree with what was said about the obvious dangers
of emergency legislation. The danger with this legislation is that in trying
to solve one problem we will create others; we risk closing one door, but
opening others.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I must be totally frank: I am not particularly
happy with parts of the bill. Like Richard Simpson, I have concerns about
section 3. The idea that we, as legislators, can declare something to be
a mental illness is not one with which I find myself entirely comfortable.
It may be that, in due course, we will find better ways of solving this
problem. However-and this is the important point-we must look for those
better ways not in isolation, but in the context of dealing with the whole
subject. It is important that we, as a Parliament, examine the&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):
</strong>As I said before, the problem has been on-going in jurisprudence and
psychiatry for 40 years. The tragedy is that, through the incompetence
and delay of the Executive and the previous Administration, we have to
rush this legislation through. As Margaret Ewing said, piecemeal and hastily
drafted legislation is a recipe for disaster. We are left with no option
but to support the bill but we must flag up some problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have to recognise that Europe is a governmental
power. The bill addresses an aspect of Scottish law but our law has been
irrevocably changed by the European convention on human rights. The bill
is, to some extent, pass&eacute;. We are assured that the bill recognises
the convention. I hope it does but I have my doubts. I have been informed
that appeals can be made under article 8 of the convention, on the basis
that the hospital in Carstairs is a considerable distance from people's
relatives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The bill does not address two underlying
problems. It deals with people who are in the state hospital at Carstairs.
It does not deal with psychopaths or people with personality disorders.
I share the reservations expressed by many members on how we define personality
disorders. The bill does not amend section 17 of the Mental Health (Scotland)
Act 1984, which outlines the criteria by which people in civil and criminal
matters are admitted into institutions; it deals with section 1. It is
designed to stop people with personality disorders getting out of Carstairs;
it does not stop people walking out of prison at the end of their sentence,
nor would it deal with Mr Ruddle, should he choose to return to Scotland.
We are dealing with the detention of those who are in Carstairs, not personality
problems. That is a fundamental flaw in the bill, although the MacLean
committee might address it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Michael Matheson touched on the lack of
resources that are available to deal with personality disorders. As Christine
Grahame remarked, treatment for alcoholism would have helped Ruddle. His
personality disorder was exacerbated by alcohol and drugs, which created
the paranoid schizophrenia from which he suffered. Why was the alcohol
unit at Carstairs&nbsp;</font></td>

1996? Perhaps the Tories can answer that. I hope that whoever sums up for
the Executive will say when that unit will be reopened.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The clearest critique of the bill is provided
by the research note "Mentally Disordered Offenders in Scotland", which
was produced by the Parliament's information centre. Page 4 details research
from 1997. I understand that the research indicates that around 50 per
cent of people who are patients of, or remanded in, Carstairs need not
be there as they are not a danger. They should be helped in another way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The document says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Health Boards have a responsibility to
develop integrated and multi-disciplinary assessment, treatment and rehabilitation
of mentally disordered offenders. Where possible, emphasis should be placed
on the local level for provision of secure environments for the treatment
(or rehabilitation) of offenders."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Note that it recommends a local level,
not the state hospital at Carstairs. It continues:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Four or five such units should be established
across Scotland (including those that already exist at Perth and Aberdeen).
Services could be provided on a 'supra-board' level, with occupational
therapists, clinical psychologists and social work input. Health Boards
should, in future, become more closely involved in monitoring the progress
of patients from their areas who are accepted into the State Hospital.
Overall the recommendations emphasise that the 'right kind of secure hospital
facilities will reduce pressure on the State Hospital'".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Given that that information was available
in 1997 and that this legislation has been rushed through in a few weeks,
what extra resources has the Executive provided outwith Carstairs? What
additional resources have been put into Carstairs? If no additional resources
have been provided, why have they not? This bill shuts the door for some
and fails to address a fundamental problem: it does not lay down how to
deal with people who have dangerous personality disorders and it provides
no resources to help those people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know how concerned Mr Wallace will be
about knee-jerk reactions, so I will try not to provide him with one today.
However, as has been said elsewhere-and as Westminster parliamentarians
will remember-inevitably we worry about the effectiveness of any legislation
that is hastily conceived and executed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It became obvious at an early stage that
the public had grave reservations about the future of Noel Ruddle. The
minister had an unambiguous responsibility to allay public concern. The
changes that are proposed in the bill are to be welcomed in so far as they
are interim measures. That said, we support the bill and what it seeks
to achieve.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the speeches that have been made
by members of all parties, particularly that of Christine Grahame about
conditional discharge. Mr Ruddle was released despite being unable to deal
with the changes that had taken place while he was in hospital. At the
end of a prison sentence, there is a programme of training for freedom.
That might have helped Mr Ruddle, and it is to his credit that he has voluntarily
sought psychiatric help.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive's proposal to put consideration
of public safety above any treatability test is to be welcomed. The situation
that meant that, irrespective of public safety, those deemed as untreatable
had to be released, had to be reversed. Some might suggest that the proposal
has severe implications for civil liberties. The Conservative party has
always been concerned about civil liberties, the most important of which,
of course, is to be free from crime and the distress that it causes. Once
that liberty is taken into consideration, others might pale into insignificance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I ask the minister to expand his definition
of treatment. Does he believe that someone's condition has to be curable
in order for them to receive treatment? Does he accept that a person with
a condition that has been classified as incurable should receive treatment
to help manage their disorder? If so, will he consider giving those with
so-called untreatable disorders, who have been detained on the ground of
public safety, a right to treatment that will help them manage, control
and cope with their disorder? Does he agree that to deny that right would
have severe moral implications? Does he further agree that no matter how
much effort is put into framing laws, there is always likely to be at least
one case that will lead to the discovery of yet another loophole? Does
he consider that in such circumstances, the loophole must be closed as
quickly as possible?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is no doubt that this case has raised
serious legal issues regarding the ability of our laws to protect the public
from violent, mentally disordered and sexual offenders. Those legal issues
have been well aired over the past few weeks, but little attention has
been paid to the medical issues raised by the Ruddle affair; I feel that
that is reflected in the bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Since 2 August, there have been only two
Executive statements on the health implications of the case, leaving many
questions unanswered. For example, it seems incredible that there has been
no serious health input with regard to the lack of appropriate treatment
for Mr Ruddle in the state mental hospital. We have had no information
on the treatment and practice at Carstairs from the health minister, Susan
Deacon, or from her deputy, Iain Gray, who is summing up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, we do know that treatment for
severe personality disorder was available-it was just not available at
Carstairs. As a result, we have released into the community, without supervision,
a man who has proved to be a violent and dangerous individual. Can Mr Gray
tell us what provisions he intends to put in place to ensure that such
treatment will now be available when and where the need is identified?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Given that since 1994, Ruddle's responsible
medical officer considered him treatable, but could not gain access to
the appropriate treatment or therapy for his patient, will Mr Gray give
his reaction to what seems to amount to a complete failure of the system
to support the psychiatrist who was responsible for Ruddle's treatment?
Even if we close the legal loophole that allowed Ruddle to be released,
it is imperative that we ensure that people with severe personality disorders
will in future have access to appropriate, effective treatment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of personality disorder. Will Mr Gray give a commitment that further research
into professional understanding and use of that diagnosis will be undertaken?
Personality disorder must not become a catch-all title, beneath which all
forms of medical disorder can be conveniently placed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those are just some of the health issues
that have emerged from the case. However, I fear that those concerns are
merely the tip of the iceberg, particularly when we consider patient discharge
procedures and the subsequent supervision of patients in the community.
As a matter of urgency, will Mr Gray initiate a review of those issues,
which is crucial for public safety and to reassure victims and their families?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For weeks we have been deafened by the
sound of dragging feet by the Executive on the Ruddle case. In the eyes

that have been raised will not be dealt with today, but I will return to
how they will be dealt with later.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It could have been so much worse. If we
had listened to those-and to be fair, most of them are not in the chamber-who
insisted that we should do six impossible, probably unlawful, things before
breakfast, to keep Noel Ruddle in detention, while we recalled Parliament
by lunchtime and legislated before tea, we would have risked tears at bedtime.
We would have faced legislation so hasty that it might have been struck
down on its first application. Of equal importance, we would have compromised
the on-going work to modernise our mental health legislation in a right
and proper manner.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By contrast, I recap some of the essential
points of the emergency bill. First, it is a short bill with a clearly
defined purpose-public safety. Secondly, it will introduce practical and
immediate steps to close the loophole exposed by the Ruddle case. Thirdly,
the protections that are essential to an approach based on the European
convention on human rights are there; I am happy to assure members who
have asked, that the legislation has been fully considered against the
convention, including articles 7 and 5. Our view is that the legislation
meets the requirements of the convention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In that context, several members referred
to the therapeutic regime in the state hospital. It is true that the sheriff
criticised that regime. That is why, on 2 August when that judgment became
available to me, my officials and I began to look at the best way to respond
to those criticisms. It was decided that we should ask the Mental Welfare
Commission to look into the Ruddle case. As members know, we did that.
Its report will inform our response to those criticisms. The judgment was
made that Ruddle's condition was not treatable. That was the opinion of
Ruddle's responsible medical officer at that time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Fourthly, this legislation bites as of
yesterday. It will therefore apply to all future appeals in the sheriff
court against continuing detention of a restricted patient. A question
has been raised about the difference in timing of the different sections
of the bill; I reassure members that the difference in timing for the appeal
provision is to allow the Court of Session appeals procedures to be put
in place. We expect that to be a matter of days rather than weeks.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Deputy Minister for Community Care,
I strongly endorse the need to act in this way to prevent serious harm
to the public by the small group of patients who will be affected by the
legislation. I am happy to give the assurance that has been sought by several
members, that the legislation will apply only to those who have a&nbsp;</font></td>

lives. It is important to recognise-I welcome Robert Brown's intervention
on this-that most people who suffer a mental illness are no danger to the
public. The mental health framework that was launched in September 1997
is modernising the services. The mental illness specific grant invests
&pound;18 million per year in improving those services. A few weeks ago,
I announced a further &pound;2 million for the mental health development
fund. In answer to Mr MacAskill's question, I can say that forensic psychiatric
services-two in Glasgow, one in Edinburgh and others around Scotland-are
being developed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Not only do one in four of us, at
some time in our lives, need to have confidence in those services; so do
the hundreds of staff in many different professions who undertake difficult
work on our behalf. I thank Karen Gillon and Lewis Macdonald for their
interventions that reminded us of that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 1984 act is the legal framework for
all those services. That framework cannot be determined solely by the tip
of the mental health iceberg-the conjunction of disordered personality
and acute violence-and this legislation will not do that. The Millan committee
will be allowed to complete its work; it will be informed by Lord MacLean's
committee on violent offenders. The legislation that follows their recommendations
will be afforded the full normal scrutiny of the Parliament and its committees.
We have given that assurance to bodies such as the Law Society of Scotland
and the Scottish Association for Mental Health. Jim Wallace repeated that
assurance today, and I am happy to do so one more time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>1. Michael Russell (South of Scotland)
(SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it still endorses the
contents of "The Scotland Bill: A Guide", published by the Scottish Office
in December 1997. (S10-203)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister (Mr Donald Dewar):</strong>
As Mike Russell has said, the guide was published in 1997 and was an accurate
description of the Scotland Bill and of how the white paper proposals were
being translated into legislative form. The process, which was completed
with the passing of the Scotland Act 1998, was widely welcomed in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>I thank the First
Minister for his reply. Indeed the guide was widely welcomed, particularly
the section on the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. Will
the First Minister advise his colleagues at Westminster-particularly Mr
Brian Donohoe, with whom I am having a series of tedious media debates
about the issue-that section 19 of the document says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The Parliament will have the power to
debate both devolved and reserved matters".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As that statement from the First Minister-and
from his previous incarnation as Secretary of State for Scotland-seems
definitive, let us hope that, as far as this Parliament and Mr Donohoe
are concerned, the matter is at an end. [<i>Applause</i>.]</font></td>

</strong>Some applause is rather easily earned.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>The First Minister
may also have some applause if he answers properly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister:</strong> I have made
it clear on many occasions that the first priority of this Parliament is
to deal with the areas that are devolved to it, which are its responsibilities
and its duties. I am very sorry to hear that Mike Russell is involved in
tedious public debates, but I am not surprised, as I understand that the
Scottish National party is committed to the principle that it should oppose
everything and propose nothing. I suggest that a solution to the problem
would be for him to desist in the debate, which would also be widely welcomed
in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>2. Mr Duncan McNeil (Greenock and Inverclyde)
(Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will congratulate Inverclyde
Council and its partners on the staging of the recent tall ships event
in Greenock. (S1O-204)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Children and Education
(Mr Sam Galbraith): </strong>Yes, we would like to congratulate Inverclyde Council
and everyone involved in making the event a huge success.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McNeil: </strong>The event was such a
success that we made a video and there is a free copy for Sam at the end
of question time. For everyone else, it costs &pound;11.99 from Inverclyde
District Council.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Does the Executive recognise that while
event-based tourism such as the tall ships race boosts an area's image,
confidence and self-esteem, long-term gains can be achieved only by supporting
the Invest in Inverclyde campaign that seeks to deliver significant benefits
by improving infrastructure and by sustainably developing tourism? Such
measures allow areas such as Greenock to overcome serious problems that
arise from the demise of heavy industry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>I am grateful to the
member for his comments. I think I am answering this question on two dubious
pretexts: first, that because boats and sailing are involved, the issue
is related to sport; secondly, that I come from Greenock, which is where
the event was held.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is no doubt that, when we seek to
regenerate and revitalise areas, we have to consider the broad spectrum
of available tools, one of which is large sporting events. I want to congratulate
not just Inverclyde Council on its outstanding work on the event, but Shetland
Islands Council, which saw the next leg of the race. My heartiest congratulations
go to both for taking a wide view of their responsibilities and of the
way to push their areas forward.</font></td>
