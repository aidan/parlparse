<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Ms Patricia
Ferguson):</strong> We will now move on to the debate on motion S1M-39, in the
name of Henry McLeish, on the consultative steering group report. The debate
should conclude at around 12:20 pm and, while I do not intend to impose
time limits on members' speeches, I might review the position later on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">10:56</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning (Henry McLeish):</strong> As the former chairman of the consultative
steering group on the Scottish Parliament, I am pleased to move the motion
this morning but I am no more equipped to talk on the CSG recommendations
than others who are present: the Deputy First Minister was a member of
the group, as was other Deputy Presiding Officer, Mr Reid. I do not know
if it is a convention of the chamber to refer to other parts of the building
but we have other members of the group with us as well.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have an hour and a half to discuss some
important business and, if possible, we should concentrate on the principles
that underpin the motion before us. I also want to explain where we are
in relation to the report and its suggestions. It is important that we
acknowledge the tremendous groundwork that the CSG laid in creating a vision
of a modern and accessible Parliament and endorse the four key principles
that are at the root of the group's recommendations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first principle is that power should
be shared between the Parliament, the Executive and the people of Scotland.
That is what all the parties championed throughout the election campaign
and it is becoming a reality.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second principle is that the Executive
should be accountable to the Parliament and the Parliament to the people
of Scotland. After the previous weeks, I have no doubt that that is happening.
The Executive will be much more accountable to the Parliament in Scotland
than the Government is to the Parliament in Westminster. We all support
that and want to work to ensure that it is a success. The Parliament has
substantial powers, something which I support, and I am sure that those
powers will be exercised responsibly and that the partnership of the people,
the Executive and the Parliament can march forward together.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):
</strong>As the minister knows, I welcome most of the recommendations in the
CSG report. With regard to parliamentary accountability, am I right in
thinking that the CSG intended that there should&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">be an ability specifically
to question the First Minister? Can Henry McLeish enlighten the chamber
as to whether that would be done at open question time, or whether there
would be the highly desirable possibility of the First Minister facing
questions, not just from the Leader of the Opposition, but from any member?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>That all ministers,
including the First Minister, should be fully accountable to the Parliament
is in the spirit of the CSG recommendations and concurs with Alex Salmond's
comments. I hope that that will be the case in question time, which will
run from next week. The important point is that we have suggested the initial
set-up. I hope that we will review that in co-operation with other parties,
because no one wants to run away from their responsibilities. Alex Salmond
is absolutely right: a place in the new Scottish Executive carries enormous
responsibilities. I hope that all members will be able to question not
only the First Minister, but all members of the Executive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The third principle at the root of the
CSG's recommendations is that the Parliament should be open, accessible
and participative. Looking around the chamber, it is encouraging to see
that people are looking in on what we are doing. Again, we are marching
forward from what happens at Westminster. That is a serious indication
about our ability to be open, accessible, and, as the debate unfolds, to
have the maximum number of people participating in the policy and work
of the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The fourth principle is that, in its operation,
the Parliament should embrace equal opportunities for all. I take very
seriously the point made by Alex Salmond yesterday; people from ethnic
minority backgrounds participated in the election campaign, but none was
successful in becoming an MSP. Obviously, we must examine that carefully,
because there is no point in embracing the idea of an inclusive Scottish
Parliament if people from every walk of life and every ethnic background
cannot participate in the work that we are doing. Ideas such as that of
Alex Salmond should be given serious consideration in the work of the committees
and the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Reflecting on the last four weeks and on
the spirit of the CSG, it is clear that there have been some tough times,
some tensions and some ill-tempered debate. We should all look back, briefly,
on the 100 years since the campaign for the Scottish Parliament began.
Over the short space of four weeks, that campaign is fast becoming a reality;
every MSP should take some credit for that. In terms of the quality and
tone of the debates, we have a long way to go. However, as we establish
ourselves, we should consider how much we have achieved over the past few
weeks,&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">even if, at times,
that is not always obvious.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not think that I am being over-optimistic
when I say that all the principles that I have detailed this morning are
acceptable to every member. They are fine principles and the CSG has managed
to transform them into sensible recommendations for our working practices.
They are the foundation of many of the ideas for Scottish parliamentary
practice, which have so captured the imagination of the wider public. Again,
I refer to some of the opinion polls that have been taken. When taking
over such a huge responsibility, we are all slightly apprehensive. Although
there is a long way to go, it seems that initial indications from members
of the public suggest that they like what they see. Once more, that should
spur us to continue to march forward with the new politics.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How do the CSG recommendations fit into
the wider context of our work? First, the main thrust of the group's recommendations
was turned into transitional standing orders-under which we are currently
operating-that answer a concrete concern shared by us all. Secondly, other
CSG recommendations related to the practical aspects of implementing the
parliamentary project, such as the establishment of the education centre,
and those are currently being developed by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate
Body.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have the standing orders, the practical
ideas that are being developed and, of course, there are other detailed
recommendations from the expert panels that advised the CSG, which will
be taken forward separately in the coming months. An example of that is
the regulation of members' interests; the CSG recommendation is reflected
in an interim transitional order, which will apply until the Parliament
considers how it wants to regulate the conduct of members in the long term.
That important matter will be debated in the near future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Over the past few years, there has been
a wide-ranging debate about how members conduct themselves in-and outside-Parliament.
We want to be an exemplary Parliament, and to show the rest of the world
that we have the highest degrees of probity and standards. This chamber
will consider that matter, although, at present, we are working to transitional
orders that were set down by Westminster as part of the transition process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Similarly, the recommendations of the financial
issues advisory group will be discussed in detail when the Parliament considers
the financial procedures that it wishes to adopt. An excellent aspect of
the consultative steering group's work was that it ensured that this Parliament
could take decisions. There have clearly been some frustrations that decisions
have been taken by the UK Government in Westminster prior to the&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">establishment of
this Parliament. However, the 129 members of this Parliament will revisit
all those decisions and it should reassure everyone that we will decide
what procedures we will operate within.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The aspirational aspect of the consultative
steering group's work-its commitment to the four key principles-is the
subject of today's debate. By voicing our active endorsement of the consultative
steering group and of the motion, we will voice the Parliament's support
for the ideas that underpin the practical details of daily business.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I mentioned that the extensive consultation
process was one of the most reassuring elements of the work of the consultative
steering group, as it indicated that our deliberations were very much in
line with the aspirations of Scottish society. The process took many forms,
including a written consultation exercise, a series of open forum meetings
and workshops aimed at eliciting the views of groups, such as young people
and those who live in urban, deprived and remote areas, which traditionally
perceived themselves as being marginalised from the decision-making process.
To add to Alex Salmond's point, I cannot overemphasise that, while we have
listened through the consultative steering group, if this is to be a Parliament
for all of Scotland it is imperative that every one of the 129 members
continues to take the idea of consultation on board. If we can recognise
that all of the wisdom of Scotland does not preside in this chamber alone,
that will be a massive and important change in our culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When colleagues note the consultative steering
group's recommendations, they are noting the recommendations of the people
of Scotland for an open, modern and dignified Parliament. In my view, the
three elements of Scotland moving forward together steals a march on Westminster,
and, as we are building on modern European Parliaments, it also gives Scotland
a great chance to do things differently as we enter the new millennium.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I used the word dignified, which relates
not only to the ceremonial aspects of the Parliament, but to the atmosphere
in which we conduct our business. Even in the early weeks of the Parliament,
the quality of debate and of the exchanges between MSPs has been different-I
stress the word different. At times, the debate has been good; at other
times, it has been patchy. However, this is our Parliament, this is our
way of doing things, and I have no doubt that we should take collective
credit for some of the changes. For example, by electing the Presiding
Officer and the First Minister, we have put those posts before the Scottish
Parliament, whereas, in Westminster, the Cabinet does not go before the
Parliament. Such&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">examples are small
but important indications that this Parliament is very different, and reflect
both what the people of Scotland want and the relationship between the
Parliament and the Executive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have a set of standing orders, and,
although there have been some hiccups, they can be ironed out. That reflects
the work of the consultative steering group, which anticipated what we
would want to do and how we would want to do it. Canon Kenyon Wright said
that the Scottish Parliament should be viewed as a relationship rather
than as an institution. I am plagiarising what he said, but it is a good
metaphor, as we should always remember that we are linked to others, and
that it matters to people when we take decisions. Although people may criticise
the Parliament and its budget of &pound;16 billion, one of the important
aspects of devolution is that we have extensive legislative powers and
a huge responsibility. Once the new Scottish Parliament passes an act,
it will have a formidable impact on every one of the 5 million people in
Scotland and on every part of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One area of concern for the consultative
steering group was the creation of a family-friendly environment, keeping
family-friendly hours. I hope that that environment will apply to work
not only in the Parliament but in civic Scotland and in our constituencies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another element of the Parliament, which
was endorsed yesterday, are the massive powers that we will rightly give
to committees. They mean that no one need complain that an Executive is
simply taking decisions on behalf of Scotland; each of the 129 MSPs will
have a significant role in the committee structure. That also was one of
the objectives that the CSG set out.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I believe that the spirit of the CSG was
one of consensus and consultation although, as I said earlier, it does
not often seem as if those two qualities are found in abundance. Nevertheless,
the demonstration of those qualities is an objective that we must set ourselves.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to finish on the issue of civic
participation in our work. I know that young people are concerned about
establishing a youth parliament and that other people want a civic forum
to be established. The Executive, and I hope this Parliament, will warmly
endorse both ideas. Over the next few months, we need to think about how
we can interface with such organisations, how we can help them to get established
and how we can give them concrete support. That will take the process of
consultation and consensus further and will send a very firm message to
the people of Scotland that we want civic Scotland to be involved in our
work. The CSG also identified that objective, and I hope that the Parliament
will&nbsp;</font></td>

it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With those brief remarks, I will open up
this debate on the CSG report to the chamber. I hope that, when we review
the position in perhaps a year's time, we will have been able to bed down
some of the main recommendations of the report. I also hope that we will
have proved to the people of Scotland that this Parliament was worth the
100-year campaign and that they should start to ensure that the Parliament
works for them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I move,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That the Parliament records its appreciation
of the work of the Consultative Steering Group on the Scottish Parliament;
acknowledges the contribution which the Group's Reports have made to the
development of the procedures of the Parliament; and agrees that its operations
should embody the spirit of the CSG key principles.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">11:11</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr George Reid (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(SNP): </strong>This Parliament does not belong to the politicians; ownership
of this Parliament is vested solely in the people of Scotland. The consultative
steering group grasped that fundamental principle. It saw that, in order
to grow a new political culture, how this legislature functions was not
just a matter of striking a balance between the Executive and the Parliament,
but of shared decision making and the empowerment of the Scottish people.
Above all, such a new culture had to involve those people in Scotland who
had been excluded for far too long: women, young people, the one in 10
Scots with a disability, and all our ethnic minorities. As Mr McLeish rightly
said, Parliament is not the sole source of policy development or expertise
and those excluded voices should also be heard.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The CSG saw that participation is the star
by which to steer this Parliament. This morning, some of the group's members
sit in the distinguished visitors' gallery. Their organisations-trade unions,
local authorities, the business community, the Churches and our vibrant
voluntary sector-represent civic Scotland's enduring strength. In the bleak
years after 1979, they were a light in the darkness. In the first referendum,
we Scots were feart; but, in the second referendum, thanks in large part
to those organisations, we had the courage to embark on a process of constitutional
change.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have spoken to my former CSG colleagues
about the first month of the Parliament. One said, "You never get a second
chance to make a first impression." She is pleased with our openness and
informality, but is less happy with some of our inherited Westminster ways.
Mercifully, the recent awkwardities over allowances are now behind us and,
in the weeks leading up to vesting day, I urge members to reflect on the

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr McLeish and
Mr Wallace.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are many questions to answer. How
do we share power with the people of Scotland? How do we devise a participative
form of governance appropriate to the 21st century in a small country with
tight lines of communication? How, at a pre-legislative stage, do we collect
voices; and how, at a post-legislative stage, can we find out how our decisions
are working in practice?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The CSG has produced many models of best
practice that have been culled from the Commonwealth and the European Union.
I have no doubt that our committees will now take off and find a life of
their own. Committees will be able to draw on expert assessors to participate
in and inform their discussions. They will be able to convene their own
citizens panels, and their reporters-called rapporteurs in Europe-will,
as in Europe, be the focal point for minority interests.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue of most concern to civic Scotland
is the establishment of a civic forum. I welcome Mr McLeish's assurance
that the Executive is investigating ways of giving it concrete assistance
and support. The CSG saw the forum as a</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"significant means of achieving an accessible
Parliament within a participative democracy."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All parties, pre-election, endorsed the
concept of the forum, as did the coalition agreement of 14 May. More than
600 organisations from all walks of civic life have now formally registered
an interest. The civic forum will promote participation, facilitate debate
and ensure social partnership. It will be a gateway to the Parliament and
its Executive, not a gate-keeper.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The forum urgently needs a commitment of
resources to establish itself as an independent body, to kick-start its
work programme over the summer months and to enable it to recruit a small
core staff team. High subscription levels will deter participation. Without
some initial support from the Parliament it is difficult to see how the
forum can get going. In his concluding remarks, Mr Wallace may flesh out
what concrete assistance means. Is this a matter solely for the Executive?
As a service to the Parliament, might not the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate
Body and, if we decide to establish one, a committee of conveners be involved
too? Does the minister accept that planning for the forum must start as
soon as possible? Will he consider introducing a three-year package of
core support?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When the CSG report was published, the
Deputy First Minister said that he was passionate for participation. In
his concluding remarks, he can assure the chamber that his passion remains
unabated and is going to be resourced.</font></td>

party is happy to endorse many of the proposals in the CSG report, which
has been presented and forms the basis of today's motion. We think that
it will form an excellent basis for the working of the Parliament. I pay
tribute to all those who were involved in its production and in particular
to Mr McLeish, who took on the onerous task of chairing the group's many
meetings and steered it to a successful conclusion. Although I do not appear
in the title credits, I had the opportunity to come off the substitutes
bench one day to deputise for Paul Cullen, our representative on the CSG,
at one meeting of the CSG. I was warmly welcomed and enjoyed the discussions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This debate provides a timely opportunity
to consider the way in which the Parliament has operated so far. If we
are being honest, it has not lived up to its billing. We heard so much
about the much-vaunted new politics in the run-up to the Scottish elections
that the phrase had become a clich&eacute; even before the Parliament started.
That pales into insignificance when we compare it with the number of times
that the phrase has been invoked in the chamber. It has become the motherhood
and apple pie of Scottish politics.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although I may be struck down for saying
so, new politics has been a complete sham. So far, there has been a deal
cooked up behind the backs of the voters that betrayed Scottish students
on tuition fees, sold out our farmers over beef on the bone and sold our
fishermen doon the watters on the Scottish fisheries issue. There has been
a huge growth in the size of government in Scotland, with 22 ministers,
12 special advisers and a whole retinue costing the Scottish taxpayer some
&pound;5 million. There have been disgraceful attempts by the coalition
to suppress opposition to their cosy deal, whether it be on Short money
or on members' allowances, which we discussed yesterday.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the spirit of consensus politics, I
have come up with a solution to the parity problem, which so engaged us
yesterday. It is really rather simple: Labour and Liberal Democrat members
will take their office allowances in euros; SNP and Conservative members
will take theirs in pounds sterling; and we can rest assured that market
forces will achieve parity in very short order.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some people in this Parliament do not like
plain speaking. However, I prefer to deal in the truth; and, as we all
know, the truth sometimes hurts. The truth, however blunt, is infinitely
preferable to euphemisms such as consensus, co-operation and new politics.
Some people use those words as a mask for blatant political opportunism,
as we have heard on too many occasions in the three weeks or so that this
Parliament has been in&nbsp;</font></td>

politics and of elevating the whole concept of consensus, because it can
be a false god. Consensus politics, if it means the politics of the lowest
common denominator, is no way to take any country or nation forward. It

given us a presentation that referred to honesty. He then referred to council
housing. I hope, therefore, that he will join me in hoping that the courts
in England will not, in dealing with his former friend Mr Aitken, be so
forgiving as they were to his former friend Mr Saunders, who, after being
given a five-year sentence, served only 18 months. Mr Aitken offered a
defence that was remarkable in connection with council housing. He said
that he suffered from severe chronic asthma and therefore should not be
sent down. If that defence were accepted by the district courts in Glasgow,
they would have a hell of a lot of defences offered by people living in
poor, damp council houses and therefore suffering from asthma. Will he
join me in hoping that the justice system in England will hold on to Mr
Aitken for as long as possible to prevent him using such spurious defences
in future?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> Before
Mr McLetchie responds, I remind members that interventions should be about
the substance of the debate-a little more clearly, perhaps, than was Mr
Sheridan's intervention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>That was an interesting
interjection by Mr Sheridan. Mr Aitken has been dealt with by the courts
and no doubt he will serve his sentence. I would reflect that, had Glasgow
council made better use of the receipts from the sale of council houses,
and had it reinvested the money in its housing stock, many of the people
that Mr Sheridan represents would not be suffering from the problems of
poor housing to which his question drew attention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we had had consensus politics, successful
major Scottish companies such as Scottish Power, British Energy and Scottish
Hydro-Electric would still be languishing in the nationalised backwaters

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">this chamber must
be wary that consensus politics, by and large, suits the Government of
the day. Real, democratic politics is about presenting choices to the voters
at elections. We must avoid the situation in which, by worshipping the
false god of consensus, we deny the people the opportunity now and in future
elections to make real choices about their vision of Scottish society and
about the sort of policies that they want pursued by the Scottish Administration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would also like to sound a word of caution
about the implications that consensus politics have for the taxpayer. Worshipping
the god of consensus inevitably leads to a tendency to duck real and difficult
issues about the division of the spending cake. Instead, everyone comes
together in a consensus and says that the solution is to bake a bigger
cake. The ingredients of that cake would be higher spending, higher borrowing,
higher taxes or higher inflation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond:</strong> Can not we make a distinction
between the consultative steering group report, which set out the procedures
of the Parliament and which should be generally welcomed, and the practices
of the coalition Administration, which should be deplored for trying to
seize the Opposition's assets in order to inhibit it? Even as Opposition
parties, we can surely welcome an organisation such as the CSG, which has
tried in a fair-minded manner to set out the terms of debate, while obviously
deploring at the same time the practices of those who try to inhibit opposition.
There are surely aspects of the motion that can be generally welcomed,
even by Opposition parties.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie:</strong> That is absolutely
true, but Mr Salmond was obviously not paying attention to my introductory
remarks. We must be careful not to get so involved in this particular love
affair with consensus that we let the Administration off the hook and allow
people sanctimoniously to invoke the CSG and the phrase new politics, and
all the wrapping that goes with those, to justify their own ends. I am
sure that Mr Salmond will not be deceived by this any more than I will
be in the years ahead in this chamber.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr John Swinney (Tayside North) (SNP):</strong>
I am grateful to Mr McLetchie for giving way. I would like to push him
on a specific point about the use of consensus in this Parliament for pursuing
the objectives of the CSG report. In the last couple of days there has
been a great deal of scrutiny of office costs and allowances issues. There
is a need in this Parliament to extend that scrutiny and consideration
to the work of special advisers and the support that they give to the ministerial
team. Is not that an illustration of how the CSG principles can be extended
to push the boundaries of the CSG report and to bring the Administration
to account as effectively as the Opposition will be&nbsp;</font></td>

in constructive, honest and open politics based on principle. That is a
far better way to proceed. We will bring to this Parliament ideas that
are based on the policies and principles that were set out in our manifesto
and we will seek the support of others to turn those ideas into legislation.
Similarly, if other parties bring forward proposals with which we agree,
we will not hesitate to support them. We judge each idea on its merits
and issue by issue. That is the honest way to conduct politics in this
Parliament. It is a process of constructive engagement between parties,
which we intend to apply.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

The young people felt that they had a role and that their views were being

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I contrast that with my experience at the
recent election. If it does not exist already, there is a threat of there
being increasing disillusionment with the political process among young
people in Scotland. To take forward the remarks made by Mr McLeish, who
has now left, and by George Reid, it is important to reverse that trend.
Our democracy is precious-people fought and died for it and the young must
be included in it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the comments made on page 103
of the CSG report, but we must be wary of right-on, politically correct
ways of approaching such measures. I recommend that ministers consider
a slightly more regionalised and more local model for a youth parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also refer ministers back to page 96
of the report, which states:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"For example, North Lanarkshire Council
considered that a partnership approach between the new Parliament and the
local authorities would have the advantage of allowing for local government
to be used as a means of collecting public opinion."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I strongly suggest to Mr Wallace and Mr
McLeish that they consider sending a message to encourage or even compel
Scottish local authorities to establish a system of youth parliaments the
length and breadth of Scotland. Such a system need not cost a great deal.
The appropriate health boards could join in, as well as any other bodies
that were identified in due course. Ministers would then hear the opinions
of young people, who, let us face it, often know rather more than their
fathers-my children often correct me on many things.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The local authority interface would be
one way of spreading the word and bringing opinions back to the Parliament.

I am horrified at the haphazard, unco-ordinated manner in which vast sums

sums."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Earlier this year, the Scottish Library
Information Council produced a report entitled, "Enabling seamless access:
The case for a national information strategy for Scotland". It may sound
boring, but I urge all members to read it and the Scottish Parliament information
centre's research note 99/8 entitled, "The Parliament's information strategy".
The SLIC report says that, without co-ordination, the continued growth
of separate networks may in the long term prevent the development of the
"seamless access" to information and knowledge that is clearly in the interests
of Scotland's citizens.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The draft information strategy and annexe
J of the CSG report, which deals with information and communication technologies
and democratic participation, give more examples of the need for co-ordination
of a national information strategy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A total of 73 partner libraries in constituencies
throughout the country are now linked with the Parliament library; all
73 are public libraries. The public libraries network, which would allow
constituents access to parliamentary information at the branch library
closest to them, does not yet exist, and it looks increasingly unlikely
that the target date of 2002 for its launch will be met.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Even if such a network were in place, it
must be remembered that the internet is not always the best solution to
people's information needs. Skills are needed to use the technology and
money is needed to pay the charges that most libraries are forced to levy.
If the Government is able to deliver on its promise of an e-mail address

report-accessible, open, responsive and participative-can be fleshed out
and do not remain wishful thinking.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Individuals and many organisations in the
private, public and voluntary sectors have a strong desire for a different
relationship with Government. Many of the structures proposed in the CSG
report will go a long way towards building that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As someone who has worked to implement
information technology for many years, I am excited by the opportunities
contained in the report by the expert panel on information and communications
technologies. I hope that all members have looked at the excellent Scottish
Parliament website; all the information on who members are and what they
think is available to anyone who wishes to look it up, and every word spoken
in the chamber is available on the internet the following day. I agree
with Fiona McLeod that there must be other ways of communicating with people,
but I would point out that some 29 per cent of the adult population have
access to the internet and a further 14 per cent will sign up this year.
Through initiatives such as the national grid for learning and a free e-mail
address for every child, the internet will be increasingly important in
disseminating information.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The opportunities that IT offers to overcome
geographic remoteness are of interest to me. While my constituency is not
especially remote, large parts of Scotland are. One of the CSG proposals
is the development of community media centres and the use of video-conferencing
technology, which will help to implement dialogue and participation between
the Parliament and its committees and Scottish society, a key idea in the
CSG report. For many groups, travelling to give evidence to committees
will always be difficult and expensive, and that could be simply because
of cost, age or disability. Committee meetings outside Edinburgh will always
be only a partial solution to the problem, because there will always be
someone at the other end of the country or someone for whom travelling
on that particular day will be impossible because of winter weather.</font></td>

would be churlish to say other than that the group did a sound and thorough
job in preparing its fairly lengthy report. Most of it, of course, is common
sense, and common sense is the way in which we would wish to run things.
However, David McLetchie was correct to point out that the language used
in the report is indicative of the fact that we are getting far too hung
up on what is euphemistically termed the new politics and political correctness.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is meant by new politics? Of course,
we do not wish unnecessary confrontation, or to have members of this chamber
abusing one another, but all of us were elected as members of political
parties and all of us have differing and sincerely and deeply held political
beliefs. If we cannot argue those beliefs forcefully and determinedly,
we are not being loyal to those beliefs. We can argue without any animosity
at the end of the day. We should bear that in mind. We would do well to
remember that there is nothing wrong with introducing a bit of passion
into politics.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am intrigued by some other aspects of
the report. It states that we should use</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of the report to be of tremendous interest. Clearly, as Henry McLeish said,
this chamber does not have a monopoly on wisdom. Out there, there is a
great deal of untapped knowledge and expertise that Parliament would do
well to seek and utilise. However, there are dangers in doing that, and
when we come to consider our public participation approach, it will be
necessary to do so in such a manner as to separate the wheat from the chaff.
We must ensure that public participation is consistently positive and that
we do not leave ourselves open to cranks and one-issue activists, who would
not, to my mind, be the appropriate people to consult.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the importance of making sure that legislation emanating from this Parliament

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Equal Opportunities Committee will
have a key role in ensuring that that does not happen, but we must do much
more. Alex Salmond said yesterday that we have a Scottish Parliament without

We can go some way towards achieving that, by making sure that the Parliament's

so much difficulty with the concept of direct access to civil servants.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When I served on Glasgow District Council,
there was no problem: we went to see the chief executive or head of department,

did not seem to be any great difficulty in managing that, nor with the
idea of responsibility to the council's executive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also ask Mr Wallace to deal with how
the Executive will approach the mechanisms for dealing with human rights:
for legislation and for its own activities. It is important that the proper
tone is set.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Often, voluntary sector organisations have been grant-funded on the basis
that they should in some way fit into the corporate objectives of either
central or local government, but the voluntary sector and its different
sections have their own criteria and their own priorities, which, in a
pluralist society, are just as valid and should be recognised. It would
be wrong to impose a structure that in any way dampened down the rights
of the voluntary sector.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My final point is on the power of the committees.
They will be extremely important, and the committee chairs, the rapporteurs
and the vice-chairs, if we have them, must take an approach that is separate
and independent from that of the Executive. The members who hold those
positions will be the representatives par excellence of the Parliament,
and it is important that they reflect that in the way in which they operate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The CSG report, as Robin Harper said, is
excellent and a good basis for proceeding. Let us try to have the robust
exchange of views that Bill Aitken and David McLetchie talked about-that
is a valid point-but without recourse to words such as dishonesty and sanctimoniousness,
and other personalised words. If we approach each other in a spirit of
courtesy, it may well be more possible to take on the points made by Opposition
parties and Opposition members.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>I, too, welcome the report. I was pleased to play a small part in it
in my former job with BT Scotland, by co-ordinating the company's response
to the consultation exercise. BT saw it as an important opportunity to
contribute to the new Scotland. In appendix A to annexe D of the report,
many other companies, professional bodies, trade associations, voluntary
sector and local government organisations and individual citizens are listed,
who also contributed their views on how the Parliament should operate.
There is an unprecedented reservoir of good will, good ideas and determination
to create a modern and distinct Parliament and to enhance the democratic
process in Scotland. Given the poor turnout in our elections to the Parliament,
which is likely to be trumped tomorrow in the European elections, we certainly
need that increased participation and involvement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unfortunately, I cannot share all of Mr
McLeish's interpretation of the events of the past few weeks. Unless we
make a positive and determined effort to follow through some of the CSG
recommendations, many of the aspirations for a new and better form of government
in Scotland will not be realised in this term of the Parliament. We have

were told that their role was to be quiet and listen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yesterday's proceedings would be described
by any objective person as immature and by anyone looking for a new Scotland
as deeply depressing. The outcome was an office allowances scheme that
would not stand up to any logical scrutiny. If we continue in that fashion,
rather than encouraging greater participation, we will put people off.
That would be a great pity, given the reservoir of good will, good ideas
and good intentions that has been created.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ultimately, it is up to each of us as individual
parliamentarians to ensure that the work of the CSG is followed through
to action in the Parliament. That places a particular responsibility on
non-Executive members of the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats. During
the coming weeks and months, they must have a greater courage of their
convictions in debates. Abstaining and putting forward ill-conceived compromise
motions will not create a new and better form of government in Scotland.
If all members play a full role in the activities of this Parliament, and
express their own views, we can and will carry out the recommendations
of the CSG report as the people of Scotland want us to.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

shall speak on the section of the CSG report that deals with the sharing
of power and the role of civic society. Paragraph 19 says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The development and implementation of
legislation needs to take account of the diversity which exists across
Scotland. Specifically, we recognise that well intentioned legislation
cannot always be implemented in an Islands context without practical difficulties
arising."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is still concern in areas such as
Shetland that the Parliament will concentrate on the needs of the central
belt, not on those of peripheral, rural and island areas. It is up to the
Parliament to demonstrate that that is not the case and that there are
ways in which peripheral, rural and island areas can be at the heart of
what goes on in here-most importantly, in the committees. We have it in
our hands to choose between a Parliament that is only for the central belt
and one that is for all of Scotland's diverse regions. That is the broad
context in which I enthusiastically welcome the CSG report.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

constitutional convention, representatives of the island areas-Shetland,
Orkney and the Western Isles-have argued constructively for the special
needs of those areas to be recognised. I pay&nbsp;</font></td>

who worked on such bodies as the islands working group of the SCC. Their
ideas are coming to fruition in the CSG report and the standing orders.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Islands representatives have pointed out-right
across the spectrum of policy issues-that they live in a different environment:
a fresh wind in Edinburgh is but a gentle breeze at home in Lerwick. They
have also drawn attention to the problems that we face day in, day out.
A short journey to an out-patient clinic in a Glasgow hospital contrasts
with the experience of someone who lives on Unst, who must take a ferry,
a car, a ferry, a car, a plane and a taxi to get to the middle of Aberdeen,
and must spend two nights away from home.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are differences in perspective and
of practical considerations. Any member here could listen to a representative
of the Hjaltland Housing Association for a spare hour or two, who would
illustrate the problems of trying to make warm and draught-free houses
that are built to a standard Scottish Homes will fund. There are big differences
between the Scottish regions in such practical matters. That is one of
the great strengths and delights of Scotland. The islands are different
and they deserve to be given special consideration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Page 6 of the CSG report says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We recommend that committees engaged in
pre-legislative scrutiny should specifically address the issue of implementation
in Island areas and where appropriate make recommendations for suitable
amendments or derogations."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is a particularly important sentence.
We should ensure that legislation that would not work in the Western Isles,
or which would damage a business in Orkney, is not introduced. Such problems
were recognised by the Scottish constitutional convention, and here we
have the mechanisms to provide practical safeguards for island areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In our representation of issues in the
islands, we do not seek to clog up the business of the Parliament; we seek
to ensure that the interests of those areas will be looked into by the
Parliament as a matter of routine. The simplest way forward would be to
put in place a requirement for each item of legislation to be accompanied
by a memorandum that examines its implications for island areas and proposes
exemptions or special provisions for the islands, if necessary. That is
what I ask the minister to consider in his concluding remarks.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">sector and I am
excited by this morning's debate because it is about finding a new way
of doing things. All of us who campaigned for election to the Scottish
Parliament continually told people that it would be a different kind of
Parliament that would introduce a new politics. Much reference has been
made to new politics; perhaps we all need to learn how that new politics
will operate. It should be about listening and I hope that we can get away
from attacking people all the time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The people in our communities, who are
listening to what is happening in Parliament, want to be listened to. They
want a voice, but they need to know that someone will listen to that voice.
If we ask young people-the people whom Karen Gillon mentioned-about politics,
they will say, "No one is interested, no one is listening and it's not
about me." We have a responsibility to change that attitude. We must do
something about people who feel excluded from the decision-making process
and who feel that no one cares how their lives progress.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The idea of a civic forum is very exciting.
It will give us an opportunity to consider how we can take things forward.
The forum could assist the Parliament with consultations, it could explore
new ways of doing things and it could bring together a wide range of bodies
to examine how power and decision making in the Parliament can be influenced.
The forum could conduct a dialogue across the civic sector in Scotland
and link with other forums.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is vital that the forum should exist.
It would not be a threat to this Parliament; it would be a gateway that
would facilitate the Parliament's work. We should examine how the forum
will be resourced, how it will be established, and how we can support it.
If we are serious about this Parliament being a people's Parliament, we
must have links across Scotland. The Parliament should be more than a meeting
that takes place in Edinburgh.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

soon as possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I shall give some examples. Cannonball
House does not have any form of disabled access. The microphone consoles
that we use have no indication for someone with a visual impairment. The
swipe card points in the building are too high for someone in a wheelchair.
Those are basic issues that could readily be addressed, and I ask that
they be carried out, given that we will be here for at least the next two
years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Should this Parliament decide to move elsewhere,
the new Parliament should be barrier free. Unfortunately, disability is
a social construct; it is society that puts barriers in the way of people
with disabilities. Before we start talking about equal opportunities and
telling other people what to do, we should sort out our own back yard.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">12:08</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy First Minister and Minister
for Justice (Mr Jim Wallace): </strong>This has been a very useful debate. Those
of us who were involved in the consultative steering group were only too
pleased that the debate should take place early in the Parliament so that
we could hear the views of members. All the CSG could do was make recommendations.
Over time, it will fall to the Parliament to flesh out and change those
recommendations where necessary.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although the CSG arrived at a report that
was based on consensus, it is fair to say that, in reaching that consensus,
there was some pretty robust discussion. That gives the lie to the idea
that all consensual agreements are somewhat soggy and are arrived at in
some watery way. It is possible for robust discussion to lead to consensus.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Shona Robison drew attention to the passage
in the report that said that we should not indulge in Westminster-style
point scoring. Therefore, if I say no more about David McLetchie's speech,
I am sure that members will understand.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some very important remarks have been made
and it is vital that this Parliament should, at the earliest opportunity,
affirm the key principles of the report. Mr McLeish reminded us of them:
power should be shared between the Parliament, the Executive and the people
of Scotland; the Executive should be accountable to the Parliament, and
the Parliament to the people; the Parliament should be open, accessible
and participative; and its operations should embrace equal opportunities
for all. A number of comments reflecting on those key principles have been
made during the debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

those important comments on access and facilities for people with disabilities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Substance is already being given to the
consultative steering group's recommendations on equal opportunities by
the fact that we will have an Equal Opportunities Committee. It will be
up to that committee to organise itself, but it could, if it wanted to,
appoint a number of special advisers from ethnic communities or other groups
where there was felt to be a need for equal opportunities. The committee
could also establish a panel of experts to assist it. There are imaginative
and innovative ways in which the bones of the CSG principles can be given
more substance, particularly as the committees get down to work.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many of the CSG recommendations are already
in operation. We have electronic voting, which we now take for granted,
although those of us brought up in the Westminster tradition find it a
revolution and far simpler and speedier than what happens in Westminster.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tavish Scott mentioned island communities.
Rule 9.3.3 of the standing orders says that the policy memorandum that
the Executive will be obliged to supply along with a bill must assess the
effects of the bill on, among other things, equal opportunities and island
communities. It will then be for the committee to assess that policy memorandum.
It will also have to address how a particular piece of legislation will
impact on an island community.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I point out to Robert Brown that the policy
memorandum must also include the human rights aspect of any piece of legislation.
I remind members that, from 1 July when we obtain our full powers, the
legislation says that the European convention on human rights must underpin
everything we do-all policies and all the legislation passed by this Parliament
must comply with the convention. It is almost a foundation stone of our
new constitutional settlement that human rights will be part and parcel
of what we do.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>Will the Deputy First
Minister confirm that the European convention on human rights also applies
to legislation passed in the Westminster Parliament which, as we heard
earlier, also impacts on devolved legislation? I am thinking of the Immigration
and Asylum Bill, for example.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>The impact of the European

participation is key to the way in which this Parliament operates. A monopoly

Stone that the youth parliament will hold a meeting at Murrayfield on 30
June, at which I am sure members will be welcome.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My colleague, Mr McLeish, wrote to all
local authorities earlier this year expressing support for the youth parliament
and inviting them to consider ways in which they could interact with the
voice of young people at a local level. Mr Stone and, I think, Karen Gillon
talked about the importance of involving our young people. There will be
opportunities at a national level to do that and local authorities will
be encouraged to follow good practice and get young people involved at
a local level. Information is the currency of any informed debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Why can the Parliament not go on into the evening? Why can we not make
full use of working time on that day? Only nine constituencies fall within
the category 1 formula used in yesterday's debate. An extended debate on
Wednesday evenings would be of great use to members from outlying areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>Mr Gallie will recognise
that the CSG gave much consideration to this matter. There was a consensus
on working hours, both across the parties and among those who belonged
to no party. I cannot get home at 5.30 pm on a Wednesday. Even if we rose
at 4.30 pm I could not get home that night and be back here the following
morning. For many people there will be the opportunity to get back home,
and it is important that that opportunity is taken. There is provision
for meeting late if the need arises.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It has already been pointed out that a
commitment to the civic forum appears not only in the CSG report, but in
the partnership agreement. Mr Reid raised an interesting point about the
Parliament, not simply the Executive, being involved. I would be happy
for Executive officials to explore with the parliamentary authorities how
the Parliament might interact with the civic forum and, through the Scottish
Parliamentary Corporate Body, whether the relationship is workable or appropriate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With regard to funding, we hope that we
can channel encouragement into concrete assistance and support for the
civic forum. I cannot commit the Executive to a particular level or pattern
of funding at this stage because, as Mr Reid knows, there is some difficulty
with regard to statutory authority, or lack of it. However, I am sure that
over the months ahead we will want to discuss how we can give substance
to the idea of the civic forum, which is widely supported across the parties.

project. I remind everyone that responsibility for the Holyrood project
passed on 1 June from the Executive to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate
Body.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The corporate body, which has five members
who were elected by MSPs, has held its first meeting. The corporate body
is answerable to members for the project and is responsible for it in law.
Members of the corporate body are, in effect, the clients of the project.
For that reason, we will discuss the implications of the project with the
architect and the project team this afternoon. We have instructed that
no further works contracts should be signed in the next 10 days, which
is the maximum period for which we can make such an arrangement without
penalty. That gives us time to discuss the whole matter further.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am arranging for the full paper that
the corporate body has already discussed to be available to all members
this afternoon. I also hope to arrange a series of informal seminars-at
least two, and possibly three-to allow members to ask the project team
questions. The seminars will take place next week, before we debate the
matter. They will be chaired by the Deputy Presiding Officers. Details
will be announced in the business bulletin.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We in the corporate body are conscious
of the fact that, although we are responsible for the project, we are answerable
to the whole of this Parliament and that the Parliament must give us instructions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am grateful to the Business Manager for
proposing a rearrangement of next week's business to allow the Parliament
to take a fundamental decision on the Holyrood project in time, without
incurring any penalties on the contract.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that what I have said clarifies
the position and that it has been helpful to all members.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The question is, that motion S1M-44, in
the name of Tom McCabe, be agreed to.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
