Officer: </strong>Margaret, you must finish.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mrs Smith: </strong>One other point that
I must make on behalf of the taxpayers of Edinburgh is that all members
would give their eye-teeth to have the Parliament sited in their constituency.
We should listen to Andrew Wilson and take the Parliament round the cities
and towns of Scotland. We must not leave it to the taxpayers and the councillors
of Edinburgh to find the funding to put in place the transport to get people
to the Parliament, otherwise the Parliament will suffer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Margaret Jamieson (Kilmarnock and Loudoun)
(Lab): </strong>I took the opportunity on Tuesday to be briefed by the architectural
and client teams involved with the Holyrood project. I went to that briefing
with an open mind and came away determined that the way forward would be
to vote for the continuation of the project. That view is supported by
a constituent of mine in this week's issue of the <i>Kilmarnock Standard</i>.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The briefing enlightened the attending
MSPs about the reasons for the cost increase, which were identified as
an increase in circulation space for the movement of people; the provision
of appropriate accommodation and facilities for all those working in, or
visiting, the Parliament; the cost of meeting fully the requirements of
disability legislation; taking account of the best currently available
building standards; and anticipating future improvements.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The amendment in the name of Donald Gorrie
makes no reference to those important matters, nor does it address the
financial penalties that may be incurred if it is approved. The accommodation
that is currently available to Parliament is not wholly suitable. It is
not barrier-free and has high security costs, because of the number of
sites. The heating of separate buildings is not cost-efficient. The adaptations
to date are short term and would require further expenditure to meet regulations,
and the accommodation does not meet the needs of staff in the Parliament's
employ.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The deliberations of a special committee
would further delay the provision of a suitable Parliament building for
Scotland for the next century and beyond. It is my view-and I hope that
all members will agree-that if the Parliament is to meet the needs of the
Scottish people, its facilities must be barrier-free. I accept that everything
must be done to ensure that costs are controlled, but that should not exclude
any group or individual from participating in Scotland's democracy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn
and Lochaber) (SNP): </strong>As the representative of the people of Inverness
East, Nairn and Lochaber, I would naturally prefer the Parliament to be
situated in Inverness. However, I am prepared to concede that that will
not be possible without adequate transport links to Heathrow and the rest
of the world.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am sure that all members will join me
in thanking the Church of Scotland for negotiating with the Scottish Office,
which is also to be commended, to make this chamber available to the people
of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Two sets of issues are becoming confused
in this debate: issues relating to the choice of site, and issues relating
to the building and, in particular, the chamber. I want to speak out in
defence of this chamber, because it is an excellent forum. Last week my
colleague Mary Scanlon arranged a visit by a group of people from Inverness.
Almost to a person, they expressed their approval for this chamber, because
of the sense of history, the ambience, the atmosphere, the tradition and
the sense of occasion that inform and-perhaps-raise the quality of our
contributions to debates.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Three factors must be considered when we
contemplate a move to another chamber: the needs of the press, the needs
of the public and the needs of members. I understand that the press in
this chamber can see virtually every member except, perhaps, one or two
Conservative members; I make no comment as to whether that is an advantage
or a disadvantage. I understand that they can see members' reactions and
expressions during debates, and even members passing sweeties to one another.
That is part of the democratic process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The arguments about the lack of facilities
are unrealistically exaggerated. The First Minister was not here to accept
Mrs McIntosh's kind offer of an umbrella to prevent him from becoming drookit
the next time that it rains, but I am sure that, if pushed, we can have
a whip-round among SNP members to arrange one-in the spirit of non-partisan
co-operation. I have never seen the High Street covered with 6 in of snow;
sadly, we have not seen 6 in of snow on Cairn Gorm, where, I hope, the
Cairn Gorm funicular railway will shortly be situated.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

ownership of the phrase "nationalist shibboleth", and we now believe that
the unwanted authorship of that phrase belongs to Brian Wilson, who is
not here-I express no opinion as to whether that is an advantage or a disadvantage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to voice one thought that might
be unwelcome to members of the Labour party who sit in this Parliament.
I believe that any new Parliament building will hasten progress towards
full independence for Scotland. Naturally, I welcome that. Perhaps, therefore,
the intelligent Labour members-I am sure that they form the vast majority-will
reflect that if we were to stay here, which is one of the options under
Donald Gorrie's amendment, it might help slow down the separatist march,
as Labour members would see it, towards independence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In conclusion, I wish to echo your words,
Sir David, about this Parliament being a kitten, which we want, without
any genetic modification, to see transformed into a proud Scottish lion,
independent and free.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">11:40</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Bill Aitken (Glasgow) (Con): </strong>Lyndsay
McIntosh was perfectly correct in trying to focus our minds on the basic
issue: cost. The Holyrood option clearly has to be considered, but it is
worth bandying about a few of the figures, a term which I use advisedly.
When the project was first mooted in 1997, various figures between &pound;10
million and &pound;40 million were quoted. I fully accept that those figures
were never likely to be realistic. The figure of &pound;50 million-plus
VAT and fees, of course-was later quoted. I do not think that I am alone
in thinking that the question of fees and VAT was mentioned sotto voce.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The product that we are likely to receive
in the end has many pleasing aspects. Like many members, I would take issue
with the design and style of the chamber-clearly something that will require
to be examined again. I am sure that, in the end, a serious compromise
can be reached.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I must return to the question of cost.
Why, when the figure of &pound;50 million plus fees plus VAT was mooted,
was it considered that 16,000 sq m would have been adequate? Clearly, that
would not have been adequate to achieve what we wanted-a Parliament that
could house members and staff adequately. The appropriate space is now
considered to be 23,000 sq m. Why was consideration not given to the essential
corridor space? There are far too many unanswered questions, and the inescapable
conclusion to which one is drawn is that the First Minister, whose enthusiasm
for the project is entirely praiseworthy, acted in a somewhat impetuous&nbsp;</font></td>

I would say-and I seek not to be agist-it was a case of a not-quite-so-young
man in a hurry. That was unfortunate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we had looked at the matter in a more
measured, leisurely manner, we would have found a more acceptable conclusion
for the people of Scotland. They are wary of the question of costs, and
are well aware, as are many of us, of the way in which capital projects
can overrun. We do not want the existing figure of &pound;109 million to
be exceeded. Regrettably, we have to draw breath and examine the matter
in a cogent and reasoned manner. What Mr Gorrie is suggesting should be
commended. We are not saying that we will not go to Holyrood. We are saying
that we should examine in detail the options and the costs-there would,
of course, be costs were we not to go to Holyrood-and then make a clear,
reasoned decision, going where we go, knowing what the costs are likely
to be and assuring the people of Scotland that they will get value for
money.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">11:44</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mike Watson (Glasgow Cathcart) (Lab):
</strong>Today's speeches in support of Mr Gorrie's amendment have been disappointing.
It is appropriate that we have the opportunity to discuss these matters,
and I welcome it. However, Mr Gorrie was a bit disingenuous in some of
his arguments, not least when he said that his proposal was "not anti-Holyrood".
He went on to justify his position in two ways; it was clear that it was
an anti-Holyrood proposal. First, he spoke in favour of the Calton hill
proposal, which could have legitimacy only at the expense of Holyrood.
Secondly, he justified his position by citing a paper from Mr James Simpson,
which he circulated to all members this morning-Mr Simpson advocated New
College as a potential site for the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is quite clear that Mr Gorrie's position
is anti-Holyrood. I am happy to put my cards on the table and say that
I am pro-Holyrood. It is a good proposal. It may not be the best site in
Edinburgh, but there are very few sites in central Edinburgh, either new
or old, which will not cause the traffic congestion that Mr Gorrie mentioned.
We could site the Parliament at the Gyle, which would be handy because
of the train station there, but it would not be appropriate. The setting
of the Parliament is important.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I accept that cost is an issue, but it
should not be the overriding issue. I listened to Bill Aitken's remarks.
We are building a Parliament that we hope will be there for hundreds of
years. I am not into the national virility symbol argument, but the new
Parliament does have symbolic importance. Whether we get new politics remains
to be seen, so I shall not use the term-but a new millennium and a new
democracy in Scotland merit a new&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I might horrify the First Minister by saying
that I was very disappointed when, as Secretary of State for Scotland,
he announced that we would move away from Calton hill. For me it had been
the focus of years of campaigning for a Scottish Parliament. We prepared
Calton hill in 1979 and campaigning was based around that building. So
I was disappointed, but I have now come to the conclusion that wherever
we talk about-Calton hill, New College or remaining here-we do not need
an old building. For new politics, for the new democracy, we need a new
building.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>Does the member accept that many of us who will be voting for
the amendment are not wholly opposed to the Holyrood site, subject to amendments,
and are in favour of a new building?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mike Watson: </strong>If Richard Lochhead
suggests that, I accept it; so much the better. I am sure that there is
no uniformity of view within the parties that will vote for the amendment
and against the substantive motion. There is a large element of political
opportunism-it is an opportunity to have a go at the First Minister and
the Executive, which is unfortunate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I believe that we will ultimately take
the decision to settle at Holyrood, because it will be shown to be the
best site in the circumstances, and there is no benefit in delaying that
decision. I listened to Michael Matheson's speech; again, he spoke passionately
about the needs of people with disabilities. That is a very important issue.
It is one of the reasons why this building and the others that we are currently
using are not suitable and why we should clear out of them at the first
opportunity. I am therefore opposed to any delay that would cause us to
remain here longer than necessary.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I fear that adopting the amendment would
put us into a spiral, so that it would be not just a two-month delay but
considerably longer than that. Although everyone has done well in preparing
this building for us, it is not suitable in the long term; neither is the
office accommodation. We need to move ahead today on the basis of the motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>The issue is being discussed on party political lines today, which
is sad. Any rejection of the Holyrood site appears as an attack on the
Miralles design-that is not the case. I was born and brought up in Edinburgh;
I remember well when the Scottish and Newcastle building was built and
the chaos that that caused in that area of the High Street. I should be
fascinated to know how many members have taken a walk down the High Street&nbsp;</font></td>

back up Holyrood Road and have taken into account the feelings of the people
of Dumbiedykes, for instance. I remember when the extension to Moray House
College was built on the far side of Holyrood Road and the traffic chaos
that that caused.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The traffic impact study that has been
made available to us appears to say nothing about Dynamic Earth-to which
Margaret Smith referred-and nothing about the 2 million people who are
expected to visit the Parliament. It claims that there will be no traffic
problems. Anyone who comes down Abbey hill at half-past 8 in the morning,
as I did today-under the bridge and to the bottom of the High Street-will
see that there are major congestion problems. We should support the amendment
to allow us to make proper decisions and to take into account what is necessary
before we proceed with a new building.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The other day, I went with an open mind
to see Mr Miralles and the project team. I asked them two questions, neither
of which they could answer satisfactorily, although I thought that they
were fairly simple questions at this stage, with work about to move into
the construction phase. I asked how long the roof would last and when the
first major refurbishment of the exterior walls was expected. I received
no reply. They had no answers. Labour members who were there know that
that was the case. I worry deeply because we are investing in a building
that is supposed to last for many years, perhaps 100 years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Cathie Craigie (Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)
(Lab): </strong>Will Mr Quinan give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Quinan: </strong>No, I will not give way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That historic building should last and
be a focus for the country, as the Sydney Opera House is a focus for the
people of Australia and as the new Reichstag is a focus for the people
of a united Germany. That is what we are aiming for.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It concerns me that we are taking this
decision in impatience. If we get it wrong, the mistake will be there in
bricks, mortar, sheet steel and plastic for us and for those who come after
us to walk by or walk into each year for the next four years. It will be
an indictment of our impatience if we proceed with the proposal without
proper consideration. I urge all members who are not supporting the amendment
to take a walk down St Mary's Street, or through the Cowgate and down Holyrood
Road, to the bottom of the Royal Mile and back again, and then tell me
whether the development will have a major impact on traffic.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

no preconceived notions and had no detailed knowledge of the locations

qualms about the way in which the issue has arisen and is being debated
today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister told us that there would
be a free vote among Labour members, but I think that we all anticipate
that, at the end of the debate, the Labour members who vote against the
motion-if any-will be fewer than can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
The SNP, which is apparently to have a whipped vote on the issue, tells
us that it is considering the matter from various perspectives, that there
is nothing at all political about it, and that it is acting in the best
interests of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those are the wrong ways in which to approach
the matter. It is wrong that it should be presented to us as an Executive
motion; we should have had a vote on a motion by the Scottish Parliamentary
Corporate Body. I speak as a member of that body, and regard my role as
being something of a trustee for the Parliament, subject to taking a steer
from the Parliament on a matter such as this.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have considerable qualms about our present
position. Whatever the rights and wrongs of Donald Dewar's original decision-and
I have immense respect for Donald's artistic knowledge and feeling for
this kind of thing, which go far beyond anything that I can offer the Parliament-we
are faced with a fait accompli in a situation in which there is no stark
decision to be made. I do not know the reason for the hurry. A letter from
the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland has been circulated to
members. It concludes:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It would be prudent . . . when end-user
(MSP) adjustments are rightly being sought to refine this design, to ensure
that a realistic time scale and budget are established which recognise
the high quality specification demanded of the project, and the inevitable
adjustments which will be required during its realisation. Members of the
architectural profession have felt for some time that both budget and time
scale would need to be reviewed for a variety of reasons if these aims
were to be met."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I take that letter quite seriously because
the advice that it contains comes from an independent source. At the same
time, I thought that Mike Watson made a valid point when he said that a
two-month delay would not be enough to resolve the problems. We are faced
with on-going costs and difficulties in proceeding with the project.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the end of the day, the decision is
one for Parliament, not for the Executive. I am trying to come to a view
on a matter about which information is growing by the day. I do not have
architectural knowledge, nor do I have a detailed method of assessing the
financial issues, although&nbsp;</font></td>

the new building. Here, there are 350 seats, which have been pretty much
filled day after day since the commencement of the Parliament, and that
is a good thing. I like this site, I like being in the heart of the city
and it is appropriate that Parliament should be in the heart of the city.
I am not convinced that, if we move down to Holyrood, the public will have
the same feel for it. There are difficulties with the walking route and,
as Margaret Smith observed, there are still unresolved accessibility difficulties.
The traffic report that we received this morning effectively said that
things are yet to be done, and an intensive and on-going study to ensure
that accessibility measures are in place is not yet being carried out.

that will hold no barriers. I did not recognise the comments that Michael
Matheson made about access in the new building. Nor did I recognise Lloyd
Quinan's comments about answers that he allegedly did not receive about
the costs of the building and the lifespan of the roofing and exterior
walls.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Conservatives' approach does not surprise
me. What does surprise me about today's debate is the lack of ambition
that we are hearing from the nationalists. The SNP wants Scotland to take
a leap into the economic dark, but is not prepared to put its money where
its mouth is and help establish a Parliament that is fit for the next millennium
and the people of Scotland. Instead, it is prepared to support a proposal
from Donald Gorrie for the sake of a couple of cheap headlines.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Parliament has a clear choice between
the vision of an exciting new building for Scotland that can take us forward
into the next century, and the penny-pinching parochialism of Donald Gorrie.
As Mike Watson commented earlier, Donald Gorrie's position is anti-Holyrood.
To delay today is to delay forever, and the Parliament will never move

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>The Scottish Conservatives accepted the verdict of the Scottish people
when they voted for the Scottish Parliament-and a new building-in the 1997
referendum. However, at that time we were told that the cost of the building
would be between &pound;10 million and &pound;40 million. The Scottish
Conservatives argued that there would not be much change out of &pound;100
million. We were ridiculed for making those statements, and told that we
were scaremongering. Well, today it can be seen that we were right.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We also raised the possibility that other
costs might be added on to the Parliament. We said that the cost of the
ministerial team would be three times that of the Scottish ministers in
1997. The First Minister has excelled himself and has gone to four times
that figure. We believed that the revenue costs could rise to &pound;100
million-we were told that that was not possible. Donald Gorrie's comments
today suggest that the Presiding Officer's department could cost &pound;12
million. That must put us well on the way to reaching the &pound;100 million
revenue costs that we were forecasting back in 1997.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some in this chamber might say, "That is
typical of you Conservatives. You are obsessed with costs." We are obsessed
with costs, but it is not our money that the Parliament is spending-it
is taxpayers' money. We have got to get every bit of value out of the money
that the Parliament spends. Like Lyndsay McIntosh, I would rather that
some of the money was spent on upgrading the A77.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tommy Sheridan made a passionate plea for
Glasgow's housing yesterday. Perhaps some of the money could be spent on
uprating housing. That would be good value for money, but spending this
amount of money on a building because someone has decided on the Holyrood
site and that the new building is necessary for Scotland's image is questionable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that, during his speech, I counted at least eight people in the segment

that its members cannot have independence of thought today, I thought that
it was a bit rich for Mr Ewing to lecture us this morning on independence.
SNP members should consider that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am delighted that we are having this
debate, because it gives us the opportunity to show our confidence in the
success of this Parliament and in the new Scotland that we will help to
shape. When we consider the proposed design, we must take into account
the needs of MSPs and their staff and the needs of the Parliament staff.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Parliament also needs to be open and
accessible to all. At the moment, visitors have to walk up and down the
High Street to find the seven buildings that make up the Parliament and,
while adaptations have been made to those buildings to provide disabled
access, the distance that has to be travelled between the buildings makes
accessibility very difficult. I am sure that that problem is being addressed
in the proposals for the new building.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the Parliament staff who have adapted the buildings that we are using to
provide us with a temporary home, but by no yardstick or criterion can
this arrangement be anything other than temporary. We may have just about
enough committee rooms for all our new committees, but the committees will
be open to the public-presumably if there is any space left. There is nowhere

things have moved on, decisions have been made and important milestones
have been reached.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Perhaps the most important milestone is
the perception, widely held in Scotland, that we are already located at
Holyrood; that name, in wider Scotland, is already deeply rooted in the
mindset as synonymous with the Scottish Parliament. Much of Scotland has
accepted, rightly or wrongly, that Holyrood should be the site of the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the amendment wins today-and, rightly,
it should-it will need to be explained carefully to the Scottish people.
If the First Minister's motion is defeated, the position should be accepted
as one of pragmatism, common sense, and, hopefully, in the end, consensus.
Scotland deserves no less. Nobody can doubt that incorrect decisions have
been hurriedly taken at crucial moments. Frankly, the whole process has
been handled extremely badly in terms of public relations, design consultation,
and finance. There is a perception that it has been a complete boorach.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There can be no doubt that serious and
difficult questions remain to be answered about the way in which this project
has been managed from the outset. The key decision takers must answer those
questions. I dread to think what derision might have been visited on councillors
if this had happened in a local authority. In my former life as a Scottish

as this debate has been in parts. The one unifying symbol of Glasgow is
the City Chambers-whether one is inside it, or like my old adversary on

about symbols is worth promoting.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

project is carried out. I am not convinced of the merits of the design.
When I first saw that it featured upturned boats, I felt that it had been

a quadrangle in which the chamber could be located in a way that would
bring the old together with the new, similar to what Germany has recently

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Keith Raffan (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(LD): </strong>Thank you, Mr Deputy Presiding Officer. I rise to support Donald
Gorrie's reasonable and sensible amendment. There have been some passionate
performances today, not least from my friend Mr Russell, but I do not want
to compete with him on this occasion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must consider the issue of the Parliament
building rationally. The First Minister's speech raised more questions
than it answered. He said that a decision on the site had to be taken.
Why? He decided that a decision had to be taken. He is the one who initiated
the project and it was he who has rushed it. He was right when he said
that the Parliament should make a decision on the building. We should reach
that decision in a considered and methodical way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must wait to see how the Parliament
evolves over at least four or five years. That makes sense. We have only
just set up and named the members of committees; those are the initial
16 committees, but there may be more sub-committees. That kind of thing
dictates the type of facilities that we will need. We should see how the
Parliament evolves over at least four or five years before we make a final
decision on a permanent building. The Australians were in provisional accommodation
for 60 years. I do not recommend that we take that long, but that we can
reasonably make do with this excellent chamber for eight years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I share Mr Gorrie's concern about the location
of the Parliament. I would not describe it as being "in a hole", but it
is certainly down in a hollow, or dip. One of the remarkable things about
the cluster of buildings that we occupy at the moment is that we are right
in the life of the city. Mr Salmond and others might agree that it is much
better than Westminster in that respect. That is another argument for Calton
hill, which is also more accessible than the other end of the Royal Mile.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_15"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Johann
Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab): </strong>Will Mr Raffan give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>No, I do not have time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister made a crucial point
about the design when he said that the floor space had increased by 44
per cent since Mr Miralles's original design. Any architect who has followed
the development of the design will say that Miralles's original design
has changed radically. That, too, raises concerns.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the quality of the building, Mr Quinan
mentioned its lifespan. I understood that the project team said that the
lifespan was 100 years. That does not seem very long to me when one considers
that some of the buildings that will surround it have lasted for more than
500 years.</font></td>
