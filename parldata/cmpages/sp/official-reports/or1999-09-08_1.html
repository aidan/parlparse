<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding
Officer (Sir David Steel):</strong> Before we begin this afternoon's proceedings,
I would like to say that the Procedures Committee agreed yesterday on the
form of address to be used for the occupants of the chair. It suggested
that each of us may be addressed simply as Presiding Officer-without the
use of Mr, Madam or Deputy in front of it-or by using our names. All three
of us warmly endorse that recommendation. As it involves no change in the
standing orders, I suggest that we adopt the practice immediately and that
we rule out of order the use of speaker, deputy speaker or more exotic
epithets.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I
am happy to accept that, but I wish to raise a point of order that relates
to your conduct as Presiding Officer of the Parliament. As you are aware,
I have given you prior notice to that effect. My point concerns the complaint
that you made on behalf of the Parliament to the Press Complaints Commission,
in relation to the coverage of the proceedings of the Parliament in the
<i>Daily Record</i>. The fact that you took that action on our behalf came
to light in your speech on Monday to the Church and Nation committee of
the Church of Scotland. You circulated copies of the speech to members
of the Parliament, the text of which makes it clear that your referral
was made not in a personal capacity but on behalf of the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As you will appreciate, Presiding Officer,
complaints about coverage in the <i>Daily Record</i> come as second nature
to the Scottish Conservatives, as we have been on the receiving end for
years. However, irrespective of the merits of your complaint, there is
an important point of principle. Where is your authority to submit such
a complaint, given that, to the best of my knowledge, you did not seek
the approval of the Parliament, the corporate body or the Parliamentary
Bureau for the course of action that you have followed? In the words of
the relevant section, have "proper procedures" been followed in relation
to this aspect of the business of the Parliament?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, having initiated this complaint
without consultation or approval, which procedures do you now intend to
follow in relation to the progress of the complaint? Will you publish the
text of your letter to the Press Complaints Commission? What guidance do
you intend to take from the Parliament in relation to the reply that you&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> First, thank
you for your courtesy in giving me notice of your point of order-that is
an important precedent. Secondly, if your point had not involved me, I
would have ruled that it was not a point of order, as it does not relate
to proceedings in the chamber. The substantive answer is that I will write
to you and, with your agreement, I will release the text of my reply on
electronic mail so that every member has access to it tomorrow.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):</strong>
We now proceed to the first item of business this afternoon, which is motion
S1M-118, in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, on a financial resolution for
the Mental Health (Public Safety and Appeals) (Scotland) Bill. The motion
will be taken without debate. Before I call Mr McConnell to move the motion,
I remind members that, after he does, we will move immediately to a decision.
Looking ahead, I inform members that there are likely to be a number of
decisions during the debate on stage 2 of the Mental Health (Public Safety
and Appeals) (Scotland) Bill, and I intend to explain the procedure that
is to be followed immediately before the start of that debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Convener (Sir David Steel):</strong>
We move to consider stage 2 of the bill in the Committee of the Whole Parliament.
As the bill procedure is new to us all, I want to explain how we will proceed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The debate on stage 2 is programmed to
last for two hours 50 minutes in total. I remind members that electronic
voting will be used for any divisions and that the voting time will be
30 seconds.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Copies of the marshalled list of amendments
to be considered were delivered to members with their copies of the business
bulletin. They are also available now from the clerks at the back of the
chamber. As well as the 36 amendments lodged on Monday and printed in yesterday's
bulletin, the marshalled list includes three amendments lodged by the Minister
for Justice, Mr Wallace, after the normal deadline. I took the view that
the merits of those amendments outweighed the disadvantages of lack of
notice, and so intend to exercise my power under standing order 9.10.6
to allow them to be moved. These manuscript amendments, together with another
amendment that has been changed slightly, are indicated by asterisks on
the marshalled list.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Copies of the grouping list have been placed
on members' desks. Amendments have been grouped to allow a single debate
to take place on related amendments. That should avoid undue repetition
and allow the committee to concentrate on the important issues. Nevertheless,
I remind members that all the amendments must be called in turn from the
marshalled list and will be disposed of in that order. Whoever is chairing
will be strict in ensuring that the committee observes that rule. In particular,
we shall not permit the committee to move backwards in the list.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There will, therefore, be one debate on
each of the six groups of amendments set out in the marshalled list. We
will call first the proposer of the first amendment in the group, who should
end his or her speech by moving the amendment. We will then call other
speakers, including-if time permits-the proposers of all amendments in
the group. Other speakers should not move their amendments at that stage.
The minister will be called to speak on each group.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the end of the debate on each group,
we will put the question on the first amendment in the group and the committee
shall decide whether to agree to the amendment. We will then call the next&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">amendment on the
marshalled list. The member who has proposed it will have the opportunity
to move it, but should not make a speech. There will be no further debate
and we will immediately put the question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To assist members in interpreting the groupings,
the grouping list indicates sub-groups of amendments that either stand
or fall together, or are clear alternatives. For example, group 1 on the
list has amendments 1 and 10 as the first sub-group. Those amendments propose
the same adjustment to two different subsections, and they stand or fall
together. In the second sub-group, amendments 2 and 11 propose alternative
amendments to the same subsection: they are clear alternatives and cannot
both be accepted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In relation to such amendments, I expect
the committee to respect the decision that is taken on the amendment that
is disposed of first. For example, amendments 1 and 10 make exactly comparable
changes in two places in the bill. If amendment 1 is agreed to, I expect
the committee to agree without dissent to amendment 10 when it is reached.
If amendment 1 is disagreed to, I expect amendment 10 not to be moved.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some amendments pre-empt others. For example,
if amendment 11 is accepted, that pre-empts amendment 12, which seeks to
delete a word that would no longer be part of the bill if amendment 11
were to be agreed to.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, I remind members that, as well
as disposing of amendments, the committee is required to decide whether
to agree to each section of the bill. I will put the question on each section
when it is reached. The only way in which it is permitted to oppose agreement
to a section is by lodging an amendment to leave out the section. No such
amendments have been lodged so far and, given the time limits within which
we are working, I do not propose to allow any last-minute manuscript amendments
to leave out sections to be taken.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are operating the committee system with
the electronics for the first time, and I ask members to press the button
to speak only on the group that is under discussion. The screens will be
cleared at the end of each group. We in the chair will not be setting any
time limit on speeches, because at a committee stage, by definition, all
speeches should be short and there should be free interchange.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am sure that all that I have said has
been clearly understood, but in case it has not, copies of this guidance
will now be circulated by the attendants, so that members can have it by
their side. We have already agreed a strict timetable for this afternoon's
debate, and the clock starts ticking once I invite the first member to
move the first&nbsp;</font></td>
