<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Motion debated,</font></i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That the Parliament notes with regret the
loss of 99 jobs in Dumfries with the closure of the Nestl&eacute; factory,
in addition to over 2000 jobs in Dumfries and Galloway in the past two
years and the potential loss of 1700 jobs in the agricultural sector in
the next two years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>I would like to say how much I welcome this opportunity to raise with
the Scottish Executive-and with the other members who I am pleased to see
are staying with us-the concerns of the people of the south-west of Scotland.
They are witnessing the battering of their local economy by unprecedented
levels of job losses in manufacturing and farming.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also welcome Mr McLeish's letter to me
today in which he commits himself to coming to Dumfries at an early opportunity
to meet with Dr Murray, Mr Fergusson, Mr Morgan and myself. The letter
tacitly recognises that the economic problems of areas such as Dumfries
and Galloway have perhaps not always had the attention that they deserve.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I believe that the seriousness of the situation
in which we find ourselves merits direct Government action. I will argue
for Executive involvement in a task force to develop and implement a jobs
strategy; for the Executive to back the area's application for European
structural funding under the new objective 2-[<i>Interruption</i>.]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George
Reid):</strong> Order. Will members engaging in private conversations please
do so outside the chamber and not in the course of the member's remarks.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David Mundell: </strong>Thank you, Mr Reid.
I will ask the minister to acknowledge that we in Dumfries and Galloway
face many of the same problems of remote and rural areas as do the Highlands.
Although we do not have our own minister, we merit the same level of attention
and funding. There is also a growing feeling of marginalisation in the
south-west, so I want this Government, which talks so much about social
inclusion, to demonstrate some geographic inclusion so that the people
of Dumfries and Galloway can be confident that they are on the agenda of
the Executive and this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

assured is a word-and dispersed communities, the two major problems that
the region faces are spiralling job losses in the manufacturing sector
and the restructuring and adjustment of the agricultural&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">sector. Dumfries
and Galloway has, at 12.8 per cent, the highest mainland level of employment
in agriculture. That compares to the Scottish average of 2 per cent. Agricultural
output constitutes 23 per cent of the area's gross domestic product. That
is why farming's worst crisis since the war has had a particularly devastating
effect not only on the farmers, but on their suppliers and the local shops
and businesses in the area.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I commend the Scottish Agricultural College
report on agriculture and its future in rural Dumfries and Galloway to
both Mr McLeish and Mr Finnie. It is an excellent document but it makes
troubling reading as it predicts up to 1,700 job losses in that industry
unless positive action is taken to restructure.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the manufacturing side, the closure
of the Nestl&eacute; plant in Dumfries with the loss of 99 jobs is the
latest in a seemingly endless line of bad-news stories that have made the
local papers. We have become used to headlines like "New Year Jobs Blow",
which greeted the closure of the UCB polypropylene film plant, and "Double
Jobs Blow Hits 180" on the shock closure of a showpiece plant. I will not
go on, although I must say that I was intrigued by the headline "Crisis
Alert-Dewar to Visit Region".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The job losses that we have experienced
tend not to make the national news because the numbers are not headline
matters. However, the drip, drip loss of 100 jobs in Dumfries, the loss
of 20 this week at Cochran Boilers in Annan and 160 jobs lost at Stelrad
in Dalbeattie are equivalent to the loss of many hundreds or even thousands
of jobs from our large cities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The psychological effect is the same. An
air of gloom has descended on many communities with the inevitable consequence
that people move away. The statistics show that depopulation has begun
and it is predicted that it will continue. Who is going? Young people and
skilled people are going, leaving behind an aging and economically inactive
population. Dumfries and Galloway cannot survive on only the income of
retired people. Work is needed to sustain and develop vibrant rural communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are bright spots, though. I commend
the Langholm initiative to Mr McLeish and I suggest that he visit there.
It is a shining example of how a community and local organisations can
work together to stimulate economic development and enhance their environment.
I welcome the closer working relationship between Dumfries and Galloway
Council and the local enterprise company. Their joint economic strategy
document is a starting point, but I believe its development and implementation
will only be fulfilled, in this time of unprecedented crisis, with the
clout and expertise of the Scottish Executive as a full partner&nbsp;</font></td>

I call on the Executive to make that level of commitment a reality, whether
or not we give it the title of task force.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to conclude my remarks with a further
plea to the Scottish Executive that it will give a commitment today to
support the Dumfries and Galloway European partnership case for rural strand
objective 2 support for the years 2000 to 2006. As its lobby document sets
out, such funding is needed if the region is to succeed in building on
the foundations that were established under the objective 5 programme with
the aim of developing a modern, diverse rural economy with an emphasis
on employment creation and on knowledge-based and high-value-added activities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is always hard to draw attention to
a difficult situation without appearing overly negative. Members should
be in no doubt that the south-west has a wonderful natural environment,
some of the best health and educational facilities in Scotland and, of
course, its premier resource, its people. Let us by our actions make this
Scottish Parliament the catalyst that will allow the south-west to reach
its full economic potential.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>I congratulate Mr Mundell on securing this debate. One of the
most important parts of debating in this chamber will be the debates under
rule 5.6(c), in which members can express concerns from their area and
receive assurance, which I am sure that there will be, and possibly even
promises of action from the relevant minister. We look forward to that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also want to commend Dr Elaine Murray,
who has already taken a useful initiative by inviting members for South
of Scotland to meet from time to time to discuss issues. I have been slightly
tardy in replying to her, but have done so now and hope that she will take
the lead in convening the first of those meetings. The members from the
Scottish National party will be happy to attend them and to find a consensual
way of addressing the problems in the south of Scotland as far as we can.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Mundell is right to say that when one
talks about rural deprivation, as with land reform and other matters, the
emphasis is always on the Highlands. All of us who know the south of Scotland
know that there are many problems there that are similar to or more grave
than the problems in the Highlands and Islands-an area that I know well-but
which receive little direct attention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Alex Johnstone talked earlier about there being a stark difference between
rural and urban Scotland. That stark difference does not really exist.
There are certainly different problems in rural, urban and small-town Scotland,
but they are all problems to do with people. Often they are to do with
how people earn their living and how they can continue to live and work
in the area that they choose or in which they were born. We must find a
way to address that issue. It will be a major job for this Parliament in
the next four years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There must be concern, but also action.
Mr Mundell has put together concern with a requirement and a request for
action. This Parliament will be better served, because it will focus more
closely on the regions of Scotland. Certainly, the fight in the south of
Scotland will be helped immensely by the fact that the Government's professional
mummers, Mr Brian Wilson and Lord Macdonald, who were always on hand to
mourn at the funeral of jobs in the south of Scotland, are no longer with
us. Mr McLeish, who will be, I am sure, of a much jollier countenance-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Learning (Henry McLeish): </strong>I will attend a few weddings.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Yes, and bar mitzvahs
no doubt. Mr McLeish will focus strongly on the need for jobs of the whole
of Scotland and on the particular needs of the south of Scotland, in many
areas of which there is, unfortunately, a cycle of decline. Job losses
lead to job losses and to a feeling that such things cannot be reversed,
which leads to an outflow of population.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that all the members for South of
Scotland will concentrate on the issue of not only saving jobs but creating
them and on finding new ways in which to attract new jobs and to find indigenous
industries to bring in jobs. That is this Parliament's job. I welcome Mr
Mundell's initiative and look forward to the minister's response.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">been shocked to
learn that the Nestl&eacute;-formerly Carnation-factory, which has long
been associated with the town, intends to cease operating in October next
year. My discussions with Nestl&eacute;'s representatives immediately after
the announcement brought to light two particular problems that they felt
had led to the decision.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first was the difficulties that continue
to exist as a result of the BSE crisis, particularly the loss of exports
to the near east and Saudi Arabia, which has seriously reduced Nestl&eacute;'s
market for dried milk products. The second, which has also featured in
my discussions with other local manufacturers-Dupont and Cochran's, for
example, both of which have recently announced intentions to downsize as
it is known-was the effect of the recession in Russia and the far east.
As a consequence of the collapse of the markets there, companies trading
in those areas have moved in to compete in a significantly smaller marketplace.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am not quite sure what the Scottish Parliament
can do to rectify either of those problems. The joint economic strategy
launched by Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise and Dumfries and Galloway
Council expressed the view that</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"the Parliament should offer opportunities
for all agencies to work more closely together and with central government."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That sounds good, but somehow we must make
it a reality.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Having said all that, I do not think that
it helps to talk Dumfries and Galloway down. It is not some bleak unemployment
black spot. Although jobs have been lost during the past couple of years,
they have also been created. Indeed, the unemployment figures have fallen
by approximately a quarter since 1996.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">New employers will be attracted to the
area because of its advantages and potential. That must be emphasised,
but it is not to deny that there are problems that need to be tackled.
Even if employment is growing in other sectors, the loss of manufacturing
industry is worrying as it offers better paid jobs that help to sustain
local economies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dumfries and Galloway has a reputation-an
unfortunate one in my opinion-for having a low-wage economy. Wages are
some 10 per cent less than in other areas. I do not believe that my constituents
should be paid lower wages because they happen to live in Dumfries and
Galloway and we can ill afford to lose employers who pay better wages.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are a number of transport issues
to consider, such as the poor quality of some of our trunk roads, such
as the A76, parts of the A75 and the A7. Public transport, too, is often
inadequate.&nbsp;</font></td>

That is not just an inconvenience to me; it is a disincentive to business

area where so many positive developments are taking place and I want to

Dumfries and Galloway has to offer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tourism is a major industry in the area.
The industry is worth something like &pound;75 million and employs about
9 per cent of the local work force.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Briefly,
please.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Murray: </strong>There are plans to expand
the tourism industry. We also have the food industry, the forestry industry
and, despite the current problems, the agriculture industry. Dumfries is
renowned for the quality of its products and will continue to have a future
at the quality end of the market.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Positive efforts are being made to try
to turn round some of the recent bad news. For example, Nestl&eacute; is
working closely with the council and the enterprise company to do what
it can to find another employer to take over the site. There have been
a number of other issues, but I do not have time to go through them all
at present.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I wish to draw members' attention to the
world-class optical cable communications system that is being installed

That has happened because everyone has worked together. Problems have been

the tide has started to turn. I hold out that hope to Dr Murray.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am worried about the south of Scotland
not getting recognition. People think about the Highlands and Islands and
the rest. The lowlands is not just the lowlands; it is the lowlands and
the south of Scotland and we must ensure that that is not forgotten.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Communications, such as roads and high-tech
electronics, are deeply important. Education is also important and leads
me to the south of Scotland university project, which I wish well and think
could make a difference. The Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels
has been incorporated into Heriot-Watt University and now has an office
in Hawick. That will make a difference because success breeds success and,
therefore, people will stay. Investment is also important.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Small things can make a difference. I have
had two letters from constituents that will strike a chord with Dr Murray.
Something as simple as the authorities' failure to put back a tourist sign

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alex Fergusson (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>I will preface my remarks by acknowledging the letter from Mr McLeish
that conveniently arrived on my desk at about quarter past two. I acknowledge
the &pound;1 million for Dumfries and Galloway's enterprise action plan
for 1998-99 and the &pound;2.4 million for the 1999-2000 action plan, but
question how much of that money will end up as consultancy fees, feasibility
studies and jobs for the boys, rather than jobs for the men and women who
need them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">David Mundell described the serious situation
in Dumfries and Galloway. While I agree that we must not talk the area
down, there are underlying problems with the agriculture and forestry industries,
which account for a staggering 30 per cent of the region's gross domestic
product. That is a stunningly high level of dependency in anybody's language
and the Scottish Agricultural College has projected that there will be
1,700 job losses over three years. The crucial importance of those two
basic rural industries is clear to all and the SAC report shows how much
the agricultural situation has worsened during the year.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Parliament will
not want to hear, nor have I time to give, all the facts and figures that
are available to illustrate the demise of agri-forestry, so I will confine
myself to a mere two facts. They are stark and sobering. First, in 1996,
total farm income in Scotland was &pound;546 million. In 1998, it was &pound;187
million. I still have trouble getting used to the second fact, which is
that it is cheaper to import fencing posts from Latvia than it is to manufacture
them in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is why 1,700 jobs are at risk in south-west
Scotland. Not just farmers' or farm workers' jobs are at stake; the jobs
of shop assistants, drainers, fencers, sales reps, forestry workers and
saw mill workers-the myriad of jobs that agriculture and forestry help
to sustain-are at stake. Entire rural communities are under the severest
of threats because of the decline in those most rural of industries.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What can this Parliament do? I strongly
maintain that, within the European Union, the Scottish farmer will take
lessons from no one on production efficiency. However, perhaps we have
lessons to learn in marketing. I hope that the Parliament will be able
to promote the benefits of co-operation and co-operative marketing as one
positive way of improving agriculture's lot.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have no doubt that one role of this Scottish
Parliament will be to promote Scotland and all things Scottish. I believe
strongly that as part of that role the Executive, in conjunction with local
authorities and enterprise companies, should work to encourage the further
manufacturing of a region's primary produce, so that the region may gain
substantially from the added value and increased economic input that rural
communities so desperately require.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is already a deeply held scepticism
in many rural areas about whether this Parliament will be of much benefit
to them, and I am afraid that the legislative programme that was set out
this morning will have done little to alleviate it. We must unite across
the parties to set our parliamentary sights on regenerating the rural areas
of Scotland. That is the only way in which this Parliament will be deemed
a success. Indeed, it is on that that the oft-mentioned but seldom-witnessed
new politics will be judged in rural Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

as they are in the United States.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As has already been said, we need to encourage
the south of Scotland university project. The Government should encourage
it in the same way, and with the same amount of money, as it encouraged
the University of the Highlands and Islands. A centre of academic excellence
in the region will encourage businesses to gravitate to, or stay within,
it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>My
apologies go to Mr Robson and Mr Gallie, who wished to speak but who have,
unfortunately, been beaten by the clock. I call Mr McLeish to wind up the
debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning (Henry McLeish): </strong>I am very pleased to wind up the debate.
There have been some excellent speeches. It has been brief, but I am delighted
that so many members have been able to speak. Of necessity, I, too, shall
have to be brief. That should not be construed as anything other than sticking
to the timetable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

debate and thank the other participants, including my colleague Dr Elaine
Murray. I also want to confirm that I intend to visit Dumfries and&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Galloway very soon.
If there are problems to be addressed, my style will be to visit and encourage
local relationships-we have many in the area, and I hope that we can take
advantage of them. Economic development powers do not come to the Parliament
until 1 July, but I want to make preparations for my visit now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is clear that rural economies in Scotland
face particular problems. I am aware, because I have heard them say so
on many occasions, that people from Dumfries and Galloway and, indeed,
the Borders feel disadvantaged by the emphasis that has been placed on
the Highlands and Islands. We should not take anything away from the Highlands
and Islands, but we can put more emphasis on Dumfries and Galloway and
the Borders. That is what a Parliament for the whole of Scotland is all
about, and this evening I am committing myself to that aspiration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The involvement of local authorities, the
private sector and public sector bodies in local enterprise companies leads
me to believe that local ownership of solutions is vital. That does not
mean that the Government can walk away from tackling the problems practically.
Adjournment debates in Westminster seemed very remote, geographically and
psychologically. This is Edinburgh, we are very close, and I want Mr Mundell
to take a strong message back to his community: we want to gel all our
commitment locally and work for his area.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We also want to take a new initiative.
Debates about rural affairs and rural economies cover virtually every subject
in the Parliament. Governments have traditionally not been good at what
we call cross-cutting. I want to work closely with Ross Finnie and others
to ensure that transport, tourism, the environment, economic development
and land issues are brought together, not only in the Executive, but in
this Parliament. I would like to think it a challenge to this Parliament,
with its subject and mandatory committees, to examine the possibilities
of cross-cutting very early on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Government has responded over the past
two years. It is clear that Dumfries and Galloway has faced difficult times.
Last October, Donald Dewar announced an additional &pound;1 million for
Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise to start the rebuilding process. Funding
has already laid foundations for economic growth: more than 300 people
have benefited from training programmes and from early completion of the
plastics park in Dumfries, which is a fine example of local skills and
strengths being adapted to changing global markets. There has been additional
support for small business, which is essential for diversification and
the local economy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An additional &pound;1 million of funding
has to be followed through with a clear strategy and&nbsp;</font></td>

The situation is developing, and there are perceived problems, but I want
to concentrate in the short time available to me on the potential for Dumfries
and Galloway. All members who spoke stressed the problems, but every area
has potential. It is right that this Parliament and all the agencies involved
recognise that fact. Agriculture is facing difficult times, but it has
a tremendous future and tourism has grown enormously, to the extent that
9 per cent of the employed population is now working in it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is evident that, with a minute remaining,
I will not have time to do justice to the myriad points that have been
made in this debate. Suffice to say that I want to look, listen and learn
about what is happening in Dumfries and Galloway. A raft of reports is
already available, but we are also at the start of a new era in which we
can do things differently. I think that, over the next few weeks, we will
be able to visit Dumfries and Galloway. We want to discuss the situation
there with our farming colleagues and to examine assisted area status,
European funds and objective 2, which is a current issue-it is reserved
to Westminster, but Scottish ministers are closely involved and we want
to do the best we can for every part of Scotland.</font></td>

think that this debate has illustrated why we fought so long to get it.
It has been very constructive and I hope that it will act as a signpost
for others. I am delighted that it has taken place. It has been extraordinarily
brief, but we will be visiting, building and co-operating not only with
MSPs, but with everyone who has the best interests of Dumfries and Galloway
and the south of Scotland at heart.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>On a point of order. I understand that there is provision in the standing
orders to extend debates in certain circumstances. It is a pity that two
members were unable to participate in this debate and that the comments
of the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning had to be abbreviated.
Members are not awfully familiar with many of the niceties of the standing
orders, and it might be useful if you, Mr Deputy Presiding Officer, could
arrange for an explanation of how we might protract a debate when another
10 minutes might make a difference to be given in a future business bulletin.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>This
is a timed debate and the magic hour of half-past 5 is almost with us,
but I will arrange for such information to be brought to the attention
of members through the Presiding Officer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
