an inclusive, all party campaign to seek assistance for the area and to
act as a focus for the regeneration of this important part of Argyll.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands)
(SNP): </strong>For how long may I speak?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>You have
10 minutes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Hamilton: </strong>That may be more than
I need.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The debate today on the regeneration of
the Cowal economy is the culmination of a campaign that was launched locally
with the support of most of the local members of the Scottish Parliament
and with the local authority, and I thank them all for their contributions.
In particular, I thank the <i>Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard</i>,
which has been an enormously successful campaigning newspaper. I am sure
that we will have contributions from members of all parties. My thanks
also go to Maureen Macmillan, George Lyon and Michael Russell, who have
played an important role in signing this motion and making sure that it
got on to the agenda.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important to outline simply what
the current problem is with the Cowal economy. Of course, the issue is
complicated, as Alasdair Morrison will know from his recent visit, but,
over the past couple of years, there has undoubtedly been a drop-off in
the level of tourist activity on the peninsula, sometimes by 30 or 40 per
cent: a cumulative hit that no economy could sustain. The Cowal peninsula
and the whole of Argyll rely disproportionately on tourism for their income,
especially since the pull-out of the American base.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The area has not been helped by the policy
of the strong currency, which seems to have been encouraged by the Government
in Westminster. I can inform the minister and the Parliament that the anger
at the insensitivity of the policy, which ignores the needs of the local
economy, should not be underestimated. I am sure that local&nbsp;</font></td>

have taken the opportunity to make clear to the deputy minister their disgust
at the level of attention that they have received over the past while.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is also important to understand that
one of the major problems for Dunoon is that, as a regional retail centre,
it has taken a damaging hit following what happened across the water in
Gourock. We will come back to the link between Dunoon and Gourock later
in the debate, because it is pivotal to the plan for regeneration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The area's decline is mirrored in the population.
In the period 1991-97, the population of the area has declined by approximately
7 per cent. The figures from the voluntary census that Argyll and Bute
Council took in 1999 show that the population appears to be down to less
than 15,000. That gives a sense of a community in decline. The area needs
to be built up, but the figures are going in the wrong direction.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unemployment is central to the motion before
Parliament. The unemployment rate on the peninsula-7.2 per cent-is substantially
above the average of 5 per cent in the area served by Argyll and the Islands
Enterprise, which is part of Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The momentum is a downward spiral. Local
concern has reached this Parliament-there is no chance that that would
have happened in Westminster, given the lack of time there. It is important
for the prestige of this Parliament-certainly in the part of the world
that we are talking about-that we have had the opportunity to have this
debate, which I very much welcome. However, people in the area are looking
for more than warm words; we want concerted action from the Scottish Executive
to ensure that the problems can be alleviated and turned around.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It has been suggested that there has been
an overreaction to this problem and that it is not as bad as we think.
I have to say that the mood on the ground is that we must be aware of the
reality of the problem. That is the mood not just from businesses, which
are perhaps the best weather vane of this, and not just from people who
see the rundown in the quality of the buildings and the number of people
in the town, but from the council, which is talking about setting up a
Cowal regeneration task force specifically charged with making sure that
we draw together all the interest groups-including politicians, economic
groups or whatever-to ensure that we drive things forward and make others
aware of the reality of the problem.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What do we do about the problem? That is
the basis of this debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and identify with
it. The SNP's policy is to get rid of nuclear weapons from the Holy loch
and the area. If that were to happen, does he agree that the economy of
Cowal and the surrounding area would become much worse?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Hamilton: </strong>We seem to be suffering
from a time warp.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>I am sorry, I meant
Faslane.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Hamilton: </strong>The real problem in
the Cowal economy is not caused by the leftovers of the removal of the
US naval base. It is caused by real, current economic problems. Phil Gallie
represents a party-he represented it in the Westminster Parliament, too-that
has not served Argyll and Bute well and has not served the Cowal peninsula
well. A lot of the problems go back to a lack of investment at a much earlier
stage. I look forward to the regeneration of the Tory party in terms of
a base of ideas for positive thinking. It is not enough to tell the SNP
that, because we took a principled stance against nuclear weapons, we are
responsible for the current plight of the Cowal economy. We have to do
a bit better than that, Mr Gallie.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The key to the problem is the rebuilding
of Dunoon pier, which will be more memorable to many older members in terms
of trips doon the watter than it is to me. That experience is not really
open to people of our generation-I say that to the deputy minister. The
problem is largely that the pier is falling down. According to the report
commissioned by the Argyll and Bute Council transport and property chiefs,
it is unsafe: 40-tonne lorries cannot disembark on the pier and, unless
there is massive investment-initially about &pound;50,000 to patch it up
as an interim measure-17-tonne vehicles will not be able to use it either.
That is not good enough for business, given that we are looking at rebuilding
the area and providing a quality transport link.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are in a catch-22 situation because,
until we get funding for the pier, which the cash-strapped council is in
no position to give, Caledonian MacBrayne cannot guarantee the ferry link.
Moreover, until the Deloitte &amp; Touche report into the maintenance of
the link between Gourock and Dunoon is published, the council cannot ask
for money for the pier. We must have an early resolution of that problem.
It is important that we see the matter as an integrated transport problem.
This is not just about building the pier because it looks nice; a rebuilt
pier will be the driver for growth in the area.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Professor Neil Kay is the foremost expert
on the ferry routes in the area and on the need for regeneration and how
we achieve it. He wrote in the <i>Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard</i>,
which I mentioned earlier:</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"There are two
things to bear in mind as far as Dunoon pier is concerned. It is an integral
part of the public transport system-buses and trains-which is now Government
policy. That wasn't the case when the Deloitte and Touche report was commissioned.
Secondly, the cross-Clyde run is similar to the Forth bridges in terms
of being a transport link across a major estuary . . . it is a mistake
to say the pier is just for Dunoon. The pier has symbolic importance but
it is much more than that-it is actually part of a major transport route."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I ask members to view the problem in its
proper environment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, when discussing the ferries, we
need to consider the history of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report. We have
been waiting for well over a year since the leaked version of the report
was published to find out what is going on. The Minister for Transport
and the Environment simply refuses to give any indication of when that
report will be available, and in the meantime the axe hangs over the CalMac
ferry route into Dunoon pier. That is not good enough.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a written answer last week the minister
told me that the report would be published "soon". I am afraid that soon
has been a very long time. It is about time that we saw this report, so
that we can end the uncertainty. When the Deputy Minister for the Highlands
and Islands and Gaelic comes to respond, I would welcome some indication-perhaps
even a date-of when we will be able to see it. The report affects so many
lives and so many livelihoods that there are no grounds for concealing
it any longer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must also bear in mind the fact that
there are two ferry routes in this area; some members may not be aware
of that. One is run by Western Ferries, and one by Caledonian MacBrayne.
Local people want us to move away from the idea that only one or other
of those routes can be maintained. We want the CalMac route to be maintained
and have no problem with the maintenance of the Western Ferries route.
We want to avoid monopoly pricing and a situation in which Western Ferries,
which handles a substantial amount of traffic, is able to charge through
the nose for that. We do not want private business to be run out. I do
not see why it is impossible for the Government to put fair competition
at the heart of its strategy. The restrictions under which CalMac operates
at the moment mean that we have far from fair competition.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important to recognise that Western
Ferries deals largely with the lucrative end of the market-vehicle traffic.
However, its passenger safety provisions are not to anything like the same
standard as CalMac's. It has a different form of craft, and the Western
Ferries port is way out of town. Professor Kay has estimated that the impact
on Dunoon of traffic simply passing through on its&nbsp;</font></td>

without attempting to stop in the town, would be enormously detrimental
to the whole peninsula. We have to examine this issue in terms of economic
regeneration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is also important to recognise that,
even if we were to get rid of CalMac tomorrow, Western Ferries does not
have the capacity, in terms either of craft or of current facilities, to
deal with all the traffic. That is a logistical fact.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Above all, if we want to regenerate the
area, we must think about the impact on business. Again, I come back to
Professor Kay, who is assuming a somewhat legendary status! He says something
very interesting from a business perspective. When he was asked what he
thought the current climate would mean for a business, he replied:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"You can't really begin to talk about the
future of the community until you have established a secure transport base.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If I were a firm looking at locating over
here I would just look at the uncertainty over transport that has existed
here for some years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That would worry me because if it did come
down to one transport operator then how are prices to be regulated? There
is no regulatory structure in place for dealing with that."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That, in a nutshell, is the argument against
a monopoly. It is why we need not only the maintenance, with additional
Government money, of Dunoon pier, but an early commitment to the CalMac
route to Gourock, to fair competition between the thriving Western Ferries
and the vital service provided by CalMac, and to the crucial and traditional
Dunoon pier.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Ms Patricia

Council about this, and the statistics that it gave me did not bear that
out. The council said that it did not consider the Cowal area, apart from
the west of Cowal around Tighnabruaich, to be a fragile area, that Dunoon
had received a good deal of investment recently, and that it was surprised

of Corpach, Invergordon, Machrihanish and Benbecula. When a large employer
leaves an area, that causes a crisis of self-confidence. People are afraid
that things will go into total decline. However, there have been new initiatives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From discussions with Argyll and Bute Council,
I know that telephone service centres have invested in the area and that
the swimming pool has been redeveloped. However, such initiatives might
not generate the self-confidence that is necessary for an area to pull
itself up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A commitment by Caledonian MacBrayne to
retain the service from Dunoon to Gourock would help to restore confidence
in the area, as would the refurbishment of the pier. We await that announcement
with great anticipation. There are fears about the cost and frequency of
the remaining service should Caledonian MacBrayne withdraw. As Duncan said,
Caledonian MacBrayne sails to the centre of Dunoon and takes passengers
back and forward across the Clyde. I know Dunoon well and I know how essential
the ferry is to the town; my mother came from Dunoon and used the ferry
every day to go to school in Greenock. The loss of the ferry would have
a profound effect on the economy of the town. I believe that the link across
the Clyde is essential, no matter what the outcome of the ferry plan is.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that Argyll and Bute Council and
Argyll and the Islands Enterprise make a strong bid for European structural
funds. I think that that is the way forward. In the European Committee
yesterday, we talked about the importance of infrastructure and how, if
infrastructure projects were to be funded by the structural funds, we would
have to show that economic good would come out of them. I said that I wanted
substantial improvements in the infrastructure of the Highlands and that
we had to link that to economic development.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The people of Cowal have to keep up their
campaign-it is important to show that they have a fighting spirit-but,
more important, they have to have plans and ideas about how they would
maximise the benefits of a refurbished pier. They cannot simply say that
they want the pier refurbished; they must have plans about the expansion
of industry, commerce and tourism. That is the way in which they can maximise
their chances of getting funding for the project.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

on taking forward the initiative of the <i>Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire
Standard</i>.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Transport infrastructure is the key to
the region. The Cowal peninsula is in many ways similar to an island and
two election campaigns in the western isles and a lifetime have made me
aware of how crucial ferry services are to those areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Cowal's economy, which had become reliant
on the Holy loch base, is now very fragile. The agriculture industry is
in a chronic depression and while prices plummet, so does the level of
employment in an area that has the second highest unemployment in Argyll
and Bute.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Forestry, which used to provide a lot of
jobs when the commission employed its own workers in the forestry villages,
employs hardly anyone. Most of the work is done by outside contractors.
That policy could be reversed by using local labour for planting, husbandry
and felling. If much more were made of them, Forest Enterprise's outdoor
sporting and leisure resources could help those villages to become healthy
communities again.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dunoon's shopkeepers are not making money.
People find it easier to shop where the goods are cheaper-across the water-and
what is the point of charging people to park in Dunoon when there is no
serious parking problem? It smells of bureaucracy and drives people away.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The welcome addition of a marina at Sandbank
will create some jobs and restore and improve the appearance of the area.
It is vital that we attract more such inward investment to the area, but
that will be difficult while the uncertainty about the pier and the ferries
remains.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dunoon pier is an attractive legacy of
the Victorian era. It is a focal point in Dunoon and I believe that a breakwater
should be built to protect it and that it should be restored and used commercially
as a point of interest in the town.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A roll-on, roll-off pier facility should
be built, because that is the sort of ferry that will be used in future
for short-haul trips. The two ferry companies should continue in a spirit
of healthy competition. Dunoon and the Cowal peninsula's beauty will always
sell the area as a place to live in or visit, but financial incentive must
be forthcoming to encourage people to make their homes there even if their
jobs are across the water.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I cannot leave this debate without mentioning
the special islands needs allowance, which Argyll and Bute, with its numerous
islands, should surely now receive, or without mentioning that lower fuel
costs are the other vital key to restoring our remoter rural areas. Dunoon
and Cowal are steeped in history. Let us take a leaf out of America's book,
and provide our rural areas with sound infrastructure and better access
so that they&nbsp;</font></td>

their former prosperity themselves.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must remember that an economy that becomes
dependent on a military or naval base is bound to suffer, at least temporarily,
from a forced withdrawal. The inhabitants of Benbecula are about to experience
the same problem, and I shudder to think what effect the closure of Faslane
would have on Helensburgh and the surrounding areas if the Scottish National
party was to implement its pledge to remove Trident.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last, Para Handy and his puffer the Vital

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD):
</strong>I believe that Jamie will find that the Vital Spark is moored at the
end of the Crinan canal, so we might see it back in Dunoon again.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome this debate; we have found ourselves
in an interesting situation, in that the first question in the Scottish
Parliament was on the issue of the Cowal-Dunoon ferry service and the first
members' debate after the recess is on the Cowal situation again. That
is what the Scottish Parliament is about.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Both Duncan and Jamie have mentioned uncertainty.
The crucial issue in this debate is the uncertainty hanging over Dunoon
pier and the future of CalMac on the Clyde. That has an impact even further
down the Clyde, on the Rothesay-Wemyss Bay service, in which I have a passing
interest.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Cowal economy has experienced some
difficult times resulting from the closure of the Holy loch base, but uncertainty
about the future of Dunoon pier and the ferry service is having a detrimental
effect on investment decisions in the area. Indeed, the chief executive
of Western Ferries told me yesterday that it has suspended its decision
to purchase a new boat until this issue has been resolved. That is a clear
example of the effects of the uncertainty.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Amid the talk of crisis, we have to be
careful and take a balanced approach. There are some good- news stories
in among the doom and gloom. The number of telecommunications service centres
has expanded rapidly over the past two years; indeed, with the opening
of a second centre, the number of employees in that sector will increase
from some 70 to 170. The minister and I visited Database Direct yesterday.
It announced that the number of its employees is increasing from 87 to
119. Those are full-time jobs. There is some expansion there.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I thank the minister for coming to view
the situation at first hand yesterday. I have asked Sarah Boyack, the Minister
for Transport and the Environment, to come and consult local people about
how to proceed and resolve the future of Dunoon pier and the ferry service.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> Please

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>George Lyon: </strong>It is very important
that we get the Deloitte &amp; Touche report published. We have to bear

it is happy with the report being published.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">friend Alasdair
Morrison will be positive-there is from Highlands and Islands Enterprise
or officials of Argyll and Bute Council, there is a crisis of confidence
and an economic crisis. It does not help to hide from that fact. Duncan
Hamilton has outlined some of the elements of that crisis. Let us consider
some of the positive solutions. I welcome Jamie McGrigor's conversion on
the question of local authority aid. It seems to me that that was always
blocked when the Secretary of State for Scotland was a Tory, but I always
welcome lost sheep into the fold. If he now supports this campaign, that
is well and good. The Government has a duty to recognise the special circumstances-the
island circumstances-of the local council, and to take action on them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I say to Maureen that the question is not
one of refurbishing a pier. We cannot refurbish something that is falling
down. We must rebuild the pier and get the breakwater. The distinguished
pier that celebrated its centenary last year is the life-blood of Cowal
and must be preserved. It was a dereliction of duty by the local council
before the change of administration-I have hopes of the new administration,
as my party and Mr Lyon's party are in it, and we have a chance to change
things-to allow that pier to collapse. The worst thing that ever happened
to Cowal was the election of a so-called independent administration, which
was led by Councillor Dick Walsh. It was a disaster for the town.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Fortunately, in the new politics we have
decided to let bygones be bygones. The <i>Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire
Standard</i> is leading the way with an all-party campaign. Let us get
behind a campaign for island status for Argyll and Bute, restoration of
Dunoon pier and investment in transport links. Let us get some energy into
the local enterprise company and let us ensure that the ideas that Maureen
talked about-the good ideas that appear every week in the columns of the
<i>Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard</i>-are translated into reality
by a sympathetic council and a sympathetic enterprise company, both supported
adequately by this Administration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that we will hear an enthusiastic
message from Alasdair today. He will be very welcome in Cowal again and
I shall welcome him into my own house-that was not a bribe-as long as he
has something to offer to the community, which feels in crisis, wants assistance
and has a community newspaper that is pushing the issue. We can solve the
problem, but we can only do so together. We must recognise the problem
that exists.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I will certainly take up Mike's kind invitation to visit him in his house.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The motion talks about a crisis. It is
important to stress that the claim that there is a crisis is not supported
by facts. As George said, I was delighted to visit the Cowal peninsula
this week. Inward investment has been talked about. The main purpose of
the visit was to announce that Government support, which we are providing
through the enterprise network, will create another 32 information technology
jobs in one of Argyll's most prominent companies, Database Direct. That
will boost the total work force at the company to around 120.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As an islander, I appreciate how important
communications, particularly ferry services, are for any community that
relies on them. There can be no doubt that Dunoon's prospects are closely
linked to the frequency and accessibility of the ferry services that connect
it with the other side of the Clyde.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As an islander, I am also well aware of
the importance of good connections to remote areas. My visit to Dunoon
and the Cowal peninsula yesterday heightened my awareness of the importance
of ferry services to the area.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>Will the minister
give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Morrison: </strong>I have already gone
over by 30 seconds, so I cannot let Fergus intervene.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Important public policy issues are involved.
There are transport links involving subsidised competition with a private
operator and there is a call, against very tight expenditure constraints,
for significant investment in new infrastructure.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My colleague the Minister for Transport
and the Environment, Sarah Boyack, has made it plain that a consultation
document on options for the future of ferry services between Gourock and
Dunoon will soon be made publicly available. I can assure Duncan Hamilton
and the people of Cowal that Sarah Boyack and other ministers approach
the consultation process with open minds and with no preconceptions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One issue that is intimately tied up with
such considerations is the condition of Dunoon pier. As Jamie McGrigor
pointed out, it is a Victorian landmark which, along with the castle hill
and the statue of Burns's Highland Mary, makes up what many generations
have recognised as the classic view of Dunoon-a view that I enjoyed yesterday.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The pier is owned by Argyll and Bute Council
and the maintenance of the infrastructure, which has listed building status,
is therefore the responsibility of the council.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
