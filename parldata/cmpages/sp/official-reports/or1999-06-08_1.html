<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding
Officer (Sir David Steel):</strong> The first item of business this afternoon
will be consideration of Parliamentary Bureau motion S1M-35 to amend the
business programme that was agreed by Parliament on Wednesday 2 June, and
an amendment to that motion. Before I call Mr Tom McCabe to move the business
motion, I remind members that under standing orders there should be no
more than one speaker for and one speaker against the motion and any amendment
to it, and that each speaker may speak for no longer than five minutes.
As there is one amendment, the debate may last up to 20 minutes, with one
speaker for the motion, one for the amendment, one against the motion and
one against the amendment. Each speaker will be limited to five minutes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>On
a point of order, Mr Presiding Officer. I wonder whether you could use
your good influence to ensure that we are given adequate notice of the
business that we are about to discuss. Yesterday, when I asked at the chamber
office for a copy of the motions and amendments that we would be discussing
today, I was told that they were not available. A business bulletin was
published this morning, which details the motions and some of the amendments
that are to be debated today, but at the last minute we have been handed-by
one of the Parliament's staff-a copy of subsequent amendments.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not blame the members who lodged those
later amendments; I understand why they lodged them. However, the original
motions should surely have been lodged so as to give us greater opportunity
to propose amendments to them. That raises the general question of the
lack of notice, even of the meetings of the Parliament. Mr Presiding Officer,
can you ensure that we are given more than a week's notice of meetings,
and more than one day's notice of motions and amendments?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> I have every
sympathy with that point of order-I have raised the matter myself in the
Parliamentary Bureau. The problem stems from the short notice that is required,
under the standing orders that we have inherited, for the lodging of motions
and amendments. We have&nbsp;</font></td>

Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I do not want to get a reputation
for moving amendments or for being negative about business motions. I propose
a technical change to motion S1M-35 and have lodged motion S1M-41, which
deals with information technology and office equipment. We were advised
that those matters could not be covered by the allowances motion because
they did not come under the heading of allowances. However, all parties
felt that information technology should form part of today's debate, as
there will be support for members in that area. Accordingly, and with Mr
McCabe's agreement, I seek permission for debate on that issue to be included
in this afternoon's business, as was originally intended.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Russell, and
agree that it would be sensible to include a discussion on information
technology and office equipment in the debate on members' allowances. The
amendment is not contentious; it deals with a technical matter that was
omitted in the drafting of motion S1M-35.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The business motion seeks to make two amendments
to the programme of business to which the Parliament agreed on Wednesday
2 June. It proposes that, today, immediately after decision time, there
should be a 30-minute debate on the subject of motion S1M-24, in the name
of Dr Sylvia Jackson, on the Loch Lomond and Trossachs national park. That
will be the first members' business debate. Such debates will be included
in the business programme regularly, and the subject will be chosen by
the Parliamentary Bureau from the motions that members have lodged. The
debates will give members the opportunity to have debated by the Parliament
issues that they consider to be of particular local interest or concern.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The other amendment proposed in the business
motion affects tomorrow's business. It is proposed that, at 10.30 am, the
First Minister will make a statement on legislation in the UK Parliament
concerning devolved matters. That will allow him to respond to some of
the points raised during last week's debate on the orders made under the
Scotland Act 1998. The matter is of particular interest and relevance to
the Parliament, and the Parliamentary Bureau has taken the view that it
should be included in the business programme at an early date.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The debate will be followed, no later than
11 am, by a debate on the consultative steering group report. The bureau
proposes that the remaining business should remain as set out in the business
motion that was approved by the Parliament on 2 June.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and
Fife) (Con): </strong>On a point of order. Mr McCabe explained that the reason
for having members' business after decision time was so that we could have
the opportunity to debate members' concerns. Could you clarify whether
other members will be able to speak in such debates?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>That is the
case, but members' business debates are very short and are the property
of the member who has secured them. Speaking off the top of my head, I
think that the right thing to do would be to consult the member who has
secured the debate and to seek his or her agreement about whether it is
reasonable for another member to intervene. As a matter of courtesy, that
would be the right way of doing it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
