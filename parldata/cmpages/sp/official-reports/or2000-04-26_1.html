              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ian Baillie (Royal 
                National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen):</strong> Good afternoon.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Others went out on 
                the sea in ships; they were merchants on the mighty waters. They 
                saw the works of the Lord and his wonderful deeds in the deep, 
                for he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves. 
                They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths. In 
                their peril their courage melted away. Then they cried out to 
                the Lord in their trouble and he brought them out of their distress. 
                He stilled the storm to a whisper and the waves of the sea were 
                hushed. They were glad when it grew calm and he guided them to 
                their desired haven.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus calmed the storm 
                when he was in the boat with the fishermen. We have the guidance 
                of the Parliament in our country's calm times and its restless 
                times. In our times of trouble and distress we all look for a 
                safe haven, which we might find in our particular faith, in our 
                family or in some special part of Scotland. From Mallaig to Scrabster; 
                in Stornoway and Lerwick on the islands; and from Aberdeen to 
                Eyemouth, the fishermen's mission offers such a haven in its centres 
                and through its network of staff across the country.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fishermen's mission 
                has been caring for fishermen and their families and communities 
                for more than a century. It gives financial, practical and spiritual 
                help to shipwrecked, sick, distressed, disabled, retired and sea-going 
                fishermen and to their wives, widows and children, irrespective 
                of their creed or race.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the first month 
                of the new millennium, nine men were killed, nine vessels lost 
                and 56 men rescued. Fishing is our most dangerous industry and 
                has been a major source of employment in Scotland for many years. 
                As a representative of the mission and of our country's fishermen 
                I am honoured to share these thoughts with the Parliament. Let 
                us pray.</font></P>

                East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP): </strong>I am most grateful for the 
                opportunity to move, under rule 8.2.6, that motion S1M-778, on 
                the assisted areas map, be taken at 4.15 pm without notice.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am indebted to the 
                Presiding Officer for indicating that it is accepted that the 
                matter meets the stringent criteria that govern such motions without 
                notice.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Presiding Officer 
                (Sir David Steel): </strong>That is correct. I have decided to accept 
                the motion, which means that the Parliament itself will decide 
                whether to debate that matter later this afternoon. Mr Ewing may 
                introduce his motion now, in two minutes, and I will call Alasdair 
                Morrison to respond for the Executive.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>I 
                am obliged, Presiding Officer. There are four reasons why the 
                motion should be moved without notice&#151;as is customary&#151;and 
                I apologise for any lack of courtesy and for any inconvenience 
                that members have suffered in giving up other commitments to come 
                here today.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, I make no apology 
                for arguing that the future lives and livelihoods of thousands 
                of people in the Highlands and Islands will be at stake if the 
                areas that were removed from the initial map&#151;as submitted 
                to the European Commission&#151;are not reinstated. This comes 
                at a time when more than 2,500 people are about to be made redundant 
                at BARMAC. In proportionate terms, that is the biggest redundancy 
                in the United Kingdom&#151;the matter is vital to the Highlands 
                and Islands.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, I was delighted 
                yesterday to be able to secure all-party support for the motion. 
                I was pleased to receive support from Mary Scanlon of the Conservatives, 
                John Farquhar Munro of the Liberal Democrats and Maureen Macmillan 
                of the Labour party. I believe that that cross-party approach&#151;which 
                I also pursued with the Westminster MP, David Stewart, in a joint 
                press statement last week&#151;is not only expected of all elected 
                representatives in the Highlands, but is the approach that we 
                were elected to pursue when that is appropriate. We were elected 
                to pursue a common approach&#151;albeit with robust arguments&#151;but, 
                none the less, in pursuit of a shared aim.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thirdly, it has not 
                been possible to introduce the matter before today. The announcement 
                of the exclusion of Inverness, Nairn, Moray, and Badenoch and 
                Strathspey from the assisted areas map as proposed to the European

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fourthly, this is an 
                emergency in the sense that the consultation period, although 
                it was announced during the recess, will conclude next Tuesday, 
                on 2 May. Today, therefore, is the only opportunity for members 
                of our Parliament to influence the consultation process. If the 
                Parliament means anything, it means that members from all parties, 
                who have expressed support for the motion, should have an opportunity 
                to debate the subject, which is detailed and complicated, but 
                which is, however, absolutely crucial to the lives and livelihoods 
                of thousands of people throughout the Highlands and Islands.</font></P>

                for Highlands and Islands and Gaelic (Mr Alasdair Morrison): </strong>As 
                Fergus Ewing outlined, the new assisted areas map proposals were 
                announced by the Government on 10 April. This matter is reserved, 
                but even the UK Government does not have full discretion in designating 
                assisted areas, which must be approved by the European Commission.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As part of the proposals 
                that were published in July 1999, all the Highlands and Islands 
                area was put forward for inclusion on the basis of its overall 
                population sparsity. However, the Commission would not accept 
                inclusion of the whole area on that basis, and the Inverness area 
                does not qualify as sparsely populated.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr Ewing referred to 
                a period of consultation. There is such a period, which runs until 
                2 May, during which interested parties are invited to submit views 
                on the revised proposals. A number of Highlands interests have 
                already made representations and their views will be taken into 
                account as part of the consultation process. Indeed, discussions 
                about the proposals that were announced on 10 April took place 
                last week between the chief executive of Highlands and Islands 
                Enterprise and the senior official who leads the Scottish side 
                of the assisted areas map review. I understand that further such 
                discussions are likely.</font></P>

                The same words would have been helpful in instructing Mr Ewing

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Presiding Officer:

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has been a great 
                pleasure, in the first year of this Parliament, to be convener 
                of the Rural Affairs Committee, particularly because of the way 
                in which committee members have worked together and how that has 
                largely allowed political divisions to disappear when we have 
                discussed issues that are important for Scotland's fisheries and 
                rural communities.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a strong tendency 
                among the committee's members to leave their political cloaks 
                at the door. That has happened on almost every subject that we 
                have discussed&#151;with the possible exception of the impact 
                of the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 which, as 
                it happens, is the issue on which the motion that I have lodged 
                is based.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The committee found 
                that it had divisions on this matter during the preparation of 
                its report and even during the decision whether to progress with 
                today's motion. It is appropriate that I should bring that fact 
                to the Parliament's attention, given that it is always important 
                for members of the committee to be allowed to have their views

                were put forward in the debate on 3 June last year, but follows 
                up the key outstanding issues that were raised then. The committee 
                takes seriously the disappointment that the Scottish Fishermen's 
                Federation continues to express. It has been argued that a resolution 
                of this problem&#151;or even a decision that is more widely accepted&#151;could 
                help to restore confidence among the fishing community. The persistent 
                concerns of the fishing industry that the committee accepts should 
                be addressed are the level of consultation that was carried out 
                prior to the introduction of the boundaries order and the scope 
                for confusion that was created by the choice of boundary that 
                was made.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The committee accepts 
                that the processes leading up to devolution may have affected 
                the preparation and the publication of the order. In particular, 
                the committee is concerned by two matters that may have resulted 
                from lack of consultation. First, when the boundary order was 
                introduced, no inconsistency with the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore 
                Activities) Order 1987 appears to have been identified. Secondly, 
                the amount of fishing activity in the disputed area does not appear 
                to have influenced the order. That became clear during evidence 
                taking on 2 November, when Irene McGugan asked:</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Were records 
                checked, to determine who fished mostly in the disputed area&#151;whether 
                Scottish or English vessels?&quot;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The minister replied:</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We lack information 
                on that. There has been light policing of that territory, and 
                there is precious little evidence of boardings or sightings of 
                vessels from any country in that area. We do not have detailed 
                information on that.&quot;&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, <I>Rural

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Scottish Fishermen's 
                Federation subsequently provided information that it had received 
                from the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency on 3 June 1999, 
                showing boardings and sightings of Scottish vessels between April 
                1996 and March 1999 in the vicinity of the median line. It is 
                the committee's opinion that, had that information been available 
                earlier, it might have influenced the discussion on the order.</font></P>

                to include in the report was the scope for confusion created by 
                the order. In his evidence, the minister sought to steer debate 
                away from the sensational comment about winning or losing specific 
                amounts of sea area and explained that this is a new boundary

                no legal significance. That patrolling boundary has been quoted 
                as the boundary of custom and repute.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reference has already 
                been made to the existence of another boundary between Scottish 
                and English waters, which was established by the Civil Jurisdiction 
                (Offshore Activities) Order 1987 for the purposes of the Continental 
                Shelf Act 1964. Within the territorial waters&#151;up to the 12-mile 
                limit&#151;the two boundaries are close but are separated by a 
                distance of 0.09 km. That means that, out to the 12-mile limit, 
                there is an area&#151;not exactly a gap&#151;in which the boundaries 
                do not agree.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That brings me to my 
                next point. I mentioned the scope for confusion. The area between 
                the boundaries has not only confused the issue, but confused the 
                committee. Examples of that were highlighted during the preparation 
                of the report, such as the problem of Scottish boats operating 
                between the two boundaries being under Scots law if they are undertaking 
                oil contract work and under English law if they are fishing in 
                the disputed zone. To emphasise that confusion, the report gets 
                those two positions the wrong way round. I ask the minister to 
                acknowledge that correction.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Home Robertson 
                argued that the potential for confusion over oil-related work 
                was hypothetical. He advised that there are three decommissioned 
                oil installations in the area, which have been cleared as safe 
                for normal commercial fishing, and that two further oil installations 
                will be disposed of in the same way. The committee believes that 
                the existence of two different boundaries between Scottish and 
                English waters in the North sea could lead to confusion, as I 
                have explained.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On what solution might 
                be recommended, some members of the committee felt that we should 
                not follow the same course as the House of Commons committee, 
                which considered the matter by seeking to define a boundary line 
                without adequate consultation. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation 
                has pointed out that the newly adopted median line runs straight 
                through the Berwick bank fishing ground and it has warned of the 
                possibility of fishing regulations being varied, at some point 
                in the future, across the Scottish/English boundary in that vicinity. 
                The minister has assured the committee that the present Administration 
                would not seek to make any regulations that differ from those 
                that exist on the other side of the boundary, but the possibility 
                remains that, with the devolution of fisheries powers, we may 
                in future create different regimes on either side of that boundary.</font></P>

                and recommends that the line that is defined by the Civil Jurisdiction

                arguments for taking no action on the fishermen's concerns was 
                that the imposition of the boundary would pose no advantage or

                the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 may have consequences 
                for other legislation, beyond that affecting fishing. The order 
                contains two distinct definitions of boundaries. Article 3 sets 
                the boundaries for internal waters and the territorial sea; article 
                4 sets the boundaries for the sea within the British fisheries

                the United Kingdom as is adjacent to Scotland. The boundaries 
                of Scotland are therefore partly set by this order, which means 
                that other legislation relying upon that definition of Scotland&#151;such

                by this choice of subject for a full-scale debate in the chamber. 
                Indeed, Mr Johnstone acknowledged the fact that the committee's

                is certainly one of the most important responsibilities that we 
                have assumed in this new Scottish Parliament and a number of major 
                issues face our fishing communities at present. In recent meetings 
                with the SFF and around the coast, we have had representations 
                on many issues such as the review of the common fisheries policy; 
                problems arising from the underdeclaration of engine power; restrictions 
                on scallop fishing due to amnesic shellfish poisoning; initiatives 
                to conserve stocks by using square mesh panels; the need to claim 
                a Scottish share of developing fisheries in the north-east Atlantic; 
                and, most important of all, safety measures. I could go on&#151;the 
                list is quite long&#151;but the subject of the boundary of the

                and constituency interest in the fishing communities closest to 
                the new demarcation line. Dunbar and Port Seton are in my constituency; 
                until last year, I was a member of Eyemouth Harbour Trust, in 
                Euan Robson's constituency; my wife's council ward includes Burnmouth,

                should be concerned about lines on maps. The matter is also of 
                interest to some journalists. However, the Executive has been 
                working with the SFF and others to try to address the issues that 
                really affect the interests of Scottish fishermen. We have been

                10 months since we assumed responsibility for Scottish fisheries, 
                and we have made significant progress.</font></P>

                of introducing groundbreaking conservation measures in the North 
                sea; thanks to that initiative we succeeded in negotiating an 
                increase of 8,000 tonnes in the total allowable catch for haddock&#151;mostly 
                for Scottish fishermen. We got a very good deal for Scotland at 
                the December Fisheries Council in the European Union. We have 
                set up the new Scottish inshore fisheries advisory group, to give 
                our fishermen a direct input into policy discussions. We have 
                begun the process of increasing local management by approving 
                the Shetland Islands Regulated Fishery (Scotland) Order 1999.

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have been able to 
                make that progress precisely because the Parliament and the Executive 
                have taken responsibility for Scotland's fisheries. That transfer 
                of responsibility required the area of the Scottish fishery zone 
                to be defined for the first time; that is what the boundary is 
                all about. I am pleased to note that the Rural Affairs Committee

                the committee's concern about the lack of consultation before 
                the boundary was created. A press release was sent to the SFF 
                and others on 8<SUP> </SUP>March 1999 and the order was debated 
                in committee in both Houses of the Westminster Parliament on 23<SUP> 
                </SUP>March. We have accepted that consultation with the industry 
                should have been much more proactive. We are going to great lengths 
                to establish inclusive and open channels for consultation on fisheries 
                policy in keeping with the Executive's commitment to make government

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the debate on

                decisions concerning our Scottish zone. We are fulfilling that 
                promise. The industry has been consulted about proposed regulations 
                and it has been actively involved in drafting measures such as 
                the Irish sea cod recovery plan and those designed to implement 
                conservation of juvenile haddock in the North sea. On that last 
                point, the industry asked us for more stringent conservation requirements

                4 June 1999, after the previous debate. The Secretary of State 
                for Scotland also met SFF representatives on 24 June. However, 
                as there is no evidence whatsoever that the location of the boundary 
                has any effect on fishermen's interests, the secretary of state 
                has concluded that the median line is an appropriate boundary.</font></P>

                might be made on either side of the line at some future date, 
                which is the point made by Mr Tosh. Yes, with devolved powers 
                we could make different regulations, but it would be absurd for 
                either the Scottish Executive or the Ministry of Agriculture, 
                Fisheries and Food to create circumstances that would harm the 
                interests of Scottish and English fishermen. Apart from anything 
                else, we have an agreed fisheries concordat, which requires consultation 
                between MAFF and ourselves on matters of mutual concern. There

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Mr Johnstone said, 
                the report comments on the fact that the boundary set by the Civil 
                Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987 is not the same 
                as the fisheries boundary. I do not know whether that was considered 
                when the fishery boundary was drawn, but I do not accept that 
                it gives rise to any confusion. The adjacent waters boundary applies 
                to fishing activities, which cannot really be confused with tasks 
                associated with oil industry activities. Differences between fisheries 
                boundaries and continental shelf demarcations are not unusual. 
                The latest agreement with Denmark and the Faroe Islands, signed 
                on 18 May 1999, has different lines for fisheries and for the 
                continental shelf.</font></P>

                famous 6,000 square miles. We can now reflect on that with the 
                benefit of 10 months' experience. The key point is that fishermen 
                retain their rights to fish where they have a legitimate track 
                record, regardless of the creation of the new Scottish zone. Scottish 
                boats therefore retain their rights to trawl for prawns off the 
                coast of Northumberland, for mackerel off the coast of Cornwall, 
                for sea bass in the English channel and for scallops in the Irish 
                sea, to name just four different fisheries&#151;there are many

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have obtained some 
                figures for fishing activity that may help to put this debate 
                into perspective. We reckon that the sea-fishing activities of 
                our 2,600 Scottish boats in the 43 weeks since the boundary was 
                created will have been in the region of 400,000 trawler days at 
                sea. Meanwhile, we have established from logbook reports that 
                our fleet clocked up just 160 trawler days in the 6,000 square 
                mile segment east of the land border. Therefore, fishing in that 
                area accounts for less than half of 1 per cent of our fleet's 
                activities. To say that the area is lightly fished would be something 
                of an understatement. The area has been patrolled by the Royal 
                Navy fishery protection service since 1 July 1999, but no fishing 
                vessel from any nation has been prosecuted for any alleged breach 
                of fishing regulations, and there are no cases pending.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The committee concluded 
                that responsibility for any change to the boundary lies with the 
                Westminster Parliament and recommended that the Secretary of State 
                for Scotland should establish a new boundary running well south 
                of the median line. The Executive is content to take note of that 
                recommendation from the committee, and we will not vote against 
                the motion, but it is important to recognise that such a change 
                to the boundary would not achieve any advantage whatsoever for 
                our fleet and it could undermine our excellent relationships with 
                fishing interests in other parts of the UK, so I would be inclined 
                to oppose such a measure in the House of Commons if it were ever 
                to come to a vote.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the second

                the UK Parliament. I hope that we can now move forward and concentrate 
                on issues that really do affect the interests of Scottish fishermen 
                and which lie within the responsibilities of this Parliament. 
                I want to get the best possible deal for Scottish fishermen: the

                regulations; a better return from the market for better quality

                that the minister and his colleagues had hoped that the matter 
                was dead and buried a year ago, but it is alive and kicking and

                fishing industry on keeping the issue in the limelight and on 
                continuing the campaign. The Deputy Minister for Rural Affairs 
                said that the boundary dispute is a non-issue, but it is one of 
                the most significant issues to have faced this Parliament. He 
                said that it was not an issue for our fishing communities, yet 
                one has only to look at the time and expense that fishermen's 
                representatives have put into campaigning for the boundary to 
                be changed to see that it is. They have issued leaflets and given 
                briefings; they have attended party conferences to put their case. 
                The minister and I attended the Scottish Fishermen's Federation 
                annual dinner recently, where the boundary dispute was the No 
                1 priority in the president's speech. So that the minister is 
                aware of the strength of feeling around the country, I will send 
                him a copy of the SNP's petition on the boundary dispute, which 
                has been signed by thousands of people in the hope that they can

                their conscience and to take on board the following information. 
                We know now that the new boundary was created by an obscure committee 
                in Westminster that could not be bothered to wait to consult the 
                Scottish Parliament, which was just about to be established. We 
                know now that ministers accept that there was a lack of consultation 
                by the Westminster Parliament&#151;they have described that lack 
                of consultation as deplorable. Ministers have admitted that the 
                information on which to base a valid decision was not available 
                and that there was no attempt to find it. Ross Finnie said in 
                the debate last June that the order related only to fisheries, 
                yet, as the Rural Affairs Committee discovered, it has implications 
                for many other matters, such as the Food Safety Act 1990 and the 
                Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, as Alex Johnstone said

                fishing boundary is to say that we should not worry, because the 
                line is based on international conventions; the Government knows 
                what it is doing because it gave a lot of thought to the location

                per cent of cases involving the fishing and economic zones of 
                opposite countries, such as Britain and Norway, are settled on 
                a median basis; and that between countries that have adjacent

                Why did the management boundary issue arise in the first place? 
                We have not had an answer that convinces anybody&#151;and the

                consultation? What was the Government afraid of? Was this yet

                the Labour Government, with the minister meekly standing by? Does 
                the minister feel that there is anything to apologise for? He 
                has heard from Richard Lochhead of the efforts made by the fishermen's

                been moved, is there a risk that the 1987 line may be moved at 
                some future date? The minister might be setting a dangerous precedent. 
                I am no more a lawyer than Richard Lochhead is, so I do not know 
                the answer, but I raise the point in earnest. We must start thinking

                the fact that this Parliament is taking responsibility for a wide

                including fisheries, and that, if we are to take responsibility

                worked fine. The fishery protection vessels covered that area 
                and the Royal Navy came up to that line. What we have now is a 
                no-man's land. I was interested to hear the minister say that 
                the Royal Navy had been patrolling the area. It might have a responsibility 
                to do so, but the fishermen's leaders say that they have not sighted 
                a patrol vessel there. Can the minister give us any evidence that 
                the area is being protected? Protection against illegal fishing 
                in that area&#151;particularly from abroad&#151;is in the interests 
                of all Britain's fishermen. I would like the minister to give

                asked it to state the difficulties that fishermen were facing 
                over the issue. That statement was sent within a week of the meeting. 
                In return, he promised that the Government would send out a circular 
                to skippers and owners explaining why the change was a good thing

                he did not do so in the form of a circular, but he wrote to the 
                chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation on 15 September. 
                The substantial letter addressed a number of the fishermen's points. 
                Consultation took place and a response was given. On the narrow 
                point, as to whether a circular was produced, I concede that David 
                Davidson is right, but would he concede that the secretary of

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>I 
                made a point, and I will stand by it. I have been advised that 
                it is correct. The fishermen expected the secretary of state to 
                respond, as he said he would. As far as I am aware, he did not 
                withdraw that offer to the Scottish Fishermen's Federation.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us examine the 
                way in which the Executive deals with matters. The Executive seems 
                content to accept at face value comments and activities of ministers 
                in London that affect all parts of the UK. There is the continuing 
                saga of Scottish trust fishing ports. John Prescott decided, in 
                his wisdom, to issue a regulation that would remove the elected 
                status of many of those port authorities and introduce a system 
                of appointees, despite the fact that their boards had worked efficiently 
                over many centuries and represented the users of the ports and 
                the hinterland that serviced and was serviced by the ports. Within 
                an hour of the statement's release in London, a minister here&#151;not 
                the fishing minister&#151;issued a press release saying that that 
                was okay by her.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Executive in Northern 
                Ireland said, &quot;We are not doing this; we will reserve our 
                position and consider whether this piece of legislation will adversely 
                affect our ports.&quot; Why did the Scottish Executive do what 
                it did without seeking to consult? The evidence is damning; the 
                minister will eventually have to explain to us what he will do 
                and how the fishing community can have confidence in its dealings 
                with the Executive.</font></P>

                and long-standing rights to be protected by Scottish law and to 
                be represented in a Scottish court have been usurped. The Berwick 
                bank fishing, enjoyed by Scottish boats for generations, is now 
                divided between two jurisdictions. The boundary was not drawn 
                with any regard to fishing; it was an arbitrary line that was 
                drawn unnecessarily, although the minister will argue that it 
                was done by international agreement.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In last year's debate, 
                Ross Finnie stated that he would write to the appropriate Westminster 
                minister to explore whether flexibility might be applied to prosecutions, 
                should anybody allegedly transgress in the area. Has that letter 
                been written? If so, what response has there been? The minister 
                was keen to intervene earlier; perhaps he would like to give us 
                an answer to that now.</font></P>

                the same debate, Euan Robson asked why the Government was invoking 
                international law in a domestic situation. We did not get an answer 
                then; I hope that we will get an answer to that question today. 
                Perhaps, if Mr Robson participates in this debate, he will ask 
                his question again. We will listen with interest to hear what 
                answer he gets this time.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we are a United

                so divergent between England and Scotland that common sense, instead 
                of international law, cannot settle them.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Further to Mr Finnie's 
                comments about rights, has the Executive researched the value 
                of contracts to the oil industry that could be lost to Scottish 
                vessels? Having listened to the minister's comments today, especially 
                his answers to members' questions, I wonder what ministers have 
                learned since last June.</font></P>

                supports the fishermen; it would show them they can have confidence 
                in us to look after their genuine interests and concerns. The 
                Executive must not just accept the motion moved by the convener

                (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): </strong>The first thing 
                that I would like to make absolutely clear is the firm support 
                from the Liberal Democrat group for the terms of the motion. Both 
                John Farquhar Munro and I, as Liberal Democrat members of the 
                Rural Affairs Committee, voted for this motion in committee to 
                ensure that a practical way forward could be found in which to 
                resolve the problem and to support our fishermen.</font></P>

                who has followed the history of this affair, so ably outlined 
                by Alex Johnstone, can only draw the conclusion that a simple 
                mistake was made when the Westminster Parliament drew up the Scottish 
                Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999. The first attempt to put 
                that mistake right was made in this chamber when we debated the 
                issue on 3 June 1999; the Executive has addressed the terms of 
                the motion that was agreed on that occasion.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, no moves 
                were made by Westminster on the issue, and the Rural Affairs Committee 
                rightly decided to pursue this important matter. The committee 
                decided to recommend that the Secretary of State for Scotland 
                should either introduce a revised order or support the bill proposed 
                in the House of Commons by Archy Kirkwood MP calling for a revised 
                boundary. That was, and remains, the practical way forward.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The way in which the 
                SNP and the Conservatives seem to have politicised the issue, 
                by using it, metaphorically speaking, to beat Labour over the 
                head at every opportunity, has ensured that the Secretary of State 
                for Scotland has not budged.</font></P>

                of those views, as he has some small responsibility up there&#151;how 
                can he claim that we are being political? We are merely acting

                have described appeals particularly to SNP members, who continue

                weapon to keep bashing Labour. In using those tactics, the SNP 
                risks damaging its case for the boundary change. The SNP is using 
                real anxieties expressed by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation 
                to promote its own interests and the nationalist agenda.</font></P>

                SNP's position is completely illogical if campaigning on this 
                issue is part of its strategy for independence. However, that 
                does not stop the SNP. The issue provides it with a good opportunity 
                to keep giving Labour a good bashing. Who said that we were in 
                the era of new politics?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I return to my main 
                point. The complete lack of action by the Secretary of State for 
                Scotland has provided the SNP with a campaigning issue from what 
                should essentially be a technical matter stemming from the home 
                rule settlement. If fishermen had been properly consulted in the 
                first place, they would have had more confidence in the finalised 
                boundary.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The secretary of state's 
                view can be justified only if he believes that changing the boundary 
                sets an unwelcome precedent. In my view, that is an entirely negative 
                and unnecessary approach. He could have taken the opportunity 
                to demonstrate positively that both the UK Government and the 
                Scottish Executive are prepared to work in partnership to smooth 
                out difficulties such as this that have emerged as a result of

                realise that that is what home rule is all about. Westminster

                Lochhead would agree that the report is aimed at the Secretary 
                of State for Scotland. It recommends that he does one of two things: 
                introduce a new, revised order or support the bill calling for 
                a new boundary that was proposed in the House of Commons by Archy 
                Kirkwood, whose constituency, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, this 
                matter most directly affects. The Rural Affairs Committee is clear 
                on that; it is what this debate is all about. The debate is not

                particular uses every opportunity that this mistake and the failure

                (Aberdeen Central) (Lab): </strong>Like other members, I was pleased 
                to hear Mike Rumbles's new motto&#151;&quot;Stop bashing Labour&quot;&#151;and 
                I hope to hear it resound around the chamber many times over the 
                next three years. Like other members, I welcome the fact that 
                we are debating a rural affairs issue, and a fisheries issue. 
                However, I do not pretend to welcome the fact that the majority 
                of members of the Rural Affairs Committee put this specific issue 
                at the top of their list of priorities. I do not believe that 
                it is the most pressing issue that faces the Scottish fishing 
                industry today.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important that 
                members in general be aware of the full facts about the Rural 
                Affairs Committee's report and the views of all the committee 
                members. I draw members' attention, first, to one sentence in 
                the report, in paragraph 13, which was quoted by Alex Johnstone, 
                the committee convener. It states that</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;some members 
                of the Committee felt that it should not follow the same course 
                as the House of Commons Committee which considered this matter, 
                by seeking to define a boundary line without adequate consultation.&quot;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alex Johnstone said 
                that all views were taken into account in the preparation of the 
                report but, sadly, that one sentence is all that survives&#151;in 
                the main body of the report or in the summary of findings and 
                conclusions&#151;as evidence of the fact that this issue divided 
                the membership of the Rural Affairs Committee and led to considerable 
                debate among those members on the correct way forward.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly, I was surprised 
                to discover that there is no provision in the standing orders 
                for a minority report from members of a parliamentary committee. 
                I was even more surprised to discover that the majority of members 
                of a committee, if they so wish, can vote to remove any reference 
                to a division of opinion from the body of text of a committee 
                report. So, there can be no minority report, and no right for 
                minority views to be published or for the arguments to be laid 
                out in the report of a parliamentary committee&#151;that is very 
                unfortunate. Further, as the drafts of the report were debated 
                and decided upon in private, there is not even an <I>Official 
                Report</I> of those proceedings.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Richard Lochhead:

                speech talking about parliamentary procedure, would he care to 
                address the Rural Affairs Committee's report?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis Macdonald: 
                </strong>Sadly, Richard Lochhead's intervention is very much in line 
                with his approach to the whole debate. As a member of the Rural 
                Affairs Committee, I consider the procedures of the Parliament 
                and the committees to be of critical importance to us all; in 
                no way does that detract from the substance of the issue that 
                is before us. </font></P>

                </strong>Will the member confess that he is over-egging the custard 
                somewhat? In particular, in relation to his reference to divisions, 
                the only proposal was that reference to those divisions be removed 
                from the main body of the report to the appendix. There is no 
                question of anything being swept under the carpet regarding those 
                divisions.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis Macdonald: 
                </strong>It is true that there is reference in the report. If the reader 
                cares to search through the appendices and interpret them, it 
                is clear what the divisions were about. This is an important matter, 
                and I think that it is appropriate to bring it to Parliament's 
                attention in the debate.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rural Affairs Committee 
                has failed to support the principle of representing all views 
                as fully as it should. As I said, that is unfortunate. In the 
                end, however, in spite of the arguments that were made in private, 
                the majority of members chose to do just what they condemned Westminster 
                for doing: declaring where the boundaries of the two fisheries 
                zones should lie, without any consultation. One Parliament fails 
                to consult fishermen on where the Scottish and English fisheries 
                zones should begin and end, so somehow the other Parliament&#151;this 
                one&#151;is supposed to pretend to lay down the law, without consulting 
                anyone either, on precisely the same question. That proposition 
                makes no sense at all.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Richard Lochhead: 
                </strong>Lewis Macdonald says that the Rural Affairs Committee reached 
                its conclusions without consultation, but he was present when 
                the committee took evidence from the fishing organisations and 
                the Scottish Executive. Was that not consultation? Were the committee's 
                findings and recommendations not in line with the wishes of the 
                fishing industry in Scotland? If they were not, can Lewis Macdonald

                for a boundary line to define the legislative and administrative 
                competence of this Parliament. What was and continues to be in 
                doubt is the need for a new and separate line when a boundary 
                already existed for the purposes of civil jurisdiction offshore.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When giving evidence 
                to the committee, the minister was unable to identify any advantage 
                in having the boundary redrawn, and was unable to identify any 
                organisation that was in favour of or content with the new line. 
                The Scottish Fishermen's Federation, on the other hand, which 
                represents 90 per cent of the industry's catching capacity, was 
                unanimous in its opposition to the measure. That is quite a disparity.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The committee concluded 
                that the basis for this on-going difficulty was the lack of information 
                that was made available and the lack of consultation that took 
                place prior to the order's being approved. In total, that comprised 
                the issuing of a press release and the publication of a statutory 
                instrument. The minister has acknowledged that he would have liked 
                more consultation about the new boundary. He admits that the consultation 
                conducted by Westminster was flawed, but he still stands by the 
                UK Parliament's decision.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The committee learned 
                that no account was taken of the extent of fishing activity in 
                the disputed area. The minister admitted that he lacked information 
                on that matter&#151;information about boardings and sightings 
                in the past three years of Scottish vessels in the disputed area 
                that the SFF was able to supply and confirm. Some simple dialogue 
                with interested parties prior to any decision being taken would 
                have identified all the anomalies, objections and facts, and might 
                have resulted in a totally different outcome. We have the facts 
                now and are aware of the overwhelming objections of the industry. 
                It is time that we acted on those.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In giving evidence, 
                the minister pointed to another factor that was influential at 
                the time that this order was being processed. A substantial number 
                of consequential regulations and statutory instruments had to 
                be enacted prior to devolution. </font></P>

                decision of another Parliament that was at best a mistake and 
                at worst a piece of deception with potential long-term constitutional 
                implications? It would be disheartening for democracy in Scotland 
                if this Parliament ignored the overwhelming evidence compiled 
                by the Rural Affairs Committee and chose arrogantly to uphold 
                Westminster's decisions.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The findings of the 
                committee's report are clear. There is no good reason for having 
                two boundaries and a number of good reasons for having only one. 
                If, as the minister has stated, there is no advantage or disadvantage 
                arising from the location of the boundary, why was the Scottish 
                zone redefined and why does he continue to defend that decision 
                so vigorously?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I remind the minister 
                that the fishing industry is many times more important to the 
                Scottish economy than it is to the English economy. He has a duty 
                to defend the interests of one of our most significant traditional

                their case? While such problems may never happen, one complaint 
                that was not hypothetical was that of the lack of consultation 
                with the industry on the boundary. That complaint stood up to 
                scrutiny, which is why lessons must be learned and, I believe,

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Organisations now complain 
                to me about the mass of consultation documents they receive. That 
                is good, as it shows that the Executive is willing to listen. 
                The Executive has established the Scottish inshore fisheries advisory 
                group, which enables the fishing industry to have an on-going 
                dialogue with the Executive.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The committee also 
                dealt with the Shetland Islands Regulated Fishery (Scotland) Order 
                1999, which enables Shetland fishermen to manage locally their 
                industry, to plan ahead and to protect their livelihood and that 
                of their children. Such regulations are also being implemented 
                in Orkney, and I hope that they will be extended to the Highlands.</font></P>

                amendment to current legislation and which has important implications 
                for fishermen.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much of the economy 
                of the area where I was brought up depends on inshore fisheries. 
                Because of the lack of local control and management of those fisheries, 
                problems have arisen, with different fishing methods not being 
                implemented sympathetically. When I was a child, many of the creelers 
                caught lobsters and crabs, and some of them even caught prawns. 
                Now prawns are all that is left in that area.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The situation threatens 
                the economy of that fragile area. All creelers have to make their 
                living out of the prawn fishery now, as there is nothing left 
                to diversify into. Along with the community, I was pleased when 
                the minister arranged to visit the area, to see for himself the 
                problems that local fishermen face. That was the first time that 
                a politician with the power to do something about the problem 
                had listened to the fishermen's concerns. He strengthened the 
                liaison group set up to deal with their problems and, if that 
                does not solve a problem, I will have no hesitation in returning 
                to him to ask for other measures to be taken.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must listen to the

                we protect the rights of fishermen to fish in areas where, historically, 
                they have made their livings, by working with partners in the

                this is still a controversial issue. Fishermen throughout Scotland 
                have found the introduction of the new sea boundary for fisheries 
                off the east coast offensive, to say the least. In the manner 
                in which it was introduced, it was a disaster, and its implementation 
                was a presentational disaster. There was no consultation before 
                the event, nor was there any explanation after it. The fishermen's

                in which the Westminster Government chose to employ the convention 
                was, I say, inappropriate. The convention is sometimes used where 
                two landmasses lie on opposite sides of, for example, inlets, 
                straits or navigable channels. In similar cases, where the border 
                runs more or less at right angles to the coast, the convention 
                is almost never used.</font></P>

                The Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency thought that there was 
                a boundary: it used to publish it in its annual report, although 
                I notice that it has not published it in its report this year. 
                Many people thought that there was a boundary already, but we 
                must take the Secretary of State for Scotland's word for it that 
                there was not.</font></P>

                why, in this day and age, and bearing in mind that we are still 
                a unitary state, we need between England and Scotland two borders, 
                which are 60 miles apart. Why not use one line, the original jurisdiction

                on, the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 as a lasting 
                legacy and failure of the Westminster system. The issue is therefore 
                a test of how well the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive

                to landowners' representatives. We have commissioned a major inquiry

                will gather information from all sorts of groups and agencies 
                throughout Scotland. I am at a loss to explain why those many 
                important issues are not being discussed, and why we have spent

                to discuss issues that could improve the lives of people in Scotland's 
                rural areas. We can make changes that will increase rural employment; 
                we can have land reform to ensure that we know who owns the land 
                in Scotland; we can have national parks that are an asset to this 
                country; and we can have a debate on what constitutes a community. 
                I hope that the next time the Rural Affairs Committee brings a 
                debate to the chamber, we can start to talk about how to improve 
                the lives of people in Scotland, and not simply indulge in political

                a debate on assisted area status, which is an issue that impacts 
                on many rural communities. However, I notice that only Jamie Stone

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I said, the Labour 
                benches have been poorly attended this afternoon, and the Executive 
                itself has been aloof in its attitude. The arguments have been 
                very clearly made in this chamber and by the SFF and other organisations 
                that represent fishermen's interests. From letters that I have 
                received from constituents in the north-east and discussions with 
                local fishermen, I know the strength of feeling about the lack 
                of consultation and how this situation came about. Our fishing 
                communities expect us to debate these issues. As Irene McGugan, 
                Richard Lochhead and others have pointed out, not just the catching 
                aspect of fishing but the whole downstream activity is vital for 
                rural employment.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The minister and I 
                know the importance of the fishing industry. We have discussed 
                and debated fisheries issues for many years; in fact, we have 
                probably participated in more debates than people in the chamber 
                have had fish suppers. However, I must ask him whether this issue 
                will be discussed in the inter-Cabinet liaison mechanisms. Is 
                it going to be part of the protocols? Will the matter be discussed 
                at the next Fisheries Council and will the minister be in attendance? 
                Will he take a lead role and will he be voting? Will the attitudes 
                of the Parliament, which have been expressed so clearly by one 
                of our committees&#151;the committees are supposed to be the powerhouses

                the matter, both in committee and in Parliament. As others have 
                said, the debate was reintroduced in the chamber against the wishes 
                of the minority on the Rural Affairs Committee. As Cathy Peattie

                we seem to be spending a lot of time discussing an issue about 
                which the Scottish Parliament is unable to do anything. It is 
                not a question of meddling in other people's affairs; this is

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jamie McGrigor has 
                expressed an opinion which is very similar to that given by Irene 
                McGugan today, about the importance of the fishing industry to 
                the Scottish economy. However, the Tories in the House of Commons 
                take a very different view. Indeed, English Conservatives, such 
                as Oliver Letwin and Michael Fabricant, have argued that the eastern 
                part of the line is too far south and should extend further north. 
                Scottish Tories appear to have more in common with Scottish nationalists 
                than with their colleagues at Westminster. What has brought about 
                such a curious meeting of minds?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is only one situation 
                in which the difference between the fisheries boundary and the 
                civil jurisdiction offshore activities boundary might be problematic, 
                and that is if the nationalists are successful in separating Scotland 
                from the rest of the UK. Again, I can see why the nationalists 
                want to press that agenda, but why should the Tories? The Tories 
                like to portray themselves as the bulwark of the union.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Solway boundary 
                is a median line. It was not always so. The Royal Navy used to 
                patrol up to Ballantrae. According to Mr Davidson's argument about 
                custom and practice, that boundary should be retained. I am sure 
                that nobody particularly wants the western boundary to go up to 
                Ballantrae again, and that people would prefer it to stay at the 
                median in the Solway. If separation happens, constituents such 
                as mine in Dumfriesshire are likely to have much more to exercise 
                their minds than a line in the sea 12 miles east of the mainland.</font></P>

                avoidance of doubt or misrepresentation that I have always supported 
                the case about the boundary line made by the Scottish Fishermen's 
                Federation and by my constituents in Eyemouth and Berwickshire, 
                and will continue to do so. Also, I am not Mike Rumbles MSP.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SFF was entirely 
                right to complain about the lack of initial consultation about 
                the boundary, a situation that the Scottish Executive has rightly 
                altered in subsequent consultation on this and other fishing issues.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important to 
                emphasise that the unalterable fact in the dispute remains that 
                the problem with the new boundary is that it is a problem that 
                can be put right only at Westminster; it cannot be put right anywhere 
                else. For that reason, my colleague, Archy Kirkwood MP, and I 
                decided that he should draw up a bill to set the boundary on a 
                line concurrent with that of the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore 
                Activities) Order 1987.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Herein lies the difference 
                between me and some of my colleagues. The fisheries minister points 
                out that a formal boundary at sea was never established. Strictly 
                speaking, he is probably&#151;I stress probably&#151;correct. 
                I am indebted to my former tutor, Professor Geoffrey Barrow, lately 
                professor of Scottish history at the University of St Andrews 
                and a world-renowned medieval historian, for his help. His view 
                is that there was no formal treaty or agreement on the line at 
                sea, in marked contrast to the great number of documents relating 
                to the land boundary. Indeed, the exact line on land in places 
                such as Yetholm and Sprouston, in my constituency, was apparently 
                established in early modern rather than medieval times.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, if there was 
                never a formal agreement, there was certainly a line of custom 
                and practice or repute. Had the civil servants who drew the line 
                taken the time and trouble to ask the practitioners&#151;the fishermen&#151;or 
                the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency, they would have received 
                a clear answer. If they had bothered to travel to Eyemouth, for 
                example, had stood on the pier and had asked, no one would have 
                pointed north; everyone would have pointed south of the harbour 
                entrance and bar.</font></P>

                quite clearly an uncontentious, happily working arrangement or 
                understanding. No one would have objected to its formalisation.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fishermen's case 
                has been well recorded. There are worries about the legal jurisdiction 
                and about whether alleged transgressions will be tried in England 
                or Scotland. I understand from a letter to my colleague, Archy 
                Kirkwood, from the then fisheries minister, Lord Sewel, that the 
                Eyemouth fishermen refer to the jurisdiction of the Scottish courts, 
                and that is unchanged. He said that in relation to fishing, the 
                current practice is normally to prosecute an alleged offence under 
                the sea fisheries legislation at the court nearest to the place 
                where the offence is detected.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no reason 
                for that practice to change. Indeed, John Reid said in a letter 
                dated 15 September to Hamish Morrison that</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;it remains possible 
                that an offence may be taken in either a Scottish or an English 
                court. I would not expect a vessel's port of registry to be a 
                major factor in determining where the case was taken.&quot;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My understanding is 
                that where a case is heard will depend on the individual circumstances, 
                but we will not find out the definitive answer until there is 
                an unfortunate incident of prosecution.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main worry is the 
                well-rehearsed point about the Berwick bank fishery. Differing 
                codes north and south of the line could well lead to a loss of 
                economic viability of the fishery if gear has to be changed halfway 
                through a trawl. That point has been made on a number of occasions. 
                With great respect to the minister, it is all well and good to 
                say that that will not happen on his watch&#151;of course it will 
                not&#151;but the minister cannot commit his successors in perpetuity 
                and there is no guarantee that the concordat will be permanent.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A further point concerns 
                guard vessels. That is a lucrative and important activity for 
                Eyemouth vessels, because, on a rota, they protect other fishing 
                boats from sub-sea oil and gas installations. The new boundary 
                must not interfere with traditional arrangements, and it would 
                be a pity if it did.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The existence of two 
                lines at sea&#151;the fishing boundary and the Civil Jurisdiction

                confusing: a case, as my colleague Ian Jenkins muttered to me 
                earlier, of pouring trouble on oiled waters. Of equal significance 
                to those practical issues is the reinforcement of the general 
                perception held by fishermen of my acquaintance that the boundary-at-sea 
                issue demonstrated that they were not taken into consideration 
                in this heavily regulated industry, and that their views were 
                not given prominence. The Executive has made a major effort to 
                change that perception, and </font></P>

                fishing debates in the chamber, I do not regard myself as an authority 
                on the fishing industry. I deferred to the minister when he chose 
                to spend quite a bit of his speech on matters that he said were 
                of more pressing concern to the fishing industry, instancing quotas, 
                safety measures, access to fishing grounds, conservation measures 
                and so on. He was clearly correct to dwell for a time on those 
                practical matters. Of course, Parliament has debated those issues 
                and doubtless will debate them again, but I submit that it is 
                entirely proper for us to discuss this issue today, for three 
                reasons.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, contrary to 
                what the minister said, this matter has been raised on several 
                occasions by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation. I have by no 
                means been in the front line of the debate, but I recall meeting 
                three delegations from the SFF, and I have received several briefing 
                notes from it. This is clearly a matter of concern to the SFF, 
                which it is legitimate for us to discuss. Indeed, Euan Robson 
                rehearsed a number of the points that the SFF has constantly and 
                consistently raised, such as the implications of changing gear 
                halfway through a trawl. That is a point that I have heard raised 
                frequently, but I have never heard it answered. The chamber would 
                be grateful for an answer.</font></P>

                unsatisfactory. My recollection of the outcome of that debate 
                was that the Parliament was left with the impression that something 
                reasonably vigorous would be done to promote a satisfactory resolution 
                to the dispute. That has not happened, and the Scottish Executive 
                has not played any part in reaching a resolution. If it has, it 
                has been remarkably modest about its input.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thirdly, important 
                constitutional matters are involved in the alteration of a boundary 
                line between two countries, whether or not they are part of a 
                unitary state. The simple fact is that whether the line was laid 
                down in treaty or was a use-and-wont line, Scotland went into 
                the union in 1707 with a degree of territory and has emerged later 
                as a devolved unit within a unitary state with less territory, 
                having had removed from it a substantial part of its territorial 
                waters without discussion, without debate, without consultation 
                and without consent. That is not constitutionally proper, and 
                it does not accord with the principles on which the Parliament 
                was founded.</font></P>

                and Mr Robson has just referred to a customary boundary&#151;which 
                becomes a real enough boundary when there is no other. If that 
                boundary is changed and given statutory enforcement, the proposals 
                and their justification must be discussed with the people affected;

                to mean that the Parliament has the right to raise on behalf of 
                Scotland a huge range of issues that are not within its competence. 
                The Executive has made a virtue of the role that it has played 
                in relation to, for example, the fuel duty escalator, the climate 
                change levy and regional selective assistance. We expect that. 
                We ask questions about such things; they are part of our business. 
                But one thing that the Executive will not discuss or explain is 
                the alteration of this boundary. That is anomalous, peculiar and 
                unacceptable. It is contemptuous of Parliament and not awfully 
                respectful towards Scotland. It is a pity that the Executive will 
                not be the champion of Scotland's interests on this matter.</font></P>

                the change happened. We are not given an explanation, so we are

                it could be admitted that the transfer was just an error and whether, 
                if that is the case, it can be put right. There is much dignity 
                in politicians or parties admitting that they have made an error, 
                and then correcting it. We have all had to do that&#151;certainly, 
                in my long span, I have had to do it.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why can the Executive 
                not admit that the order was a mistake? The minister's speech 
                today was pathetic because he is as much involved in the mystery 
                as we are and does not know the answers. Should he have been the 
                person to address the chamber, given that he does not even attempt 
                to know the answers?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have reduced our

                Conservative member made that point.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is said that Scottish 
                fishermen still have the right to fish in the area that is under 
                discussion, and that the change makes no economic difference. 
                Are we just materialists in the chamber? Are we concerned only 
                with material considerations? I have an interest in the matter 
                as I was a criminal lawyer&#151;I should perhaps say that I practised 
                in the criminal court extensively for many years, and after I 
                lost my seat at Hamilton, I practised criminal law again. I was 
                also an academic Scots lawyer. I am proud of Scots law because 
                the world respects our criminal legal system. It is one of the 
                jewels of the world's jurisprudence&#151;I do not speak lightly 
                about that and can quote chapter and verse the people who have 
                said that.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is now doubt 
                about which court a criminal matter in the disputed area would 
                go to. The answer is not clear from what has been said so far&#151;the 
                truth is that nobody knows. It seems that oil will go to Scotland 
                and fish to England. However, are we not concerned with rights 
                in law as well as rights to fish?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cases that arise might 
                not be concerned only with a fisherman disregarding the law on 
                fishing, and could relate to tanker negligence&#151;there have 
                been incidents such as collisions in my time. If one goes to an 
                English court in such situations, one gets a lesser system of 
                criminal prosecution. I dare any jurisprudence expert to deny

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As John Farquhar Munro 
                said, it is not logical to have two boundaries. Having two boundaries 
                is messy and will cause difficulties. It has been said that there 
                has not yet been a criminal incident in the disputed waters, but 
                there will be. Are we going to wait until all the horror and outrage 
                that an incident will cause makes the Executive admit its error? 
                That is what I foresee will happen.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I asked the same questions 
                in the previous debate: why did the change happen? Was it a show 
                of ignorance? Members on the Westminster delegated legislation 
                committee admitted that they were puzzled and did not know the 
                impact that it would have. It was obviously a mistake. However, 
                if it was not a mistake, and there was a conspiracy, it was a 
                pretty disgusting conspiracy of thieves in the night on the eve 
                of the establishment of our distinguished Parliament. What on 
                earth can the motive have been for that? Was it to increase the 
                English tonnage in the quota at the expense of the Scottish tonnage?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In my presence, during 
                a visit by the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs 
                and the Internal Market, Henry McLeish admitted that because fishing 
                in the UK was predominantly a Scottish matter, the Scottish minister 
                would represent the UK in Europe. Was the transfer something to 
                do with that, as if the English and Scottish tonnages were equalised, 
                there would not be the problem of the Scottish minister representing 
                the UK?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Was the motive fear 
                that we were going to win our independence? Was it a warning light? 
                Was it to say, &quot;You have got your Parliament, but we are 
                still the masters, so we will dish you out a dirty trick on the 
                eve of your creation&quot;? That may sound enormously stupid, 
                but as I cannot get an answer to the question whether it was a 
                mistake&#151;the Executive does not seem prepared to admit that 
                and to put it right&#151;one is left with the conspiracy theory.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a lot of confusion. 
                We are told that the issue has nothing to do with oil, but we 
                have already heard many members tell us from experience that many 
                fishing boats serve the oil industry. The two industries are not 
                totally separate; there is a mix, as we all know. I know that 
                many of my fishermen friends are out there in boats that serve 
                the oil industry, and a dangerous job it is too.</font></P>

                not consultation. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation was in St

                that the water that we are discussing is used almost exclusively 
                by Scottish boats. The Rural Affairs Committee talked about the 
                inconsistency of having two boundaries. When the minister came 
                before the committee, I asked him about precedents for the action. 
                He said then that he knew of none, although I accept that he mentioned 
                the precedent of Denmark in his speech today. That is all very 
                well, but it relates only to the fishing boundary. Henry McLeish

                we should not be discussing this subject because there are more 
                important subjects. I remember precisely the same argument being 
                used for many years by the opponents of devolution. They said 
                that we should be talking about the economy and so on, instead 
                of tinkering with the constitution. Even if I accepted that the 
                matter is of no importance, I would not accept that we should 
                not discuss certain matters because they are less important than 
                others. The report is the only one that was available to the committee 
                for discussion and it is appropriate that Parliament should discuss 
                it. If members had wanted to discuss something else, they could 
                have discussed assisted area status, but they chose not to.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are having this 
                debate as a result of a proposal that was brought forward without 
                consultation, discussed by a committee&#151;some members of which 
                admitted that they were confused&#151;and passed in the chamber 
                without any debate being allowed. That is Westminster democracy 
                in action. [<I>Interruption.</I>]</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Presiding Officer 
                (Sir David Steel): </strong>Order. Far too many conversations are going 
                on in the chamber. Will members please come to order?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Alasdair Morgan: 
                </strong>Perhaps something exciting is about to happen&#151;perhaps 
                the Government is going to push forward with the committee's recommendations.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How did we get to where 
                we are now? Both David Davidson and Lord James Douglas-Hamilton 
                raised that question. Who decided that the boundary should be 
                proposed? What instructions were civil servants given? At no stage 
                has Parliament had an answer to those questions. Was it the case 
                that civil servants in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries 
                and Food dreamed it up, not realising that the Department of Trade 
                and Industry had dreamed up another boundary some years previously? 
                Was it a conspiracy or a cock-up? As a fairly moderate member 
                of my party, I always go with the cock-up theory of politics. 
                There is no reason to change the custom-and-practice line. If 
                we were starting again and if this had not happened, surely we 
                would not now be in this situation. As the SFF&#151;the main non-political 
                objector&#151;is against the boundary we should surely not adopt 
                it. There seems no coherent reason for it.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The minister, in opening 
                the debate on 3 June, prayed in aid the fact that the change was 
                in accordance with what he said was the normal convention of international 
                law, although the SNP disagrees with that. The deputy minister, 
                in writing to the convener of the Rural Affairs Committee on 25 
                October, said:</font></P>

                international law in aid and the other says that it is of no importance. 
                As I said, we do not know whether the Government got here by conspiracy 
                or by cock-up. However, there is a fairly overwhelming opinion 
                that it has got to the wrong place.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How can we get out 
                of this situation? The Liberals say that we should support&#151;or 
                get the Government to support&#151;Archy Kirkwood's bill in the 
                House of Commons. I realise that they do that because they want 
                to make a party political point. Archy Kirkwood's bill is number 
                15 for consideration on 21 July. Once the first bill is talked 
                out at 2.30 pm, the names of the other 14 bills will be read out. 
                On each occasion the Government whip will shout, &quot;Object&quot;&#151;and 
                that will be the end of Archy Kirkwood's bill.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only way in which 
                to get out of this situation is for the Secretary of State for 
                Scotland to introduce a new order. We must press the Executive 
                and the Scottish Parliament to get him to do that. I ask the Executive 
                to intervene with the secretary of state to remedy the situation 
                and get rid of this anomaly. I would not crow about that and I 
                would not say that it was a U-turn. I say that we should get to 
                where we want to be and to where we should have been in the first 
                place. The motion is only a take-note motion. I hope and expect 
                that there will not be a vote on it and I hope that the Executive 
                will respond in the spirit of the committee's report and push 
                forward with the committee's recommendations.</font></P>

                Munro and Rhoda Grant all voted for the motion&#151;the information 
                that I received previously was that that was not the case. Secondly, 
                I would like to record that I voted for the motion, whereas I

                I understand that the member asked for a copy of the division

                more serious and affects all members. The member is saying that 
                he voted, but that he is recorded as having not voted. I have 
                seen the list, and that is how he is recorded. This has happened

                see whether that is the case; it does not happen often, but it

                damaged in members' pockets or handbags&#151;that also happens 
                occasionally. However, we have found in the past that the most

                measures, and therefore believes that crofters and farmers should 
                not suffer financial disadvantage through no fault of their own.

                by the delay in introducing the countryside stewardship scheme 
                creates a further welcome window of opportunity for new crofters 
                and farmers to enter the existing ESA scheme. Some 700 producers 
                are now part of that scheme in Shetland. Out of 1,100 agricultural 
                units, that represents a notable step forward in recognising the 
                importance of the principle that underlies ESAs. The scheme covers 
                a large percentage of the Shetland flock and a large acreage of 
                agricultural land in the islands.</font></P>

                sheep quota by producers in Shetland under the ESA scheme.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original advice 
                to producers, based on the department's rules when the scheme 
                began, was that all parties understood that quota freed by the 
                stock disposal element of the ESA scheme could be used to cover 
                other eligible sheep on a croft or farm. Rules expressly stating 
                that were given to producers who signed up after 22 July 1994. 
                Indeed, the letter from the then Scottish Office agriculture, 
                environment and fisheries department in November 1994 quite clearly 
                states:</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If you have signed 
                and lodged an application form for an Environmentally Sensitive 
                Areas Scheme . . . <U>before</U> 22 JULY 1994 you may lease out 
                quota throughout the lifetime of your scheme.&quot;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the past year, because 
                of reinterpretation of those rules, which Ross Finnie has explained 
                in answer to questions from Alex Fergusson and in letters to members 
                of all parties, the rules have been amended. Producers are now 
                not entitled to lease out quota or claim sheep annual premium 
                on other female sheep on the croft or farm. I am glad that the 
                mistake has at least been recognised; that is progress. Crofting 
                colleagues of mine who are many years older than I am have suggested 
                that it is the first time that the department has admitted getting 
                something wrong. That is welcome and the minister is to be congratulated 
                on making that progress. The agriculture community recognises 
                that.</font></P>

                a crofter who is affected by the change of circumstances, has 
                asked me to suggest to the minister the introduction of a new 
                scheme. He said in a recent letter to me:</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If the agreed 
                payments cannot be made under the ESA scheme, then surely&#151;with 
                a little bit of imaginative thinking&#151;a way can and must be 
                found to compensate crofters and farmers for their loss, even 
                if no EU funding is available for such compensation&quot;.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He went on to suggest 
                that it could be called the official error compensation scheme. 
                I do not know whether the minister would be prepared to take up 
                that helpful suggestion from one of my constituents.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alex Fergusson has 
                cases of this difficulty in his region; if I understand it correctly, 
                the cases are broadly to be found in the northern isles and in 
                south-west Scotland. In Shetland, 29 producers are affected; on 
                the telephone last night I spoke to one who will lose approximately 
                90 units at 35&#151;about 3,150.</font></P>

                stressed are in no way the responsibility of the crofters or farmers

                I would like the minister to recognise that, as the mistake is 
                that of the department, a mechanism should be found to ensure 
                that producers are not financially disadvantaged.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The minister will be 
                aware of the impending case, backed by legal opinion, being sought 
                by the National Farmers Union on behalf of one of its members. 
                I would like to raise the actions that have been taken, because 
                it is important to consider them. The time scale that the rural 
                affairs department has operated under has not always helped producers 
                to make informed decisions in pursuing this matter.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The minister rightly 
                asks for the industry to behave in a thoroughly modern, businesslike 
                fashion. To do that, we must have consistency in the application 
                of the department's rules and schemes. It is difficult to do that 
                when advice has conflicted, when time scales demanded for answers 
                to potentially difficult questions are short and when information 
                asked for by crofters to allow those informed decisions to take 
                place&#151;based, for example, on advice by the Scottish Agricultural 
                College, the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group or other organisations 
                who give advice in this area&#151;takes months to arrive.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Difficulties have been 
                created by the way in which this has been handled. To illustrate 
                the time scale, the first information letter to producers saying 
                that there was a problem arrived on 2 July last year. It intimated 
                that&#151;hopefully&#151;within eight weeks, there would be further 
                advice to producers. Nothing happened until 25 January this year, 
                when a letter was sent to affected producers, setting out the 
                position. I remind members&#151;those who are aware of the circumstances 
                will know this&#151;that that was only a matter of days before 
                the Friday 4 February cut-off for the application for sheep annual 
                premium and hill livestock compensatory allowances.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The time scale given 
                to crofters and farmers who were affected was especially short 
                and, in some cases, very difficult. Someone said to me on the 
                telephone last night that they received the letter on the Tuesday, 
                but had to have their SAP and HLCA claim in on the Friday. That 
                is demanding in anyone's estimation; in the days available, they 
                had to make a best estimate of what they would do with their ESA.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There were problems 
                with trading, leasing in or purchasing quota to cover eligible 
                female sheep. For Shetland, that is complicated by the fact that 
                the nearest available place in which to trade quota is Aberdeen 
                Northern Marts, at Thainstone. To do that, one has to exchange 
                letters; there are practical issues there that are not easy to 
                conclude.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ESA is a good use 
                of agri-environment moneys; I would like it to continue. The competitive 
                structure being considered for future agri-environment support 
                is not necessarily the best way forward because, as many farming 
                and crofting organisations have pointed out, it is difficult to 
                compare a croft in Walls in the west of Shetland with a larger 
                farm in south-west Scotland. There are concerns about that. I 
                suggest to the minister that, in the areas in which they have 
                been available, ESAs have been a good, useful mechanism for providing 
                agri-environment support for crofting and farming.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The manner in which 
                some producers are being treated is causing disquiet. Potential 
                applicants&#151;there are quite a number in Shetland at the moment, 
                simply because the window has been extended&#151;do not know what 
                to expect. I hope that, in his summing up, the minister will give 
                an assurance that there will be no more rule changes that will 
                disadvantage people. That point was made when I met some union 
                representatives and the SAC the other day, before I came south; 
                I was asked to pursue the matter today.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I press the minister 
                for a review of the 29 outstanding cases in Shetland. I would 
                like him to ensure that not one of those crofters or farmers is 
                financially disadvantaged because of the treatment of their case.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I welcome his announcement 
                that the department will consider claims from producers for losses 
                caused as a consequence of the scheme guidance issued by the department. 
                That is an admission of the mistake and an attempt to set a solution 
                in progress. That is welcome, but the department is still judge 
                and jury and, given the circumstances and the history, some producers 
                will obviously have a concern about that. I hope that that concern 
                can be allayed.</font></P>

                and difficulties with regard to state aid rules, but I urge the

                MSPs, I am sure, in that issues relating to the double payments 
                anomaly started hitting my desk last autumn. Rarely at that time 
                did any agricultural meeting go by without someone speaking to 
                me of their difficulties with their participation in one scheme 
                or another. I accept fully that the double payments issue, relating 
                to the regulations on stock disposal, was the result of a misinterpretation 
                of those regulations by the Scottish Office agriculture department, 
                as it was then.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I also accept that 
                the minister, by intimating that he does not intend to seek repayment 
                of such double payments, has shown understanding of the situation, 
                in that no double payments were the result of false or fraudulent 
                claims and all claimants who were caught in the double claims 
                trap were under the impression&#151;given officially in writing 
                in some cases&#151;that they were perfectly entitled to use quota 
                that was freed up by the reduction in stock numbers to claim subsidy 
                for other stock that was previously not covered by quota. Indeed, 
                that fact alone may well have made the difference for some entrants 
                between applying and not applying for a scheme.</font></P>

                the upset that SERAD&#151;as the department had become&#151;caused 
                when it sent out notification that such claims could not be allowed. 
                Sometimes, as Tavish Scott said, it is gratifying to discover 
                that officialdom can make mistakes and admit to it and, to a degree, 
                one can accept that if it is handled properly. However, I must 
                make strong representations that this business has not been handled 
                well and has increased greatly the frustration and hardship of 
                some of the farmers and crofters involved.</font></P>

                SERAD officials, who were extremely helpful, had success, ultimately; 
                I am delighted to report that. However, that farmer received his 
                first notification that there was a problem with his claim under 
                the countryside premium scheme on 22 June 1999.</font></P>

                explain matters further. The reply from SERAD arrived, eventually, 
                on 24 January 2000. Can it be right that it took seven months&#151;never

                his sending a recorded delivery letter to the minister on 23 December, 
                to which he has yet to receive a reply? That is not right, and

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;May I recommend 
                that your committee enquire into SERAD's relationship with its 
                clients. I would sum it up politely as an attitude problem.&quot;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps I was fortunate 
                that I farmed in an era when my relationship with the department&#151;as 
                we always called it&#151;was one of mutual respect and helpfulness, 
                within reasonable parameters. Sadly, those days appear to have 
                gone and it will be much to the detriment of SERAD officials and 
                the individual farmer if respect and helpfulness are replaced 
                by suspicion and obstruction. That would appear to be almost inevitable 
                when one looks at the farce of the agricultural business improvement 
                scheme, the shambles of some of the agri-environment schemes and 
                the current non-availability of the farm woodland premium scheme.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only conclusion 
                that I can come to is that SERAD is in a mess procedurally and 
                that that is affecting its performance and that of those whom 
                it exists to serve&#151;its clients. I make no accusations against 
                individuals, who have been helpfulness personified in trying to 
                assist the people who have written to me, but I urge Ross Finnie 
                to look into the concerns that have been expressed, to find out 
                what is wrong and to take measures to put things right. That would 
                be to everybody's benefit, not least the minister's. I support 
                the motion.</font></P>

                especially over a short period. When that happens, there is not 
                much that people can do about it and their carefully laid plans 
                run into difficulties. That is particularly true at this time, 
                when the whole rural economy is extremely fragile. As we know, 
                the margins sheep farmers are working on are critical. This seems

                as in the Borders valleys, developments of this kind are critical 
                to the whole rural economy. I am grateful to the minister for 
                acknowledging errors that have been made in the past. His willingness 
                not to exact double payments is vital. I ask him to do whatever

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Minister for 
                Rural Affairs (Ross Finnie): </strong>I welcome the opportunity to 
                respond to Tavish Scott on this issue, which has caused a considerable 
                amount of angst&#151;although, as Alex Fergusson noted, many of 
                those who have claimed on other occasions to be most concerned 
                about it do not appear to be displaying that angst here, which 
                seems rather odd.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want to emphasise 
                two things. First, I hope that I have made it clear that I regret 
                very much the position that some of our producers find themselves 
                in, through no fault of their own. Secondly, this is now a legal 
                issue&#151;which I regret&#151;and not just a matter of funding. 
                I recognise that many members, including Tavish Scott, Alex Fergusson 
                and Ian Jenkins, have raised this issue and that it is a topic 
                of concern. I want to make it clear that the Executive is alive 
                to that and that we have no wish to disadvantage producers financially.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tavish Scott claimed 
                that there were difficulties in getting the forms in between 25 
                January and 4 February. He may be aware that the department has 
                agreed to accept sheep annual premium claims that can be adjusted 
                later without penalty. I hope that that is of help to him.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alex Fergusson talked 
                about the relationship between officials in SERAD and the farming 
                community. He will be aware that the integrated administration 
                and control system red tape review raised concerns that the relationship 
                had broken down. I have indicated that I am anxious to rebuild 
                it.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am bound to say that 
                I think it is extremely unfortunate that the European Union framework 
                has turned people in my department into policemen, instead of 
                officials who are genuinely interested in helping the farming 
                community. I have indicated to officials&#151;the vast majority 
                of whom welcome this&#151;that their role is to act on behalf 
                of and in co-operation with farmers. I hope that we can quickly 
                resume that kind of relationship.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reference was made 
                to a state of collapse, which is perhaps a slight hyperbole. The 
                difficulty we are having with the European Union in agreeing the 
                revised regulations, which is putting a stop to the farm woodland 
                grant scheme, for example, is a matter of deep regret, but I am 
                not able to accept that that difficulty is entirely the responsibility 
                of my department.</font></P>

                will respond to John Scott's question in detail when I have investigated 
                the matter.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>John Scott: </strong>I 
                am grateful.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>As 
                Tavish Scott said, the original interpretation of the scheme was 
                that the regulation would put a prohibition on the use of quota 
                rights as a result of stock disposal in an agri-environment scheme. 
                The department's original interpretation of that requirement was 
                that the bar, as Tavish said, was only to lease or sale of the 
                quota rights and that freed quota rights could be used to claim 
                SAP. We are all agreed on that point.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I regret to say that 
                that interpretation, which was before my time, was erroneous: 
                the prohibition on the use of quota rights extends not only to 
                lease or sale but also to the use of those rights to claim SAP. 
                In short, a proper interpretation of the rules shows clearly that 
                one cannot receive agri-environment stock disposal payments and 
                SAP payments utilising units of quota that ought to have been 
                frozen. I think that we agree that fact, although it is to be 
                regretted.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The stock disposal 
                element has affected 121 producers in Scotland, 29 of whom are 
                in Shetland, who have received double payments. The total value 
                of those payments amounted to just under 400,000. I accepted 
                in good faith from the outset that the producers acted in good 
                faith. We have told them that the decision is not up to me&#151;I 
                am glad that that fact has been recognised. If it were left to 
                me, I would not be seeking any recovery of the payments.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I greatly regret that 
                the EU has decided that the situation might be one of state aid 
                and therefore, unfortunately, I am in its hands. I repeat: I am 
                not minded to seek any recovery from our producers.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Alex Fergusson: 
                </strong>On that point, can the minister give an idea of the time scale 
                in which a decision might be reached?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I 
                continue to press the point almost weekly. I hope that a decision 
                will be made soon. While I cannot give a precise date, I have 
                made it absolutely clear to the EU that this is nonsense, as the 
                situation involves a small sum of money and it would be completely 
                wrong for us to recover payments in the circumstances in which 
                we find ourselves. That is as far as I am able to go today.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have given producers 
                the option of continuing with their agri-environment stock disposal 
                option, which will require the requisite number of quota rights 
                to be frozen, or of withdrawing without penalty. The vast majority 
                of producers&#151;95 per cent&#151;who have responded have indicated 
                a preference to remain within the agri-environment scheme. In 
                Shetland, 100 per cent have chosen that option.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I recognise that the 
                withholding of payments that were expected in 1999 has caused 
                hardship in many areas. However, I regret to say that once the 
                issue had been resolved and the legal position clarified, the 
                rural affairs department would have been acting illegally if it 
                had continued to make those payments. That option is not open 
                to me, but I say to Tavish Scott that we are not aware of any 
                other regulation that has been misinterpreted in this way, so 
                I am not aware of any other scheme in which we would have to issue 
                a similar revamped interpretation of a regulation's intentions.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 17 February, I announced 
                to the chamber that the Executive would consider claims for compensation 
                from individual producers who could demonstrate that their business 
                had suffered a loss through following the department's guidance. 
                As Tavish Scott indicated, the NFU in Scotland has advised its 
                members to seek the assistance of farm advisers in drawing up 
                claims. Indeed, I believe that a claim is being prosecuted. I 
                assure members that those claims will receive sympathetic and, 
                I hope, swift consideration. If those claims are taken further, 
                the matter may go outwith the hands of my department. We still 
                recognise, however, that compensation may be payable. Where our 
                inquiries have established that all, some or part of the expected 
                1999 stock disposal payments can be made, that is now being done.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A number of producers 
                have suggested that they be allowed to repay their 1999 SAP payments 
                and receive the agri-environment stock disposal payment instead. 
                I am sympathetic to that, and we are seeking to establish whether 
                such an approach would be legal.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will consider in 
                the light of advice what the implications for the future operation 
                of the SAP scheme might be. I regret not having that advice now, 
                but I am hoping to receive the final advice within the next two 
                to three weeks. It was a matter worth pursuing and I am extremely 
                sympathetic to the point that has been raised in this debate.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a matter of
