          <P> <strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_2"></A>The Presiding Officer (Mr George 
            Reid): </strong>Good morning. The first item of business is a statement 
            by Frank McAveety on the cultural review. The minister will take questions 
            at the end of his statement and there will be no interventions.</P>
          <P>09:30</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Mr Frank McAveety): 
            </strong>I thank the members who have made themselves available at 
            this early hour.</P>
          <P>Today is the start of a new era for Scotland's culture. I know that 
            both the cultural sector and my parliamentary colleagues have been 
            waiting for the launch of our review of culture: it begins now.</P>
          <P>The review of the cultural sector is, in my opinion, a once-in-a-generation 
            opportunity. It is a precious opportunity to consider seriously and 
            maturely the place and provision of culture in Scotland and to decide 
            the best ways in which to ensure its future support.</P>
          <P>On St Andrew's day last year, the First Minister, Jack McConnell, 
            set out a vision for cultural provision in Scotland. The core vision 
            was of each citizen securing the right to access to and excellence 
            in our diverse culture and the right to pursue the means of fulfilling 
            whatever talents might be within them.</P>
          <P>The message of his speech was greeted warmly by those within and 
            outwith the cultural sector, and we intend to deliver on the aspirations 
            and inspiration behind the speech. Politicians had spoken before, 
            extolling the importance of culture for its own sake and its ability 
            to inspire. However, in that speech, we had for the first time a reflection 
            on the essential nature of cultural activity and on the fact that 
            there is not a single part of our physical, intellectual and emotional 
            lives that cannot be touched in some way by exposure to and experience 
            of cultural activity.</P>
          <P>The First Minister said:</P>
          <P>&quot;Let's agree the centrality of cultural activity to all aspects 
            of our lives - why it's important and how it can revitalise us individually 
            and as a national community.&quot;</P>
          <P>Since that landmark speech, we have been giving careful consideration 
            to how we can make that vision a reality. We had established a partnership 
        </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>commitment to deliver a review of the cultural sector within Scotland 
            and we have had to consider the best way to ensure that the review 
            can have maximum reach and impact, engage the greatest number of citizens 
            in Scotland and benefit from the immense experience and brilliance 
            of our creative communities. How can we ensure that people from all 
            branches of the arts, heritage and creative industries, and from national 
            bodies, local government and the private and voluntary sectors, can 
            take part?</P>
          <P>Instead of just doing a standard review, the purpose of my discussion 
            and deliberation has been to think of a more effective way to engage 
            in the review and to consider the form and process of the consultation. 
            Consultations are often engineered or developed and they have their 
            place, but sometimes they fail to penetrate beyond the usual people 
            whom we would expect to make a contribution. Given that we have this 
            once-in-a-generation opportunity, it would be unforgivable to make 
            that mistake when it comes to something as intrinsically important 
            in the lives of the people of Scotland as culture, which is fundamental. 
            I strongly believe that the opportunity to make a change in how we 
            view cultural provision deserves a far more innovative approach.</P>
          <P>I want those whom we would expect to make a contribution to respond 
            and to take part, and of course they will do that; they are some of 
            the brilliant people that I mentioned earlier in my speech. However, 
            they are not the only ones. There are many others who have tried to 
            make their voices heard in the recent past and who have not always 
            felt that they have achieved that. We would like many other voices 
            to be heard much more effectively on cultural activity and development 
            in Scotland.</P>
          <P>I share the commitment that the First Minister identified to see 
            culture as a rich source of inspiration and enjoyment. Therefore, 
            I have decided that we should establish a new independent body, a 
            cultural commission, which will undertake the review in full consultation 
            and partnership with the people of Scotland. I have asked James Boyle, 
            who is currently chair of the Scottish Arts Council, to chair the 
            commission. He will be remunerated at the same rate as attaches to 
            his SAC post. I know that James is respected by many in the cultural 
            community&#151;his experience and background indicate that. I have 
            also been impressed by the work that he has undertaken so far with 
            the SAC. He has decided&#151;with me, and rightly in my opinion&#151;to 
            stand down as chair of the SAC on taking up his post at the commission. 
            We shall take steps quickly to fill that vacancy.</P>
          <P>The other members of the commission will also need to be selected 
            carefully to provide the right </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7603">7603</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>blend of expertise and knowledge. I expect that there will be a small 
            core membership, which may establish sub-groups for specific strands 
            of business.</P>
          <P>The other appointments will be made once the commission's chairman 
            has been able to scope its full work in further detail and to consider 
            the available candidates. We will aim to make a further announcement 
            in time for the commission to get down to business from the beginning 
            of June.</P>
          <P>People may ask why there is to be a commission and how it will work. 
            I see some clear advantages in establishing a commission to carry 
            out the cultural review.</P>
          <P>The commission's members will be highly experienced people who understand 
            Scotland's rich and complex cultural landscape. An external commission, 
            drawn from the wider community, will be best placed to listen to the 
            cultural sector and to understand what it tells them. Its members 
            will also know who the many different stakeholders are&#151;they are 
            not always those who occasionally see themselves as the singular stakeholders 
            in Scotland's culture.</P>
          <P>In my opinion, the commission will be able to look beyond and to 
            confront stereotypical notions of culture. It will be asked to employ 
            innovative and radical thinking in the work that it undertakes. I 
            will look to the commission to use some of that innovative skill to 
            develop new ways of involving more people in cultural activity in 
            Scotland. When they have done all that, by June next year, I will 
            welcome their recommendations on how we can deliver the St Andrew's 
            day vision for developing access and excellence in Scotland's cultural 
            life. I want to look forward to a positive 21<SUP>st</SUP> century 
            solution for a sector whose governance, in many cases, developed over 
            many decades in the previous century.</P>
          <P>Our future support for culture must harness all the available resources 
            in ways that deliver best value. In this context, best value means 
            trimming unnecessary bureaucracy and ensuring that the maximum possible 
            level of resources is directed to cultural activity and to unleashing 
            the innate creativity of people throughout Scotland.</P>
          <P>When I served in local government, as a convener of arts and culture 
            and then as a leader of a local authority, maximising resources was 
            always a challenge and collaboration, co-ordination and co-operation 
            were vital. There are many excellent examples of how local government 
            has faced that challenge in the cultural sector. I expect the commission 
            to draw on and to benefit from the wealth of knowledge and experience 
            in local government.</P>
          <P>The creativity of Scots&#151;from the classroom to </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7604">7604</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>the boardroom&#151;is the edge that we need in a competitive world. 
            Our duty as an Executive is to enable the conditions to be developed 
            to allow creativity to flourish&#151;whether in arts, science, commerce 
            or industry.</P>
          <P>The First Minister said:</P>
          <P>&quot;If we can all work together, it could result in the most extraordinary 
            release of talent and, crucially, a stronger, more vibrant and confident 
            country.&quot;</P>
          <P>That is an aim that I think everyone in the chamber shares. He continued:</P>
          <P>&quot;We would be recognised around the world as a creative hub - 
            a powerhouse of innovation.&quot;</P>
          <P>That is a bold aim, but it is achievable if we have the right infrastructure 
            to deliver it.</P>
          <P>The commission has an important task to perform; I am confident that 
            James Boyle and the members who are appointed in the coming weeks 
            will be equipped to deliver. Today I will also publish an Executive 
            statement that sets out the policy framework and the terms of reference 
            for the commission's work. Those should be available today and I urge 
            members to study them. We are embarking on important business, which 
            may well lead in due course to the introduction of legislation for 
            the Parliament to consider.</P>
          <P>We will consider all the action that we must take to bring our arrangements 
            for cultural provision into the present century. We will do that from 
            a position of first principles. We need to be clear about where we 
            want to be and how we can get there. Therefore, in my opinion, we 
            first need the review: to take stock, to look again at our cultural 
            infrastructure and to ask whether it is fit for purpose. I believe 
            that we can do better with what we already have.</P>
          <P>On the principles, we must foster the innate creativity of our young 
            people and energise a new generation by creating the conditions that 
            encourage them to realise their cultural potential. Many members of 
            the Parliament go to schools in their constituencies and regions on 
            constituency and parliamentary business. They see the benefits that 
            young people get from creativity. I want the commission to consider 
            ways in which good examples of that can be made more widespread throughout 
            Scotland.</P>
          <P>The review of the cultural sector will take as its starting point 
            the premise that each person in Scotland has rights of access to cultural 
            activity. I want us to work towards more equitable cultural provision 
            for people in Scotland regardless of where they live, how old they 
            are or how much money they have.</P>
          <P>To achieve that, I believe that a basic shift may be required in 
            our cultural, political and administrative agencies to change the 
            way in </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7605">7605</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>which they approach and deliver what they do. As I mentioned, collaboration, 
            co-operation and co-ordination are strengths that we must learn to 
            maximise in all sectors of government and across the cultural sector.</P>
          <P>I have already had a series of discussions with many of my ministerial 
            colleagues about the way in which investment in culture can improve 
            Scotland. I hope that those discussions will result in positive developments. 
            There needs to be a similar dialogue across the private and voluntary 
            sectors, which bring so much to our cultural infrastructure in Scotland.</P>
          <P>Make no mistake: the work that I have launched today ranks as one 
            of the most crucial undertakings of this Executive's partnership programme. 
            I have briefly outlined our policy; the commission will now provide 
            practical recommendations on how we may implement it. If legislation 
            is required, we will publish a culture bill by 2007. Throughout all 
            the above&#151;policy, practice, legislation&#151;the key values of 
            access and excellence will be the guiding principles. No longer do 
            I wish to have the tired debate that access is traded for excellence, 
            or excellence for access. We have the capability in Scotland, among 
            the agencies, institutions and individuals that make up our cultural 
            sector, to ensure that both of those principles are enshrined in what 
            we do.</P>
          <P>The Scots writer Thomas Carlyle summed up many of our intentions 
            when he wrote that the great law of culture is,</P>
          <P>&quot;Let each become all that he was created capable of being.&quot;</P>
          <P>That is what we want for all of Scotland's society, for this generation 
            and generations to follow.</P>
          <P>As one of our best young playwrights, David Greig, a recent winner 
            of the SAC creative Scotland award, said when asked about his work:</P>
          <P>&quot;the real effects begin to emerge 10 to 15 years down the road 
            ... you keep emitting your message or calls like a whale swimming 
            in some vast ocean ... hoping that someone somewhere, will get the 
            message.&quot;</P>
          <P>Our message is that we can make a difference to Scotland's cultural 
            future. Each of us in this chamber and beyond has a responsibility 
            in shaping Scotland's cultural future.</P>
          <p><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> The minister will now take 
            questions on the issues raised in his statement. I will allow around 
            20 minutes for that process.</P>
          <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP): </strong>Presiding Officer, 
            I apologise for arriving 30 seconds late. Unfortunately, that came 
            about because we were still waiting for a copy of the statement at 
            9.20. I have had a bit of speed reading to do, so I hope that the 
            minister will </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7606">7606</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>forgive me if my questions are a little broad-brush as a result.</P>
          <P>How does the minister see the review relating to the cultural strategy 
            of a few years ago, about which there was a great deal of debate and 
            some criticism? It would be useful for us to understand how the two 
            are to mesh.</P>
          <P>We need some blue-sky thinking, but I am not entirely clear how the 
            review will deliver that. How will the minister ensure that the members 
            of the commission are not just the usual suspects? We do not want 
            to see coming out of the review a repeat of some of the things that 
            we have always seen. We need something new.</P>
          <P>On membership of the commission, I make a personal plea that the 
            traditional arts and music be directly represented on the commission, 
            because in the past they have often missed out on cultural discussions 
            in Scotland.</P>
          <P>There are two specific issues in creating a truly effective cultural 
            medium in the country. There is the process of creating in the first 
            place what might be called the cultural artefact, and there is the 
            process by which access to it is delivered. Is the review to be about 
            both those aspects of cultural life? If we end up concentrating on 
            only one, we risk there being a severe imbalance in the way in which 
            things are delivered. I suppose I am asking the minister to be clear 
            about whether he can guard against the review just becoming an exercise 
            in moving furniture, and instead ensure that it becomes something 
            far more serious and long term for the future of Scotland's cultural 
            life.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>I apologise for the late delivery of 
            the speech, but I thought that it was important to get the David Greig 
            quote into it, which I came across earlier this morning on the train.</P>
          <P>Roseanna Cunningham asked some important questions about the core 
            issues. I want to identify ways in which I can respond positively 
            to them. The commission's work needs to be rigorous and far reaching. 
            The commission must examine critically those sectors that feel that 
            they have not in the past been brought to the table and heard on an 
            equal basis with other diverse voices. I do not want to say that particular 
            cultural sectors will be represented on the commission. The work of 
            the commission is to reach out, invite submissions, engage with individuals 
            and examine innovative ways in which voices can contribute.</P>
          <P>I assure Roseanna Cunningham that I expect that the work that the 
            cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on Scottish traditional 
            arts has done will be part of the commission's consideration. There 
            are individuals in that group, as well as in the cross-party group 
            in the Scottish Parliament on t<STRONG>he Scottish contemporary music 
            industry, of which I have been a member, who can </STRONG></div>

            no doubt that there are real opportunities for traditional music and 
            arts in terms of not just broader cultural sustainability, but positive 
            economic and tourism outcomes. One of the key themes that the commission 
            will examine is how we connect culture and creativity and develop 
            enterprise, and how we maximise the benefits from that.</strong></P>
          <P><strong>On the difficult philosophical question of the role of the 
            review&#151;is it a structural review or is it about creating space 
            for artists to develop and flourish?&#151;I do not want to prescribe 
            to the commission how the review should develop. I hope that the commission 
            will examine critically that important question because, like Roseanna 
            Cunningham, over the years I have become tired of the way in which 
            debate on the arts in Scotland becomes polarised and of the fact that 
            we cannot encourage innovation, radicalism and the challenging aspects 
            of individual artists or groups of artists while also having a structural 
            debate about institutions such as the Scottish Arts Council and national 
            organisations and bodies.</strong></P>
          <P><strong>I want the commission to get to the heart of questions that 
            have not been asked or examined enough in Scotland over the past 10 
            to 20 years. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change 
            the situation. I hope that that principle can shape the commission's 
            work over the next year, so that it addresses many of the issues that 
            Roseanna Cunningham and I are concerned about.</strong></P>
          <p><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_4"></A>Mr Jamie McGrigor (Highlands 
            and Islands) (Con): </strong>I thank the minister for the statement. 
            I got it only five minutes before he delivered it, so I have done 
            my best.</P>
          <P>I agree with the minister when he says:</P>
          <P>&quot;Our future support for culture must harness all the available 
            resources in ways that deliver best value ... best value means trimming 
            unnecessary bureaucracy&quot;.</P>
          <P>However, I question whether setting up a new commission will trim 
            that bureaucracy. Where will the minister trim bureaucracy?</P>
          <P>Will the members of the commission consider new methods of funding 
            arts companies such as Scottish Opera, so that that icon of Scottish 
            excellence can flourish and continue to delight, rather than lurch 
            from crisis to crisis?</P>
          <P>Will the minister do more to encourage Scotland's visual arts sector, 
            by attracting more of the international arts world to Scotland? Does 
            he accept, as he has already mentioned, that traditional music is 
            a thriving area of Scottish culture? Will he give more recognition 
            to the excellent accordion and fiddle clubs that play a huge part 
            in Scotland's culture? In particular in the Highlands and Islands, 
            they are keeping traditional </div>

          <P>Scottish culture alive. Will he do more to attract film makers to 
            Scotland, so that more films and television programmes can be made 
            here?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>It would be wrong of me to prescribe 
            fully what the commission should examine, but I expect that over the 
            next year some of the big questions that Jamie McGrigor asks will 
            be examined critically. We have to get beyond the issues of individual 
            organisations or companies not being able to meet their aspirations 
            with the resources that they have, or issues about how they handle 
            those resources. Sometimes the handling of those resources has a knock-on 
            impact on investment in other cultural and arts sectors. We need to 
            achieve fairness.</P>
          <P>I expect the commission to examine ways in which the heritage, visual 
            arts and screen industries can all be developed more effectively to 
            ensure that we can make a genuine difference for the future. It would 
            be wrong to lay down prescriptions on those issues today, but I would 
            expect the commission to undertake a rigorous assessment and to invite 
            views not just from those who are already in the sector, but from 
            folk who want to have a greater role in cultural development in Scotland.</P>
          <P>How can we grow the cultural sector by using better links between 
            sectors? Too many of our institutions and organisations still operate 
            in silos. We need to break that down and see how they can collaborate 
            and co-operate more effectively to deliver a much better future for 
            the sectors about which they care most passionately.</P>
          <p><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_6"></A>Mr Kenneth Macintosh (Eastwood) 
            (Lab): </strong>Like all back benchers, I did not receive an advance 
            copy of the statement, but I too will do my best.</P>
          <P>Does the minister agree that many creative pursuits are businesses, 
            as well as cultural activities? I highlight the Scottish music business 
            as one example. The music industry has suffered in the past from either 
            no Government recognition or support or, more recently, that support 
            being channelled through arts rather than enterprise funding.</P>
          <P>Given the hesitant steps that we are making to address that deficit, 
            will the minister ensure that the cultural review considers the economic 
            impact of our creative industries as well as their cultural benefit? 
            Will he ensure that he continues to work with ministerial colleagues 
            from the Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department to 
            further policy on that issue?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>I commend Ken Macintosh for his work 
            in the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on the Scottish 
            contemporary music industry. With Pauline McNeill and other colleagues, 
            he has been raising big questions through that group.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7609">7609</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>I have two immediate answers. First, I continue to discuss with Jim 
            Wallace, the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Enterprise and 
            Lifelong Learning, the crossover with enterprise issues and ways in 
            which we can work more effectively. I will certainly raise the issues 
            that Ken Macintosh raises at a forthcoming bilateral meeting. Secondly, 
            we need to engage and interface more effectively with the music industry. 
            The issue is not only about performance, but about producing and sustaining 
            talent in Scotland. We need to create an infrastructure in Scotland 
            that will allow people to survive here longer rather than journey 
            to London or the United States, although that can be a welcome move 
            economically for the individuals who do so. As I said in response 
            to Roseanna Cunningham on the issue of traditional music, I would 
            welcome the commission's engagement with key people, including the 
            cross-party group on contemporary music, which has been working hard 
            on the issues.</P>
          <P>The commission will not have all the answers, but it will try to 
            get underneath the issues and to examine in detail not only questions 
            that have been asked before and not fully answered but questions that 
            have not been asked before. The Executive will continue to support 
            the sectors that we have supported until now. I give a commitment 
            to continue to engage with Ken Macintosh on the issues, as I have 
            done in the past.</P>
          <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>The setting 
            up of a commission is a good idea that will receive wide support. 
            I welcome the concept of individual rights to culture.</P>
          <P>Will the minister ensure that the commission listens to and responds 
            adequately and imaginatively to the wide range of community or grass-roots 
            arts activities? Will he ensure that the commission takes into account 
            dozens of different art forms from throughout the country, such as 
            local choirs, orchestras and operatic societies and community drama, 
            folk-singing, dance, art and craft groups? There is a wide range of 
            activities, so it will be difficult to get a grip on the diffuse problems, 
            but in many cases, a little bit of help, such as liaison with schools 
            or a small amount of money, would be effective. Will the minister 
            consider the approach of the Edinburgh festival fringe, which is hugely 
            successful because the minimum amount of organisation enables everyone 
            to do their own thing?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>I expect the commission to address 
            many of the issues that members have raised. The Enterprise and Culture 
            Committee is considering the role of community and grass-roots arts 
            organisations in developing cultural activity in Scotland. I am sure 
            that the committee will make a positive contribution that will feed 
            into the commission's work.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7610">7610</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>An incredible wealth of experience exists among individuals and communities 
            who have worked together to develop arts projects throughout urban, 
            rural and island Scotland to try to retain cultural identity and history 
            in communities. I stress the positive, enterprising and interesting 
            developments in the folk festival in Shetland and in the f&egrave;is 
            movement in the Highlands, which I hope to experience next weekend. 
            The critical issue is how we can harness the incredible energy in 
            the voluntary arts sector to ensure that it shapes and influences 
            the future direction of cultural policy. The commission will get more 
            to the heart of that issue than a conventional consultation exercise 
            would. I hope that the process, which will take more than a year, 
            will produce positive recommendations for ministers to examine.</P>
          <p><strong>Chris Ballance (South of Scotland) (Green): </strong>I draw 
            members' attention to my entry in the members' register of interests: 
            I am a playwright member of the Writers Guild of Great Britain and 
            a board member of Borders Youth Theatre.</P>
          <P>Many of us welcomed Jack McConnell's statement on St Andrew's day. 
            We need a cultural strategy that provides international-standard artists, 
            arts organisations and institutions and we need to give everyone in 
            Scotland the chance to get involved in the arts. However, that cannot 
            be achieved with standstill funding to the Scottish Arts Council, 
            which is the current situation. Will the minister give an assurance 
            that the cultural review will have as part of its remit an examination 
            of funding levels for the arts?</P>
          <P>Scottish Opera has been mentioned. Will the minister consider seriously 
            the suggestions by Equity and the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph 
            and Theatre Union, which would enable Scottish Opera to continue to 
            employ Scottish artists and to bring opera to the maximum number of 
            new audiences in Scotland while paying off its deficit?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>I await with interest the commission's 
            recommendations on resource allocation. I cannot pre-empt the commission's 
            work or the discussions that the Executive will have as part of the 
            spending review. We are investing in Scottish arts and providing more 
            resources than ever before. The annual grant for the Scottish Arts 
            Council will be almost £40.2 million by 2005-06. In addition, we are 
            providing extra resources for the development of the national theatre, 
            a move which Chris Ballance welcomed when we announced it. The Executive 
            has a good record on resource allocation and commitment to the arts 
            and culture.</P>
          <P>The key issue that the commission will consider is how we can maximise 
            existing resources more effectively throughout the sector. That can 
            be done, and the commission will examine the matter </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7611">7611</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>in detail. If our national institutions collaborate and co-operate 
            more effectively, resources will be found for the front line. We can 
            reorganise how we do business. The statutory basis on which many organisations 
            are established is rooted in a pre-war model of governance, which 
            is not suitable, given the demands that the Parliament has placed 
            on institutions during the past four years. That is understandable, 
            as the Parliament is a new democratic channel. We must also take into 
            account the expectations of the public, who are much more aware of 
            what their rights and entitlements should be. Our institutions should 
            try to respond to that.</P>
          <P>If Chris Ballance will forgive me, I cannot give a categoric assurance 
            on Scottish Opera, largely because we are still examining the business 
            plan that the Scottish Opera board has presented to the Scottish Arts 
            Council, which is the holding body under the grant mechanism. I have 
            responded to a number of letters from members about the submission 
            from the representative unions. I assure members that I have had an 
            honest and clear discussion with trade union representatives about 
            the long-term future. The two immediate principles are that we need 
            a sustainable future for opera in Scotland, but that Scottish Opera 
            must recognise that many other companies have been given resource 
            allocations and have met their obligations from within them.</P>
          <P>We must ensure that we have a variety of art forms in Scotland. I 
            value the role of Scottish Opera, not only in producing stage performances, 
            but in the development work that is done in schools and throughout 
            the country through which opera is brought to youngsters. We aspire 
            to maintain that situation, but how we can do so is a matter for serious 
            and tough discussions. I assure Chris Ballance that I have at the 
            forefront of my mind the sustainability of opera in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>From now on, we will need 
            snappier questions and answers to try to get in most members who have 
            requested to speak.</P>
          <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab): </strong>I welcome the 
            minister's statement, particularly the strands of increasing access 
            and equitable provision and maintaining excellence. I have received 
            several letters about Scottish Opera. Will the minister say more about 
            how we will increase access to cultural provision in Scotland? I am 
            thinking of galleries and museums throughout Scotland, such as the 
            Smith Gallery in Stirling, which do a lot of work in schools to introduce 
            pupils to the cultural life.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>One of the messages in my statement 
            was that national organisations need to think much more about their 
            responsibility to citizens and the wider public. That issue must be 
            at the forefront of the deliberations. Scottish local government has 
            a critical role in that. Many people </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7612">7612</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>have good experience of challenging assumptions about how services 
            should be delivered. We must try to consider ways in which customers 
            or individuals who receive services can be much more involved. Certainly, 
            the work that is being done by galleries is trying to ensure that 
            there is an engagement with that process. Again, some of the individuals 
            who will be involved with the commission will have experience that 
            can make a contribution in that regard.</P>
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP): </strong>I am delighted 
            that the minister is pushing to ensure that culture has as central 
            a position in the Government as it has in our lives.</P>
          <P>How the members of the commission are recruited is of concern, as 
            we must ensure that the commission comprises a wide range of people. 
            The minister will recognise that, before the commission can report, 
            it must be understood that the major concern in the arts community 
            is the shortage of cash in many sectors and that, therefore, some 
            form of entry to the budgetary process before 2007 is necessary to 
            make that work. Does the minister have any comments to make on that 
            point? How does the commission's work relate to the cultural strategy 
            that was published by the previous Administration?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>I envisage the commission comprising 
            a relatively small number of people. As such, it cannot be absolutely 
            representative of the diverse cultural and non-cultural strands in 
            Scotland. As the position statement says, we want it to engage effectively 
            and thoroughly with many of the organisations, people and areas that 
            Mr Gibson has identified in his previous contributions on the subject 
            of culture. People's credibility and quality will be the primary reason 
            for their selection for the commission, rather than their background 
            or geographical location.</P>
          <P>On the question of resources, I say that, like Rob Gibson, I have 
            a passion for arts and culture. I will argue the case in the Cabinet 
            and the chamber about the centrality of arts and culture in our lives 
            and the way in which it impacts on the quality of our lives. There 
            will always be demands for resources from other areas of public policy; 
            all I can do is make a contribution to the debate about resources 
            and attempt to influence, inspire and persuade colleagues in that 
            context.</P>
          <P>Since the 2003 election, we have made progress on many of the issues 
            that Mr Gibson has raised. The commitment that the First Minister 
            gave in his St Andrew's day speech was a strong signal of the political 
            support for this area. Obviously, that has concomitant demands on 
            the arts sector, as Mr Gibson and I are well aware. However, we will 
            try to develop our ideas in that regard in the coming period.</P>

          <p></P>
          <P>A few members have made points about the cultural strategy. The cultural 
            strategy was a summation and an examination of where we were in 1999-2000. 
            In the three or four years since then, the Executive and the Parliament 
            have identified a number of issues that the commission can genuinely 
            examine. Already, we have made shifts in the nuance of the cultural 
            strategy in relation to traditional and contemporary music, because 
            of my personal interest in those issues, and in relation to literature 
            and writing, which we are trying to utilise more effectively in Scotland. 
            However, that is a continuation of what we have already done.</P>
          <P>The cultural strategy resulted in some substantial achievements, 
            but we want to move on and undertake a dramatic, innovative and radical 
            examination of what we do over the next 15 to 20 years and beyond.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>I 
            give a cautious welcome to the proposed new cultural commission. However, 
            I am not exactly sure how the new body will differ in scope and role 
            from the Scottish Arts Council. If the SAC is to remain in place, 
            will there not be a doubling-up of effort that will lead to still 
            further bureaucracy in what some see as an already over-bureaucratic 
            system of administration in Scottish culture?</P>
          <P>I support the notion of having a culture bill, but I question why 
            it should take until 2007. I would expect that it would be possible 
            for us to have some sort of results and some sort of bill before then.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>I have achieved something this morning 
            if I have received a cautious welcome from Ted Brocklebank, and I 
            thank him for that.</P>
          <P>The commission is time limited. It will operate for the next 12 months 
            in order to deliver some serious and critical recommendations about 
            the overall structure, organisation and processes of cultural development 
            activity in Scotland. It will not sustain itself beyond that year. 
            The critical issue is to identify the ways in which existing arts

            their work and to engage with them.</P>
          <P>The commission does not represent a doubling-up of bureaucracy. It

            serious and far-reaching questions that have not been fully examined 
            in the past 10 or 15 years. The commission will probably say some 
            challenging things&#151;we will have to wait and see what the outcomes 
            are&#151;but I welcome the work that will be undertaken over the next 
            12 months. The experience that James Boyle brings from his work </div>

          <P>in the Scottish Arts Council and in public sector broadcasting will 
            help us to identify ways in which we can deliver a different type 
            of cultural structure that fits the needs and demands of this century 
            rather than last century.</P>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab): </strong>I welcome the 
            establishment of the cultural commission under James Boyle. It is 
            time for the initial work of the cultural strategy to be taken forward.</P>
          <P>The minister will be aware of my interest in culture in education. 
            The importance of culture in raising pupils' self-esteem and attainment 
            levels is shown by the fact that creativity is now enshrined in our 
            national priorities for education. Could the minister comment on the 
            success of the school cultural co-ordinators programme and state whether 
            the intention is for that programme to be rolled out? Will he be making 
            a contribution to the current review of the curriculum in Scottish 
            schools? Does he agree that it is important that, as well as getting 
            additional money for culture, we should ensure that funding for culture 
            is embedded across the spending of all the various departments of 
            the Executive?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>Like Rhona Brankin, I am passionately 
            committed to the role that culture, arts and creativity can play in 
            the development of young people. The speech that the First Minister 
            made on St Andrew's day and the speech that I have made today contain 
            principles that will be thoroughly examined through the commission's 
            work.</P>
          <P>The work of the cultural co-ordinators programme, which was pioneered 
            by Rhona Brankin and others in the culture sector, has brought substantial 
            benefits to the schools and local authority areas that have engaged 
            with it. We would like the programme to be one of the key features 
            of our development of cultural activity across schools in Scotland.</P>
          <P>I am currently involved in bilateral discussions with the Minister 
            for Education and Young People on the role that culture can play in 
            the curriculum in terms of attainment, achievement, self-confidence 
            and other issues that we have identified in many debates in this chamber. 
            We believe that the commission will make a helpful contribution in 
            relation to those issues. Like Rhona Brankin, I believe that it would 
            be welcome if the commission's inquiry resulted in additional resources 
            for culture in schools.</P>

          <P> <strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_15"></A>The Presiding Officer (Mr 
            George Reid): </strong>The next item of business is a debate on motion 
            S2M-1184, in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, on mental health, and three 
            amendments to the motion.</P>
          <P>10:08</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Health and Community Care (Malcolm Chisholm): 
            </strong>The Executive and its many partners have a strong commitment 
            to mental health in Scotland. I am confident that that commitment 
            is shared by all of us.</P>
          <P>This morning, I want to share with members some of the work that 
            we are taking forward across the Executive and with our partners. 
            It is appropriate that we have this debate in national depression 
            week. Estimates show that depression will directly affect one in five 
            of us at some point in our lives. It is a common illness but one that 
            need not devastate lives. The aim of national depression week is to 
            raise awareness about the realities of depression and to reduce the 
            stigma associated with it. If we achieve those aims together, we can 
            play a significant part in encouraging people to seek help at an early 
            stage and improve their chances of recovery.</P>
          <P>Getting our policies right on mental health provides us with a great 
            opportunity in Scotland. Mental health is far more than the absence 
            of mental health problems and mental illness. It is about how we think 
            and how we feel about ourselves, how we interpret the world around 
            us and how we relate to others. Good and positive mental health is 
            an essential component of our overall health and well-being; if we 
            improve our mental health, our overall health and well-being are significantly 
            enhanced. We therefore gain huge benefits from working together to 
            create a more mentally healthy Scotland.</P>
          <P>At the same time, we need to be aware of the impact and the potentially 
            devastating effects of mental health problems. We know that people 
            with mental health problems die younger, live poorer-quality lives, 
            are more likely to live in poverty and are far less likely to be in 
            work. The economic impact in Scotland is estimated to be nearly £8 
            billion per annum. It can be no surprise, then, that since the birth 
            of the Parliament we have made mental health a priority and introduced 
            the most progressive mental health legislation in Europe. We have 
            made a start on developing and implementing a range of policies, programmes 
            and initiatives that will make a significant and practical difference 
            to people's lives. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight 
            some of that work.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7617">7617</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>In October 2001, I launched the national programme for improving 
            mental health and well-being in Scotland, which was the first public 
            policy programme on mental health improvement and public mental health 
            in the United Kingdom. Some £24 million of new money is being invested 
            in a number of practical measures, including work by NHS Health Scotland, 
            which is implementing a programme of mental health first-aid training. 
            That programme is based on work that was undertaken in Australia and 
            it aims to raise public awareness of mental well-being and mental 
            health problems. The programme is being tested throughout Scotland 
            in a range of settings, including colleges, police forces, general 
            hospitals and local communities.</P>
          <P>We have funded see me Scotland, the national anti-stigma campaign, 
            since 2002 and we have committed further resources to continue the 
            campaign's work. The campaign has achieved a level of recognition 
            and impact that exceeds our expectations, and I pay tribute not just 
            to the campaign team but to the alliance of five organisations that 
            continue to work together to support the campaign.</P>
          <P>In December 2002, I launched choose life, a 10-year suicide prevention 
            strategy and action plan. Our goal is to reduce Scotland's suicide 
            rate by 20 per cent by 2013. The strategy is backed up with £12 million 
            of funding for the first phase of national and local implementation. 
            To date, there are 32 choose life co-ordinating groups working in 
            local authority areas to address suicide prevention as part of the 
            local community planning process.</P>
          <P>Linked to the suicide prevention work is the breathing space telephone 
            advice line, which aims to help people who are at risk of suicide. 
            The line will be extended to cover the whole of Scotland by spring 
            2005.</P>
          <P>People with mental health problems can and do recover; international 
            estimates suggest that 60 to 70 per cent of people achieve recovery. 
            There are many things that help to promote and support recovery, and 
            good care and treatment services are a key component. The national 
            programme is funding the Scottish recovery network to promote a wider 
            understanding of what helps people to recover and to support local 
            agencies to help people to recover.</P>
          <p><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP): </strong>I 
            am grateful to the minister for that information, which is useful. 
            In March 2004, the &quot;National Mental Health Services Assessment&quot; 
            indicated that in 2002 there were nearly 900 suicides or undetermined 
            deaths in Scotland&#151;that is a horrific figure. The review also 
            shows that access to services in times of crisis is a high priority. 
            If someone is facing a potential suicide situation, that is an emergency. 
            A helpline number </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7618">7618</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>is obviously important, provided that it is well known. Can the minister 
            tell me the breathing space helpline number?</P>
          <p><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_8"></A>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I 
            do not personally know what it is. The helpline is operating in greater 
            Glasgow and Argyll and Clyde but, as I indicated, it will be extended 
            to cover the whole of Scotland by spring 2005. As Bruce Crawford points 
            out, the issue is not just a matter of helplines, important as those 
            are, and I will move on to talk about other services, including crisis 
            services. As I have only five and a half minutes, I will have to do 
            so without taking interventions. I will have to be selective, but 
            I want to give an outline of the vast range of initiatives that are 
            under way.</P>
          <P>I take this opportunity to focus on some key elements of the efforts 
            that are in hand to improve mental health services. When I spoke to 
            the Parliament last year, I committed the Executive to undertake a 
            national assessment of mental health services throughout Scotland 
            to help us to identify the issues that we need to address in implementing 
            the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. That work 
            was completed and published last month, and I am grateful to Dr Sandra 
            Grant and her team for their excellent work. Their findings were much 
            as we and others expected&#151;although there is much that we can 
            be proud of, there are significant areas for development.</P>
          <P>Using the results of the national assessment, each area has been 
            asked to complete a joint local implementation plan to set out how 
            the statutory agencies, with their voluntary sector partners and working 
            with service users and their carers, will deliver on the act's requirements. 
            To help with the implementation of the act, additional new resources 
            have been allocated between 2003 and 2006. Some £27 million is being 
            provided to local authorities, and partnership agreement funding of 
            £15 million is being invested in national health service boards to 
            support a range of work including the development of crisis response 
            services.</P>
          <P>I will pick up on a number of other areas for action that are mentioned 
            in Dr Grant's assessment. The first area is work force issues. We 
            established the national mental health work force group, which is 
            chaired by the head of the mental health division, and it is considering 
            work force planning for the new act, including recruitment, retention, 
            development and retraining issues. It uses a partnership approach 
            and it is supporting NHS employers and partner organisations to develop 
            local implementation plans. The group is modelling future work force 
            requirements in the light of the act, and it is gathering baseline 
            intelligence on the current mental health work force. In the future, 
            the group </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7619">7619</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>will focus on work force redesign, training and development issues. 
            Specific work is in hand with the Royal College of Psychiatrists on 
            those issues.</P>
          <P>On the SNP amendment, redesign is important but I point out that 
            we have created more training posts and specialist registrars for 
            psychiatrists. There is a recruitment problem throughout the United 
            Kingdom&#151;indeed, it is far worse in England than in Scotland. 
            We have increased the number of training positions for clinical psychologists, 
            so important action is being taken.</P>
          <P>The second aspect to highlight is service redesign. An appropriate 
            example of that, given that we are in national depression week, is 
            the work that is being done by the Health Department's centre for 
            change and innovation. As I mentioned, depression is a common mental 
            health problem in Scotland. It is costly, but it is also treatable. 
            Access to local and timely responses and the full range of interventions 
            and supports for depression are not yet universally available. The 
            national doing well by people with depression project aims to address 
            those issues. It is a three-year national programme with an initial 
            budget of £4.5 million for 2003 to 2006.</P>
          <P>Work is being done in a number of areas throughout Scotland to improve 
            the way in which depression is managed. In practice, that means improving 
            access to services and extending the range, quality and availability 
            of treatments and interventions. The results of that work will be 
            shared throughout Scotland to help to ensure the uptake of those new 
            and improved ways of working to support people with depression.</P>
          <P>A third area that we are progressing is improvement to care, treatment 
            and support for perinatal mental illness. That work aims to provide 
            services that are specifically targeted at the needs of mothers and 
            their babies. The act places a particular responsibility on health 
            boards to progress that important area of specialist care. In advance 
            of implementation of the act, we have developed guidance for the organisation 
            of admission services for mothers and babies. Greater Glasgow NHS 
            Board is well advanced in that work, and I am delighted that it has 
            invited me to open a dedicated unit later this year. Other boards 
            are developing their plans.</P>
          <P>I have deliberately left until last the most important element of 
            Dr Grant's report: the experiences, views and wishes of people with 
            mental health problems and their carers. Although a lot of good progress 
            is being made, it is clear that we need to do more to truly involve, 
            listen to and be influenced by the views of people who have direct 
            experience of services. I want to see not just involvement but evidence 
            of practical action that has been taken on their views and a sense 
            of engagement from those who provide </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7620">7620</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>care, treatment and support. That is essential to achieve the person-centred 
            focus that I want all our services to have.</P>
          <P>An example of that is the way in which we are responding to the views 
            that are expressed by people about the need for crisis services. In 
            the partnership agreement, we committed ourselves to the development 
            of mental health services, particularly crisis services. We have provided 
            funds in response to the &quot;Bid 79&quot; report by the remote and 
            rural areas resource initiative to help systems to develop psychiatric 
            emergency plans. I have also been particularly encouraged to learn 
            about plans to develop a crisis service that is led by people with 
            experience of mental health problems, and we are considering how best 
            to support that in partnership with the Scottish Association for Mental 
            Health. I pay tribute to the work that that body has done on psychiatric 
            drugs, including its most recent report, which again illustrates the 
            importance of involving users as partners in their care.</P>
          <P>An important aspect of supporting user involvement is the development 
            of individual and collective advocacy services, and we are committed 
            to ensuring access to independent advocacy for those who need support. 
            There is a duty under the act to provide that, and substantial extra 
            funds have been allocated. Finally, we are funding a major national 
            service user conference, which will take place on 22 and 23 June.</P>
          <P>My time is up so let me conclude. Mental health must be a priority 
            for the Executive and for the Parliament and it will continue to be 
            so. I am as conscious as anyone that more must be done to improve 
            Scotland's mental health and well-being, but I believe that we are 
            making progress.</P>
          <P>I move,</P>
          <P>That the Parliament acknowledges, in National Depression Week, the 
            Scottish Executive's commitment, reflected in the Partnership Agreement, 
            to maintain the mental well-being of the people of Scotland and to 
            improve the situation of those with mental health problems; notes 
            that National Depression Week aims to raise awareness of the realities 
            of depression and to reduce the stigma associated with it; commends 
            the work of the National Programme for Improving Mental Health and 
            Well-Being and progress towards implementation of the Mental Health 
            (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003; welcomes specific initiatives 
            in relation to workforce development and service re-design, such as 
            the Doing Well by People with Depression projects, but also urges 
            the Executive to continue to support efforts to reduce suicides through 
            the &quot;Choose Life&quot; strategy, to remove stigma and to increase 
            the range and quality of services available to those with mental health 
            problems.</P>

          <P>disappointing that his statement has abbreviated this debate.</P>
          <P>The SNP welcomes the chance to debate mental health one year on from 
            the passing of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 
            2003. We find it easy to welcome any initiatives that will improve 
            the mental health of people in Scotland and we support any measures 
            that will reduce the stigma attached to having a mental health problem, 
            especially if those initiatives can lead to reduction in suicide among 
            Scotland's people.</P>
          <P>Our amendment recognises that resource constraints will severely 
            inhibit the progress to success. At the time of the act's passage 
            through the Scottish Parliament, we focused on the need for adequate 
            resources to promote successful implementation. We share the minister's 
            vision for improving mental health services in Scotland, although 
            we do not necessarily agree about all the ways in which he seeks to 
            do that. Sandra Grant's findings show that much needs to be done.</P>
          <P>On a personal note, it is 40 years ago this month that I started 
            work in a psychiatric ward during my time between school and university. 
            For many people, mental ill health is an intensely personal experience 
            during which sufferers experience stigma, employment difficulties 
            and health support that is poorer than health support for almost any 
            other segment of people who are treated by the health service.</P>
          <P>Over the past five years, a number of MSPs past and present have 
            suffered bouts of mental ill health. No segment of society is immune. 
            The socially disadvantaged suffer greater ill health than average, 
            although mental ill health shows slightly less socioeconomic bias.</P>
          <P>We do not try to manage health provision on the basis of how many 
            people each winter have a cold, which is a self-limiting disease. 
            Similarly, the 70,000 or so who consult their general practitioner 
            for depression each year are but a fraction of those who suffer from 
            that debilitating illness. Assessing the need for mental health provision 
            is quite significantly different from other types of assessment and 
            we welcome the fact that the Executive is consulting on a draft code 
            of practice and regulations under the act.</P>
          <P>Sandra Grant's report is disturbing. The minister said that the report 
            was much as expected, but that is pretty disappointing, given that 
            we have one year to go until the full implementation of the act. Let 
            me quote the words of the patients whose comments are included in 
            the report and which are highlighted in the Scottish Association for 
            Mental Health briefing:</P>
          <P>&quot;You can sit in your room alone all day and no one will come 
            and see how you are.&quot;</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7622">7622</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Another comment was:</P>
          <P>&quot;cups were unwashed and stained, patients just stubbed their 
            fags out on the floor&#151;it was a hellish place&quot;.</P>
          <P>Another patient commented:</P>
          <P>&quot;At one stage I was lying on the ground because I was so distressed 
            and sad. All the staff did was walk over me in the corridor.&quot;</P>
          <P>I absolutely accept that NHS staff are dedicated and that, at its 
            best, the NHS is very good. However, those quotes show that, at its 
            worst, the NHS is very bad. As a caring society, we must judge our 
            performance by the worst. We must narrow the gap by raising the performance 
            of the worst, not by lowering the performance of the best.</P>
          <p><strong>Dr Jean Turner (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Ind): </strong>The 
            report gives an honest picture but, in fairness to NHS staff, the 
            NHS creates mental ill health because it does not look after its staff. 
            We have too few people doing the job. Too many people are ill treated 
            when they have workplace grievances and end up leaving due to mental 
            stress.</P>
          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Jean Turner makes an important 
            point. It would be interesting to know what the incidence of mental 
            ill health is among NHS staff compared with in the population. Perhaps 
            the minister can enlighten us on that.</P>
          <P>Stigma is also an issue. More than 100,000 Scots are denied work 
            because of their mental ill health. Fewer employers would consider 
            taking on someone with a mental illness than would consider taking 
            on a physically disabled person. In the wider community, 41 per cent 
            of those who live with mental health problems have experienced harassment 
            in Scottish communities, compared with 15 per cent of the general 
            public. That is why initiatives such as the see me campaign are a 
            welcome sign of the Executive's commitment to change society's attitude. 
            The minister said that the campaign has achieved good recognition 
            and impact, but the question is whether it has changed the experience 
            of people who suffer from mental ill health.</P>
          <P>I welcome progress on reduction of self-harm and suicide. Like others, 
            I will have been touched by suicide at some point in my life. I also 
            welcome the signs that the focus is turning to younger people, who 
            have been neglected in the provision of health services.</P>
          <P>The NHS boards have formidable new burdens under the act. We have 
            perhaps not yet seen progress in supporting health boards. The act's 
            implementation must not be half-baked. We must not see the introduction 
            of community-based compulsory treatment orders as an excuse for inadequate 
            levels of hospital services. Such orders are not a sticking plaster 
            or a cheap </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7623">7623</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>alternative. We need both community-based and hospital-based provision 
            being driven by patients' wishes.</P>
          <P>Sandra Grant's report highlights the fact that funding is not ring 
            fenced and much has to be provided from existing money because new 
            money has yet to be allocated.</P>
          <P>On staffing, 9 per cent of consultant psychiatrist posts are currently 
            vacant and some 5 per cent have been vacant for over six months. Between 
            400 and 500 student nurses specialise in mental health each year, 
            but there is a chronic under-recruitment of 10 per cent.</P>
          <P>The report's summary refers to some significant issues that Jean 
            Turner mentioned earlier:</P>
          <P>&quot;There are major staff morale, attitudinal and cultural problems 
            which, unless attended to consistently, will inhibit full implementation 
            of the underlying principles of the new Act ...</P>
          <P>Workforce gaps are probably the most difficult issue to address in 
            the short-term&quot;.</P>
          <P>There ain't a magic bullet, but we need to hear more from the minister. 
            Solving staff shortages cannot be done quickly. Our amendment refers 
            to the lack of psychiatrists, which is a surrogate for a broader problem. 
            We find it possible to support the other amendments, which have merit, 
            as does the motion.</P>
          <P>I conclude by drawing the minister's attention to the fact that none 
            of the Executive's 14 health objectives makes any reference to mental 
            health. Let us hope that, after the scheduling of today's debate, 
            we see a welcome shift up the priority ladder for this rather forgotten 
            corner of the NHS.</P>
          <P>I move amendment S2M-1184.1, to insert at end:</P>
          <P>&quot;while expressing concern that the large number of vacant consultant 
            psychiatrists' posts represents a significant barrier to delivering 
            much sought after improvements.&quot;</P>
          <P>10:28</P>
          <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con): </strong>I 
            welcome today's debate. I regret that it will be short, given that 
            many members have previously expressed their desire to speak on what 
            is a very big subject. Mental ill health probably affects 25 per cent 
            of the Scottish population at some time in their lives. That is a 
            stark figure. Mental health may be an Executive priority, but that 
            is not always apparent to people&#151;those who suffer from the conditions 
            and those who try to care for them.</P>
          <P>The minister has talked a good game this morning, but we need to 
            ensure that we get action to match. I welcome the resources that he 
            has announced, but I am concerned about their size. </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7624">7624</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Like others, I am concerned about whether we will have the trained 
            work force that will be able to implement and use those resources 
            in the best interests of sufferers and their families.</P>
          <P>It is frightening that 30 per cent of employees in any one year will 
            suffer from a mental health problem. As Stewart Stevenson rightly 
            pointed out, that affects us in Parliament as well. Nobody is immune 
            from mental illness. Part of the problem is to do with the way we 
            lead our lives in our society and the pressures that people are put 
            under.</P>
          <P>My amendment highlights the point that Dr Turner made about retention 
            of and support for the mental health work force. I had a family member 
            who suffered from poor mental health. She was in a psychiatric ward 
            in an old building that was not fit for purpose. However, more important 
            was the fact that there were not enough trained people to man that 
            ward fully throughout the week. If we went in on a Saturday or Sunday 
            to visit&#151;as we did&#151;we found that some of the nurses had 
            been co-opted from another part of the hospital and did not have the 
            necessary training. That meant that trained members of staff were 
            under tremendous pressure to juggle the needs of the various patients 
            who might want assistance at any time. If we are to encourage people 
            to take part in training to become psychiatric support workers such 
            as nurses, psychiatrists and therapists&#151;there is a huge shortage 
            of therapists&#151;we must ensure that they are well supported and 
            safe in their work, because there are elements of risk in some situations.</P>
          <P>I mention suicide in my amendment, about which we are all concerned. 
            No one in Scotland is unaware of the fact that suicide is the leading 
            cause of death in men aged between 15 and 34&#151;that point has been 
            made in the chamber on many occasions. I welcome the minister's comments 
            on the matter this morning. Once we are a little further down the 
            road, I would like the minister to indicate&#151;perhaps by placing 
            information in the Scottish Parliament information centre&#151;how 
            the problem is being addressed, so that Parliament can have access 
            to information about what is happening.</P>
          <P>The minister and others have mentioned stigma, which is a very important 
            issue.</P>
          <p><strong>Bruce Crawford: </strong>I asked the minister to provide 
            the telephone number for the breathing space helpline. I did not expect 
            him to know it, but I was trying to make the point that it should 
            be a 999 service because it deals with real emergencies. Does David 
            Davidson share my view that people should be able to access the service 
            in that way to get help?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>I support any action that will enable 
            access to care to be provided in a hurry. I </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7625">7625</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>thought that that would have been one of the tasks of NHS 24. In 
            the absence of the direct number that the minister cannot remember, 
            I would try NHS 24. I presume that I am helping the minister out by 
            making that point.</P>
          <P>I spoke recently at a function that was also attended by the head 
            of the mental health division of the Health Department. Interestingly, 
            people from areas other than mental health were at that function. 
            Stigma is an issue&#151;it is about being different but not being 
            understood. We must take that vital subject to our hearts in Scotland. 
            It relates not just to mental health but to disabilities in general.</P>
          <P>I was disappointed that the minister did not say much about the voluntary 
            sector and the wonderful role that it plays, despite its not being 
            supported adequately. I know that the minister and his team support 
            the establishment of a new organisation to support carers of mental 
            health patients. I hope that in time he will be able to back that 
            up, as I know that he has given his staff clearance to become involved, 
            which I welcome greatly. Many carers throughout Scotland are grateful 
            for that.</P>
          <P>This morning there has been much talk about Sandra Grant's report, 
            which highlights some issues in the community. There is a chronic 
            shortage of community psychiatrists and support staff&#151;instead 
            of there being one psychiatrist per general practitioner practice, 
            there may be one community psychiatrist operating in the community 
            two days out of five and who has to cover six or eight practices. 
            To be frank, that is not good enough; it is certainly not good enough 
            for those involved and for sufferers.</P>
          <P>We need to consider early assessment in all areas of mental health, 
            not just for depression. If early assessment does not take place, 
            we may end up dealing with chronic conditions, suicides and all sorts 
            of habits, such as alcohol or drugs habits, which people develop as 
            means of escape. If we assess people early, we must have the capacity 
            and infrastructure in the health service to provide care to people 
            once they have been assessed.</P>
          <P>I hope that the Auditor General for Scotland is watching the outcomes 
            of these developments. It is now his habit to examine various aspects 
            of health care, such as infection in hospitals and cleanliness. I 
            hope that he will start to consider mental health, so that adequate 
            outside influence can be brought to bear on it.</P>
          <P>I move amendment S2M-1184.2, to leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; 
            to end and insert:</P>

            of the National Mental Health Services Assessment which highlights 
            shortcomings in mental health services; is concerned about recruitment, 
            retention and support issues surrounding the mental health workforce; 
            notes that the number of those receiving care in inappropriate settings 
            is still too high, and urges the Executive to increase its efforts 
            to address the rising incidence of suicide in Scotland.&quot;</P>
          <P>10:34</P>
          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP): </strong>I commend 
            all the helpful speeches that have been made.</P>
          <P>The figure of one in five has already been cited often in the debate. 
            That figure could apply to the chamber, although mental health problems 
            affect disproportionately those who live in deprived areas. I do not 
            think that many members live in such areas, so perhaps fewer than 
            one in five of us is affected by mental ill health.</P>
          <P>There is a duty on the politicians in the chamber to help to remove 
            the stigma that is associated with mental ill health by acknowledging 
            contact with mental health problems, or experience of mental health 
            problems that they might have had; for example, I have suffered from 
            post-natal depression. Mental ill health is not about being different&#151;it 
            is quite normal to react, at some stage in our lives, to the society 
            in which we live with a mental health problem.</P>
          <P>Poverty is a big factor. People who live in the poorest areas are 
            nearly three times as likely as the general population to be admitted 
            to hospital for depression and Malcolm Chisholm said that people with 
            mental health problems were more likely to be poor: poverty is both 
            a cause and an effect of mental ill health. People who live in deprived 
            areas are three times more likely to commit suicide, four times more 
            likely to be admitted to hospital for self-poisoning, six times more 
            likely to be admitted with schizophrenia and 10 times more likely 
            to be admitted with an alcohol problem. We cannot address individual 
            mental ill health without addressing the health of society in general. 
            Unless we introduce radical measures to eradicate poverty, hopelessness 
            and the despair that goes with them, we will not reduce seriously 
            the number of people who are affected by mental health problems. Even 
            within the limited powers of the Scottish Parliament, we could&#151;for 
            example, by abolishing prescription charges&#151;do a great deal to 
            reduce the economic burden on people who have been diagnosed as having 
            mental health problems. We also need to consider prevention, which 
            would be much more effective than treatment. We need to eradicate 
            poverty.</P>
          <P>One helpful measure would be to ensure that local authorities are 
            able to offer people with mental health problems&#151;as they do for 
            people </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7627">7627</A></p>

          <P>with disabilities&#151;access to concessionary travel and appropriate 
            transport schemes. The dial-a-bus scheme that provides a taxi-style 
            service should be extended to those who are unable to use public transport 
            because of anxiety disorder. Small measures of that sort would make 
            a big difference to the quality of life of people who have mental 
            health problems.</P>
          <P>Reference has already been made to the situation in the workplace. 
            The figures make it clear that a higher than average proportion of 
            people who are in employment suffer from mental ill health&#151;three 
            in 10 employees have a mental health problem in any one year. NHS 
            staff have been mentioned and it is absolutely true that a very high 
            proportion of sickness absence among NHS staff is associated with 
            stress and mental health problems. Just before I was elected, I dealt 
            with issues relating to staff in acute medical receiving wards, which 
            have sickness absence rates of up to 20 per cent. The majority of 
            those absences were caused by stress. We must care for the staff who 
            care for the patients.</P>
          <P>It is clear that there is a case for money to be spent on preventive 
            measures and for mental health services to be lifted from their current 
            Cinderella status in the NHS. At the same time, we need to remove 
            stigma from people with long-term mental health issues. Less than 
            10 per cent of people with severe and enduring mental health problems 
            are in full-time employment and 72 per cent of people with psychotic 
            illness are unemployed or economically inactive, which is unacceptable. 
            Discriminatory attitudes that would be unthinkable for any other oppressed 
            group are promoted by sections of the press and, unfortunately, fear 
            and hatred of people with mental health problems are the last acceptable 
            prejudices. Despite the see me campaign and all the great words that 
            have been uttered in the chamber, in the latest issue of <em>Holyrood</em> 
            magazine, ex-MSP Mike Russell casually uses the abusive word &quot;loony&quot; 
            to describe political opponents. That is not acceptable. We have all 
            been guilty of it in the past&#151;I admit guilt&#151;but we need 
            to cut it out.</P>
          <P>My amendment refers to several measures, including the abolition 
            of prescription charges&#151;one of the big issues&#151;and a proper 
            advocacy service for when there is debate. Access to cognitive therapy 
            and counselling should be as easy as access to a prescription. The 
            pharmaceutical companies have too great a vested interest in the profits 
            that are associated with drugs and mental illness and I have grave 
            concerns about the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</P>
          <P>It is unacceptable that people have to wait in excess of six weeks 
            before they receive counselling. There should be equal access to </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7628">7628</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>alternative therapy and cognitive therapies that can be much more 
            effective at achieving recovery, rather than merely stabilisation.</P>
          <P>I also agree that we need to have emergency access. During the consultation 
            on primary medical services in Lanarkshire NHS Board, mental health 
            groups have consistently raised the issue of being unable to get a 
            duty consultant psychiatrist when they approach out-of-hours services 
            through their general practitioners or through accident and emergency 
            units. All that is unacceptable.</P>
          <P>Words are fine, but we have to apply resources in the long term in 
            order to achieve real change, and we have to tackle the problems in 
            society that cause the hopelessness and despair that lead to the majority 
            of mental health problems.</P>
          <P>I move amendment S2M-1184.3, to leave out from &quot;through&quot; 
            to end and insert:</P>
          <P>&quot;; notes that mental health problems disproportionately affect 
            those living in deprived areas and that despite the Executive's commitment 
            to tackling mental health problems as a priority, mental health services 
            remain underfunded and overstretched in many parts of Scotland; believes 
            that abolishing prescription charges would help to address the poverty 
            trap faced by mental health service users who return to work, and 
            further believes that more resources should be directed towards treatment 
            and rehabilitation in community settings, that there should be a greater 
            emphasis on children's mental health, that in-patient treatment facilities 
            should be housed in modern buildings, accessible to the communities 
            that they serve, that more practical and financial support should 
            be given to the families and other carers of those experiencing mental 
            health problems and that, as a priority, a well-resourced, independent 
            national advocacy service for users of mental health services should 
            be established in Scotland.&quot;</P>
          <P>10:41</P>
          <p><strong>Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): </strong>I 
            am pleased that Executive has given us the opportunity to consider 
            the services that are provided for people in Scotland who have mental 
            health problems.</P>
          <P>There can be little doubt that mental health services have improved 
            in recent years. However, there is no room for complacency. A little 
            more than a year ago, the Parliament passed the Mental Health (Care 
            and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, which was the first major overhaul 
            of mental health law for 40 years. It is clear that it will be some 
            time before the effects of that legislation can be thoroughly examined, 
            but much can be done in the meantime.</P>
          <P>As Carolyn Leckie and Stewart Stevenson said, one of the first problems 
            that someone who is suffering from mental ill health will encounter 
            is the stigma that is unfortunately still associated with such conditions. 
            The Scottish survey on public attitudes on mental health showed that 
            half of all </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7629">7629</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>respondents said that they would not want anyone to know if they 
            developed a mental health problem. Similarly, a survey that was carried 
            out by the National Schizophrenia Fellowship (Scotland) showed that 
            41 per cent of people with mental health problems had experienced 
            harassment while living in Scottish communities, which compares with 
            the large figure of 15 per cent among the general public. That is 
            unacceptable and we all have a role to play in bringing a greater 
            understanding of such conditions. A debate such as today's will play 
            its part, but we as a society have to acknowledge that mental ill 
            health is widespread but can in many cases be treated effectively.</P>
          <P>The three-year mental health action plan that was announced last 
            September contained several welcome initiatives and, just as important, 
            the Executive is committed to providing the resources that are necessary 
            to implement them, with £24 million coming from the health improvement 
            fund. One of the priority areas that were identified in the action 
            plan was the mental health of children and young people, which has 
            not in the past been given the attention that it deserves, so I was 
            pleased to see that the Executive will concentrate on it.</P>
          <P>Last year, the Scottish needs assessment programme published its 
            &quot;Needs Assessment Report on Child and Adolescent Mental Health&quot;. 
            The report noted that at any one time, about 10 per cent of people 
            aged under 19 in Scotland&#151;125,000 young people&#151;have mental 
            health problems that</P>
          <P>&quot;are so substantial that they have difficulties with their thoughts, 
            their feelings, their behaviour, their learning, their relationships, 
            on a day to day basis.&quot;</P>
          <P>Clearly that is not an ideal start to life and, although it does 
            not necessarily follow that those who suffer from mental health problems 
            when they are young will continue to do so when they are older, it 
            is certainly the case that the disruption that depression or other 
            mental illnesses can have at such a crucial stage in a person's life 
            can have a devastating effect on their later lives. It is certainly 
            one area that we have to get right.</P>
          <P>The Liberal Democrats believe strongly in health promotion and the 
            prevention of ill health. That is particularly important when we deal 
            with young people. It is no surprise that one of the recommendations 
            of the Scottish needs assessment programme's report on child and adolescent 
            mental health is to adopt</P>
          <P>&quot;An integrated approach to promotion, prevention and care&quot;.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7630">7630</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>The report found that although those themes should be complementary, 
            in practice they are</P>
          <P>&quot;often discussed as separate or even competing approaches.&quot;</P>
          <P>The mental health action plan states that the Executive will act 
            on a number of the SNAP report's recommendations, but it does not 
            say on which ones. I would therefore be grateful if the minister could 
            tell me whether that is one of the recommendations that will be vigorously 
            pursued.</P>
          <P>Among the other priorities that are outlined in the action plan is 
            the need to improve mental health and well-being in employment and 
            working life. As David Davidson said, in any one year, three out of 
            every 10 employees will be off work with a mental health problem. 
            Although our main concern should be with the patient, the cost to 
            employers cannot be overlooked, with the economic impact of mental 
            health problems in Scotland estimated at almost £8 billion. I support 
            the measures that are contained in the action plan to promote good 
            health at work, especially the pledge to work alongside Scotland's 
            Health at Work&#151;SHAW&#151;to promote mental health and well-being 
            at work.</P>
          <P>We must also remember that everyone has the right to work and that 
            working is often an important part of ensuring good mental health. 
            We must ensure that we break the vicious circle in which many people 
            find themselves of experiencing mental health problems, being unable 
            to find suitable employment, and then experiencing further problems 
            because of that.</P>
          <P>One of the areas that was highlighted in the Liberal Democrats' manifesto 
            for the 2003 elections was a pledge to</P>
          <P>&quot;Support the work of community mental health nursing teams, 
            allowing services to be delivered within local communities.&quot;</P>
          <P>That is vital because we should be ensuring that patients are, wherever 
            possible&#151;and, importantly, when they want it&#151;able to stay 
            in their homes.</P>
          <P>It is clear that although there is still a lot of work to do, we 
            are progressing in the right direction. By concentrating on important 
            areas such as young people, well-being at work and&#151;particularly 
            important&#151;health promotion and the prevention of ill health, 
            we can ensure that people are in sound mental health in the future. 
            There should now be less stigma attached to mental health problems 
            than was the case in the past, but it cannot be denied that stigma 
            is still present. We have to get the message across that mental health 
            problems can affect anyone and everyone. There is no shame in someone's 
            admitting that they have mental health problems. Help and support 
            are available.</P>

          <p><strong>Helen Eadie (Dunfermline East) (Lab): </strong>I will support 
            the motion in the minister's name and I believe that it and the amendments 
            serve to illustrate that there is infinite demand for finite resources, 
            whether those resources come in the shape of funding or qualified 
            personnel.</P>
          <P>I applaud the efforts of Malcolm Chisholm, his colleagues and members 
            of Parliament who have been united over the years and who have stated 
            clearly that mental health will be a priority of Parliament, which 
            reflects serious concern throughout Scotland. There is evidence of 
            that commitment in legislation and regulations and in the funds that 
            are being put in place. As I understand it, funding at the end of 
            2001 stood at just less than £0.5 billion.</P>
          <P>Mental health issues have probably touched us all at one time or 
            another. As an MSP, I have dealt with several cases, a number of which 
            I have found to be very distressing. I have a young daughter who attends 
            university in Fife and I know of several cases there that I have found 
            to be profoundly distressing.</P>
          <P>My election agent also brought the issues home to me. She was a psychologist 
            in North Lanarkshire and had to take early retirement because of the 
            burn-out that she experienced as a professional. Her perception was 
            that the ratio of psychologists to patients was something like 1:60,000. 
            There are therefore enormous issues in respect of recruitment, retention 
            and training of staff.</P>
          <P>I applaud the work of Dr Sandra Grant, and her report. I find it 
            to be extremely informative; when we are implementing the new legislation, 
            the report will inform us about the challenges that have to be faced 
            in our own back yard. If I am allowed to do so, I will speak about 
            the situation in Fife.</P>
          <P>The hospital configuration in Fife is of serious concern and I want 
            to impress on the minister that there is a real need in that area. 
            We have been talking for five years about addressing the configuration 
            of mental health services in Fife, so I plead that the minister and 
            his civil servants address the matter by meeting urgently with Fife 
            NHS Board to arrive&#151;once and for all&#151;at the conclusion that 
            we must have at least one centre of excellence in Fife. That view 
            comes through in Dr Sandra Grant's report and a number of my MSP colleagues 
            in Fife share it. The configuration issue must be addressed.</P>
          <P>I have visited Stratheden hospital, which for centuries now has been 
            one of the mental health providers in our locality. However, the building 
            is inadequate; it is enormous and it is heated throughout, although 
            only half of it is used. Money </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7632">7632</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>is dripping through the bottom of a bucket that never fills up. If 
            we are to consider waste, we must get the situation in Stratheden 
            sorted. One of the worst cases with which I had to deal was that of 
            a patient who was going to be a resident in Stratheden for the foreseeable 
            future. However, he was living in one of a number of cubicles that 
            had no windows and in which the walls were merely dividers that were 
            only three-quarters of the height of the room, which did not allow 
            for patients playing radios or having private conversations.</P>
          <P>There are no children's beds in Stratheden and six of its adolescent 
            beds have been closed. There are no separate in-patient facilities 
            for mothers and babies. Dr Grant's report refers to those matters. 
            There is no 24-hour response service in Stratheden. In some parts 
            of Fife, community mental health teams are well established, but in 
            other parts they are under-developed. Something must be done urgently 
            to make community-based compulsory treatment orders a viable option.</P>
          <P>The voluntary sector plays an important part in Fife, having widened 
            the scope of the services that are provided. However, the services 
            for carers in Fife are patchy and not well developed. There are no 
            advocacy projects for carers and there is a waiting list for service 
            users who want to access advocacy services. However, Fife Council 
            and NHS Fife have a clear commitment to developing advocacy services.</P>
          <P>The priorities in Fife that we want the minister to address are: 
            providing mental health awareness training for the public; changing 
            the system and the attitudes of psychiatric and medical staff; and 
            providing a centre of excellence in mental health as part of a wider 
            health centre. I can suggest a place in my constituency in which to 
            build such a centre: Lochgelly. I believe that people throughout Fife 
            agree that it has a central location. Lochgelly is adjacent to a motorway 
            and has good access to every part of Fife. There are masses of space 
            there for development. I believe that Lochgelly would be an excellent 
            place in which to have a new-build facility. I am told that ministers 
            review their capital spending allocations in June. If any underspend 
            is found, I plead with the minister to think carefully about whether 
            it could be used to provide a new facility in Lochgelly. Fife also 
            needs more access to respite care and access to alternative therapies. 
            I spoke briefly to the minister about that last night, so I know that 
            we are pushing at an open door. Fife also needs better access to psychology 
            services.</P>
          <P>I thank the minister for all his and his team's hard work. From speaking 
            with him, I know how heavily committed he is to mental health issues. 
            He and his colleagues are addressing the issues </div>

          <P>against a difficult background of infinite demand and finite resources.</P>
          <P>10:53</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I preface 
            my remarks by thanking the Executive for bringing the debate to the 
            chamber today. The debate is timely in that it is being held during 
            national depression week. In addition, the debate will help to raise 
            awareness of depression and to fight the stigma that surrounds it.</P>
          <P>It bears repeating that one in five people will be affected by depression 
            at some stage in their lives. Treating depression accounts for 30 
            to 40 per cent of the work burden of NHS primary care services. The 
            World Health Organisation predicts that depression will be second 
            only to heart disease as the biggest global health burden by 2020. 
            However, three in four cases of depression are neither recognised 
            nor treated because the stigma that is associated with mental health 
            problems continues to prevent people from seeking and finding help.</P>
          <P>Therefore, while any and all initiatives that the Executive takes 
            to raise awareness and tackle stigma are to be welcomed, there are 
            legitimate questions to be asked about whether enough is being done 
            to promote mental well-being and to combat mental ill health, given 
            the scale of the problems and the history of underinvestment in mental 
            health services over many decades.</P>
          <P>Ministers are aware of the patchy nature of service provision across 
            the country. Dr Sandra Grant's report identifies many gaps in services 
            and it makes for grim reading. The notion that mental health is the 
            Cinderella service of the NHS persists&#151;under-resourced, under-staffed 
            and under intense pressure is the reality for professionals who work 
            in the field. Despite the central directives and the establishment 
            of mental health as a national clinical priority, local NHS boards 
            still appear to be reluctant to reallocate resources in favour of 
            mental health. The minister's earlier announcement of extra resources 
            is welcome, but ensuring that those resources reach their intended 
            destination and have the required impact will need careful monitoring.</P>
          <P>In the time that I have left, I want to focus on one or two areas 
            for priority action. The first is child and adolescent mental health, 
            which was until recently something of an invisible issue in the policy 
            domain. As Mike Rumbles highlighted, recent studies have indicated 
            that 10 per cent of the five-to-15 age group&#151;125,000 of Scotland's 
            children&#151;suffer from mental health problems of such severity 
            and persistence as to have a significant impact on those children's 
            functioning and relationships. The rate is higher among </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7634">7634</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>children in lone-parent households and in low-income families. However, 
            according to the Scottish needs assessment programme report that was 
            published last spring, such problems often go unidentified and it 
            is difficult to access the right support even when they are recognised.</P>
          <P>Clearly, it would make sense to ensure that such problems are tackled 
            when they arise, instead of allowing them to develop to the point 
            at which they endanger a child's healthy development. Early intervention 
            and prevention of mental ill health among children should surely be 
            at the top of the priority list for Government action. Other studies 
            show that it is possible to instil resilience&#151;the capacity to 
            cope with stress&#151;through school-based programmes. Carefully designed 
            and implemented preventive programmes can reduce the rate of subsequent 
            mental health problems in high-risk populations.</P>
          <P>I am aware that the child health support group is working on a guidance 
            template to develop the SNAP report's recommendations, but I would 
            appreciate an indication from the ministers today of their commitment 
            to ensuring that implementation will be supported by sufficient resources. 
            Dr Graham Bryce, who chairs the support group's work in that area, 
            indicated yesterday to the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament 
            on mental health that a doubling of the budget on child and adolescent 
            mental health services would be required to turn round the dire situation 
            that specialist services will face within the next five to 10 years.</P>
          <P>That may be necessary as far as treatment is concerned, but clinical 
            services alone will not tackle the underlying problems. The range 
            of children's services must be brought into play in the form of an 
            intelligent network. Schools have a particularly important role to 
            play not only in terms of referrals to specialist services, but in 
            providing direct assistance to children. The importance of a major 
            staff-training effort cannot be overemphasised.</P>
          <P>We must move away from current practices in which children who are 
            identified as having mental health or behaviour problems are all too 
            often diagnosed by general practitioners who have little time or expertise 
            to carry out thorough assessments. I am particularly alarmed at the 
            growth in the use of drug therapies to modify children's behaviour 
            or to deal with their mental health problems. That cannot be the way 
            forward. I have run out of time, but that is an area to which I will 
            need to return in future.</P>

          <p><strong>Marlyn Glen (North East Scotland) (Lab): </strong>I welcome

          <P>depression week, as part of a much needed exercise in raising awareness 
            of the realities of depression. I also welcome the Scottish Executive's 
            commitment to improving the mental health and well-being of the Scottish 
            population. Mental health in Scotland has always been designated as 
            a priority by the Parliament.</P>
          <P>The main focus of the money given so far to build up mental health 
            services is on crisis services. If members have any first-hand knowledge 
            of mental health issues, they will appreciate how vital a well-resourced 
            and efficient crisis service is, but crisis services are only part 
            of the equation. Mental health difficulties can often be chronic and 
            recurring, and the new ways that are being used to support and treat 
            people with depression are also absolutely essential. Unfortunately, 
            however, mental health is an area that most people try to ignore.</P>
          <P>We all realise and accept that our general health will have its ups 
            and downs, and some of us are always more than happy to give chapter 
            and verse about our aches and pains to anyone who will listen. Although 
            we may not want to listen, we do not assign blame, but mental health 
            is another story. Too often, it is an untold story, as the statistics 
            show. As we have heard, one in five of us will face mental health 
            issues sometime in our lives, which means that every single one of 
            us will be affected in some way. If it is not oneself, it may be one's 
            partner, children, parents or friends and, most certainly, one's constituents.</P>
          <P>Another aspect of mental health is the fact that all categories of 
            people are affected by it. More women than men suffer from depression 
            problems, but more of the men commit suicide. The importance of &quot;Choose 
            Life: A National Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent Suicide in Scotland&quot; 
            cannot be overemphasised.</P>
          <P>A surprising number of young people suffer from mental health problems. 
            As a teacher of many years' experience, I know that it has only lately 
            been recognised that young people in schools often have mental health 
            problems, which lie at the heart of their learning difficulties. How 
            can anyone concentrate on class work when they are clinically depressed? 
            I am not sure that teachers are best placed to do the referrals, because 
            they must first recognise that there is a problem and they must be 
            instructed on how to pick that up and deal with it. I welcome the 
            introduction of services to school pupils, but I know that it is not 
            generally accepted that we should be looking after the mental health 
            of young people&#151;even those as young as primary pupils.</P>
          <P>If one has what is called a sunny disposition, it is extremely difficult 
            to comprehend the darkness of the cloud that can settle on someone 
            else, and it is also difficult to take in the prevalence of </div>

          <p></P>
          <P>depression. It is now accepted, however, that consideration of health 
            must include consideration of mental health. The report &quot;Towards 
            a Healthier LGBT Scotland&quot; contains a section that states:</P>
          <P>&quot;Anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide and attempted suicide 
            have all been linked with the combined effects of the experience of 
            prejudice and discrimination&quot;.</P>
          <P>Thus it becomes less surprising to read in that report about the</P>
          <P>&quot;Higher levels of LGB people reporting psychological distress&quot;,</P>
          <P>especially in light of the finding that &quot;Gay&quot; is</P>
          <P>&quot;now the most commonly used term of abuse in the school playground&quot;.</P>
          <P>That is a fact that most teachers would corroborate, but I am not 
            confident that most teachers know how to deal with it.</P>
          <P>Because mental health cannot be considered in isolation, as Carolyn 
            Leckie said, the problems that accompany depression can be wide ranging 
            and quite paralysing. Problems with unemployment, housing, debt and 
            prescription charges for essential drugs are additional problems that 
            we must consider more seriously. For young people, education itself, 
            bullying and general health are the problems that can come up, so 
            it is crucial that we work to raise the general level of services 
            across the board. Mental ill health multiplies the ordinary pressures 
            of life, yet there is still a tendency to ignore it.</P>
          <P>I conclude by commending the award-winning see me anti-stigma campaign, 
            and I ask each of us to start looking around and really seeing one 
            another. That is what the campaign is about. I also congratulate the 
            stigma stopwatchers, who are challenging misleading or inaccurate 
            representations of people with mental health problems in the media. 
            That is something that we can do here as well; we can challenge such 
            representations in the chamber. Importantly, the stigma stopwatchers 
            also know when the media get it right, so there is a positive side 
            to that initiative too. We need to start talking openly about mental 
            health and give real support and good service to all those affected. 
            I end on a lighter note by recommending the greeting used by the fictional, 
            but very astute, Dr Frasier Crane, and by wishing everyone &quot;Good 
            mental health.&quot;</P>
          <P>11:05</P>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>Although 
            Carolyn Leckie, Marlyn Glen and other members have mentioned the statistic 
            that one in five people will be affected by depression, I seem to 
            remember that the British Medical Association wrote to us to say that 
            more than 30 per cent of visits to GPs involved an element of mental 
            health, </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7637">7637</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>so I think that the one-in-five figure may be an underestimate.</P>
          <P>Too often, we concentrate on staff, on drugs and on day centres, 
            assuming that if we throw more money at mental health all the problems 
            will be solved. I suddenly realised that we do not actually spend 
            much time talking about the causes of depression or recognising those 
            causes, as other members have said. Last night, many MSPs turned up 
            for the briefing from the National Association of Funeral Directors. 
            I was touched to hear the speakers talking about unresolved grief, 
            which is obviously a problem that funeral directors recognise but 
            cannot deal with. They said that they can do their bit at the time 
            of death and that they are aware of that enormous problem, but when 
            they refer people to bereavement counselling&#151;particularly to 
            Cruse Bereavement Care in Edinburgh&#151;those people have to wait 
            for more than three months. Instead of always talking about drugs, 
            psychiatrists and psychiatric hospitals, we should perhaps start to 
            look at giving people help where it is needed, rather than telling 
            them to wait for three months and to cope on their own. The point 
            about early intervention has been well made.</P>
          <P>Members of this Parliament should be proud of achieving the passing 
            of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. The 
            Westminster Government had been considering such legislation for some 
            years and then shelved the Mental Health Bill, but we just got on 
            with it. The complexity of the 2003 act and the speed of its passage 
            through Parliament is a matter for concern, but its provisions are 
            nonetheless to be welcomed and I am sure that ministers and MSPs in 
            all parties will closely monitor its implementation.</P>
          <P>I commend the work of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland. 
            I have contacted the commission on behalf of constituents who had 
            complaints and I believe that in any discussion of mental health we 
            should commend the excellent work that it does. However, when the 
            Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Scotland Act 2003 was passed, the 
            shortage of psychiatrists and mental health officers was highlighted. 
            At that time, we were 29 psychiatrists short in Scotland and required 
            a further 28 to implement the act. Although staffing is crucial, the 
            considerable bed blocking in mental health is also due to the shortage 
            of day centres, crisis care centres, supported housing and residential 
            care. Sandra Grant's thorough report highlights those shortages.</P>
          <P>In this Parliament, we are capable of raising concerns about postcode 
            prescribing&#151;we are right to raise those concerns&#151;and I was 
            pleased to hear the point that Adam Ingram made, but that </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7638">7638</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>debate often leads to the view that there is a pill for every ill. 
            In mental health, that is particularly the case, whether the problems 
            are long term or short term, but drugs can never be the only answer. 
            In fact, the side effects sometimes cause greater problems than the 
            drugs attempt to resolve. I make no apology for once again mentioning 
            the prescription of Ritalin to young children, which is a matter for 
            serious concern. There are also concerns about the use of Seroxat 
            for adults. I have worked with several constituents in the Highlands 
            who have been trying to reduce their intake of Seroxat and I am aware 
            of the horrendous side effects that they have suffered. I acknowledge 
            that that is not the case for every patient, but it is the case for 
            some.</P>
          <P>Psychological support is also needed. Given the severe staff shortages, 
            that area is sadly neglected. As other members have said, hospitals 
            are not just about containment. I am always shocked when I hear about 
            people who are on suicide watch in a psychiatric hospital but who 
            go out at 9 o'clock in the morning and come back at 9 o'clock at night. 
            I am also amazed that so many people are reported to the police as 
            missing from psychiatric hospitals. Psychiatric hospitals are there 
            to support people and should not just offer bed and breakfast. The 
            people whom they support should be closely monitored.</P>
          <P>Carolyn Leckie mentioned therapy, counselling, complementary medicine 
            and so on. In Scotland, 40 per cent more prescriptions are handed 
            out for depression than in England&#151;that is a shocking statistic. 
            I commend the work that Adam Ingram is doing in the cross-party group 
            on mental health. At the group's meeting yesterday, Graham Bryce talked 
            about suicide among young men. If we think that a helpline is the 
            only answer to that problem, we are really missing the point. Many 
            young men and women are depressed because they are unable to express 
            their feelings and fears. Earlier this week I met speech therapists. 
            I had tended to think that they could help only people who have physical 
            impairments, but in fact they have a tremendous input into helping 
            people to express themselves. I hope that speech therapists, as well 
            as other professions allied to medicine, will be made available. Let 
            us not naively think that the answer to everything is to roll out 
            the breathing space advice line throughout Scotland.</P>
          <P>I commend the community mental health team in Nairn for its excellent 
            work in supporting patients safely at a local level, which consistently 
            reduces admissions to psychiatric hospitals.</P>
          <P>11:11</P>
          <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab): </strong>I welcome the 
            opportunity to debate mental health, which, thanks to much of the 
            action that the Scottish </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7639">7639</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Executive has taken, is not quite the Cinderella of the health service 
            that it once was. I acknowledge the key role that the national programme 
            for improving mental health and well-being will have as a driver of 
            change. Change is desperately needed.</P>
          <P>Let us set the situation in context. Adam Ingram was right to cite 
            information from the World Health Organisation that suggests that 
            mental health problems are likely to be the second greatest cause 
            of illness&#151;after cardiac problems&#151;in the next decade or 
            two. That should concern us all. I agree with Marlyn Glen, Carolyn 
            Leckie and others that there is a causal link between poverty and 
            disadvantage and between substance abuse and mental health problems, 
            but we must be careful not to over-generalise. Mental illness affects 
            as many as one in five people, as we have heard, so it clearly impacts 
            on people in all different walks of life. There is no uniformity to 
            mental illness; it affects people in very different ways, so we must 
            ensure that we deliver an appropriate range of services, as locally 
            as possible.</P>
          <P>In the context of mental health care, small is indeed beautiful&#151;that 
            is different from some of the other principles that drive health service 
            reform. I stress that point because small units are clinically advantageous, 
            not just for the service but, more particularly, for patients. Successful 
            treatment of mental illness, whether the illness is long or short 
            term, depends to a large degree on the delivery of local care. I think 
            that everyone agrees that local care that is delivered by community 
            mental health teams and provided with appropriate support is the best 
            option in most circumstances.</P>
          <P>However, we should not assume that the pattern of any particular 
            mental illness remains static. As with most other illnesses, there 
            will be crises, when appropriate in-patient services will be needed. 
            We need a critical level of in-patient beds throughout Scotland that 
            can be accessed locally, rather than through a centralised system. 
            Like others, I believe that Sandra Grant's report helpfully charts 
            the journey that is still to be undertaken. The report identifies 
            the need for: out-of-hours and crisis services; more support for people 
            in the community who cope with mental health problems; easier access 
            to local, rather than centralised, services; and much better cohesion 
            between the agencies that are involved. Perhaps most important, the 
            report identifies the need to involve users and carers in shaping 
            the services that are provided.</P>
          <P>Let me be parochial for a minute. I was privileged to visit the Christie 
            ward in the Vale of Leven hospital, which provides 24 in-patient beds. 
            Staff there take a holistic, personal approach to the needs of people 
            with mental illness and the ward operates as a centre of excellence&#151;as 
            many </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7640">7640</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>people would also describe it. The relocation of such provision, 
            even to a site that was 15 miles down the road, would be detrimental 
            to the needs of patients, because someone's recovery is partly aided 
            when it takes place in their local community, where they are surrounded 
            by familiar faces and vistas, rather than in a strange environment. 
            Staff in smaller units can have a much more personal relationship 
            with the people for whom they care and that continuity is important.</P>
          <P>There is a worrying trend in relation to access to in-patient services. 
            Beds have closed throughout Scotland. It is absolutely right that 
            that should happen in institutions such as Woodilee hospital, which 
            are not appropriate for the care of people with mental illness. Notwithstanding 
            that, we must ensure that sufficient short-term beds are available. 
            Many people regard in-patient care facilities as places of safety 
            for people who might be particularly vulnerable during an illness, 
            just as they are places for people who are deemed to be at risk or 
            unsafe. Assessment beds should therefore always be available for voluntary 
            patients. There has been a 300 per cent increase in sectioning during 
            the past 13 years in Scotland, so the risk that voluntary patients 
            might have to be sectioned just to obtain a bed or escorted safe transport 
            is fast becoming a reality. We need sufficient local in-patient care 
            that can respond to a crisis and that is flexible enough to respond 
            to local need. I commend to the minister the model that Argyll and 
            Clyde NHS Board provides, in which the Christie ward works alongside 
            a developing community mental health team. That is a model that can 
            deliver results.</P>
          <P>Finally, I know that mental health remains a priority for the Executive. 
            However, I also know that ministers will focus attention on the drive 
            to improve services, because that is the key to making a difference 
            in the experience of people with mental illness.</P>
          <P>11:17</P>
          <p><strong>Eleanor Scott (Highlands and Islands) (Green): </strong>I 
            welcome the chance to speak in the debate from the perspective of 
            remote and rural areas, such as parts of the Highlands and Islands, 
            where there are particular problems in promoting mental health and 
            in delivering services to people with mental health problems. Although 
            there are difficulties in the delivery of health care in remote areas, 
            it is a matter of principle that services should be based on need, 
            rather than on where people live. However, there is often a dearth 
            of specialist services in remote and rural areas. That must be addressed, 
            especially given that some mental health problems, such as alcoholism 
            and, most worrying, suicide, are more prevalent in rural areas.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7641">7641</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>I have mentioned specialist services, but of course the majority 
            of contacts for people with mild and moderate mental health problems 
            are with GPs and their teams in primary care. Those teams must be 
            adequately resourced. Where necessary, health boards should take advantage 
            of the new GP contract to commission and enhance GP mental health 
            services&#151;I hope that the minister keeps a watching brief on that. 
            We must support work force planning in primary care, for example through 
            the expansion of the GP rural fellowship scheme.</P>
          <P>I was glad to hear in the minister's opening speech that some of 
            the recommendations in the Bid 79 document, &quot;Recommendations 
            for the safe management of acutely disturbed psychiatric patients 
            in Scotland's remote and rural areas&quot; have been acted on. All 
            of us who come from rural areas are aware of distressing stories of 
            acutely mentally ill people who have to be held in, for example, police 
            cells, which are clearly inappropriate, because there is a lack of 
            appropriate facilities. That is unacceptable. The report makes 10 
            recommendations and I would be interested to know how many of those 
            have been or will be acted on. The report recommends that each NHS 
            board produce a psychiatric emergency plan for its area in collaboration 
            with appropriate agencies. It also recommends patient focus and public 
            involvement, so that service users have an input into in the drawing 
            up of such plans. It considers staff governance and protocols on, 
            for example, the use of sedation or restraints.</P>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>In the document &quot;National Mental 
            Health Services Assessment Locality Reports&quot;, the section on 
            Highland says, on page 82, that the priorities of service users in 
            Caithness include</P>
          <P>&quot;Easier transfer to hospital&#151;waits of 18 hours in police 
            cells are not acceptable.&quot;</P>
          <P>We can take it that the recommendations to which Eleanor Scott refers 
            have not yet been implemented.</P>
          <p><strong>Eleanor Scott: </strong>I am sure that the member is right. 
            I received a letter from someone in Thurso who was held in a police 
            cell in an acutely distressed state. The police acted as well as they 
            could, but dealing with such cases is not their job. The situation 
            was distressing for everyone concerned, including the police. There 
            are issues about the use of community hospitals as more appropriate 
            facilities for dealing with such cases, although that obviously involves 
            consideration of risk management issues. I would like the Executive 
            to state clearly that the use of police cells as a place of safety 
            is inappropriate.</P>

          <p></P>
          <P>I want to focus on recommendation 10 in the RARARI document, which 
            has the heading, &quot;Further Development&quot;. It states:</P>
          <P>&quot;A <em>Rural Mental Health Network</em> should be established 
            on a formal basis involving all NHS Boards with responsibility for 
            remote and rural areas. The network's functions should include collection 
            of data on psychiatric emergencies, collaboration on the drafting 
            of PEPs&quot;&#151;</P>
          <P>psychiatric emergency plans&#151;</P>
          <P>&quot;sharing good practice across the country, and audit of arrangements 
            in remote and rural areas for psychiatric emergencies.&quot;</P>
          <P>That recommendation is crucial and I want to hear from the minister 
            that the Executive endorses it unequivocally. I know that rural GPs 
            seek the establishment of such a network, which would formalise and 
            facilitate good practice and produce the necessary resources.</P>
          <P>The end of RARARI has left a gap in the examination of health care&#151;not 
            just mental health care&#151;in remote areas. I believe that the management 
            of mental health care in those areas is an aspect of health care that 
            will be adversely affected by that. I have already mentioned that 
            suicide rates are higher in remote and rural areas. We need to tackle 
            that, but we need proper resource planning to take account of the 
            special problems and needs of people in those areas. We must consider 
            the implications of the lack of resources and the need for the provision 
            of staffing and support on a network basis. I will be interested to 
            hear from the minister how those issues are being progressed.</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Murray Tosh): </strong>We move 
            to closing speeches. We are slightly ahead of the clock at this stage, 
            so closing speakers can have a little flexibility. In theory, Carolyn 
            Leckie has six minutes, but she can take a bit longer.</P>
          <P>11:22</P>
          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie: </strong>Thank you. I hope that I will not 
            need that extra time.</P>
          <P>The debate has been highly informative. I particularly want to agree 
            with the comments of Mary Scanlon and Jackie Baillie. My amendment 
            refers to the need for local access to services and patient beds so 
            that people can be treated in their communities in a small and friendly 
            environment. I hope that my amendment attracts support.</P>
          <P>Mary Scanlon spoke about prescribing and how matters were being viewed 
            through the wrong end of the telescope. We should be examining the 
            causes of mental health problems. The World Health Organisation's 
            statistics are frightening. They paint a picture of a society from 
            which people feel disengaged and about which they are </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7643">7643</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>despairing. That leads to mental ill health. Without a fundamental 
            change in society, we will not address those appalling statistics.</P>
          <P>I want to concentrate on some aspects of my amendment that I was 
            unable to cover in my opening speech. Adam Ingram referred specifically 
            to children's services. The situation is unacceptable&#151;there needs 
            to be urgent resourcing of children's services. Children make up a 
            fifth of the population, but only a twentieth of the mental health 
            service budget is spent on children's services. When he sums up, I 
            would like the minister to identify what specific measures will be 
            taken to address that matter. In particular, I want him to deal with 
            services for looked-after children&#151;which require urgent attention&#151;as 
            those children are most vulnerable to, and most affected by, mental 
            health problems.</P>
          <P>We should consider prevention as well as treatment and should put 
            greater emphasis on it. That is where education and our schools come 
            in. The curriculum should foster an awareness of mental health and 
            emotional well-being in children. From a very early stage, children 
            need to be encouraged to express their emotions and how they feel&#151;their 
            sadness and their despair, for example, which might result from bereavement, 
            such as the death of their parents. Schools sometimes still put far 
            too much emphasis on discipline and conduct in the class and repress 
            the expression of our children's emotions, so it does not surprise 
            me that when children in this country reach adulthood, they are highly 
            vulnerable and susceptible to mental ill health problems.</P>
          <P>I suspect that the roots of our high suicide rate&#151;which applies 
            especially to young men&#151;are associated with that sort of culture, 
            which our society and our schools perpetuate. We need to begin to 
            combat low self-esteem when children are very young. We cannot avoid 
            the fact that low self-esteem among children is disproportionately 
            related to poverty and social problems in the homes from which the 
            affected children come.</P>
          <P>I concur with the concerns that have been expressed about the increase 
            in recent years in the prescription of psychiatric medication to children. 
            There is a dearth of research into the effects of psychotropic drugs 
            on developing nervous systems. It is irresponsible for the Executive 
            not to check and monitor the rapid increase in the prescription of 
            such drugs to children. We need urgently to conduct research into 
            the prescribing of such drugs and the circumstances of their prescription 
            and to assess the impact on the children concerned. GPs must account 
            for that shift in practice. When someone is under pressure and under-resourced, 
            it is sometimes too easy for them to write a prescription. Although 
            the development of services </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7644">7644</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>from which children might benefit more might be a bit more resource-consuming, 
            such services might allow children to recover rather than to remain 
            doped up with drugs. I would like the minister to mention children's 
            services in his summing up.</P>
          <P>In his opening speech, Malcolm Chisholm talked about perinatal services. 
            I agree that the development of a special unit by Greater Glasgow 
            NHS Board is long overdue. When I did psychiatric training as part 
            of my training to be a midwife, I did a short stint at the Southern 
            general hospital, which had just lost its unit for handling mothers 
            and babies. A new special unit in Glasgow has been a long time coming. 
            Such units are urgently required throughout the country. When mothers 
            and babies can stay together, it is unacceptable that they continue 
            to be separated when the mother requires treatment. I want the Executive 
            to provide a timescale for eliminating that practice in Scotland.</P>
          <P>Words are fine, but resources are necessary to deliver on the strategy 
            and on our aspirations. Given that health boards have deficits of 
            tens of millions of pounds, I am concerned that mental health services, 
            which have always been the Cinderella service, will continue to be 
            constrained as health boards attempt to balance their budgets. I would 
            appreciate a commitment to provide resources for mental health services 
            and an assurance that they will not face further stringent measures 
            in the future as a result of the financial strictures on health boards 
            generally.</P>
          <P>11:28</P>
          <p><strong>Mike Rumbles: </strong>I have been struck by the positive 
            tone of this morning's debate and the constructive engagement that 
            has taken place throughout the chamber. However, I am disappointed 
            that there are only 17 MSPs present. I am not making a party-political 
            point&#151;on this occasion, my party, the Liberal Democrats, is the 
            worst offender. It is a shame that 112 MSPs are elsewhere and are 
            not listening to the debate in the chamber; I hope that some members 
            are watching the TV screens.</P>
          <P>Among many points, Malcolm Chisholm mentioned that one of the Executive's 
            targets was to reduce suicide rates by 20 per cent by 2013, which 
            is in nine years' time. I have nothing against targets, as they can 
            be a good thing, but I would like Tom McCabe to explain when he sums 
            up why a figure of 20 per cent was chosen. Was it pulled out of the 
            ether? I would like to know the reasoning behind it.</P>
          <P>Stewart Stevenson, among other members, focused on the stigma that 
            is associated with mental ill health; that important theme ran throughout 
            the debate. David Davidson focused </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7645">7645</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>on the shortage of trained staff, and his personal experience helped 
            to illustrate the point.</P>
          <P>I want to spend a little more time over the points that Carolyn Leckie 
            made. She urged us not to use the word &quot;loony&quot; to describe 
            political opponents and said that she had used that word in the past. 
            I, too, hold up my hand. Mary Scanlon&#151;quite rightly&#151;has 
            had occasion to take me to task on the issue. I shall certainly endeavour 
            not to use the word again. I agree that MSPs must be sensitive and 
            careful about the way in which they use language, especially in the 
            chamber. The point is important, particularly in relation to the subject 
            of our debate this morning. In my role as health spokesman, on considering 
            the issue and reading through some of the literature, it struck me 
            that the stigma of mental ill health was a constant theme throughout 
            the literature. It is interesting that nobody from the lobby groups 
            mentioned that point to me. We have to do what we can across the chamber 
            to get rid of some of the stigma.</P>
          <P>Mary Scanlon, in an extremely good speech, talked about recognising 
            the causes of depression. She used the term &quot;unresolved grief&quot;, 
            when talking about the group that she had spent time with yesterday. 
            Help, where and when it is needed, and early intervention are required. 
            Drugs can never be the only answer. Mary Scanlon made a positive and 
            helpful contribution to the debate.</P>
          <P>Jackie Baillie said that, thankfully, mental health is not the Cinderella 
            service of the NHS that it was at one time. That is absolutely true. 
            The Scottish Executive is doing a huge amount to raise the issue and 
            the profile of mental health services, as is the Parliament.</P>
          <P>Eleanor Scott focused on the specific problems of the management 
            of mental health care in Scotland's remote and rural areas. Politics 
            is not only about addressing issues in the chamber; it is about making 
            choices and allocating resources where we think that they will do 
            the most good. Eleanor Scott's point about the special needs of remote 
            and rural Scotland was well made.</P>
          <P>The debate has been constructive. The motion is a good one and I 
            have no problem in supporting it. To be honest, I think that the amendments 
            were lodged more to convey parties' participation in the debate and 
            not because of any real intention to change the motion. The motion 
            should attract support from across the chamber.</P>
          <P>11:33</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Nanette Milne (North East Scotland) (Con): </strong>Like 
            all members in the chamber, I welcome the debate, which comes during 
            national depression week with its aims of raising the awareness of 
            depression, reducing the stigma that </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7646">7646</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>is associated with depression and mental health in general, and making 
            treatment more effective. It has been a well-informed debate, which 
            has shown clearly the interest of the MSPs who are in the chamber 
            in the mental health well-being of the population.</P>
          <P>Statistics show the seriousness of the situation that faces mental 
            health services at present&#151;one in three GP consultations involves 
            some aspect of mental health and a quarter of the population are affected 
            by mental illness at some stage in their lives. That means that fewer 
            of us will go through life untouched by mental health problems in 
            one way or another&#151;either personally or among our family and 
            friends.</P>
          <P>When we learn that more young men are dying at their own hand than 
            are killed in road traffic accidents and that suicide is the leading 
            cause of death in Scottish men aged between 15 and 34, we know just 
            how important it is to tackle the problem head on and to unravel the 
            complex issues that underlie it. Mary Scanlon touched on that point.</P>
          <P>There is no doubting the Scottish Executive's commitment to maintain 
            the mental well-being of the Scottish people and to improve the situation 
            of those with mental health problems. As the minister illustrated 
            in his opening speech, many of the initiatives that are under way 
            have that intention. I was particularly pleased to hear the minister's 
            statement about advocacy services. As has been acknowledged in the 
            debate, however, there is still a long way to go before the Executive's 
            aspirations are achieved.</P>
          <P>Undoubtedly, there are serious shortfalls that have to be addressed 
            in the provision of early intervention, crisis and respite services. 
            Access to a range of treatments is patchy across the country; I am 
            thinking of access to medication, complementary therapies, counselling, 
            psychotherapy and social support. Services are not accessible at the 
            local level, nor are they always effective in responding to people's 
            needs. For many patients, a shortfall in specialist help can still 
            result in GPs prescribing antidepressants and other mood-altering 
            drugs when counselling, specialist help and psychotherapy would have 
            been much more effective and beneficial. Bed blocking remains a serious 
            issue and mixed-sex wards continue to cause distress to many of the 
            patients who have to be treated in them.</P>
          <P>As we heard, the national mental health services assessment highlights 
            the many shortcomings of the current service and the pressures on 
            staff to cope with the added demands of new legislation. It also highlights 
            the perception of the chronic underfunding of services in the face 
            of rising needs and the demands and expectations of the public and, 
            indeed, politicians. The assessment </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7647">7647</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>notes the continuous change agenda and restructuring that get in 
            the way of the prime duty of caring for patients. Stewart Stevenson's 
            quotations from Dr Sandra Grant's report revealed the worst in the 
            service. Clearly, all of us hope that such conditions will soon be 
            history.</P>
          <P>The increasing bureaucracy that is associated with monitoring and 
            accountability and the perception of increasing centralisation and 
            control from the Executive&#151;despite the rhetoric of devolved power&#151;all 
            lead to low morale in the service and contribute to difficulties in 
            the recruitment and retention of staff. As Jean Turner pointed out, 
            lack of concern for staff well-being is a major factor: it hits staff 
            morale and leads to the loss of many able and well-trained people.</P>
          <P>Dr Grant's report contained a clear recommendation that more authority, 
            responsibility and accountability&#151;including for budgets&#151;should 
            be devolved to front-line staff in the future, with the objective 
            of enabling those staff to work closely with the voluntary sector, 
            service users and carers. I hope that the minister will support that 
            recommendation and that he will not be put off by the fact that it 
            is in line with Conservative party policy.</P>
          <P>I am pleased that Mike Rumbles and Adam Ingram highlighted the need 
            for more work to be done with children who have mental health difficulties. 
            I, too, heard and was impressed by Dr Bryce's excellent presentation 
            at the cross-party group meeting yesterday. Dr Bryce gave us the frightening 
            statistic, which Mike Rumbles and Adam Ingram quoted, that 10 per 
            cent of the population aged between five and 15 years of age have 
            serious mental health problems at any one time. That is 125,000 children&#151;enough, 
            as Dr Bryce said, to fill a football stadium.</P>
          <P>The breakdown in health of many of those children can be foreseen 
            by teachers, primary care and social work professionals who form the 
            network of people who know about the underlying risk factors that 
            hit those children. I am thinking of issues such as family breakdown, 
            which is increasingly common, and the misuse of drugs, alcohol and 
            other substances. The network, however, is not really in the loop 
            as far as early diagnosis is concerned.</P>
          <P>The children who were questioned by Dr Bryce's organisation cited 
            the need for discussion about issues such as family breakdown. They 
            want to have it out with adults; they want to know how family breakdowns 
            come about and they want to talk about the emotional consequences. 
            They also cited the need for adults to learn how to communicate with 
            young people; how not to talk down to them; and how to find language 
            with which young people are in tune. The children pointed out the 
            lack of leisure and recreational </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7648">7648</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>facilities in many communities. They showed concern that, although 
            many schools pay lip service to issues such as bullying by having 
            policies on paper, they do nothing very much to deal with the issues.</P>
          <P>Work is under way to develop the NHS work force and the network of 
            children's services. That includes several of the initiatives to which 
            the minister referred in his opening speech, such as the see me anti-stigma 
            campaign, the health-promoting schools unit that deals with emotional 
            health and well-being and the choose life suicide prevention strategy. 
            All those measures aim to move services closer to children, at home 
            and at school. For those who are already ill, the mental health and 
            well-being support group is looking at services for the seriously 
            unwell and those who come under the provisions of the Mental Health 
            (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.</P>
          <P>There are, however, major problems facing child and adolescent mental 
            health services. There are serious shortages in all the professions, 
            and there is difficulty in providing an integrated system for young 
            people that involves health, education and social work services. The 
            separate structures and budgets of those authorities make joint planning 
            and joint service provision hard to achieve. I urge the minister to 
            give serious consideration to unifying the health-related social budgets 
            so as to help alleviate that problem.</P>
          <P>I reinforce what David Davidson said about voluntary services and 
            urge more use of the voluntary sector. It has the skills and expertise 
            that are required, as well as flexibility and willingness to work 
            with the private sector. Voluntary organisations know that they could 
            do more and they feel frustrated that they are often left out of the 
            equation, despite the fact that they are able and willing to help.</P>
          <P>Mental health is a massive issue. Progress is being made on several 
            fronts, but there is still a very long way to go before people who 
            are suffering from mental illness get the care that they require. 
            Money is tight and morale is low, and there is undoubtedly a serious 
            lack of trained professionals in health and social work. That must 
            be addressed. There has been progress, but much more is needed. That 
            is why I am happy to support the amendment in the name of my colleague 
            David Davidson.</P>
          <P>11:41</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>Like other members, 
            I welcome the opportunity to debate this important issue. The timing 
            of the debate is appropriate, as it comes one year after the passing 
            of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 and 
            one year </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7649">7649</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>before that act is fully implemented. The debate gives us an opportunity 
            to assess what has happened and what we can do to make improvements 
            before 2005.</P>
          <P>I used to volunteer for mental health services, and I seem to remember 
            doing a lot of outreach work, particularly in housing schemes. Unfortunately, 
            a lot of that work has been discontinued but, having read Sandra Grant's 
            report, I see that things have moved more towards community work, 
            which should be commended. I look forward to the day when we go back 
            to having more community health services, which were useful. I will 
            return to the subject of community work, which was raised by Carolyn 
            Leckie, Jackie Baillie and others.</P>
          <P>One of the issues in Sandra Grant's report that was raised most frequently 
            by service users and carers was the services that they wanted to be 
            either improved or continued. In particular, they wanted the see me 
            campaign to be continued, and I thank the minister for his announcement 
            on that. That campaign has been very successful and I know that users 
            and carers will welcome the announcement. Service users and carers 
            mentioned responsible and positive reporting by the media, and I will 
            return to that subject, too. They also wanted openness on the part 
            of mental health services about what services are available and what 
            information they can access; in particular, they wanted such information 
            to be made available for carers, and not just for users.</P>
          <P>Stewart Stevenson raised the paramount issue of the work force. Sandra 
            Grant's report mentions that the position is likely to deteriorate 
            further in Scotland. We need to take that into consideration, bearing 
            in mind the level of training that is required. As we all know, there 
            will not be any early change for the better; it was worrying to read 
            that in Dr Grant's report. The report is honest, as members have said, 
            and we should take cognisance of what it says.</P>
          <P>David Davidson and Mike Rumbles mentioned the important issue of 
            stigma, which has been raised again and again. I, too, would like 
            to quote some figures from the survey that Mike Rumbles cited earlier. 
            According to the survey, 64 per cent of young people said that they 
            would be too embarrassed to disclose a mental illness or health problem 
            to a prospective employer. I find that quite worrying. Only 37 per 
            cent of employers said that they would be prepared to take on somebody 
            who had said that they had a mental illness. I find that very worrying, 
            too.</P>
          <P>According to the same survey, 50 per cent of people said that media 
            portrayal of mental health problems was much more negative than positive. 
            That is why I ask the minister whether he could monitor the see me 
            campaign. Once the campaign </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7650">7650</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>has run its course, perhaps another survey could be done to find 
            out the extent to which it has improved society's perception and, 
            I hope, that of the media. If 50 per cent of people say that the media's 
            portrayal of mental health problems is negative, that is a terrible 
            indictment of the society in which we live today. I worry about that 
            very much.</P>
          <P>Carolyn Leckie highlighted the plight of people who live in deprived 
            areas and the accessibility of services; the accessibility of services 
            was also highlighted by Jackie Baillie and Mary Scanlon. Services 
            must be accessible in the community, and I agree that we must ensure 
            that people are not denied services simply because they cannot afford 
            them or because they are not provided locally. That is a major issue, 
            which Carolyn Leckie described very well.</P>
          <P>We need to consider advocacy. I welcome the minister's recognition 
            of the fact that demand for advocacy services will rise and I hope 
            that he will ensure that advocacy is available to all, and not just 
            to people who can access it and who can afford to do so. That is where 
            the community aspect of the matter has to come in.</P>
          <P>Many members, including Nanette Milne in her summing-up speech, mentioned 
            children. It is very worrying to think that there are 125,000 children 
            with mental health problems. Nanette Milne was right to say that early 
            intervention is important if we are to help those vulnerable kids. 
            If we could prevent something in society from getting worse, we would 
            all be proud of that. We must pay special attention to the fact that 
            such vast numbers of children are suffering. I am sure that all of 
            us will be thinking about that carefully.</P>
          <P>The minister mentioned the fact that the Executive is looking to 
            more outreach work being undertaken. As I said, I used to do outreach 
            work in the voluntary sector. Whole families used to come along, even 
            if only one person in that family was suffering from some form of 
            mental health problem, and I found that to be a good thing. Services 
            were provided in centres&#151;or clinics, as they were called in those 
            days&#151;that were located in the middle of communities, so families 
            could bring their children, and mothers and fathers could come with 
            the rest of the family. Perhaps because people were able to come along 
            to meetings, there was less stigma. Neighbours and others got to know 
            about the service, and I was amazed at the number of people who came 
            along. I hope that we can get back to having more localised services 
            like that. We must try to reach out and help the people concerned. 
            The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 was a good 
            piece of work but, as Sandra Grant's report said, we must consider 
            improving certain of its provisions.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7651">7651</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Once again, I welcome this opportunity to debate the issue. We have 
            heard about a number of issues around the lack of surgeons, psychiatric 
            consultants, community services, advocacy and, obviously, funding, 
            which I would like the minister to address when he sums up. Although 
            there is funding for local health boards and local authorities, Sandra 
            Grant's report found, as have people on the ground, that the money 
            that is allocated for mental health services is not always used for 
            that purpose; basically, the money is soaked into the general grant. 
            Adam Ingram picked up on that point. Is there any way that the minister 
            could ensure that that money is spent on mental health issues? There 
            is an issue of ring fencing, which the minister might wish to address 
            when he sums up.</P>
          <P>We have to know where the money is being spent. It is all right to 
            say that money is being given to local authorities and health boards 
            to spend on mental health services, but if&#151;as Sandra Grant's 
            report, users and carers are indicating&#151;the money is not being 
            spent on those services and is being soaked up for something else, 
            we require answers.</P>
          <P>We must move forward. I appreciate the fact that we are doing something 
            that Westminster might never have got round to doing. The Scottish 
            Parliament should be proud of that. Let us get things moving. We recognise 
            the problems. Let us solve them and give people with mental health 
            issues a better deal and a higher quality of service.</P>
          <P>11:49</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care (Mr Tom 
            McCabe): </strong>I thank members for their constructive contributions 
            to the debate. Yet again, a good debate has shown the commitment throughout 
            the chamber to addressing mental health issues. I will do my best 
            to respond to some of the points that have been made.</P>
          <P>I say to Stewart Stevenson that mental health is one of our three 
            national clinical priorities. Although people are quite right always 
            to advocate additional resources for any aspect of health, it is important 
            to put the matter in perspective. Around 10 per cent of all health 
            spending is now directed towards mental health, which is by any standards 
            a considerable amount of money.</P>
          <P>I say to Adam Ingram and Sandra White, who raised concerns about 
            monitoring the implementation of spend, that we intend to monitor 
            the way in which the moneys that have been made available to local 
            authorities and health boards are implemented. That is important. 
            We are only too well aware that money can easily be diverted to </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7652">7652</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>other causes, so we intend to monitor the spend as vigorously as 
            we can.</P>
          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Will the minister take an intervention?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>Not at the moment. I have just started.</P>
          <P>I emphasise the impact of mental health problems, which we have heard 
            are both a cause and a consequence of social exclusion and can lead 
            to a lack of opportunity for work, training, education and participation 
            in social and community life. One in four people will be affected 
            directly by a mental health problem at some time in their life. Such 
            problems can affect any one of us, regardless of our economic or social 
            circumstances, but, as many members have said, we know that people 
            living in deprived communities are more at risk of mental health problems 
            and are more likely to experience negative effects on their lives.</P>
          <P>The Executive is working with partners to reduce the social exclusion 
            and inequalities that many people with mental health problems face. 
            For example, we are focusing attention on opportunities for employment. 
            I will say more on that in a moment, but I want to stress that anyone 
            can encounter mental health problems, no matter their social standing, 
            profession or qualifications&#151;it can happen to anyone. We cannot 
            say often enough that there is no shame, that stigma comes from a 
            lack of understanding and that there is no place for and no sense 
            to discrimination.</P>
          <P>Stewart Stevenson mentioned the benefits of work. A key route to 
            recovery is through the work of Jobcentre Plus, with which we are 
            working to consider ways to improve its staff's training on and awareness 
            of mental health. We are also working with the Department for Work 
            and Pensions on welfare-to-work and benefits issues and, in particular, 
            on supporting pilot schemes that are designed to support people back 
            to work and ease the transition from benefits to work.</P>
          <P>A national pilot that is taking place in Argyll and Clyde works to 
            support back to work people who are currently on incapacity benefit. 
            The success of such schemes is vital, because in some areas of Scotland 
            up to 35 per cent of people on incapacity benefit have mental health 
            problems. There are also a number of supported employment schemes 
            throughout Scotland. In tandem with those schemes, there are a large 
            number of local projects and services that work with people to support 
            them in getting ready for work; they help to rebuild confidence and 
            self-esteem and give people hope for the future. I had the opportunity 
            earlier this week to visit the Redhall walled garden in Edinburgh, 
            which is an excellent example of the contribution that our voluntary 
            sector partners can </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7653">7653</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>make to improving participation and inclusion for those with mental 
            health problems.</P>
          <P>For people who are already in work, we are working closely with Scotland's 
            health at work, which has developed an employment and mental health 
            training programme for employers to help them fulfil their roles and 
            responsibilities on employment and mental health. The programme is 
            being rolled out throughout the country and each area will have access 
            to a trained instructor.</P>
          <P>We need to continue to seek ways to reach out to those who are vulnerable 
            to poor mental health and who may feel particularly excluded. We are 
            working on a range of vulnerable groups of that kind. In particular, 
            with the National Resource Centre for Ethnic Minority Health, we have 
            an initial two-year programme of awareness raising and development 
            work and a series of information and good-practice seminars are taking 
            place throughout Scotland in the next eight months. The centre is 
            also being funded to take stock in each local area and to examine 
            in depth the provision of services and support for the mental health 
            of people from ethnic minority communities. The results will help 
            in the planning of appropriate services and access to them.</P>
          <P>As has been said during the debate, we know that the cost of inequality 
            can be high. People who live in the most deprived communities of Scotland 
            have a 10 times higher risk of suicide than do those who live in the 
            least deprived communities. The figure for suicide in Scotland is 
            800 a year, with 600 deaths being attributed directly to suicide and 
            the remaining 200 deaths being unattributed. In the Executive's choose 
            life strategy, we are working to address those inequalities and we 
            are about to introduce a community based training course. Over two 
            weeks&#151;one week in West Lothian and one week in Glasgow&#151;48 
            instructors from throughout Scotland will be trained in applied suicide 
            intervention skills. The course is run by experts in suicide prevention 
            from Living Works Education, Inc at the University of Calgary in Canada 
            and has been developed over 20 years. It has proved successful in 
            helping agencies, community representatives, family members and others 
            to assist in the prevention of suicide.</P>
          <P>Mike Rumbles mentioned the target to reduce by 20 per cent the incidence 
            of suicide by 2013. That target, which is consistent throughout the 
            United Kingdom, reflects our determination to focus on this critical 
            area, but also to be realistic.</P>
          <P>I turn to the challenges that we face in providing services to those 
            who experience mental health problems. Mike Rumbles pointed out rightly 
            that one in 10 of our children and young people under the age of 19&#151;125,000 
            of our young people in Scotland&#151;will have mental health problems 
            that </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>are so substantial that they have difficulties with their thoughts, 
            feelings and behaviour day to day.</P>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>Will the minister join me in commending 
            Lochyside RC Primary School in Fort William, which the First Minister, 
            Jim Mather and I visited separately on Monday, for its excellent relationship 
            with the pupils whereby the staff listen to and build partnership 
            with the pupils and encourage them to express their feelings through 
            art projects?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>Of course I warmly welcome such developments. 
            I hope that the pupils were not diverted too much from their studies 
            and thoughts by all the people who visited them earlier in the week. 
            I am sure that the visits made a contribution and did not detract 
            from their work.</P>
          <P>I am happy to reassure Mike Rumbles and Adam Ingram that the Executive 
            is proceeding with several strands of work following the publication 
            last May of the Scottish needs assessment programme report on the 
            needs of children and young people with mental health problems. The 
            work will cover promotion, prevention and care and will involve a 
            range of agencies including those in education, social work, health 
            and the voluntary sector.</P>
          <P>We are aware that there are particular concerns about the provision 
            of in-patient services for children and young people and the child 
            health support group is considering the range of in-patient services 
            that are now needed throughout Scotland. I note the concerns that 
            Mary Scanlon and Carolyn Leckie expressed about Ritalin. Its prescribing 
            is subject to a Scottish intercollegiate guidelines network guideline, 
            but it will be reviewed in due course.</P>
          <P>There are important issues to address in relation to the arrangements 
            for planning, resourcing and delivering mental health services. We 
            are conscious of the opportunities and challenges that community health 
            partnerships will present for the delivery of properly integrated 
            local mental health services. Officials have therefore been working 
            with partners from health boards, local authorities and voluntary 
            organisations to develop guidance, which I expect to be available 
            soon in draft for discussion with the wider mental health community.</P>
          <P>I believe that the Executive has in place a clear policy on mental 
            health. We want to see an overall improvement in the mental well-being 
            of the people of Scotland, towards which the national programme is 
            making real progress. We also want to see a real improvement in the 
            services that are provided to those with mental health problems. The 
            Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 is an important 
            part of that and the follow-up to Dr Grant's review will be </div>

          <P>critical, not just to ensure that the act is implemented but to improve 
            the range and quality of services for all the people in Scotland who 
            need them.</P>
          <P>I reaffirm the Executive's commitment on mental health, which is 
            to reduce the risk and prevalence of suicide and the stigma associated 
            with mental health problems, including depression; to promote and 
            support recovery in all senses; and to improve services overall for 
            those with mental health problems. It is clear from this morning's 
            debate that the Parliament shares that commitment and those aspirations 
            and we look forward to working together to make a difference in mental 
            health awareness and services for all people in Scotland.</P>

          <P>12:00</P>
          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Prime Minister (Meetings)</strong></P>
          <P> <strong><A NAME="QuestionTime">1.</A> Mr John Swinney (North Tayside) 
            (SNP): </strong>To ask the First Minister when he next plans to meet 
            the Prime Minister and what issues he intends to raise. (S2F-806)</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>I have no 
            immediate plans to meet the Prime Minister.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>On 21 January 2002, the Deputy First 
            Minister&#151;the then Minister for Justice&#151;announced plans to 
            privatise the escorting of prisoners. He said:</P>
          <P>&quot;Public safety will not be compromised under any circumstances&quot;.</P>
          <P>Does the First Minister accept that awarding the contract to a company 
            that, according to the current Minister for Justice, did not have 
            enough staff, training or management controls was a breach of Jim 
            Wallace's promise? Why was that contract awarded in those circumstances?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister:</strong> No, I do not accept that the 
            assurances that were given by ministers have been put to one side 
            in this instance. The Government has a clear policy to ensure that 
            the 300 police officers who can go back out on operational duty are 
            delivered in our police service and that those police officers are 
            doing the job that they are signed up to do, which they chose as a 
            career path, and are not transporting or supervising in waiting rooms 
            prisoners who can be transported or supervised by others.</P>
          <P>At no time in advance of the contract, during the negotiations for 
            the contract or since has there been any suggestion that the police 
            force in Scotland would be anything other than in charge of the maintenance 
            of order in our courtrooms. The Minister for Justice made that perfectly 
            clear yesterday afternoon.</P>
          <P>At all times, the Executive is absolutely committed to ensuring that, 
            in Scotland, we reduce crime, tackle crime, prevent crime and catch 
            criminals. We are committed to ensuring that the police officers of 
            Scotland can do their job and do the job that they want to do.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>I have here a statement from Jim Wallace, 
            from January 2002, in which he says beyond any question, in the context 
            of escorting prisoners to be contracted out:</P>
          <P>&quot;Public safety will not be compromised under any circumstances&quot;.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7657">7657</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>The Minister for Justice conceded to Parliament yesterday that public 
            safety had been jeopardised by the escape of James McCormick. She 
            said:</P>
          <P>&quot;Reliance had been working on its implementation plan for some 
            time before contract signature ... It is now abundantly clear that 
            Reliance seriously underestimated the challenge that it would face&quot;.&#151;[<em>Official 
            Report</em>, 21 April 2004; c 7528.]</P>
          <P>For 14 months the implementation plan was being worked on and it 
            all went horribly wrong on implementation. If it is abundantly clear 
            to ministers that Reliance is not up to the contract after a convicted 
            murderer has escaped, why did ministers not make it their business 
            to be abundantly satisfied that Reliance was up to the job when the 
            contract was signed in the first place? Why did ministers not make 
            it their business to determine whether Reliance could handle the contract? 
            Why did the Government award a contract that has failed to deliver 
            public safety?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister:</strong> The contract will not fail. 
            Reliance will&#151;as it properly should&#151;be forced to deliver 
            on that contract. That is the proper job of the Minister for Justice 
            and those who are responsible for the service.</P>
          <P>I remind Mr Swinney that a policy issue is at stake. What has happened 
            in the past three weeks is not an argument against reform; it is not 
            an argument to take police officers off the beat and put them back 
            in the vans looking after the prisoners. It is an argument for more 
            reform, not less. It is an argument for ensuring that our courts are 
            properly run. It is an argument for ensuring that, when prisoners 
            go to one court in the morning, they do not go back to the prison 
            and then on to a different court in the same city in the afternoon. 
            It is an argument for ensuring that the right reforms are in place 
            throughout our court and prison services. If we ensure that that happens, 
            we will release not only up to 300 police officers as a result of 
            this contract, but many more police officers for operational duty 
            to serve the public. That is where they belong and that is where they 
            want to be.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>I do not know whether the First Minister 
            has noticed, but many police officers in Scotland today are chasing 
            a convicted murderer who has escaped because of the reforms. That 
            is not putting more police on the beat; it is putting police out to 
            pursue murderers who should properly be in the jails of Scotland.</P>
          <P>The point that I am trying to get the First Minister to accept is 
            that, when the Government agreed to the contract, it promised the 
            public that public safety would be guaranteed. Whichever way we look 
            at the matter, public safety has been jeopardised, because a convicted 
            murderer is currently free in our society today. I am asking the </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7658">7658</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>First Minister to explain to Parliament why he signed up to a contract 
            that has jeopardised public safety when his ministers promised that 
            they would do no such thing.</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister: </strong>Public safety has been jeopardised 
            in the case of that individual not by the contract, but by the implementation 
            of the contract. That is why the company will rightly face penalties 
            for not implementing the contract properly. That is exactly the right 
            procedure.</P>
          <P>I notice that Mr Swinney's former chief executive said this week 
            that the Scottish National Party is all over the place because it 
            only ever complains about things and does not come up with solutions. 
            What we need in Scotland today are solutions that not only reform 
            our court and prison services, but get our police officers and our 
            police service doing the job that they want to do. We need every one 
            of those 300 police officers on operational duty. We must ensure that 
            they can get out there, do the job that they want to do and catch 
            not only this one criminal, but many more criminals. More reform&#151;not 
            less&#151;is what is needed in our prison service. The SNP will have 
            to wake up to that some day.</P>
          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Cabinet (Meetings)</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>2. David McLetchie (Edinburgh Pentlands) (Con): </strong>To 
            ask the First Minister what issues will be discussed at the next meeting 
            of the Scottish Executive's Cabinet. (S2F-813)</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>The next 
            meeting of Cabinet will, as ever, discuss our progress towards implementing 
            the partnership agreement to build a better Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>I thank the First Minister for 
            that answer, but I am sure that the Cabinet will want to discuss further 
            the implications of the Minister for Justice's statement to Parliament 
            yesterday and the fact that a brutal killer is still on the loose 
            in Scotland.</P>
          <P>The Reliance fiasco is bad enough, but it is compounded by the fact 
            that the Executive releases hundreds of prisoners early on licence 
            who go on to commit further crimes. This week, we heard of a brutal 
            attack on a nurse, Pauline Dunnery, at her place of work in Perth 
            royal infirmary by an assailant who had been released early and was 
            out on licence. Figures released by the Executive show that the number 
            of prisoners recalled from licence reached a new high of 239 in 2002. 
            Does the First Minister accept that his publicly expressed confidence 
            in his Minister for Justice is no longer matched by public confidence 
            in the justice system?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister: </strong>One of the reasons why I have 
            so much faith in the Minister for Justice is that it was she who set 
            up the Sentencing Commission, which will deal with the very problem 
        </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7659">7659</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>that Mr McLetchie outlines. There is a clear need to deal with the 
            issue of early release on licence and there is a clear need to consider 
            what happens when potential prisoners are out on bail when sometimes 
            they perhaps should not be. We established the Sentencing Commission 
            to consider those issues properly with the judiciary and with those 
            in the system whom I believe we must have on side to make the policy 
            work.</P>
          <P>We must ensure that the system works for victims and for witnesses 
            and does not work for the prisoners or the criminals. That is the 
            absolute priority for this Government and that is why we are moving 
            forward so quickly and effectively in tackling the issues that Mr 
            McLetchie regularly raises. We share the same interest in the issues, 
            but our job is to find solutions, which is what we will do.</P>
          <p><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>The First Minister talks about 
            tackling issues quickly, but the establishment of the Sentencing Commission 
            is a recipe for delay and inaction on the part of the Executive and 
            the Parliament in dealing with the scandal of early release. As the 
            First Minister is well aware, I have said in the Parliament on numerous 
            occasions that one simple way of restoring confidence in the justice 
            system in Scotland would be to end the scandal of early release and 
            to give women such as Pauline Dunnery the protection that they deserve. 
            Pauline Dunnery was a victim of a crime that would never have happened 
            had her attacker still been in prison serving the sentence that was 
            handed down to him in court. That is the fact of the matter. Will 
            the First Minister tell us when his Sentencing Commission will report, 
            when some action will be taken and when the Minister for Justice will 
            take steps to restore a reputation that has been so badly battered 
            this week?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister:</strong> We have made clear in the past 
            the timetable to which the Sentencing Commission is operating. The 
            important thing is to ensure that we have a system that works in practice 
            for witnesses and victims in Scotland's courts. It is fundamental 
            to the operation of that system that we do not just, through knee-jerk 
            reactions in the chamber, adjust laws in relation to sentencing. In 
            the tradition of the Scottish system, we should ensure that the changes 
            are applicable in practice. That is why we gave a commitment this 
            time last year to establish the Sentencing Commission and why we ensured 
            that within six months of the election the Sentencing Commission was 
            up and running. That is why the Sentencing Commission has been given 
            clear priorities for decisions and action, including dealing with 
            the issues of people who are released on bail and people who are released 
            early on licence. That is why when we get the recommendations&#151;if 
            they are tough enough&#151;we will implement them and do it quickly.</P>

          <P> <strong>3. Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP): </strong>To ask the First 
            Minister what the Scottish Executive's response will be to the march 
            to be held in Glasgow on 24 April 2004 in support of the abolition 
            of the council tax in favour of an income-based alternative. (S2F-831)</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>We live 
            in a democracy where, I am happy to say, people are free to march 
            to express their views. I hope that all those who are on Mr Sheridan's 
            march on Saturday are fully aware of what they would pay under any 
            Government that he ever led.</P>
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>A number of nursery nurses will 
            be on the demonstration on Saturday. Given that they have had to strike 
            against their pathetically low pay, I can give them an absolutely 
            cast-iron assurance that they will pay less under any Government led 
            by me or any other Scottish Socialist Party representative. Does the 
            First Minister think it fair that a nursery nurse or a pensioner on 
            a low income in Scotland is paying a higher proportion of their income 
            on council tax than he is, when he is on a very good income of £123,000? 
            Is it fair that he pays a lower proportion than them, despite the 
            large difference in income?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister:</strong> I find it astonishing that Tommy 
            Sheridan wants to confirm in the chamber today that he assumes that, 
            under any Government in Scotland run by the Scottish Socialist Party, 
            nursery nurses would always be low paid. My ambition is that Scotland's 
            nursery nurses will be better paid and have better status. That is 
            why we have given them a firm commitment that, if the current dispute 
            is resolved quickly, we will establish a national review of their 
            position.</P>
          <P>We also need to remember that&#151;I hope that Mr Sheridan will point 
            this out with his usual eloquence in his speech on Saturday&#151;80 
            per cent of the cost of local government services in Scotland is paid 
            through the national taxation system. All of us who are working contribute 
            to that on the basis of our income. That is why the combination of 
            central and local taxation is a good one. I am totally opposed to 
            Tommy Sheridan's proposal that all local government taxation in Scotland 
            should be centralised&#151;collected by, organised by and paid to 
            national Government&#151;without any aspect of local democracy. That 
            is fundamentally contrary to the socialist principles to which many 
            of us adhere and I am surprised that it is in line with his.</P>
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>In a friendly manner, I suggest 
            that the First Minister might want to go to the doctor to get his 
            ears tested. I gave a cast-iron assurance that nursery nurses would 
            pay less under a Scottish Socialist Party Government; I did </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7661">7661</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>not say that they would continue to be scandalously low paid, as 
            they have been for the past seven years under the Labour Government 
            at Westminster and the Government in Scotland.</P>
          <P>The First Minister wants to avoid the question. Is it fair that MSPs 
            on £50,000 a year, ministers in the Cabinet on £80,000 a year and 
            the First Minister on £123,000 a year pay less as a proportion of 
            their income than low-paid nursery nurses and pensioners pay? Is it 
            not about time that the First Minister stopped protecting and pampering 
            the well paid and the wealthy and started to protect pensioners and 
            the low paid in Scotland? The people who will march on Saturday in 
            Glasgow will call for the axing of the council tax and its replacement 
            with an income-based alternative so that people such as the First 
            Minister and I pay more whereas pensioners and low-paid workers pay 
            less. Does the First Minister agree with that call?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I have said to Mr Sheridan before 
            that there is a case for property-based taxation in our society, although 
            that is not necessarily a universal view in the partnership parties. 
            Such a tax is easy to collect and is on one element of an individual's 
            wealth and status in society. It is right that such a tax should be 
            applied locally. I believe strongly that all of us should make a contribution 
            to the cost of local services, which we do through income tax and 
            other taxes that we pay nationally. In Scotland, nationally collected 
            taxation contributes 80 per cent of funding for local services. The 
            system is economically justifiable, although it needs to be reviewed, 
            which will happen through the independent review of local government 
            finance.</P>

            is a case for Europe-wide decision making not just on matters of environmental 
            and economic importance, but, at times, to ensure that we tackle international 
            crime and terrorism effectively. The new European constitution will 
            help us to achieve that. I look forward to the debate on the constitution 
            in relation to any referendum that might take place. The debate will 
            be between those of us who believe in a progressive Europe that secures 
            peace and delivers jobs for Scotland and those in the very strange 
            alliance that may campaign in the no camp.</P>
          <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Has the First 
            Minister made representations to the Prime Minister to ensure that 
            the Scottish result in the referendum on the EU constitution will 
            be counted and announced separately? Once the constitution has been 
            finalised by the heads of Government, will the First Minister consider 
            undertaking a fundamental assessment of its impact on the economic 
            and social life of Scotland?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister: </strong>The first part of Mr Neil's 
            question is a matter for the Prime Minister. On the second part of 
            his question, which raises an issue on which we have had exchanges 
            in the past, we regularly assess the impact of such matters on Scotland's 
            economy.</P>
          <P>I would be interested in having an exchange at some point about where 
            Mr Neil stands on the proposed referendum. He has a history of being 
            progressive on some of these matters, in comparison with some of his 
            colleagues, and I would be interested to know whether he will be standing 
            with those of us who believe in a peaceful and prosperous Europe or 
            with the Tories, the Trotskyists and, perhaps, some of the other nationalists 
            in the no campaign in the referendum.</P>
          <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>Given the 
            First Minister's response to Maureen Macmillan, will he explain to 
            me what elements of this Parliament's devolved responsibilities are 
            protected from EU interference at Commission level by article 17 under 
            title III of the constitution?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister: </strong>It is interesting that a number 
            of members of the Opposition are prepared to come out and campaign 
            against the EU constitution because the constitution will develop 
            the rights and the responsibilities of this Parliament and other devolved 
            Administrations.</P>
          <P>The key provision in the new constitution, which I hope survives 
            the negotiations that are taking place over the next three months 
            under the Irish presidency, is that which embeds subsidiarity at its 
            heart. That will give this Parliament and other devolved Parliaments 
            and Governments across Europe protection for their responsibilities 
            at the </div>

          <P>European level that they have never had before. That is an important 
            step forward. If Mr Gallie is going to be on the opposite side of 
            the argument during the next two years, I relish the opportunity to 
            enter into debate with him.</P>
          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Will 
            the First Minister outline what he believes are the red-line issues 
            for Scotland, given the on-going negotiations over the draft constitution, 
            especially as there are major concerns in Scotland about the references 
            to fishing and energy? Does he agree with many in the chamber that 
            the referendum strengthens Scotland's hand because Tony Blair will 
            require the support of Scotland to get a yes vote?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister:</strong> The Scottish National Party 
            and others have been guilty of gross misrepresentation of the constitution's 
            position on both fishing and energy. Exactly as the Prime Minister 
            said on Tuesday that he relished the opportunity that the referendum 
            campaign offers to expose the myths and misrepresentations of the 
            Tories, I am willing to take on those arguments in Scotland.</P>
          <P>On fishing, the new EU constitution does not change the current provisions 
            at all. At long last, fishing is starting to be decentralised and 
            regional management in the North sea and elsewhere is possible. We 
            should welcome those changes. On energy, the British Government and 
            the Scottish Executive have made it clear that we do not accept the 
            provisions in the draft constitution that was put together by the 
            European convention. However, those provisions have not been represented 
            truly. I am in close contact with the energy industry in Scotland 
            and with the UK Government to ensure that the Executive gives them 
            every support in getting the provisions changed.</P>

          <P>company will pay for allowing a convicted murderer to saunter out 
            of a courtroom and disappear into thin air? Will he tell the Parliament 
            today the value of the fine that Reliance will have to pay for letting 
            James McCormick go? If he will not do so, will he outline what possible 
            reason there can be for keeping such information under wraps?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister: </strong>The Minister for Justice made 
            it clear yesterday that, subject to important provisions in relation 
            to public safety and some provisions that are inevitable in relation 
            to commercial confidentiality, we will publish the contract. We will 
            also publish performance information that will not only allow the 
            Parliament to criticise, rightly, the way in which the contract has 
            been implemented in the past three weeks, but ensure that we can guarantee 
            that performance is improving and monitor that against the contract. 
            That information will be agreed between the Scottish Prison Service 
            and Reliance during the coming weeks. It will be published and it 
            will give the Government and the Parliament an indication of whether 
            performance is improving before we get to the stage of extending Reliance's 
            responsibilities elsewhere in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>Miss Annabel Goldie (West of Scotland) (Con): </strong>It 
            is common knowledge that the negotiation and placing of the contract 
            were accompanied by ministerial detachment. In so far as the Minister 
            for Justice has alluded to the contract, she has sought to hide behind 
            issues of commercial and operational sensitivity. I listened to the 
            First Minister's response, but does he accept that, if public confidence 
            is to be restored not just in our justice system but in the political 
            process in Scotland, ministerial disclosure to the Parliament of how 
            the penalty provisions of the contract operate is critical? Does he 
            accept that it is not enough for the contract to be published and 
            that it is essential that we have manifest ministerial acceptance 
            of responsibility and appropriate and regular statements in the chamber 
            about how the penalty provisions are applied?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I do not think that Annabel 
            Goldie can say that responsibility has been shirked in any way. The 
            first thing that happened when the Parliament returned to a full plenary 
            meeting yesterday was that the Minister for Justice gave a parliamentary 
            statement accepting her responsibility for sorting out the situation. 
            During the past three weeks, the minister has been pursuing not just 
            the Scottish Prison Service, the Scottish Court Service and the police 
            service, but Reliance, to ensure that this debacle is sorted out. 
            That is exactly the right thing for her to do and that is why she 
            is in her position. She is the kind of person who takes such tough 
            decisions and is prepared to knock heads together to ensure that the 
            service works in the interests of victims and </div>

          <P>witnesses. She is not the kind of person who sits on the Tory or 
            nationalist benches, shirks reform and is not prepared to put victims 
            and witnesses first in the system.</P>
          <p><strong>Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West) (LD): </strong>No doubt the 
            contract includes details of vetting and licensing. Guards who escort 
            prisoners in England and Wales face the tough licensing and vetting 
            procedures of the Security Industry Authority, which was set up under 
            legislation that was passed in 2001. The Executive has stated its 
            intention to extend that protection to Scotland. Will the First Minister 
            confirm whether the Executive is still seeking a legislative slot 
            at Westminster to do just that?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister: </strong>That is one of the issues that 
            the Minister for Justice dealt with yesterday. She said quite clearly&#151;I 
            hope that everyone in the chamber heard her comment and I hope that 
            some members of the media heard it, too, because unfortunately the 
            position has been misrepresented to the public&#151;that the people 
            who work for Reliance in the service have been subject to additional 
            security checks under the supervision of the Scottish Prison Service, 
            which makes sure that those checks are in place. That is a reassurance 
            for members of the public. Although Reliance has been unable to operate 
            the contract successfully during the past three weeks, the individuals 
            who are involved have had the appropriate checks, which have been 
            applied under the supervision of the Scottish Prison Service. That 
            is part of the agreement. We wanted to make sure that those who are 
            involved in the service are able, properly trained and&#151;</P>
          <P>My apologies, Presiding Officer, I started waffling there. I will

          <P> <strong>6. Mike Pringle (Edinburgh South) (LD): </strong>To ask 
            the First Minister what the Scottish Executive's position is in respect 
            of whether a cull in seal numbers is necessary. (S2F-825)</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>Our independent 
            scientific advice suggests that a general seal cull is not an appropriate 
            or effective way in which to protect fisheries. We therefore have 
            no plans to authorise a seal cull in Scottish waters.</P>
          <p><strong>Mike Pringle: </strong>Many people throughout Scotland are 
            concerned about an unnecessary cull of seals. Will the First Minister 
            confirm that, before any change is made to current policy, the Executive 
            will undertake a rigorous scientific analysis of the situation and 
            consider the potential damage to Scotland's image abroad and the knock-on 
            impact on tourism and other related businesses?</P>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I can confirm that we would 
            consider the suggestion only if it was backed up by a considerable 
            amount of reliable scientific evidence that such a cull was necessary 
            and appropriate. No evidence would justify such a change at the moment, 
            which is why we have no plans for a seal cull in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison (Western Isles) (Lab): </strong>Does 
            the First Minister agree that culls such as the Government-sponsored 
            ones of hedgehogs, mink and deer have a role in nature conservation? 
            Does he also agree that we must be vigilant about what is happening 
            in the waters around our islands by constantly assessing the impact 
            that fishermen and seals have on the viability of all fisheries?</P>
          <p><strong>The First Minister: </strong>Of course it is appropriate 
            for us to monitor those situations, but our position on the seal cull 
            is quite clear. We are also aware that, apart from the fishing industry 
            and the fishing communities, the greatest impact on fish stocks comes 
            from other species in that habitat, which have a much more considerable 
            effect on fish stocks than seals do. Part of the monitoring of fish 
            stocks must include an analysis of why fish stocks in Scottish waters 
            might be declining.</P>

          <p><strong>The Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </strong>I want to 
            detain members for just a couple of minutes. At long last, I can today 
            inform Parliament of the arrangements for our migration to Holyrood, 
            our occupation of the building and its formal opening. Members can 
            start packing at the end of June. They should be out of their present 
            offices by 20 August. Members will have entry to their new offices 
            during the week commencing 30 August. We shall meet in the new chamber 
            in the second week of September.</P>
          <P>The official opening of the new building by Her Majesty the Queen 
            will be on Saturday 9 October. Detailed arrangements for the opening 
            will be announced nearer the event but, after discussion with party 
            leaders, I can give the broad outline today.</P>
          <P>It will be a day for the whole community of Scotland&#151;a day of 
            quiet Scottish dignity. The day will have three elements: a morning 
            meeting in Old Parliament Hall, a riding down the Royal Mile and the 
            formal opening in the chamber. The riding marks the centuries-old 
            Scots tradition of Parliament and people working in public partnership.</P>
          <P>Only 10 per cent of those who will take part in the events on the 
            day will be MSPs. Each member will be asked to nominate a person from 
            their constituency who has done most for the public good. They will 
            walk, too, as will schoolchildren and civic representatives from throughout 
            Scotland. There will be a large contingent of Speakers and Presidents 
            from Parliaments in the United Kingdom, Europe and the Commonwealth.</P>
          <P>The cost to Parliament for the whole day will be £210,000.</P>
          <P>Lastly, let me say this. In my evidence to the Fraser inquiry, I 
            apologised for the shadow that Holyrood, with all its attendant costs 
            and delays, has cast over Scotland. Today, I thank those who have 
            stayed resolutely focused and kept up the intense pressure to occupy 
            the building in September.</P>
          <P>Before we get on, we have to get in. The opening on 9 October marks 
            a new beginning. It will be an opportunity for us all to concentrate 
            on why we are here: not to build a building, but to build a better 
            Scotland.</P>
          <P>I have today written to every member, enclosing a briefing pack. 
            If members have additional questions once they have studied it, the

          <P><strong>1. Stewart Stevenson (Banff and Buchan) (SNP): </strong>I 
            declare an interest in that members of my family have received grants 
            from sportscotland.</P>
          <P>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it will take in light of 
            the diversion of lottery funding for sport towards London's bid to 
            host the 2012 Olympic games. (S2O-2039)</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Mr Frank McAveety): 
            </strong>I want to make clear that there is no intention that sportscotland's 
            share of the lottery sports fund will be diverted to pay for facilities 
            in London. Sportscotland and the other distributors of the lottery 
            sports fund will be expected to spend a combined total of £340 million 
            on talented athlete development and the improvement of facilities 
            for elite athletes and communities in their own countries.</P>
          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Is the minister aware that sportscotland 
            has indicated that, in the coming year, the maximum grant that it 
            will give for capital works will be £750,000, and that funds will 
            permit it to make only one such grant? Given that investment in sports 
            facilities, inter alia, must increase if we are to train the next 
            generation of successful athletes, what steps does he plan to take 
            to ensure that the £40 million lost from Scottish sports funding does 
            not lead to the further demotion of Scotland down the league table 
            of international sports achievement?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>Sportscotland's strategy is in response 
            to the decline in overall lottery ticket sales. It reflects wider 
            changes in the purchasing of lottery tickets, so it is wise that the 
            entry point for contributions that can be made by sportscotland has 
            been redefined.</P>
          <P>Members will know that the Executive is committed to the enhancement 
            and development of a number of facilities for sports, right across 
            Scotland. We recognise the important role of sport in the lives of 
            Scottish people. That is why we have recently had the closure date 
            for the national and regional facilities programme. We hope that, 
            overall, £50 million will be available from the public purse to develop 
            our broad commitments for national and regional facilities. Sportscotland

            Scottish Executive when it last reviewed its guidance on safety in 
            outdoor education. (S2O-1965)</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Education and Young People (Peter Peacock): 
            </strong>The Executive is currently working with local authority representatives 
            to update the relevant guidance.</P>
          <p><strong>Christine May: </strong>The minister will recall that, in 
            his reply to me on 18 March in the chamber, he said that he expected 
            the physical education review to report on increasing the inclusion 
            in school activity of minority sports such as off-road biking&#151;which 
            is planned for Methil in my constituency&#151;and skateboarding, for 
            which facilities are increasingly being provided with Executive funds. 
            Those sports bring risks that may be different from those of traditional 
            sports, so will the minister ensure that any review encompasses the 
            risks associated with non-mainstream sports? Will he also ensure that 
            the future of those sports in schools is not jeopardised by a lack 
            of proper safety provision?</P>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Christine May&#151;I hope that I 
            have got her name right this time, unlike the last time&#151;raises 
            an important point. She is right to say that we would like the range 
            of sports and outdoor activities to be extended in schools and, indeed, 
            beyond schools. We must ensure that our guidelines cover those types 
            of sports so that they are not accidentally excluded from the list 
            of sports in which people can participate just because of a lack of 
            safety guidance. I am happy to ask officials to ensure that such sports 
            are covered in the new guidance, which we hope to publish later this 
            year.</P>
          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>The minister may 
            be aware that the City of Edinburgh Council and, indeed, a head teacher 
            are facing criminal charges in relation to the near-drowning of a 
            six-year-old boy. There is a danger that young people may not participate 
            in sport if we do not ensure that their safety is paramount. However, 
            there is also a danger that teachers will become more resistant to 
            taking part in educational visits and outdoor education. Will the 
            minister ensure that the guidance that he produces takes account of 
            what has happened in England, where an educational visits advisory 
            council has recently been established? We must have robust guidance 
            and we must have support that gives protection both to children and 
            to teachers when engaging in outdoor education and visits.</P>

          <p></P>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Fiona Hyslop will appreciate that 
            I am unable to comment on the specific instance that has been reported 
            today in relation to Edinburgh because it is potentially subject to 
            legal proceedings. The City of Edinburgh Council and other councils 
            will have their own guidelines and will have a comprehensive policy; 
            indeed, that will perhaps be the case with Edinburgh more than with 
            many other authorities, because of its difficulties in relation to 
            the Cairngorm tragedy of about 30 years ago. The council will be alert 
            to the policy implications that arise from such matters.</P>
          <P>Fiona Hyslop makes an important point, however. It is important to 
            encourage young people to participate in sport, and to participate 
            in outdoor education, which involves risk at some level. It is important 
            that proper planning is undertaken, and that there are proper guidelines 
            and policies in place&#151;including all the health and safety provisions 
            that local authorities are obliged to follow in law&#151;so that young 
            people can feel safe to take part in those activities, so that the 
            risks are controlled and defined and, equally, so that teachers can 
            feel part of that process. That is one of the reasons why the Executive 
            is reviewing the guidance and is considering what lessons it can learn 
            from England and Wales. Although the Executive will not slavishly 
            follow what has happened in England and Wales, it will do what is 
            appropriate in the Scottish context, following its discussions with 
            representatives of outdoor education in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>Will 
            the minister ensure that, while pupil safety must remain a paramount 
            priority at all times, the guidance is sufficiently concise, relevant 
            and to the point not to put off those wishing to participate in healthy 
            outdoor pursuits? If the guidance is kept concise and relevant, it 
            should succeed in its purpose.</P>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>One of the reasons why the Executive 
            has slightly delayed publishing the guidance, which has been worked 
            on for a number of months, is to ensure that the guidance covers all 
            the angles that the Executive wants it to cover. The guidance should 
            try to find a balance and to encourage young people to participate, 
            while taking risks within that participation&#151;that is the nature 
            of some outdoor activities. However, outdoor education also has benefits 
            for the personal growth of young people, who can assess their own 
            risk as part of the framework in which they learn. It is vital that 
            the Executive ensures that safety is the first priority. That is entirely 
            achievable, provided the Executive gets the guidance correct and gets 
            the balance correct within the guidance. The Executive will seek to 
            do just as Lord James has suggested.</P>

          <P> <strong>3. Scott Barrie (Dunfermline West) (Lab): </strong>To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how it will respond to the chief social work 
            inspector's findings in his report &quot;Progress with Complexity&quot;<em> 
            </em>that mental health services for looked-after children are inadequate 
            in most areas.<em> </em>(S2O-2032)</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Education and Young People (Euan 
            Robson): </strong>We are working with our expert child health support 
            group to promote children and young people's mental health and to 
            ensure better delivery of child and adolescent mental health services 
            for those who need them. That includes services for vulnerable children 
            and young people, such as those who are looked after by local authorities.</P>
          <p><strong>Scott Barrie: </strong>As the minister will be aware&#151;this 
            was highlighted again in this morning's debate&#151;there are major 
            shortcomings in obtaining psychiatric assistance and in recruiting 
            clinical psychologists for children and young people. As we all know, 
            however, looked-after children suffer disproportionately from mental 
            health difficulties compared with the general child care population. 
            Can the minister assure me that looked-after young people will receive 
            the assistance that they require to prevent further exacerbation of 
            their difficulties? Will the Scottish Executive ensure that those 
            people who rely on services that cut across departmental boundaries 
            are given sufficient priority to ensure that their needs are fully 
            met?</P>
          <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>I am grateful to the member for his 
            comments. He takes a great deal of interest in the matter, and has 
            had previous professional experience. He will know that a child and 
            adolescent mental health development group has been established to 
            draw on the expertise of colleagues from the national health service, 
            education, social work and the voluntary sector. The major force of 
            the development group's work is implementation of the recommendations 
            made in the Scottish needs assessment programme&#151;SNAP&#151;report 
            on child and adolescent mental health, which was published in March 
            2003. The group is currently focusing on the development of a template 
            for child and adolescent mental health, which will expand on the child 
            health support group's original template for child health services, 
            to set out essential components of a comprehensive child and adolescent 
            mental health service. The aim is to develop an explicit and observable 
            child mental health provision, which can be used by health boards 
            and their partners throughout Scotland to assess and plan child mental 
            health arrangements. The template is expected to be ready by the end 
            of the year.</P>
          <P>On the point about work force shortages, the Executive is well aware 
            of the position, and, as Scott Barrie rightly says, the vulnerability 
            of </div>

            work force group has been established&#151;it met for the first time 
            on 24 March. The group has been formed specifically to build a coherent 
            path to work force planning for child mental health services. It will 
            link closely with the national mental health work force group and 
            the child health development group. The membership of the group is 
            a partnership of people who are involved in work force planning. I 
            look forward to the development of its work in due course.</P>

          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>Will 
            the minister ensure that mental health services for looked-after and 
            other children recognise and diagnose communication impairment? Earlier 
            this week, speech therapists to whom I spoke told me how much they 
            can do for those children. Will the minister ensure that speech therapists 
            are included?</P>

          <P> <strong>4. Ms Rosemary Byrne (South of Scotland) (SSP): </strong>To 
            ask the Scottish Executive whether, in light of current underspends 
            in various local authorities, it will direct such local authorities 
            to spend these available resources on schools. (S2O-2007)</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Education and Young People (Peter Peacock): 
            </strong>It is for each local authority to decide how best to manage 
            its finances and allocate its resources, and to be held accountable 
            for its decisions locally.</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Byrne: </strong>Given the proposed closures of rural schools 
            in the Borders and the £3.5 million budget underspend that is predicted 
            for the Scottish Borders Council in 2003-04, does the minister agree 
            that the council should put that money into upgrading the schools 
            that are under threat of closure because of the poor state of the 
            buildings and facilities?</P>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>As I suggested, the decisions in 
            that instance are for the Scottish Borders Council, as similar decisions 
            in other cases are for other local authorities. Furthermore, Rosemary 
            Byrne makes two basic errors. The Scottish Borders Council still does 
            not know the outcome of its expenditure for last year because it will 
            not close its books until the end of this month, which means that 
            there may be some variance in the figure to which she referred. In 
            any event, a one-year variance from the budget would not be sufficient 
            to cover the cost of a school for the next 40, 50 or 60 </div>

          <P>years, which is the timescale in which investments take place.</P>
          <P>In addition to all the other investments that the Executive makes, 
            we invest heavily in new schools the length and breadth of Scotland 
            and support local authorities in their investments. The Scottish Socialist 
            Party does not support our approach to building new schools&#151;it 
            would cancel the projects if it had the opportunity. However, we will 
            keep investing in that approach, which will continue to improve education 
            in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>John Swinburne (Central Scotland) (SSCUP): </strong>Does 
            the Executive plan to direct local authorities to use underspends 
            to provide adequate remuneration, in line with the foster care allowance, 
            to grandparents who provide kinship care for their grandchildren at 
            the request of local councils, to enable those grandchildren to participate 
            in sport on an equitable basis?</P>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Local authority underspends are matters 
            for the local authority. On the wider point that Mr Swinburne raises, 
            we are aware of the issues that arise about grandparents' rights and 
            we are keen to work through those issues and make progress on them. 
            I am happy to have a discussion about that with Mr Swinburne if he 
            wishes.</P>

          <p><strong>The Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Mr Frank McAveety): 
            </strong>A project to merge the 14 area tourist boards with VisitScotland 
            is in its early stages. The objective is to have the new tourism network 
            operating from April 2005.</P>
          <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe: </strong>How will democratic accountability 
            be continued in the new set-up? Will satellite areas have a degree 
            of autonomy to pursue strategies that are tailored to their requirements?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>The primary objective will be for tourism 
            agencies throughout Scotland to work together locally and nationally 
            to grow the opportunity to visit Scotland. That applies to the internal 
            domestic market in the United Kingdom and to the international market. 
            I have had early-initiative discussions with the Convention of Scottish 
            Local Authorities to consider how we can meet the aspirations for 
            local democratic input. I will endeavour to work on that issue, which

            expo will return to Aberdeen next year, which will bring tourism industry 
            representatives from throughout the globe back to the city? Is that 
            a positive sign that the new hub structure will lead not to a loss 
            of local influence but to a strategy that meets the tourism industry's 
            needs throughout Scotland?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>I was delighted that my colleague was 
            present at the expo yesterday in Aberdeen, to see the good work and 
            the high-quality tourism product from throughout Scotland. I hope 
            that the expo will enhance the profile not only of Aberdeen, but of 
            Scottish tourism. As I said, identifying what is best for local areas 
            and maximising what can be done for our overall product are integral 
            to the debate.</P>
          <P>I give the assurance that we want to work with local providers to 
            ensure that they feel engaged in the process over the next year. I 
            have given VisitScotland a clear signal about how it will wish to

          <P>Will the minister explain how hubs that are populated by people in 
            ivory towers, who often have no practical experience, will do a better 
            job than area tourist board directors, who have local expertise? Where 
            will funding for local tourism now come from? Will he consider keeping 
            area tourist boards as autonomous membership organisations with expertise 
            in their areas while giving VisitScotland the responsibility of marketing 
            Scotland throughout the United Kingdom and abroad?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>I assure Jamie McGrigor that the clapping 
            was for the achievement of the Highlands rather than the quality of 
            his question. The achievement is tremendous. I pay tribute to the 
            Highlands and Islands for the work that has been done on sustainable 
            tourism. We have the ambition of growing sustainable tourism in the

            environmentally and socially sustainable development. (S2O-2053)</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Education and Young People (Peter Peacock):

            of Scottish Office/Scottish Executive commitment to education for 
            sustainable development (ESD) in Scotland&quot;? That report states 
            that Scotland now lags behind the rest of the UK in the vital task 
            of placing sustainability at the heart of education and training. 
            Does he agree that that is unacceptable? Will he tell us what will 
            be done and when in order to rectify the situation? Will he give a 
            commitment to act on the report's recommendations?</P>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>I am aware of the report and I say 
            to Patrick Harvie that he has quoted slightly selectively from it. 
            The report is partly critical, but also says that there are some encouraging 
            messages in what the Executive is seeking to do, particularly in the 
            opportunities that have been created through the work of the sustainable 
            development education liaison group; our work on the sustainable secondary 
            schools partnership; our work with RSPB Scotland, Scottish Natural 
            Heritage, WWF Scotland and others; the support that we are giving 
            for eco-schools throughout Scotland and the eco-schools initiative; 
            the things that we are doing in relation to curriculum development 
            and curriculum materials that we are putting into schools; and the 
            fact that we are now monitoring the performance of local authorities 
            in relation to the eco-schools programme. Those are all signals that 
            we take the issue seriously. We are trying to embed sustainable development

          <P><strong>1. Alex Johnstone (North East Scotland) (Con): </strong>To 
            ask the Scottish Executive when it will make an announcement in respect 
            of the planning inquiry into Arbroath supermarkets. (S2O-2043)</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Communities (Mrs Mary Mulligan): 
            </strong>The report of the public local inquiry into three supermarket 
            proposals in Arbroath is currently under consideration by the Scottish 
            ministers. Every effort will be made to reach an early decision.</P>
          <p><strong>Alex Johnstone: </strong>I thank the minister for her reply 
            and am glad that consideration is continuing. However, I am sure that 
            the minister understands that competition among supermarkets in Arbroath 
            would deliver better pricing for people in Arbroath and surrounding 
            districts. Consequently, will she explain to me why it has taken some 
            16 months to date&#151;and it would appear that it will take longer&#151;for 
            an appeal that was lodged with the Executive as long ago as 6 February 
            2003 to be considered?</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>The original two applications were 
            refused by the local council and therefore came to us on appeal. The 
            applicants have up to six months to lodge an appeal, so the timescale 
            can be elongated for that reason. However, given that there were a 
            number of applications for supermarkets in the Arbroath area, the 
            Executive considered that the most efficient method would be to hold 
            the three inquiries at the same time in order to resolve the planning 
            issues around the supermarket applications.</P>
          <P>I should point out to the member that it is not the role of the planning 
            system to arbitrate between supermarkets. However, I recognise the 
            affordability issues that could benefit constituents in the area if 
            competition should arise.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP): </strong>Does the minister 
            accept that the long delay in reaching a decision has led to uncertainty 
            and unnecessary speculation on a matter that is of great importance 
            to the local economy of Arbroath and Angus? Is she aware of the massive 
            local support for the Asda supermarket application? Will she ensure 
            that, one way or the other, a decision will be taken as quickly as 
            possible to end the uncertainty and speculation and allow the local 
            economy to make progress?</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>It is essential that the planning 
            procedures are conformed with when such applications are considered. 
            Considering all three applications at the same time was the most sensible 
            thing to do. It is essential for local people to be given the opportunity 
            to partake in such inquiries and I believe that that has been the 
            case.</P>

          <P> <strong>2. Paul Martin (Glasgow Springburn) (Lab): </strong>To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken to ensure that free 
            debt advice is available to all who require it. (S2O-1981)</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Communities (Mrs Mary Mulligan): 
            </strong>We announced in January an extra £4 million of new funding 
            for free money and debt advice for 2004-05 and 2005-06. That funding 
            will be used to develop money advice services for vulnerable groups, 
            such as ethnic minority communities, lone parents and people with 
            mental health issues, and to boost the £3 million annually that is 
            already provided to local authorities by the Executive.</P>
          <p><strong>Paul Martin: </strong>Is the minister aware of a statement 
            that was made by the chairman of the HSBC Bank, which made a pre-tax 
            profit of £6.86 billion? He advised that it was a very good year for 
            HSBC. It was not such a good year, however, for many of those who 
            find themselves in debt. Is it not time for us to call on our banking 
            giants to provide funding so that we can deliver independent and objective 
            financial advice in our local communities?</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>The Executive will continue to look 
            at a number of ways of providing money advice, particularly to those 
            with debt problems&#151;we recognise the problems that they experience. 
            We are also in conversation with the banks about how they can lend 
            assistance to those who have particular problems in accessing money 
            at affordable rates. Credit unions have provided a great way of assisting 
            in some communities, but there are other ways in which the banks can 
            assist people to access money and advice.</P>
          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Access to Credit</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>3. Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab): </strong>To ask the 
            Scottish Executive what action within its responsibilities it is taking 
            to support those who are excluded from using the traditional financial 
            sector due to their credit history. (S2O-2031)</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Communities (Mrs Mary Mulligan): 
            </strong>We believe that credit unions have a vital role to play as 
            they provide access to small loans at affordable interest rates, while 
            at the same time encouraging a savings culture, which is a long-term 
            way out of money problems. We want to help to market and develop credit 
            unions and have offered a range of support including the £1.1m capacity 
            fund that we announced in September 2003 to help those credit unions 
            best placed to serve low-income households to grow their membership.</P>
          <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>I acknowledge that the Executive 
            recognises the importance of credit unions. However, should we not 
            push the traditional </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7680">7680</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>financial sector to do more? In that regard, will the minister consider 
            promoting the uptake of basic bank accounts and look to spread the 
            model of the Wester Hailes community banking agreement throughout 
            communities in Scotland?</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>The most recent figures that we have 
            show that 5.4 million basic bank accounts were opened by June 2002 
            in the UK. We recognise that there are advantages to increasing that 
            number and, as I said in response to Paul Martin, we are in discussions 
            with the banks as to how we can develop that further.</P>
          <P>The Executive is also looking at the example of the community banking 
            facilities that were established in Wester Hailes through Wester Hailes 
            Representative Council and HBOS. We want to learn lessons from that 
            example. Although some communities could benefit from it, we might 
            need to look at other options for other communities. We are determined 
            to provide assistance to people to access financial services throughout 
            all our communities in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>Cathie Craigie (Cumbernauld and Kilsyth) (Lab): </strong>I 
            thank the Presiding Officer for taking my question now as that will 
            allow continuity with the current topic. I welcome the Executive's 
            initiatives&#151;its support for money advice agencies, its commitment 
            to assist the credit union movement and its recognition of the valuable 
            work that people do voluntarily in our communities. Does the minister 
            agree that the numbers of people who find themselves with multiple 
            debts, but who are still able to find lenders to lend them money or 
            give them cards to get them deeper into debt, is of genuine concern? 
            The points made by Paul Martin and Jackie Baillie are serious and 
            show that all of us must have been thinking along the same lines this 
            week. It is time that the Scottish Executive made proposals to deal 
            with the trend. Such debt affects people of all ages, young and old, 
            and it is too easy for people to fall into serious debt.</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>We recognise what the attractions 
            might be of loan sharks and others who can prove to be very expensive 
            in the long term. For that reason, we are working with the Department 
            of Trade and Industry on the review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
            We are also working with the DTI on a pilot scheme that is based in 
            Glasgow, although it will be operating Scotland-wide, to look at how 
            we can crack down on illegal money lenders and loan sharks and ensure 
            that we protect people, particularly those who are most vulnerable, 
            from those unscrupulous lenders.</P>

          <P> <strong>4. Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how it will protect communities affected by 
            planning applications that might have a negative impact on their environment 
            or quality of life. (S2O-2013)</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Communities (Mrs Mary Mulligan): 
            </strong>The purpose of the planning system is to guide change through 
            an efficient and effective process that respects the rights of the 
            individual while acting in the interest of the wider community. Effective 
            community engagement is essential in shaping a sustainable Scotland. 
            Our modernising agenda for the planning system includes measures to 
            enhance and strengthen public involvement in all stages of the planning 
            system.</P>
          <p><strong>Donald Gorrie: </strong>I want to focus the minister's attention 
            on the fact that many communities and councils are very angry at the 
            way in which decisions that are made locally and democratically and 
            have widespread support are overturned by the reporter at a public 
            inquiry. Indeed, the most recent example involves Dundee City Council, 
            which has sent material to members of all parties, asking them to 
            raise this very point. I realise that some of the issues in question 
            are controversial; however, if the reporter overturns a point of view 
            that has very widespread support, surely communities must have some 
            capacity to make their case in a higher court.</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>Of course the community still has 
            the opportunity to take the matter further by seeking a review in 
            the courts. However, the Executive and I are very anxious to ensure 
            that people are involved in the planning process at the earliest possible 
            stage. Doing so will secure the most effective outcomes for our communities 
            instead of making them feel that they are up against those with other 
            interests who perhaps do not recognise community interests.</P>
          <P>Moreover, we must get people involved in developing the local plan 
            and acknowledge the interests both of community groups and of applicants. 
            The modernisation of the planning system will provide an even playing 
            field to ensure that everyone's voice is listened to and that no one 
            feels ignored.</P>

          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Communities (Mrs Mary Mulligan): 
            </strong>We are carefully considering this issue in light of the recommendations

          <P>However, I say to Mr Rumbles that, in determining our position, I 
            want to balance the implications of introducing a lower age limit 
            for restriction of liberty orders, as mentioned in the committee report, 
            against the risk of impeding the court's ability to impose an alternative 
            to secure accommodation in cases in which that is considered suitable. 
            I am reflecting on how we might best achieve such a balance.</P>
          <p><strong>Mike Rumbles: </strong>I thank the minister for that helpful 
            reply. If she agrees that a progressive Government should examine 
            the issue, will she consider accepting either her Labour colleague 
            Elaine Smith's amendment or my own amendment, both of which would 
            address the matter?</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>As far as I am aware, both the amendments 
            that Mr Rumbles has mentioned seek to set age limits at which restriction

            want to make a definitive response about that age limit.</P>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab): </strong>I draw the

            those debates will be taken very seriously by committee members and 
            others who attend. It would be more helpful to have a productive discussion 
            there rather than in the chamber.</P>

            Committee and other members at stage 2 on refining the Antisocial

          <p><strong>Mr Ruskell: </strong>The minister will be aware that it was 
            originally envisaged that the people would be the second chamber of 
            the Parliament. Planning reform and third-party rights of appeal are 
            issues that directly concern the public. Will she consider using innovative 
            ways of involving the public in the consultation, such as those that 
            are being promoted by the Scottish Civic Forum? What should MSPs do 
            to encourage the public's participation in the consultations?</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>I am always looking for new ways to 
            involve the community of Scotland in the Parliament's deliberations. 
            Last summer my colleague Margaret Curran, other ministers and I showed 
            the way when we consulted on the antisocial behaviour legislation. 
            Such consultation is about involving as many people as possible.</P>
          <P>MSPs have a responsibility to talk to their communities and all the 
            stakeholders in their constituencies about planning arrangements. 
            I agree with Mr Ruskell that it is important that </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7684">7684</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>people acknowledge the role that planning plays and take a view on 
            how we should be developing our planning system for the future.</P>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab): </strong>I welcome 
            the minister's positive response. Will she consider making available 
            simple and easy-to-copy versions of the consultation documents? I 
            know that some people have had difficulty in getting multiple copies 
            of them. We want to engage our constituents in the debate and the 
            minister is right that we should have that debate through to the summer. 
            That process would be facilitated by the provision of simple documents 
            that we can access and then spread to our constituents.</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>I am more than happy to help with 
            that process. I am aware of several innovative members of my group 
            who have already put together simple, straightforward and understandable 
            papers. They are already engaged with their communities in discussing 
            planning matters. If we can be of any further assistance, of course 
            that would be okay.</P>
          <p><strong>Iain Smith (North East Fife) (LD): </strong>Consultation 
            is one thing, but listening to the results of the consultation is 
            another. My constituents are very concerned that their views were 
            not taken into account during the earlier consultation on structure 
            planning, and that the Executive decided to go ahead with city-region 
            plans that will split Fife, despite the fact that the people of Fife 
            overwhelmingly rejected those plans. They include 3,000 people in 
            my constituency who submitted a petition to the Parliament that opposed 
            the plans. Can the minister assure me that the Executive will listen 
            to those who respond to the consultation on the operation of the planning 
            system?</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>I assure Mr Smith that we will listen 
            to those who are consulted. However, as I have said previously on 
            planning issues, often we have to resolve different views. The planning 
            system has a difficult role to play.</P>
          <P>On Mr Smith's comments on the situation in Fife, it is a welcome 
            development that local authorities now produce only one local plan, 
            instead of the two-tier system of the past. The city-region plans 
            are important because they recognise the overlapping nature of the 
            areas to which they apply. It will benefit Fife to feed into both 
            the Dundee city plan and the Edinburgh city plan, because it has much 
            to do with both those areas. There are advantages to be sought.</P>

          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>General Questions</strong></P>
          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Borders Railway (Funding)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>1. Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>To 
            ask the Scottish Executive whether, in light of recent newspaper reports, 
            it has agreed its share of funding for the Borders railway. (S2O-2049)</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Transport (Nicol Stephen): </strong>The 
            Scottish Executive has not agreed its share of funding for the Borders 
            railway in light of recent newspaper reports.</P>
          <p><strong>Christine Grahame: </strong>Well, there is an honest answer. 
            However, how does that square with other newspaper reports, which 
            I hope the minister has read, that his colleague Jeremy Purvis said&#151;hint, 
            hint&#151;that we should not worry about the funding for the Waverley 
            line because the coalition is committed to it? If Mr Purvis is right, 
            how can the minister say what he just said? I presume that Mr Purvis 
            is wrong and that there is no commitment to fund the Waverley line. 
            Can the minister make the position clear once and for all?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I notice that there are still no 
            recent newspaper reports committing the Scottish National Party to 
            the funding of the Waverley rail line. As recently as 31 March, I 
            met with the Waverley railway partnership at a meeting that was convened 
            by Mr Purvis, Mr Robson and Ms Brankin, who actively promote the scheme 
            with other members of the Executive and me to ensure that the Executive 
            provides funding. We now have all the information that we require 
            on the Waverley railway partnership's business case. I will be able 
            to make a decision once I receive from my officials the full report 
            on the completed business case, which I will get soon.</P>
          <p><strong>Jeremy Purvis (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD): </strong>I 
            am delighted that Miss Grahame is such an avid reader of my press 
            releases. The minister will know that, at the meeting that I convened 
            and chaired on behalf of constituents and the Waverley railway partnership, 
            the issue was the importance of considering long-term, strategic planning 
            for the benefits of the project. Does he agree that that is a better 
            approach than one of carping from the sidelines?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>It is important to point out that 
            if a new railway line is built in an area such as the Borders, it 
            can bring significant economic, environmental and social benefits. 
            I heard comments on the radio this morning&#151;rather than getting 
            them from one of Mr Purvis's or Ms Grahame's press releases&#151;about 
            general movements in housing costs in Scotland and how, in anticipation 
            of the benefits of the Waverley line, there is growing confidence 
            in the Borders and a shift in housing prices there. Investment in 
            public </div>

          <p></P>
          <P>transport can result in such tangible benefits, which are encouraging 
            to see.</P>
          <P>We must go through the full process of analysis and consider all 
            the economic and social benefits for the community. We must also consider 
            the potential benefits for business from tourism and so on. All that 
            work is being done. The Executive is anxious to support the Waverley 
            line scheme, but the right appraisal process must be completed. I 
            am pleased that, because of the meeting on 31 March, the councils 
            and other partners in the Waverley railway partnership have responded. 
            I believe that we have received all the information that is necessary 
            to make a final decision.</P>
          <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>So that 
            I can clarify the position once and for all in my column in the <em>Border 
            Telegraph</em>, will the minister tell us when he will make the announcement 
            on the funding?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The track record of the Conservative 
            party, not only in relation to the Borders rail link but in relation 
            to any of the other major public transport projects that the Executive 
            is supporting, is non-existent. It was the Conservatives who pulled 
            money out of public transport and neglected our railways for decades. 
            Given such insecure foundations, it is interesting to see David Mundell 
            now try to put Executive members under pressure on the issue. We are 
            determined to make the decision soon. We are committed to the Borders 
            rail project, as was pointed out in the partnership agreement, and 
            I am confident that, over the next few years, not only with the Borders 
            railway but with a £3 billion programme of investment in Scotland's 
            transport over a 10-year period, we will start to transform the quality 
            of public transport in Scotland. That is something to which I hope 
            everyone in this chamber is committed.</P>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab): </strong>The minister and 
            the Parliament will be familiar with my making the point that Midlothian 
            has absolutely no train service whatsoever. It is one of the few areas 
            in Scotland still to be in that position. With regard to the business 
            case for the Waverley line, is the minister aware of the importance 
            of being able to transport my constituents into Edinburgh in order 
            to support the city's economy? Is that matter being considered in 
            addition to the benefits to both Midlothian and the Borders?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>It is important to emphasise the 
            fact that there are significant benefits to Midlothian, East Lothian 
            and areas other than the Borders as a result of the Borders rail link 
            to Edinburgh. All those benefits will be looked at and quantified 
            as part of the assessment of the business case that comes forward 
            from the Waverley railway partnership.</P>

          <P>Another important announcement that was made this week concerned 
            our investment in Waverley railway station. Without an expansion of 
            the facilities and capacity at Waverley station, it would not be possible 
            to accommodate all the ambitious plans that we have for the Borders 
            railway, the Airdrie to Bathgate line or the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine 
            line. We want to invest in a whole range of improvements and it is 
            vital that we get cracking with those decisions as soon as possible 
            so that we can get on with the really important part of the job&#151;implementing 
            and delivering new rail projects on the ground.</P>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab): </strong>I welcome 
            the minister's answer and particularly his comments about not just 
            developing the Waverley line but having somewhere for it to stop when 
            it reaches Edinburgh. In the context of that answer, will he clarify 
            whether the new platforms and train paths at Waverley station have 
            the capacity to take the Waverley line, or whether other, much needed, 
            central Scotland rail projects will be assumed in that welcome initial 
            stage of the development of Waverley station?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The initial stage that we announced 
            this week, which will increase capacity from 24 trains per hour to 
            28 trains per hour, can accommodate the Borders railway line and the 
            other projects that I mentioned.</P>
          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Tolled Bridges (Review)</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>2. Helen Eadie (Dunfermline East) (Lab): </strong>To ask 
            the Scottish Executive when it intends to start the review of tolled 
            bridges referred to in &quot;A Partnership for a Better Scotland&quot;. 
            (S2O-1972)</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Transport (Nicol Stephen): </strong>Preparations 
            for the review are at an advanced stage and I will make an announcement 
            on the remit and programme for taking forward this work in due course.</P>
          <p><strong>Helen Eadie: </strong>In light of the calls for removal of 
            the tolls on the Skye and Erskine bridges, will the minister have 
            regard to the fact that the capital costs of building the Forth road 
            bridge were repaid in 1996? Will he further note the economic situation 
            in Fife, where the level of unemployment in central Fife is acute 
            and is higher than in many other parts of Scotland? As one of the 
            solutions to the problem, will he hear my call for the Forth road 
            bridge tolls to be abolished as an outcome of the review? Will he 
            join me in welcoming the news that the Scottish Trades Union Congress 
            yesterday agreed a motion calling for another multimodal crossing 
            over or under the Forth?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>All those issues will certainly be 
            taken into consideration as part of the review. I met representatives 
            of FETA&#151;the Forth Estuary Transport Authority, which is responsible 
            for the </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7688">7688</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>bridge&#151;to discuss the pressures that it faces and to encourage 
            it to develop proposals for the crossing over the coming months.</P>
          <P>It would be wrong for me to signal the removal of tolls on any of 
            the bridges that will be included in the review, particularly the 
            Forth bridge. The toll on that bridge is being increased from 80p 
            to £1 and I know that that funding is crucial to FETA's future plans 
            in relation to the maintenance of the bridge. The structure is around 
            40 years old and will require significant maintenance and investment 
            over the coming decades. We will require to consider that matter, 
            too, as part of the review.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Mark Ruskell (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Green): </strong>Does 
            the minister agree that a study into yet another Forth road bridge 
            is a waste of resources and that we should focus on upgrading the 
            existing infrastructure, starting with the signalling on the Forth 
            rail bridge and finishing with the opening of stations at Methil, 
            Leven and St Andrews?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I agree there are significant shorter-term 
            measures that we can take, such as the introduction of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine 
            line, which will take pressure off the Forth rail bridge and allow 
            us to upgrade to improve services to Fife. In relation to our longer-term 
            view of the Forth crossing, which is vital for Scotland, I would like 
            to see the balance of investment swing towards public transport and 
            better public transport services for that crossing, but it would be 
            wrong at this stage to rule out any of the options for the future.</P>
          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Motorists (Assistance)</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>3. Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP): 
            </strong>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will take, or propose 
            that Her Majesty's Government should take, any measures to assist 
            the motorist in Scotland, in light of the necessity of a motor car 
            for many people in rural and urban Scotland. (S2O-2038)</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Transport (Nicol Stephen): </strong>I am 
            pleased at the breadth of questions on transport issues in this general 
            question time.</P>
          <P>The Scottish Executive's rural petrol stations grant scheme is assisting 
            motorists by helping to maintain a viable network of petrol stations 
            and liquefied petroleum gas supplies in rural areas. There is no equivalent 
            scheme at present in England. Also, through the Scottish energy efficiency 
            office, the Executive funds two further programmes&#151;powershift 
            and autogas+&#151;that support motorists who wish to convert their 
            car or van to run on LPG. More than 500 vehicles benefited from those

            2003 and 2006.</P>
          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>As the minister knows, the level of 
            tax on fuel in Scotland is, thanks to the London Labour chancellor, 
            the highest, or among the highest, in the world&#151;although it is 
            not high enough for the Liberal party. Can he explain what, in his 
            view, is the justification for that dubious honour? Is there any reason 
            connected with the environment? If so, can he explain the strange 
            absence of massive clouds of smog scudding along our skyline? Is it 
            the truth that the problem is not damage to the environment, but damage 
            caused by the chancellor, and that the colour of the problem is not 
            green but Brown?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Fuel duty is a reserved matter, as 
            Fergus Ewing correctly pointed out, and it would be wrong for me to 
            comment on it in the chamber.</P>
          <P>In his question, Fergus Ewing asserted that the motor car is a necessity 
            for many people in rural parts of Scotland. I understand that totally, 
            but there are many people in rural Scotland who do not have access 
            to a motor car and it is important that we do whatever we can to support 
            those individuals. Through the rural community transport initiative, 
            more than 80 schemes are being funded throughout rural Scotland; those 
            schemes try to give people, in particular elderly and disabled people, 
            access to high-quality transport. A number of demand-responsive transport 
            pilot schemes, such as dial-a-bus schemes, community bus schemes and 
            voluntary car schemes, are also being funded. Such schemes are important 
            for the future of rural Scotland and I commend campaigning for more 
            of them to Fergus Ewing.</P>

            of prison escort services. (S2O-2001)</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Justice (Cathy Jamieson): </strong>As I 
            made clear in my statement to Parliament yesterday, we are committed 
            to those reforms because they will get more police on front-line operational 
            duties. However, as I also made clear, I expect Reliance Secure Task 
            Management Ltd to meet the terms of the contract and to deliver a 
            high-quality service.</P>
          <p><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>Is it not absolutely farcical that

            is reported to have had to ask directions on how to get to the prison?

            is profit rather than public safety?</P>
          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>As I outlined clearly in yesterday's 
            statement, there will still be a police presence in and around the

            In the lead-up to the award of the contract, a range of discussions 
            took place on that issue. Reassurances were given that overall responsibility 
            for security in the courts would not be removed from the police.</P>
          <P>Over the past few weeks, there have been situations that simply should 
            not have arisen. We are continuing to monitor matters extremely closely. 
            The Scottish Prison Service is directly responsible for overseeing 
            and monitoring the contract, ensuring that it is delivered effectively 
            and reporting to me on its on-going operation.</P>
          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Rail Services (Fife, Perth and Edinburgh)</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>5. Murdo Fraser (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to improve rail services 
            between Perth, Fife and Edinburgh. (S2O-2012)</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Transport (Nicol Stephen): </strong>The 
            Scottish Executive is funding new trains and longer platforms that 
            will lead to, for example, a 28 per cent increase in peak-time capacity 
            on Fife services. The new Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line will also 
            bring significant benefits. The Executive is of course prepared to 
            consider any proposals that local authorities and their transport 
            partners may promote for new or improved rail services between Perth, 
            Fife and Edinburgh.</P>
          <p><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>The minister will be aware of the 
            importance of good transport links with the capital for economic development 
            in those areas. He is probably also aware that there is deep dissatisfaction 
            among people in Fife about the level of service between Fife and Edinburgh. 
            It is equally unacceptable to people in Perth that it can sometimes 
            take two hours to get from Perth to Edinburgh. In the context of the 
            renewal of the ScotRail franchise, will the minister outline what 
            discussions he has had with the relevant authorities about driving 
            up the service that is available to people in Perth and Fife?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I welcome the fact that there is 
            a demand for better public transport. In my view, there is a real 
            opportunity to grow the market for passenger services on our railways 
            in Scotland. Fife is certainly one of the prime candidates for improved 
            services.</P>
          <P>As I have said to the Parliament before, the current ScotRail franchise 
            is based on the existing level of service. It would have been good 
            to have </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7691">7691</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>had a whole list of new and improved lines as part of that franchise, 
            but it is recognised that, throughout the United Kingdom, there have 
            been significant pressures on new investment in the rail industry. 
            Some of the new franchises that have been let recently have involved 
            cutbacks and there were assertions that we would go in that direction 
            in Scotland. That was never the intention&#151;we want to make improvements. 
            For the first time in decades, we are building new lines in Scotland. 
            Those new lines and all the improvements that I have discussed at 
            question time today will be introduced as part of the new ScotRail 
            franchise, once a new franchisee&#151;a new contractor&#151;is in 
            place.</P>
          <P>If proposals are made that get to an advanced stage, they will have 
            to go through the normal appraisal process. Any of those improvements&#151;whether 
            they involve Perth, Fife or other parts of Scotland&#151;can be introduced 
            into the new ScotRail contract as an amendment to the franchise. That 
            is guaranteed.</P>
          <p><strong>Tricia Marwick (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP): </strong>Does 
            the minister agree that pressure on the Forth road bridge and congestion 
            in Edinburgh can be relieved only by the provision of a fast, frequent 
            and safe rail service from Fife and beyond? What hope can the minister 
            give to frustrated commuters from Markinch, who have been waiting 
            for the redevelopment of their station for five years, that the work 
            to include toilets, disabled access and closed-circuit television 
            will begin in the very near future?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The delivery of such projects is 
            not in my direct control, but I am keen to provide support for the 
            funding, planning and appraisal of those projects. In relation to 
            the Fife services, I have mentioned that there will be 29 new trains 
            throughout Scotland, several of which will be targeted on services 
            to the north of Edinburgh. That will benefit the Fife commuter services. 
            I also want to mention the longer platforms at stations on the Fife 
            circle and the benefits of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line, which 
            will take pressure off the Forth road bridge and will lead to further 
            improvements in commuter services in the area.</P>
          <P>I want to grow the market for public transport in Scotland, including 
            the market for rail services, and to improve the service for commuters 
            in Fife. I believe that the plans that we have put in place will deliver 
            exactly that over the coming years.</P>

          <P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Trish Godman): </strong>The 
            next item of business is a debate on motion S2M-1185, in the name 
            of Jim Wallace, on renewable energy and energy efficiency, and three 
            amendments to the motion.</P>
          <P>15:02</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy First Minister and Minister for Enterprise and 
            Lifelong Learning (Mr Jim Wallace): </strong>It is important to reflect 
            on the fact that this debate is about a topic that, although it underpins 
            much of our daily lives, we often take for granted. From the moment 
            we wake up in the morning, we use energy: through using our alarm 
            clocks, if we have an electric alarm clock, to using lighting, heating 
            and transport. Energy is vital to the running of our businesses, schools 
            and hospitals. In recent decades, our demand for more energy has regularly 
            and consistently increased. We know that our lives would be very different 
            without it; indeed, the lives of our communities would be significantly 
            impoverished.</P>
          <P>It is clear that we cannot continue simply to demand more energy 
            and to generate more energy without giving thought to the long-term 
            implications and limitations. That is why I believe that today's debate 
            is on an important topic for our future not just in this country, 
            but globally.</P>
          <P>From the early days of the Scottish Parliament, the Executive has 
            put the generation of renewable energy high up the political agenda. 
            I believe that we face five significant challenges: to attain our 
            target of generating 40 per cent of electricity in Scotland from renewable 
            sources by 2020; to develop a range of renewables technologies that 
            can achieve a balanced and consistent supply of energy; to exploit 
            the major economic opportunities in developing and producing renewables 
            technology by ensuring that we put Scottish business at the cutting 
            edge of the emerging worldwide market; to reduce the amount of energy 
            that we use and the costs to individuals and business through effective 
            energy efficiency measures; and to address the threat that is posed 
            by climate change in order to protect and enhance our environment.</P>
          <P>The actions that we set out in our strategy just a year ago will 
            help us to meet those objectives. They will enable us to help to create 
            a thriving renewables industry in Scotland that will safeguard existing 
            jobs and that will have the considerable potential to create new ones.</P>
          <P>In the past 12 months, we established the forum for renewable energy 
            development in Scotland&#151;FREDS&#151;under the chairmanship of 
            my deputy minister, Lewis Macdonald. The forum brings </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7694">7694</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>together industry, academia and government. Well before the end of 
            the year, it will produce action plans for the development of marine 
            energy and biomass. I believe that both those technologies provide 
            us with good opportunities for increased economic development, export 
            opportunities and rural regeneration. Marine energy technology is 
            still in its infancy, but it provides a major opportunity for Scotland. 
            We have potentially the largest marine energy resource in Europe and 
            more than enough to satisfy Scotland's entire demand for electricity. 
            Of course, there are formidable challenges associated with that, not 
            least in developing marine devices to economic viability. FREDS is 
            considering those challenges.</P>
          <p><strong>Murdo Fraser (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>The 
            Deputy First Minister will be aware that the Portuguese Government 
            has stimulated the market for wave technology by means of tariff subsidy. 
            Is the Scottish Executive prepared to consider a similar scheme to 
            bring such new initiatives to the marketplace here?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I would certainly not rule that out. 
            However, in making comparisons with Portugal, we should consider the 
            facts that our national resource is better, that we are further ahead 
            of the Portuguese in our academic approach and that we have several 
            designers and developers in the field. Portugal might also offer us 
            export opportunities. The developments there present us with a challenge, 
            but it is one that we can meet. They also present us with an opportunity. 
            If we can develop cutting-edge work, there will be opportunities for 
            an export market, to which we are highly alert.</P>
          <P>On marine technology, we have committed, as the Parliament will know, 
            more than £2 million towards the establishment of a wave device test 
            centre off the coast of Orkney, which will play a major role in enabling 
            the many device designs that have been developed to prove their worth. 
            The first of those, Ocean Power Delivery's Pelamis, will commence 
            testing during the next few weeks. It was with a sense of great pride 
            that those of us who were in Leith a few weeks ago for the launch 
            of the first full-scale prototype of the device were able to see it 
            and to appreciate the academic and engineering expertise that was 
            necessary to develop it, as well as the fact that the prototype is 
            from Scotland. With our partners, we are considering the possible 
            extension of the Orkney centre to enable it to test tidal stream devices 
            as well.</P>
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP): </strong>How long 
            does the minister expect it will be before the Pelamis project becomes 
            a commercial reality? The question whether we meet our targets is 
            very much tied up with the answer to that.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7695">7695</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <p><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>One of the purposes of the test centre 
            is to ensure that the necessary facilities are in place for the technology 
            to prove its worth. It would be invidious to put a timescale on that, 
            but we all recognise the importance of pressing on with the work. 
            I very much look forward to seeing Pelamis off the coast of my constituency 
            and the work that will be done with it.</P>
          <P>I welcome the fact that one of the main sub-groups of FREDS is on 
            marine energy. The sub-group brings together people from business 
            and academia, as well as allowing for a political input. As that shows, 
            we want to ensure that any barriers to the development of marine energy 
            can be eliminated. There is a real sense of urgency and commitment 
            around taking that forward.</P>
          <P>The use of biomass for energy has not yet taken off in Scotland, 
            despite the huge natural resource in our forestry industry, which 
            represents a significant opportunity for Scotland to grasp. That is 
            why FREDS has been asked to give urgent consideration to the actions 
            that are needed to increase the penetration of biomass technologies.</P>
          <p><strong>Jeremy Purvis (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD): </strong>Will 
            the minister give way?</P>
          <p><strong>Christine May (Central Fife) (Lab): </strong>Will the Deputy 
            First Minister give way?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I think that Christine May got in first.</P>
          <p><strong>Christine May: </strong>Does the Deputy First Minister accept 
            that it might be necessary for the Executive to intervene with additional 
            support for the biomass industry in order to kick-start it and to 
            get it to the level that we want it to be at?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>That is very much the sort of issue 
            that the FREDS sub-group has been asked to consider&#151;what are 
            the things that we can do to assist with the use of biomass? We hope 
            that the sub-group will report later in the year, after which we will 
            be in a better position to identify the measures that we need to take 
            in order to give a kick start, as Christine May described it, to the 
            biomass industry.</P>
          <P>In all fairness, I should now give way to Jeremy Purvis.</P>
          <p><strong>Jeremy Purvis: </strong>I am grateful to the Deputy First 
            Minister. Will he ensure that, given that the Minister for Communities' 
            affordable housing review is now being carried out, there will be 
            an opportunity for social housing to benefit from combined heat and 
            power plants? That could be exactly the sort of thing that could stimulate 
            the development of renewables in the public sector.</P>
          <p><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_11"></A>Mr Wallace: </strong>A whole 
            range of things can be done on combined heat and power and on the 
            heating of housing and public buildings. For </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>example, there are opportunities for thermal heat pumps. That is 
            another technology that has not taken off in Scotland as much as it 
            has elsewhere. In continental Europe, there have been huge and exponential 
            advances in its use and I think that we will see that in Scotland 
            as well. Jeremy Purvis is right to identify some of the opportunities 
            that can not only help to ensure that we are better stewards of our 
            natural resources, but result in job opportunities.</P>
          <P>Together, wind power, wave, biomass and other renewables technologies 
            represent a range of renewable energy sources that will provide a 
            consistent and balanced energy supply. If that can be achieved, it 
            will be a huge prize not only for Scotland, but for the world.</P>
          <p><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con): </strong>Will the minister take an 
            intervention?</P>
          <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>Will the 
            minister take an intervention?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I have been pretty good at taking interventions, 
            but I will take one more, from John Scott.</P>
          <p><strong>John Scott: </strong>When will all the fine ideas that the 
            minister is talking about become a commercial reality? Will they deliver 
            a worthwhile amount of energy?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>The target is that 18 per cent of electricity 
            will be generated by renewable sources by 2010, which we believe we 
            are on course to deliver. Although it is a challenge to us to deliver 
            40 per cent of our electricity generation from renewable sources by 
            2020, I believe that it can be done, which is why we are taking action 
            to ensure that we contribute to meeting that target through marine 
            and biomass technology and through saving energy, so that the base 
            to which the percentage is applied is lower.</P>
          <P>I will now deal with the economic advantages and opportunities. We 
            are committed to developing and implementing a green jobs strategy 
            to help Scotland to realise the significant business, environmental 
            and employment benefits of a greener economy, of which renewable energy 
            will be an important part. The strategy is focused on how best to 
            create and support indigenous wealth, jobs and opportunities; in the 
            coming weeks, I will launch a major public consultation exercise on 
            it. I am confident that one of the reasons why we can benefit from 
            the strategy is that it plays to many of Scotland's traditional strengths, 
            such as innovation, engineering, manufacturing and exporting. New 
            skills will certainly be needed, but they can be developed alongside 
            existing skills. I am sure that Scottish business and education can 
            rise to the challenge.</P>

          <P>Our strategy for growing the renewables sector supports a range of 
            renewables technologies at grass-roots level. In the next three years, 
            we will invest more than £5 million in the Scottish community and 
            householder renewables initiative for small-scale wind, solar, biomass, 
            hydro, marine and geothermal energy projects.</P>
          <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab): </strong>Will the minister 
            give way?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I have been pretty generous until now 
            and I want to make progress. If I have time, I will give way later.</P>
          <P>As well as promoting renewable energy, we must take steps to reduce 
            our demand for energy. The partnership agreement acknowledges that 
            it is vital to make efficient use of our energy sources. Last month, 
            I announced £20 million of new funding to implement energy efficiency 
            measures that will reduce carbon emissions through a scheme covering 
            all local authorities and health boards and Scottish Water. It is 
            intended that the scheme will involve revolving funds to be administered 
            locally.</P>
          <P>Although some of the savings from energy efficiency measures will 
            be reinvested in new measures, most of them will be invested in front-line 
            services. That will build on the work of the Scottish energy efficiency 
            office, which carried out more than 600 energy audits in 2003-04. 
            Those are estimated to have identified potential savings to Scottish 
            businesses of around £15 million and carbon savings of 228,000 tonnes, 
            which is enough to power 35,000 homes for a year.</P>
          <P>Domestic energy efficiency has improved in recent years. In 1996, 
            only 7 per cent of Scottish homes had high energy efficiency ratings,

            by 2002.</P>
          <P>I have set out briefly the action that we are taking to promote renewable 
            energy and energy efficiency. There is an opportunity for business 
            as well as a requirement to protect and enhance our environment. I 
            know that we cannot be complacent, but the actions that I have outlined 
            today and the record of the Administration in promoting renewable 
            energy and energy efficiency show the importance that we attach to 
            addressing the issue and identifying not only the challenges that 
            we want to meet, but the opportunities that exist for our businesses 
            as we try to bring some of our ideas to reality.</P>

            for the development of renewable energy technologies, including the 
            associated economic benefits and rural regeneration and export opportunities; 
            welcomes the associated drive to increase energy efficiency measures 
            across Scotland, including the recent announcement of the public sector 
            energy efficiency fund and the environmental best practice being promoted 
            by the Scottish Energy Efficiency Office; also recognises the contribution 
            that both renewable energy and energy efficiency make to reducing 
            carbon emissions, and supports the Executive's commitment to tackling 
            climate change.</P>
          <P>15:14</P>
          <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP): </strong>Moving towards 
            renewable and greener sources of energy is an essential part of reducing 
            our carbon emissions. The Scottish Power briefing indicates that its 
            existing wind farms alone will reduce carbon dioxide emissions in 
            Scotland by more than £3.5 million tonnes over the next 25 years. 
            The threat of climate change is real and we ignore it at our peril.</P>
          <P>The need to reduce carbon emissions is only one of the reasons why 
            we must go down the renewables road. For all my concerns about the 
            way in which the wind energy market is being developed, I have no 
            doubt that I would rather see in my back yard a field of wind turbines 
            than a nuclear reactor leaking goodness knows what and leaving an 
            environmental legacy to be dealt with by generations to come.</P>
          <p><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Roseanna Cunningham's amendment mentions 
            a target of 25 per cent renewable energy by 2010. Given the fact that 
            peak demand in Scotland can reach almost 6,000 megawatts, does she 
            believe that that target is achievable? Can she guarantee that there 
            will be sufficient back-up plant to ensure that peak demand is met 
            and that there will be stability of supply?</P>
          <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>That certainly is achievable. 
            However, the closer we get to 2010 without meeting that target, the 
            less likely it is to be achieved. We need to work towards the target 
            in order to meet it. I will address that issue later.</P>
          <P>The nuclear industry lobbyists have been hard at work yet again and 
            there have been reports in the newspapers this week punting calls 
            for nuclear power to be promoted ahead of wind and other renewable 
            energy sources. I know that there are some cheerleaders for the nuclear 
            industry in the chamber, but I hope that the rest of us will make 
            it known that there is no support in Scotland for going down the nuclear 
            road. Regardless of what the nuclear apologists might claim, nuclear 
            power is not green, clean or renewable.</P>

          <P>The Executive's targets for renewable energy production are a step 
            in the right direction, but we need to be even more ambitious if we 
            are to become a leading player in the renewable energy industry. Other 
            European nations are well ahead of us, which may be an answer to Phil 
            Gallie's question. For example, 29 per cent of Swedish electricity 
            generation comes from renewable sources. In Finland the figure is 
            22 per cent and in Austria it is 21 per cent. I want us to release 
            Scotland's massive potential for electricity production from renewable 
            sources and I would set a target for the production of electricity 
            from renewables at 25 per cent by 2010, with a progressive build-up 
            capacity leading up to 40 per cent by 2020.</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 
            (Lewis Macdonald): </strong>I hear what Roseanna Cunningham is saying. 
            In her view, is the best way of releasing that renewables potential 
            to make it easier to develop wind energy production or to make it 
            more difficult?</P>
          <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>The best way of doing it is 
            to ensure that the widest range of renewable energy technologies is 
            available to most people in Scotland.</P>
          <P>Understandably, new technologies inevitably take a while to become 
            commercially viable on a large scale. At present, apart from hydro 
            generation&#151;which is well established&#151;wind turbine generation 
            is the main commercially viable new renewable energy technology. As 
            such, it has an important contribution to make to the mix of Scotland's 
            energy generation, although it cannot be the only contributor.</P>
          <P>However, hostility is being created by the absence of clear, concise 
            and coherent national guidelines for the approval of wind farm sites. 
            Friends of the Earth thinks that such guidelines are necessary for 
            all renewable energy technologies, especially in view of their cumulative 
            impact. The publication of local guidelines on wind farms is welcome, 
            but the continuing silence of the Executive on proposals to generate 
            more than 50MW is causing untold damage. I have little doubt that 
            many of the more contentious proposals will be rejected, but the effect 
            of the cack-handed way in which the Executive has dealt with the whole 
            issue is that many individuals and communities will have had their 
            hackles raised by the system. There is a real danger that public support 
            for the wider case for wind farms and renewable energy will be undermined.</P>
          <P>Local communities and wind farm developments can get along together 
            beneficially. In Argyll, Scottish Power's first two wind farms have 
            contributed tens of thousands of pounds every year to community trust 
            funds. That is good news for those communities. The Executive should 
            be </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7700">7700</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>doing more to encourage all developers to recognise their responsibilities 
            towards local communities so that the communities can benefit from 
            developments on their doorstep.</P>
          <P>It would be better yet if the involvement of communities and individuals 
            in power generation came from the bottom up rather than from the top 
            down. At present, power generation is almost exclusively developer 
            led. I am aware of the Scottish community and householder renewables 
            initiative. Although it is early in the day to comment on its effectiveness, 
            I would like much more to be done to promote and assist community-led 
            renewable energy projects.</P>
          <P>At national level, we need to encourage the development of a wide 
            range of renewable technologies, for economic as well as environmental 
            reasons. The issue is not just about research and development funding, 
            but about investing in the industries.</P>
          <P>Murdo Fraser has already mentioned the Portuguese example. Portugal 
            is determined to become a market leader and is offering a level of 
            funding that provides a firm support framework for early technology. 
            In return, the Portuguese are understandably looking to attract companies 
            to establish manufacturing in Portugal. The worst-case scenario, which 
            we have to be careful to avoid, is one in which technologies that 
            are initially developed in Scotland by Scottish companies are used 
            to establish new industries in countries other than Scotland, such 
            as Portugal.</P>
          <P>We should be ambitious for Scotland, to the point that Scotland becomes 
            the first place that people think of when they think of renewable 
            energy innovations. We need to consider investing in a wide range 
            of renewable projects, including biomass, geothermals and hydrogen 
            fuel cells for the storage of energy. WWF Scotland believes that around 
            24,000 jobs could be created in the renewables industry. The industry 
            could therefore be very important economically for Scotland.</P>
          <P>I am aware that I have devoted the bulk of my speech to the importance 
            of renewable energy. However, we must not overlook the equivalent 
            importance of improving energy efficiency and addressing our continually 
            increasing demand for electricity. Unless we address that side of 
            the equation, all the good work done in setting and meeting targets 
            for renewable energy production&#151;regardless of whose targets we 
            choose&#151;will be cancelled out by increases in consumption.</P>
          <P>I do not doubt that most parties in the chamber desire to make Scotland 
            the green powerhouse of Europe. It is just a pity that the Scotland 
            Act 1998 reserves to Westminster the generation, transmission, distribution 
            and supply of electricity </div>

            energy development. If our country is to become a powerhouse, our 
            Parliament must become one, too. That will require independence.</P>
          <P>I move amendment S2M-1185.1, to leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; 
            to end and insert:</P>
          <P>&quot;recognises the contribution that both renewable energy and 
            energy efficiency make to tackling carbon emissions; further recognises 
            the importance of tackling climate change; agrees, therefore, to raise 
            the Scottish Executive's targets for generating increasing amounts 
            of electricity from renewable resources to 25% of electricity generation 
            capacity by 2010, 30% by 2015 and 50% by 2020; regrets that energy 
            policy is largely reserved to Westminster and rejects calls for an 
            expansion of the nuclear contribution to Scotland's electricity production; 
            acknowledges the important contribution that can be made by small-scale, 
            domestic and community-based renewable energy projects; notes the 
            recent growth in applications for wind farm developments and regrets 
            the absence of clear, concise and coherent guidelines for the approval 
            of such developments; acknowledges the long-term potential for the 
            development of renewable energy technologies, including the associated 
            economic benefits and rural regeneration and export opportunities, 
            and urges the Executive to ensure that these technologies are supported 
            beyond the research and development stage to ensure that Scotland 
            can become a world leader in renewable energy technologies.&quot;</P>
          <P>15:22</P>
          <p><strong>Murdo Fraser (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>I welcome 
            the opportunity to debate the Executive's policy on renewable energy 
            and to highlight its current policy failures. We also have the opportunity 
            to expose the gaping black hole at the heart of Executive policy, 
            which is the lack of any forward energy strategy.</P>
          <P>We have heard a lot from the Executive about its targets for renewable 
            energy&#151;18 per cent by 2010 and 40 per cent by 2020. However, 
            the Executive must be aware of growing scepticism about the achievability 
            of those targets. Some weeks ago, the former Labour energy minister, 
            Brian Wilson MP, questioned whether the targets were achievable. In 
            the briefing for today's debate, Unison, the trade union that is most 
            involved in the energy industry, says that it does not believe that 
            the 40 per cent target is achievable. The United Kingdom's leading 
            engineer, Sir Alec Broers, who is the president of the Royal Academy 
            of Engineering, has said that the UK targets are unrealistic.</P>
          <P>Notwithstanding the public scepticism, the Executive seems hell bent 
            on rushing ahead with its current strategy. However, that strategy 
            is not, sadly, a renewables strategy at all. All it seems to be about 
            is building wind farms right across rural Scotland. In the Deputy 
            First Minister's speech, there was hardly a mention of wind energy, 
            yet he must be aware of the widespread public concern </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7702">7702</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>about the development of wind farms. My colleague Ted Brocklebank 
            tells me of a plan in north-east Fife to build on Clatto hill 17 wind 
            turbines, each of them, at 93m, approximately the height of the statue 
            of Liberty.</P>
          <P>We know that there is a great deal of concern across the country. 
            Last week, a group of 11 Perthshire ladies made a unique protest against 
            what they regarded as over-scale wind farm developments in their area. 
            They performed &quot;The Full Monty&quot; strip for the cameras. Now, 
            it takes some courage to take one's clothes off in Perthshire in April 
            and I think that that shows the strength of feeling on this issue.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>Murdo Fraser has just exposed the complete 
            contradiction in his attack on the Executive. He said that we had 
            no strategy other than to promote wind farms and then he criticised 
            me for not referring to them. For the best part of 12 minutes, I described 
            a strategy of renewables development that barely mentioned wind power. 
            That just shows how wrong he is. We have a balanced strategy.</P>
          <p><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>We are always glad to hear from the 
            Deputy First Minister about the new technologies but I am surprised 
            that he did not address what seems to be at the core of the Executive's 
            current strategy, which is to develop onshore wind power.</P>
          <P>My criticism is not exclusively of the Executive. I listened with 
            great interest to Roseanna Cunningham. It is extraordinary that the 
            SNP is calling for an increase in targets that others are saying are 
            likely to be unachievable. All that increasing targets will do is 
            to increase pressure for more wind farms in rural areas. I cannot 
            believe that Roseanna Cunningham's constituents in rural Perthshire 
            will welcome the prospect of yet more wind farm applications. The 
            Executive is trying to meet its targets exclusively from onshore wind, 
            and is using its planning policies to stamp on local opinion.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Mark Ruskell (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Green): </strong>Will 
            the member give way?</P>
          <p><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>In a second.</P>
          <P>The deputy minister, who will be responding to the debate, is fond 
            of quoting surveys at me that show that the public are generally in 
            favour of wind power. I have no doubt that, if I were to walk down 
            a residential street in Morningside and knock on the doors, I would 
            find almost unanimous support for wind power. However, if I were to 
            propose building a wind farm on the top of Arthur's seat or the Braid 
            hills, I could guarantee that that public opinion would shift overnight. 
            It is all very easy for Labour members, in the main representing urban 
            constituencies, to support the building of wind farms in rural Scotland&#151;they 
            do not have to </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7703">7703</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>answer to their constituents for that. May I suggest that, before 
            those Labour members become too enthusiastic about wind turbines, 
            they speak to people living in rural communities?</P>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab): </strong>Speaking 
            as a representative of Edinburgh&#151;but not, I hasten to add, Morningside&#151;I 
            suggest to the member that, if he were doing such a survey, it would 
            be an awful lot more useful to offer people the prospect of photovoltaic 
            cells and mini-wind vanes, which represent a huge opportunity that 
            we have not even begun to explore in Scotland. That is where Labour 
            members are putting their energy in urban areas.</P>
          <p><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>If that means that the member will 
            join me in opposing large-scale rural wind farm developments, I am 
            delighted to hear it.</P>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack </strong><em>indicated disagreement.</em></p>
          <p><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>The member is shaking her head. Sadly 
            for the Executive, its single-minded approach to developing onshore 
            wind is already looking out of date. The tide is starting to turn 
            against onshore wind development. Last month's report from the Royal 
            Academy of Engineering was extremely sceptical about the benefits 
            of wind power, making the case that wind generation is two and a half 
            times more expensive than conventional generation. It is more expensive 
            than nuclear energy, even if the cost of decommissioning is included. 
            Tonight, the David Hume Institute is launching Professor David Simpson's 
            paper, which is another contribution to the debate. It, too, argues 
            that nuclear power is half the price of wind power and it maintains 
            that the drive to establish onshore wind represents a stealth tax.</P>
          <P>I know that there are economic benefits from wind generation and 
            I would not rule it out completely. I have seen the jobs that have 
            been created at Campbeltown and elsewhere. The sad fact is, however, 
            that all the focus on onshore wind is leading to neglect of other 
            renewables technologies. Like other members, I would like a greater 
            focus on hydro power, on tide and wave power and on biomass. There 
            are opportunities to develop those technologies if we tweak systems 
            such as the renewables obligation certificates.</P>
          <P>Even if the Executive meets its ambitious targets, there is now serious 
            doubt about whether its programme is achievable without blanketing 
            the entire countryside in wind turbines. We still have a black hole 
            at the heart of the Executive's policy. Every existing conventional 
            power station in Scotland is coming towards the end of its natural 
            life. We should be planning now for the next generation of non-renewable 
            power generation. That means power from gas, coal and nuclear. It 
            is not often that I agree with Unison, but in its </div>

          <P>briefing for the debate it made the excellent point that the Scottish 
            Executive should be adopting a balanced energy strategy, which includes 
            a mix of generating capacity. That would include a larger element 
            of renewables, when proven capacity can be delivered, together with 
            gas, coal and nuclear power. Unison is absolutely right.</P>
          <P>The Executive's current strategy is seriously flawed. Unless it is 
            prepared to consider the issues that I have highlighted, the lights 
            will be going out across Scotland because of the lack of energy production. 
            It is time for the Executive to work with the Westminster Government

          <P>&quot;notes the increasing scepticism about the achievability of 
            the Scottish Executive's targets for renewable energy from a number 
            of sources, including former Energy Minister Brian Wilson MP and UNISON; 
            further notes the publication of reports from the Royal Academy of 
            Engineers and Professor David Simpson of the David Hume Institute 
            on the costs of wind power generation as against other generation 
            methods; regrets the current rush to develop onshore wind capacity 
            to the exclusion of other technologies such as hydro, wave, tidal 
            and biomass, and calls on the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's 
            Government to work together to develop an energy strategy for Scotland 
            which will include a mix of generating capacity, with components from 
            renewables, gas, coal and nuclear power.&quot;</P>

          <p><strong>Shiona Baird (North East Scotland) (Green): </strong>We have 
            a cavalier attitude towards our use of electricity and take notice 
            only when the power supply fails. Even now, when most scientists accept 
            the reality of climate change and are now talking about the timescale 
            and the implications, neither the general public nor businesses are 
            showing any real concern. Reducing our demand for electricity must 
            be a top priority, with energy efficiency playing a huge part. The 
            Energy Saving Trust has calculated that greater household efficiency 
            could save 120 terawatt hours of energy and 8 million tonnes of carbon 
            across the United Kingdom by 2010.</P>
          <P>The Executive must set mandatory energy efficiency targets. Improved 
            building standards for new-build homes and business properties are 
            vital if we are to ensure that all new developments are at least as 
            energy efficient as the best in the world. It is not easy to address 
            energy efficiency in existing buildings, but much more can and must 
            be done to prevent the massive wastage of electricity through poorly 
            insulated buildings. Even in Scotland, it is possible to build homes 
            and offices that require no heating.</P>

          <p></P>
          <P>We must understand that electricity makes up only 20 per cent of 
            Scotland's energy use; the remainder of the energy is used by transport, 
            industry and non-electrical heating. If that situation remained the 
            same, even if 100 per cent of our electricity came from renewable 
            sources, 80 per cent of our energy would still come primarily from 
            dirty fossil fuels. Oil is not renewable. At present, we use four 
            barrels of oil for each new barrel that is discovered. The economics 
            of extraction cause concern, especially in Scotland, where economic 
            oil extraction is expected to peak in 2010, which is just six years 
            away. However, we do not have to wait until the oil runs out. To paraphrase 
            Sheikh Yamani, the stone age ended not because we ran out of stone, 
            but because we came up with something better. Let us not kid ourselves 
            that nuclear power has anything to offer: it is a dirty, unsustainable 
            and hideously uneconomic power source.</P>
          <P>Should we wait for oil prices to rocket and thereby forfeit fuel 
            security by looking abroad for our oil needs, or should we take action 
            now to develop alternatives? Alternatives such as biofuel and hydrogen 
            fuel cells are being developed by enterprising companies in Scotland. 
            Do Scottish Enterprise and the Executive encourage and support those 
            companies?</P>
          <p><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Does Shiona Baird accept that the nuclear 
            generation industry is the safest electricity generation industry, 
            both worldwide and in the UK? Does she accept that the industry does 
            not emit noxious gases of any kind? Does she accept that nuclear is 
            the most reliable power source that we have? She is always complaining 
            about the cost of fuel for old folk, but they depend on the nuclear 
            output at many critical times.</P>
          <p><strong>Shiona Baird: </strong>Phil Gallie asks three questions; 
            my answers are no, no and no. Has he forgotten about Chernobyl? We 
            are still suffering the effects of that disaster, which I think happened 
            about 17 or 18 years ago.</P>
          <p><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>What about the UK?</P>
          <p><strong>Shiona Baird: </strong>The effects of Chernobyl came across 
            to the UK.</P>
          <P>The Executive has the vision to look two decades ahead and it has 
            set an ambitious target for renewable energy. Some doubt that that 
            target is achievable, but it is achievable if the will exists. The 
            target must be achieved if we are to have any chance of reversing 
            the worst excesses of climate change.</P>
          <P>Scotland has huge resources. The potential output from four tidal 
            stream locations around Orkney could be 34.2TWh, which is around 8 
            per cent of current UK electrical generating capacity. To our shame, 
            we have a long way to go before we can realise even a fraction of 
            that enormous </div>

          <P>potential. To date, only around 200MW of installed capacity has been 
            built in Scotland, although the Executive estimates that there is 
            the potential for 11.5 gigawatts of onshore wind capacity, which means 
            that we have only scratched the surface of what is possible. Offshore, 
            the potential is even greater.</P>
          <P>What is the Executive doing to show its commitment to the environment 
            through the economy? If we manufactured all the turbines that are 
            required for onshore and, ultimately, offshore wind farms, that would 
            provide a great benefit for the Scottish economy. We lost the initiative 
            in the 1980s, when Howden of Glasgow was given no support, but we 
            have not learned the lesson. The world's first wave-powered farm is 
            being set up in Portugal. How can the Executive have allowed that 
            to happen?</P>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Does Ms Baird accept that the success 
            of a Scottish renewables company in exporting its product to Portugal, 
            which is one of our potential competitors, is a good sign of how far 
            ahead we are in the area of technology concerned?</P>
          <p><strong>Shiona Baird: </strong>Both Portugal and Ireland have provided 
            favourable market incentives, unlike us. While we have been sitting 
            around talking, our European competitors have been getting on and 
            making things happen. Portugal already has a grid connection in place 
            in the Bay of Biscay; we do not even have grid capacity. My answer 
            to Lewis Macdonald's point is that Portugal will soon want the economic 
            benefit of building machines out there. The potential loss to the 
            Scottish economy does not bear thinking about.</P>
          <P>Ocean Power Delivery&#151;the company that is behind the successful 
            wave energy converter&#151;demonstrates all that is best in a smart, 
            successful business, and what does the Executive do? Not a lot and 
            that is done too late. I ask members to support our amendment.</P>
          <P>I move amendment S2M-1185.3, to leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; 
            to end and insert:</P>
          <P>&quot;believes that the Scottish Executive can play a much more significant 
            role in tackling climate change by encouraging reductions in energy 
            use through greater energy efficiency and by achieving a greater shift 
            in energy use from fossil fuels to renewable sources, whilst at the 
            same time creating sustainable 'green' jobs; welcomes the targets 
            set by the Executive for generation of 40% of electricity from renewable 
            sources but notes that this amounts to only about 8% of Scotland's 
            total energy use; recognises that a study commissioned by the Executive 
            shows that the energy potential from renewable energy in Scotland 
            is as much as 60 gigawatts and therefore that renewable energy has 
            a massive potential to supply energy, not only for electricity but 
            also for fuels; further recognises that Scotland leads the world in 
            research and development of wave energy converters; is gravely concerned 
            that the first order for wave converters has come from outside Scotland 
            and that the potential for a </div>

          <P>manufacturing industry for wave converters may be lost to Scotland 
            because of insufficient market incentives, and therefore calls on 
            the Executive to set concrete targets for energy efficiency, to publish 
            an action plan, including targets, for renewable energy to supply 
            non-electrical uses and to improve market-based incentives for emerging 
            renewable energy technologies.&quot;</P>
          <P>15:35</P>
          <p><strong>Richard Baker (North East Scotland) (Lab): </strong>The Executive's 
            targets to increase electricity generation from renewable sources 
            are ambitious but achievable, and we are making progress towards them 
            by investing in and encouraging the renewable energy industry and 
            some of the technologies to which Shiona Baird referred. The industry 
            has huge potential not only for creating a Scotland of cleaner energy 
            production, but for allowing us to reap the rewards of its development 
            in economic benefit and job creation if we continue to provide the 
            right support.</P>
          <P>Of course, a wide-ranging debate will take place about the right 
            mix of future energy production to ensure a secure supply and lower 
            carbon emissions. As I am sure that we will hear from other members, 
            an important role remains for more established electricity generation 
            methods.</P>
          <P>We have heard before in the chamber from those who are worried about 
            reliance on wind power because they fear that its energy supply may 
            be intermittent. I have heard during the Enterprise and Culture Committee's 
            inquiry that our future mix of energy generation will be able to deal 
            with intermittency. More concerning is the intermittent support from 
            some Opposition parties for renewable energy developments. SNP and 
            Tory MSPs give us warm words about how they want more renewable energy 
            production, but they oppose specific wind farm proposals. The Tories 
            even propose a national moratorium on wind farm developments. Such 
            attitudes, which are based on political opportunism, will not secure 
            progress on renewable energy.</P>
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson: </strong>Has the member asked Mr Iain Smith of 
            the Liberal Democrats or Dr Elaine Murray of the Labour Party what 
            their attitude was to two recent wind farm applications in their areas?</P>
          <p><strong>Richard Baker: </strong>I have not spoken to them about those 
            proposals. I am talking about the Executive's strategy as a whole&#151;that 
            is what the motion refers to. What the SNP's amendment says about 
            wind farm planning applications contradicts the SNP's overall strategy 
            of having more ambitious renewable energy targets. The member must 
            examine that contradiction.</P>
          <P>The Executive's strategy is in contrast to the other parties' political 
            opportunism, because it is based on encouraging the development of 
        </div>

          <P>experimental new technologies and supporting technologies that are 
            in the marketplace. It does that successfully through the programme 
            of renewable obligation certificates.</P>
          <P>Making progress now on developing our renewable energy is not only 
            an environmental imperative. It is not simply part of a green agenda, 
            worthy as that might be; it is an economic imperative, too. Debates 
            may take place over the aesthetics of wind farms, and planning processes 
            should be sensitive to several factors, including the environmental 
            impact of proposals. I am sure that Dr Murray would have referred 
            to such matters. We hear often from a small but vocal group of people, 
            regularly including the Tories, who oppose wind farms and specific 
            developments.</P>
          <P>When the Enterprise and Culture Committee visited Campbeltown, we 
            heard about the extremely positive impact that the wind farm there 
            is having on the local economy. It is providing vital jobs for local 
            people in an area where they are greatly needed.</P>
          <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>Mr Baker 
            must be aware of the enormous economic benefit that nuclear facilities 
            have provided to their communities not only in Scotland, but elsewhere 
            in the United Kingdom. As a Labour member of the Executive, will he 
            undertake that the Labour group will not allow the Liberal Democrats 
            to determine energy policy and rule out nuclear power?</P>
          <p><strong>Richard Baker: </strong>I would not want the Labour group 
            to be dictated to by anybody, and certainly not on such an issue. 
            I am sure that John Home Robertson will refer to the matters that 
            Mr Mundell mentioned. I am talking about the benefits of renewable 
            energy and I want to make progress on describing what we can achieve 
            with that.</P>
          <P>We could bring great benefits to our economy by investing in developing 
            renewable energy technologies. Tidal energy is a particularly exciting 
            development because of its potential to provide a predictable energy 
            supply. In particular, I want to refer to offshore technologies, which 
            are not being neglected&#151;they are being invested in. The Executive 
            has recognised their potential in the funding that it has given to 
            research projects, such as the £2 million that was given to the European 
            Marine Energy Centre in Orkney, and the intermediary technology institute 
            for energy in Aberdeen will help us to consider how we can diversify 
            current skills and resources in the oil and gas sector into developing 
            offshore renewables.</P>
          <P>The Executive has also supported the development of offshore wind 
            through a research grant for the plans to develop Europe's first deep 
            offshore wind farm. Those plans propose to place some 200 turbines 
            on existing platforms in the </div>

          <P>Beatrice oilfield, and there is the potential to generate around 
            half of the new generation that is needed to meet the Executive's 
            40 per cent target for 2020. In Scotland, we have some of the world's 
            leading expertise in new technologies for marine and tidal energy, 
            at universities such as the Robert Gordon University. That is no accident, 
            but part of the Executive's strategy for funding research. I hope 
            that that funding can be backed up by the Scottish Higher Education 
            Funding Council looking to fund more marine energy research in our 
            universities, because, by capitalising on the development of such 
            technology in Scotland, we can be Europe's leaders in the industry.</P>
          <P>I was pleased to see that the forum for renewable energy development 
            in Scotland has set up a marine energy sub-group, and that meetings 
            are to take place with people who are developing the marine energy 
            sector in Portugal, to which Murdo Fraser and others have referred. 
            Indeed, we heard much about that matter during the committee's inquiry. 
            We must ensure that we are in a position to capitalise on the expertise 
            that we have in Scotland and ensure that the skills and infrastructure 
            that have made Aberdeen the energy capital of Europe can be applied 
            to successful new industry, with new ways of developing energy that 
            will go beyond the lifespan of the oil and gas industry.</P>
          <P>The minister has rightly stated that Scotland has the greatest marine 
            energy potential in Europe and the Executive has welcomed reports 
            that 35,000 jobs could be created throughout the United Kingdom in 
            the renewable energy industry by 2020. Nearly 2,000 people are currently 
            employed in the industry in Scotland. The committee's inquiry heard 
            from the Scottish Renewables Forum that as many as 24,000 jobs could 
            be created through marine and tidal energy production in Scotland 
            alone by 2015.</P>
          <P>That is why I am pleased that the Executive is investing in developing 
            marine energy, which represents the great potential of the renewable 
            energy industry as a whole, not only to improve our environment, but 
            to benefit our economy and create jobs. It is also why I lament the 
            timid support and confused strategies for developing renewable energy 
            that are displayed in the Opposition amendments, why I applaud the 
            Executive's bold strategy of developing renewable energy and why I 
            support the Executive's motion.</P>

          <P>energy. I hope that I can touch on one or two issues without either 
            pre-empting what the committee's report will say or straying from 
            my neutrality as convener of the committee.</P>
          <P>It is all too easy to concentrate on electricity generation or electricity 
            consumption, as much of the debate has done, rather than on energy 
            use as whole. Even in Scotland, I think that around 80 per cent of 
            household energy is used on space heating and a substantial proportion 
            of that space heating, of course, does not use electricity&#151;other 
            fuels, such as oil or gas, are used.</P>
          <P>Some members of the Enterprise and Culture Committee recently paid 
            a visit to Denmark and had the opportunity to visit a large power 
            station on the outskirts of Copenhagen. Apart from seeing what electricity 
            that power station produced, it was fascinating to see that the hot 
            water that is produced as a by-product, if you like, was used in combined 
            heat and power systems. I think that hot water was being pumped as 
            far as 25km to 30km away from the power station to heat district power 
            systems in various municipalities. In this country, where we have 
            a fairly mature housing infrastructure, the back installation of large 
            numbers of district heating systems would be an expensive operation, 
            although that is clearly possible in new developments&#151;I think 
            that a member has already alluded to that.</P>
          <P>The other fascinating aspect of the power station was the amount 
            of co-firing that was used. The basic fuel was, or had been, natural 
            gas, but it was fired along with straw and wood pellets. Local farmers 
            brought in bales of straw, which were then piled in the warehouse 
            to be fed into the boiler of the power station. Both straw and woodchips 
            are sustainable and renewable fuels, as well as being CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
            neutral. The use of woodchip pellets was particularly instructive. 
            The pellets are, in effect, a previous waste product from furniture 
            manufacture in Denmark. That is particularly relevant in the light 
            of Scotland's substantial production of timber, which is due to reach 
            a peak in the near future. The ability to use a fuel that is both 
            renewable and locally obtainable must be a substantial attraction, 
            which we should exploit.</P>
          <P>Given what I said about the proportion of energy that we use for 
            space heating, we must realise how attractive it is to use wood fuel 
            in boilers, particularly in large buildings such as swimming pools, 
            schools or hospitals. For every 100 tonnes of timber that we process, 
            we produce 45 tonnes of sawdust, bark and woodchip, which do not have 
            much of a market or sell at a high price, so the attraction of being 
            able to use that material is high. The idea is particularly appealing 
            in Scotland's rural areas, where we produce so much timber. We have 
            all that fuel sitting on our doorstep and if we could use it, we would 
            not have to bring in </div>

          <P>tankers of liquid propane gas or whatever other fuel to use in our 
            boilers.</P>
          <P>When we visited the Vestas-Celtic Wind Technology plant at Campbeltown, 
            I took the opportunity to drop into the swimming pool at Lochgilphead, 
            which uses precisely that method. [<em>Laughter.</em>] Fortunately, 
            it was only the boiler room of the swimming pool that I dropped into. 
            It was fascinating to see the use of wood fuel at the swimming pool; 
            virtually no ash was produced, the boiler ran seamlessly with little 
            intervention and used fuel that was produced only a few miles away, 
            and no pollution whatsoever was produced.</P>
          <P>The problem with getting manufacturers to install such equipment 
            is that they are far happier with the conventional, safe option. That 
            is a particular problem in private-public partnership and private 
            finance initiative schemes, in which the choice of method of firing 
            the boilers is left to the contractor rather than to the local council. 
            The Executive must encourage that kind of technology a bit more, perhaps 
            by considering the use of capital grants, so that we can make it a 
            more economic option. The benefits that wood fuel can deliver to the 
            community, to the environment and to the local forest industry, which 
            is often hard pressed because of international prices, are significant.</P>

          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab): </strong>I want very 
            much to support the Executive's motion; to endorse the targets that 
            it has set out; to support the progress that has been made so far, 
            particularly in hydro and wind generation; to identify the importance 
            of long-term development of new renewable technologies; and to ensure 
            that energy efficiency is part of the process. The importance that 
            the Parliament has attached to renewable energy will be one of our 
            big achievements and is one of the things that will distinguish the 
            establishment of this Parliament.</P>
          <P>The renewable energy industry is good news for Scotland. It is good 
            news for research and development in universities and companies. It 
            is good news for manufacturing and jobs. It is very good news for 
            social justice&#151;one of the things that I would add to Jim Wallace's 
            list of five objectives is that we should tackle fuel poverty and 
            end the scandal of people in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century living in 
            homes that are unfit for them. Renewable energy has something to add 
            in that regard. The industry is also good news for the environment, 
            a subject to which I will return.</P>
          <P>Renewables do not add to our climate-change problems, they do not 
            create pollution and they do not create waste and security problems 
            that last for many generations to come. For those good </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>reasons, we should think seriously about using renewables.</P>
          <P>We have made progress, partly because we have made renewable energy 
            a political priority across the chamber. I hope that we do not lose 
            that in today's debate. Work has been done at ministerial level on 
            the setting of targets, new research technology is being developed 
            in Aberdeen and Orkney, as Richard Baker mentioned, and the new FREDS 
            has been established.</P>
          <P>However, we need to maintain overall political support. I accept 
            absolutely that people do not have to sign up to every development 
            regardless of their party, but we will take no lectures from the Tories 
            on renewables. The suggestion that the current success in the development 
            of wind power has been achieved at the exclusion of other types of 
            renewables is ludicrous and totally wrong, and the facts do not bear 
            it out. Let us not forget why the wave-power approach was abandoned&#151;it 
            was because the Tories withdrew support for it. They were in charge 
            for 18 years and research into wave power was abandoned at the precise 
            point at which the Danes developed a world-class wind-power industry. 
            That is why Scotland is now playing catch-up and why we are way behind 
            Denmark, Spain, Germany and Japan. We need to have ambitious targets 
            and to give them political support.</P>
          <P>It is vital that we have a range of different projects. For example, 
            our new and refurbished hydro power systems will mean that we will 
            meet the 18 per cent target for renewables by 2010. We also have a 
            series of biomass projects; although we do not have enough of them, 
            we know that the technology works and that it can provide good power. 
            Moreover, across Scotland, many small-scale combined heat and power 
            and solar projects are being developed with practical financial support 
            from the Executive. Let us not pretend that such work is not being 
            done.</P>
          <P>There is a long distance between innovation and the mass application 
            of some of the technologies and the Executive must focus its energies 
            in that area. That is why the 40 per cent target is crucial. The target 
            needs to be ambitious. After all, we need vision and big thinking 
            if we are to lift off from our current position. On this occasion, 
            the Executive is giving us that kind of thinking.</P>
          <P>I say to the SNP and the Tories that that does not mean that we will 
            never have to make difficult decisions. Indeed, we cannot avoid such 
            decisions. Wave and tidal energy developments are not without their 
            problems and will have potential environmental impacts. As a result, 
            we need an appropriate planning and environmental impact assessment 
            framework.</P>

          <P>Roseanna Cunningham's speech was much more measured than those that 
            we have heard in the past from the SNP. However, I must tell her that 
            we have concise and coherent guidelines that make it clear that the 
            issue of cumulative impact should be taken into account in every decision. 
            I welcome Scottish Natural Heritage's work to assist that process, 
            because it will result in better decisions and more information.</P>
          <P>Local authorities have the democratic job of ensuring that their 
            communities are fully involved in such decisions and are able to get 
            into the detail of the projects. Central Government cannot resolve 
            that critical issue. For example, although 17 wind vanes in an installation 
            might be perfectly well located, the 18<SUP>th</SUP> might be in the 
            wrong place. Such a situation will be resolved not by diktats from 
            ministers in central Government, but by the power companies, RSPB 
            Scotland, the local authorities and so on sitting down together and 
            bashing things out. We need that range of decision making.</P>
          <P>We must support the 40 per cent target, and some excellent work is 
            being done in that regard. However, it is not enough simply to consider 
            renewable energy; we must also think about the way in which we use 
            energy and energy efficiency. In that respect, I was amazed to find 
            myself agreeing with almost all of Alasdair Morgan's speech, which 
            makes it clear that there is consensus across the chamber.</P>
          <P>Having said that, I disagree with Alasdair Morgan on one point. There 
            is no reason why PPP and long-term contracts cannot include provisions 
            for energy efficiency and the use of renewables. Not including such 
            provisions is a cop-out for companies and local authorities and the 
            Scottish Executive should be making them key. Such contracts, with 
            their 30-year life span, could capture aspects such as reducing carbon 
            emissions and energy saving. Indeed, provisions on those aspects should 
            be embedded in the contracts for every school and hospital project. 
            I hope that the minister will tell us when he winds up how the Executive 
            intends to deliver on that issue.</P>
          <P>15:53</P>
          <p><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con): </strong>I am afraid that I might 
            be the one to break up the consensus in the chamber this afternoon. 
            First, I declare my support for Murdo Fraser's amendment, which introduces 
            to the debate on renewable energy and energy efficiency a new level 
            of realism that is sadly lacking on the Government and SNP benches.</P>
          <P>It is important to have this debate, because the value of renewable 
            energy is being called into question not just in Scotland but world-wide. 
            The benefits of wind farms are being called into </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7714">7714</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>question even more and perhaps it is time for the Executive to acknowledge 
            that thinking other than its own on this subject might be equally 
            valid.</P>
          <P>At its simplest, wind farming is a fine idea. As a source of energy, 
            it means that we get something for nothing when the wind blows. However, 
            when the wind does not blow we are left without an energy source, 
            which means that we need a back-up source. As a result, we need to 
            build two energy systems to support one unreliable system. Such a 
            national approach is at best uneconomic and at worst the economics 
            of Alice in Wonderland. The greater our dependence on wind energy, 
            the greater the prospect of grid instability. In layman's terms, that 
            means blackouts.</P>
          <p><strong>Alasdair Morgan: </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
          <p><strong>John Scott: </strong>I would rather not, because I have a 
            lot to get on with.</P>
          <P>Because of their high level of dependence on wind energy, countries 
            such as Denmark and &Eacute;ire already suffer from grid instability. 
            We in Scotland should not be putting ourselves into the same situation 
            simply because the Executive has not thought through the consequences 
            of its intended actions. I am not being totally negative; after all, 
            we cannot totally discount the benefits of renewables such as wind 
            energy.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Ruskell: </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
          <p><strong>John Scott: </strong>No.</P>
          <P>We need to develop constant and predictable energy sources such as 
            tidal power and biofuels. Other renewables such as solar energy and 
            wave energy require the sun to shine or the wind to blow and they 
            can only ever be bonuses. That is why it is self-evident that if we 
            are going to strengthen the grid, we must not just serve the current 
            rush to support wind farms. We must support the longer-term development 
            of tidal power, which is one of the potentially dependable renewables; 
            the others are not dependable.</P>
          <P>If we must have wind farms, they should be located appropriately 
            near the area in which tidal currents are most likely to be harvested. 
            That is the only sensible way in which to strengthen the grid.</P>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Become obsessed with one type of renewable 
            energy misses the point. Even with tidal power, there can be environmental 
            impacts. Although tidal power is predictable, it is not constant so 
            there still has to be a mix of sources. To rest on tidal energy would 
            be a huge mistake for Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>John Scott: </strong>If the member was listening to what 
            I said, she will know that I did not say that we should do that. I 
            said that wind energy is a bonus, </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7715">7715</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>tidal energy is predictable and biofuels are entirely predictable.</P>
          <P>We need a more joined-up approach from Government. Commentators such 
            as John Campbell and the Royal Academy of Engineering are rightly 
            demanding not just that we take a strategic approach to planning, 
            but that we take a strategic and thought-through approach to delivering 
            a secure energy supply. At the moment, we are getting neither from 
            the UK Government or the Scottish Executive.</P>
          <P>That is why the Conservatives have argued for some time that realistic 
            and transparent decisions have to be taken now to secure our future 
            electricity supply. That is why we have to develop a balanced mix 
            of energy sources and why we cannot let our coal, gas and nuclear 
            power stations run down. If the minister will not listen to us, perhaps 
            he will listen to Unison, whose excellent briefing paper hit the nail 
            on the head, and the former minister Allan Wilson, who has long taken 
            a realistic approach to the question.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab): </strong>Has 
            he been sacked then?</P>
          <p><strong>John Scott: </strong>I beg your pardon. I meant Brian Wilson. 
            I thank the member for the correction, although I suspect that Allan 
            Wilson's sympathies go in that direction as well.</P>
          <P>No major economic country in Europe&#151;by that I mean France, Germany 
            and Spain&#151;depends or has plans to depend on renewables to the 
            extent that we aim to do in Scotland. Once again, the Scottish Executive 
            is out of step with commonsense thinking elsewhere in the world. That 
            is why I said in Parliament on 11 February that we have to start replacing 
            our coal-fired and gas-fired plants now. We must replace nuclear with 
            nuclear, coal with coal, and gas with gas if we want to remain a net 
            exporter of electricity. Renewable energy sources will be a welcome 
            bonus, but only that.</P>
          <P>The First Minister will not want to be remembered only for his kilt 
            sense or for avoiding taking the necessary decisions to secure our 
            future energy supplies. He must make the commonsense decisions now. 
            That is why I urge Parliament to support the Conservative amendment 
            today.</P>

            say that we must pay heed to the base-load, but I am not persuaded 
            in any way by the nuclear lobby that its solution is the only solution. 
            Its solution has all sorts of long-term implications, not least of 
            which are the accidents that have already occurred. The impact of 
            those accidents still </div>

          <P>lingers in Scotland today, in the lambs that cannot come to market 
            from the southern uplands because of Chernobyl. As a result of that 
            accident, it will be many years before we can bring future generations 
            of lambs to market.</P>
          <P>However, we have to address the problems with the base-load. A decision 
            will soon have to be reached about what we are going to do with Longannet 
            and Cockenzie. Those decisions cannot be put off much longer, because 
            if we are to continue down the route of having a mix of power sources 
            that includes fossil fuels, particularly coal, significant investments 
            will be required to bring them up to the standard that will deliver 
            reasonably clean power. We have to do that and Longannet&#151;if not 
            Cockenzie&#151;has to be able to deliver reasonably clean energy. 
            The route to that is through coal firing.</P>
          <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North East Scotland) (Con): </strong>Given 
            that the motivation for the debate and our action on renewable energy 
            is the long-term impact of the burning of fossil fuels, does Mr Adam 
            accept that nuclear is not the only technology that leaves us with 
            a long-term waste problem?</P>
          <p><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>Let me develop my point on the use of 
            fossil fuels. We need to have coal firing and schemes are in place 
            to encourage it. Indeed, it is to the Executive's credit that it has 
            recently improved such schemes. However, perhaps we need to think 
            much bigger. We need a significant base-load provision, not all of 
            which should come from gas. We should consider not only using straw 
            or its by-products but, what is perhaps more controversial, addressing 
            our waste problems in the same way that we address the by-products 
            of our timber industry. We are increasing the mix of available renewables, 
            but the pace at which that is happening is disappointing.</P>
          <P>We need to give clear signals that we want to broaden the base of 
            renewable energy. There is a perception out there&#151;real or otherwise&#151;that 
            renewable energy means wind, wind and more wind. I do not object to 
            the principle of wind power, but it seems to be the main route for 
            the Executive's delivery of its aspirational targets. The SNP has 
            been criticised for having even more ambitious targets, but there 
            is nothing wrong in aiming at high targets. The issue is how we get 
            there and how we encourage changes in the energy industry.</P>
          <P>I want to talk about the fuel-cell contribution that we could see. 
            Fuel cells exist now; there are practical applications now and they 
            are available now. Part of the fuel-cell industry's problem is that 
            it cannot grow the market fast enough to get the unit cost down. It 
            is not looking for direct subsidies for the companies themselves. 
            Rather, the industry wants those who are procuring new equipment as 
            part of the major investment in </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7717">7717</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>public services to be given subsidies to encourage that type of development. 
            However, the PPP approach discourages that. We must consider how we 
            can deliver sustainable energy requirements through public procurement, 
            and one way of doing that is to write it into a contract. If we wish 
            to encourage diversity in fuel sources, we should make available options 
            such as pilot schemes, and subsidies should go to such schemes rather 
            than directly to companies. That is what the fuel-cell industry is 
            telling me.</P>
          <P>I recently visited a fuel-cell company in my constituency&#151;siGEN 
            Ltd&#151;that is doing exciting work, some of which is small scale. 
            For example, the company is considering taking some of the heavy batteries 
            out of motorised wheelchairs and replacing them with hydrogen technology.</P>
          <P>We have the possibility of linking several of the available new technologies, 
            but we need encouragement for that. I commend the SNP amendment to 
            the Parliament.</P>

          <p><strong>John Farquhar Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West) (LD): 
            </strong>I welcome the debate, especially as the David Hume Institute 
            has come out this week in support of expanding the nuclear power industry 
            in Britain. I condemn its short-sighted report and view and I have 
            questions about who funded its research.</P>
          <P>The Executive must hold the line and approve as many renewables projects 
            as possible, although doing so sometimes involves difficult decisions. 
            If the Executive does not forge ahead with more approvals, we will 
            soon face the ominous threat of new-build nuclear facilities in this 
            country. It is frustrating that all those who object to wind farms 
            are, in effect, foot soldiers for the nuclear lobby. It is important 
            that wind farm developers address people's valid concerns in order 
            to minimise the impact of wind farm schemes, but we must recognise 
            that the majority of objectors to wind farm schemes&#151;who are usually 
            also the most vocal&#151;do not live or work in the locality, or really 
            understand how a scheme will fit into the landscape. The objections 
            are often ill informed and reflect an exaggerated perception of what 
            the wind farm will actually be like; indeed, I believe that many objections 
            are based on dislike of change and a wish to preserve the countryside 
            in aspic, rather than have it as a place where real people live and 
            make their livings.</P>
          <P>Wind farms, incidentally, are not the only victims of that type of 
            attitude. I cite as examples in my constituency two hydro scheme proposals&#151;which 
            I have supported over the years&#151;one of which extended for a period 
            of some 12 years. One proposal was for a kilometre-long dam; it would 
            be </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7718">7718</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>about half the length of the Royal Mile and about as high as the 
            spires above this building. The other proposal was for a weir that 
            would be 2.5m high&#151;about as high as the height of the head of 
            the Presiding Officer in his chair. One was to be built in a special 
            protection area and the other was to be built in a national scenic 
            area.</P>
          <P>One of the proposals has been turned down, while the other recently 
            took another step towards approval. Which one do members think was 
            turned down? The answer is that it was the smaller scheme, because 
            it faced a concerted and highly organised campaign from objectors, 
            many of whom were from outwith the area. The other proposal, which 
            is considerably larger, has faced almost no opposition, despite its 
            size. Of course, all schemes should be assessed on their merits, but 
            I am concerned that, in the application that was refused, the Executive 
            decision has been influenced by the force of the campaign against 
            the smaller proposal.</P>
          <P>My view is that both projects were worthy of approval. The Executive 
            must be aware that groups and objectors are, increasingly, able to 
            mount what appear to be huge public campaigns. The reality is that 
            often the silent majority in the communities actually support renewable 
            energy schemes and we must not let that silent majority be drowned 
            out by the vocal minority.</P>
          <P>We have heard several members mention the fact that Scotland has 
            a wonderful natural resource and the possibility of our becoming the 
            world leader in renewable energy. We have wind, wave and tidal energy 
            in abundance, so let us grasp the opportunity now for the benefit 
            of generations to come.</P>
          <P>16:08</P>
          <p><strong>Christine May (Central Fife) (Lab): </strong>I start by saying 
            that I support the Executive motion in full. No one seriously doubts 
            the need for renewable energy or the economic potential that it represents 
            through fabrication, for example at the Kvaerner yard in Methil, and 
            through technology development. The Executive, the minister and their 
            counterparts down south have done well in setting a severe target&#151;but 
            about which I am not sceptical&#151;which will encourage the industry 
            in Scotland.</P>
          <P>Although we welcome almost unreservedly the drive to generate as 
            much energy as possible from renewables, it is not an either/or case, 
            as the Tory motion suggests. It is important that we do not forget 
            about our remaining energy needs, which must be generated by more 
            conventional methods. In the interests of taking the debate forward, 
            I want to talk about the potential for achieving our climate change 
            targets through </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>changes to conventional generation methods as well as through the 
            use of renewables. That means that we cannot discount the nuclear 
            option out of hand, nor can we risk our energy future by relying on 
            foreign gas supplies from less stable parts of the world. We need 
            as wide a mix as possible, so that if there is a problem with one 
            type of energy we can transfer demand to an alternative source. If 
            that is locally derived, so much the better. I agree with what Alasdair 
            Morgan said about the evidence that we saw in Denmark.</P>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab): </strong>Does Christine 
            May accept that, until some solution is found to the problem of what 
            we do with nuclear waste, there is nothing to be gained from developing 
            further nuclear energy in Scotland?</P>
          <p><strong>Christine May: </strong>I understand that work is currently 
            under way to consider a long-term solution for nuclear waste. Of course, 
            Rhona Brankin is quite right.</P>
          <P>Coal has, for some reason, received a good deal less attention than 
            the nuclear option. It has been almost totally removed from our plans, 
            to be replaced by the aforementioned gas&#151;</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Home Robertson: </strong>The Tories did that.</P>
          <p><strong>Christine May: </strong>That is true.</P>
          <P>I accept that it is neither desirable nor acceptable to burn vast 
            quantities of coal in the way that we have always done, but that should 
            not blind us to the possibilities that coal presents, such as co-firing&#151;as 
            we saw in Denmark&#151;and cleaner coal technology. Technologies such 
            as carbon dioxide sequestration and the gasification of underground 
            coal are under development and could significantly increase the efficiency 
            of, and dramatically reduce carbon emissions from, coal generation. 
            As the motion suggests, we cannot achieve our carbon reduction targets 
            just by renewable energy generation; we need also to increase efficiency 
            and reduce wastage. Why should not we improve our conventional generating 
            capacities in parallel with the development of renewables as a means 
            of reducing carbon emissions? I can see folk shaking their heads at 
            the thought of using coal, despite the 1,500 direct jobs and 1,500 
            indirect jobs that the coal industry in Scotland supports&#151;not 
            to mention the facts that coal is cheap, local and part of our heritage. 
            I do not advocate exclusive coal generation; rather, I simply reinforce 
            the fact that we need a broad mix of generating methods.</P>
          <P>Biomass is one of the few renewable sources that can feasibly support 
            base load. Coal-firing, coupled with grants, is the only way to kick 
            start it as a viable industry. I admire what the Executive has done 
            through FREDS&#151;which has a sub-group that considers biomass&#151;and 
            its investment </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7720">7720</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>in the industry. I welcome the Deputy First Minister's reply to my 
            earlier intervention and I hope that when the FREDS biomass group 
            reports, there will be an opportunity for a discussion about it in 
            this forum. The discrepancy between the support that is available 
            south of the border and the support that is available in Scotland 
            makes us uncompetitive.</P>
          <P>Finally, I want to say a word to the whingers who complain that Scotland 
            is becoming a generation ground for the rest of Europe: God forbid 
            that we should actually export anything. I can think of few better 
            long-term economic strategies than one in which the rest of Europe 
            depends on us for clean and reliable energy. We have the resources&#151;let 
            us make some money from them.</P>
          <P>16:12</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne (South of Scotland) (SSP): </strong>Scotland 
            has achieved a reduction of only 4.9 per cent in emissions of greenhouse 
            gases since 1990, but climate-change emissions from the energy sector 
            increased by 27 per cent between 1990 and 2000. That poor record on 
            energy undermines the Executive's motion.</P>
          <P>We must recognise that the Executive can and must do more to improve 
            energy efficiency, to increase electricity generation from renewable 
            sources and to address the potential for green job creation. The Executive 
            must consider how our homes and businesses are built and run. We cannot 
            continue with our present levels of energy inefficiency, which cost 
            money and damage the environment. Renewable energy must be integrated 
            in all buildings at the earliest stages: all new build must incorporate 
            features such as solar panels, and insulation must be fitted as standard. 
            We could do worse than learn from the Scandinavian countries, where 
            energy emissions from domestic buildings are minimal and the figures 
            for winter deaths among the elderly are approximately half those of 
            Scotland.</P>
          <P>The development of renewable energy provides a great opportunity 
            to create jobs in Scotland, but that potential cannot and will not 
            be achieved without sustained investment and political commitment 
            from the Executive. WWF Scotland recently published a report entitled, 
            &quot;A Smart, Successful, Sustainable Scotland&quot;, which estimated 
            that more than 24,000 jobs could be created through investment in 
            wave power and solar water heating. A report by Garrad Hassan &amp; 
            Partners Ltd, which the Executive commissioned in 2001, estimated 
            that Scotland could generate more than its total electricity use from 
            renewable sources. Where is that political commitment today, given 
            that the first order for wave converters is being placed outside Scotland?</P>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>At present, the national grid is not capable of sustaining any great 
            increases in electricity generation. The infrastructure requires considerable 
            investment to increase capacity. That is particularly necessary to 
            ensure that rural communities can benefit from renewable energy developments. 
            The grid in South Ayrshire and in Galloway needs to be upgraded to 
            accommodate additional generation. The Executive should move to take 
            not only the grid, but the electricity generating companies, into 
            public ownership. Renewable energy is a resource that is provided 
            by nature and it should be generated and managed in a publicly owned 
            and publicly accountable manner.</P>
          <P>The Scottish Socialist Party is committed to the environment and 
            to the generation of clean, green and affordable energy for all&#151;in 
            other words, to green energy from renewable sources, not from nuclear 
            power. We call on the Executive to recognise that its lack of investment, 
            lack of energy efficiency targets and lack of political commitment 
            has failed the Scottish people and the Scottish environment on this 
            matter. I urge members to take electricity generation into public 
            ownership and I add that we will support the Green motion.</P>

          <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab): </strong>About 
            20 years ago, I received a letter from a household in my constituency 
            of East Lothian in which serious concerns were expressed about nuclear 
            safety. I was asked to oppose the construction of Torness nuclear 
            power station. That was a perfectly legitimate position to take.</P>
          <P>A few years later, I received another letter from the same house 
            protesting about emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants 
            from the coal-burning power station at Cockenzie and calling for that 
            station to be closed. Again, I understand that position. The story 
            gets more interesting because, when plans were published for the wind 
            farm on Soutra hill, the same family wrote to object to unsightly 
            wind turbines on their skyline.</P>
          <P>It is fair to assume that the people who wrote those letters use 
            electric lights, a kettle, a fridge and perhaps even a television 
            or a computer. Like most people, they want reliable and affordable 
            electricity but&#151;also like some other people&#151;they are unwilling 
            to tolerate any means of generating that electricity.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Ruskell </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></p>

          <P>My point is that we in Parliament do not have that luxury. We have 
            a duty to plan to provide for the strategic needs of the people of 
            Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Ruskell: </strong>I understand the point about the member's 
            constituent, but I am more puzzled about his own position. When he 
            was elected in 1978, he was pro-nuclear but, in 1986, when he addressed 
            a &quot;stop Torness&quot; rally, he was anti-nuclear. Last year, 
            he was again making pro-nuclear comments in Parliament. When is Mr 
            Home Robertson going to become anti-nuclear again? If he does that, 
            he might be able to sit more comfortably with the rest of his colleagues 
            in the Labour party.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Home Robertson: </strong>I had thought that the member 
            was going to make a sensible point. If he wants a seminar on the difficulties 
            that we experienced with the construction of Torness power station 
            and the failure of the then South of Scotland Electricity Board to 
            employ local labour, I can tell him all about that, but he will find 
            that I have been consistently in favour of that power station.</P>
          <P>The Executive has set an extremely ambitious target of 40 per cent 
            of generation from renewables. Although I support that policy strongly, 
            it must be said that the 40 per cent objective will be phenomenally 
            difficult to achieve; even if it is achieved, generation from renewables 
            plant will depend on unpredictable wind, waves and rainfall. Renewables 
            will be a valuable supplement to our base-load generating capacity 
            but, even if we achieve the 40 per cent target, that will still leave 
            a need for 60 per cent of generation&#151;plus a margin for safety&#151;to 
            come from other sources. Parliament needs to face up to the fact that 
            more than half of our existing generating capacity will reach the 
            end of its design life during the next decade.</P>
          <P>The lead time for planning and building new power stations can be 
            10 years or more, so it is imperative that the UK energy department 
            and our planning department begin the process of planning for new 
            base-load generators now. If we fail to do that, we will sacrifice 
            a lot of Scottish jobs in areas such as East Lothian and Ayrshire 
            and we will create a dangerous situation of higher electricity costs; 
            indeed, over the past six months, we have seen a surge in the wholesale 
            price of electricity. We will also create the serious risk of the 
            sort of blackouts that have occurred in places such as Italy and California.</P>
          <P>I have a major constituency interest in electricity. About a third 
            of Scotland's electricity comes from Torness and Cockenzie power stations, 
            which employ about 1,000 people in East Lothian. As Christine May 
            said, exports of electricity through the UK grid are extremely important 
            to the Scottish economy. Those exports would be put in jeopardy </div>

          <P>if we were to fail to start the process of planning to replace the 
            plants that will have to be decommissioned at Chapelcross, Hunterston

          <P>I urge the Executive and Parliament to face up to their responsibility 
            in this respect&#151;it will not go away. We have a duty to the people 
            of Scotland to plan for future strategic energy needs. The motion 
            on renewable energy addresses a valuable, but inherently limited, 
            part of the issue. The fact remains that we will continue to need 
            new base-load stations. If we are serious about reducing carbon emissions, 
            that must mean new nuclear plant.</P>
          <P>The 12<SUP>th</SUP> conclusion in Professor Simpson's paper&#151;which 
            John Farquhar Munro dismissed&#151;that was published by the David 
            Hume Institute states:</P>
          <P>&quot;Nuclear power avoids extra network costs, emits no greenhouse 
            gases and, as a baseload generator, contributes to security of supply.&quot;</P>
          <P>Of course, Professor Simpson is right, which is why we must begin 
            the process of planning new nuclear plants and why we must do so sooner 
            rather than later.</P>
          <P>I was at Torness last Sunday to see the arrival of the decommissioned 
            Concorde airliner, as it made its way to the Museum of Flight. There 
            is a worrying comparison to be drawn between the decommissioning of 
            a fabulous piece of British aviation engineering and the risk that 
            we could lose our world-leading nuclear industry. Torness is a clean, 
            safe and efficient electricity generator. I urge colleagues in Parliament 
            and at Westminster to begin the next generation of nuclear base-load 
            stations and develop more renewable capacity. We have a duty to do 
            that: we need to maintain security of supply, to avoid a genuine risk 
            of blackouts, to keep jobs in Scotland and&#151;above all&#151;to 
            reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</P>

          <P>all three things are vital for Scotland and for our economy.</P>
          <P>As we have heard, emissions from the energy sector in Scotland rose 
            by 27 per cent between 1990 and 2000. We know that CO<SUB>2 </SUB>emissions 
            increased by 0.6 per cent between 1990 and 2001. We know that North 
            sea gas production is running down and that peak oil production is 
            either running down already or will imminently run down.</P>
          <P>A Government report that was published this morning tells us that 
            more than 170,000 Scottish households have been identified as being 
            at risk of flooding resulting from the effects of climate change. 
            It is also the case that, by 2080, the costs of flooding in Scotland 
            will be up to £400 million per annum at current prices. We have to 
            act on that information and we have to do so now.</P>
          <P>The Executive seems frequently to talk about energy when it means 
            electricity. We hear much about renewable energy and renewable energy 
            targets when all that we have are renewable electricity targets. We 
            have no targets and no action plan for reducing transport energy demands 
            or for encouraging renewables in transport. We have no targets and 
            no action plan for non-electricity renewables such as biomass, combined 
            heat and power, solar heating, passive heating or geothermal&#151;there 
            is nothing at all. That has to be rectified. I think that there exists 
            within the Executive the will to examine the issue. I hope that it 
            can be translated into action.</P>
          <P>We need increased funds for the Scottish community and householder 
            renewables initiative, which has been one of the star successes of 
            the Executive's renewables scheme, and which we very much support. 
            Increased funds for energy efficiency are vital. There was an exchange 
            on the matter at the Enterprise and Culture Committee in October last 
            year, when we were examining the budget. It became apparent that the 
            energy efficiency budget has been increased this year from £6 million 
            to, I think, £10 million, purely as a result of an underspend in the 
            renewables obligation (Scotland) budget.</P>
          <P>The Executive civil servant&#151;Chris McCrone&#151;who was giving 
            evidence to the committee, said:</P>
          <P>&quot;It is a one-off for this year; the allocation will return to 
            its budgeted amount next year&#151;unless there is an available saving 
            from the SRO money next year.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official Report, Enterprise 
            and Culture Committee</em>, 7 October 2003; c 186.]</P>
          <P>We need those funds to be guaranteed for next year&#151;it is necessary 
            that there be a continuous amount of funding for energy efficiency.</P>
          <P>On energy efficiency, we should look around us. Parliament has been 
            in Baden Powell House and the other buildings for nearly five years 
            now. When were energy audits done? Why are televisions still left 
            on every night, blaring out to empty rooms in </div>

          <P>which the lights are left on? It is tremendous that the Scottish 
            Parliamentary Corporate Body has now appointed an environmental manager 
            for the new building. For the old buildings, however, that simply 
            was not done. I hope that the environmental manager gets adequate 
            funds to do the job.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>Will Chris Ballance take the opportunity 
            to welcome the £20 million fund for local authorities, health boards 
            and Scottish Water, which I announced last month? It is a revolving 
            fund and savings can be ploughed back into energy efficiency as well 
            as helping to fund the front-line services that those authorities 
            and boards are responsible for delivering.</P>
          <p><strong>Chris Ballance: </strong>I am happy to welcome that funding, 
            but we need to go much further.</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>You have one minute 
            left.</P>
          <p><strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> The tranche of PFI/PPP contracts 
            that have gone out through local authorities over the past five years 
            represent a real loss of opportunity.</P>
          <P>I turn to the Conservative amendment. Nuclear power has no future. 
            I refer also to many Labour back benchers' speeches. Elaine Murray 
            said that we need nuclear power because the visual intrusion of wind 
            farms is unacceptable. That is like saying that radiation must be 
            less dangerous than a wind turbine because we cannot see it. John 
            Home Robertson said that he has been consistently pro-nuclear, but 
            in 1986 he told a rally at Torness:</P>
          <P>&quot;I can tell you with complete confidence that if the Labour 
            Party was in power today there would be no question of commissioning 
            Torness now. The overwhelming majority of people in East Lothian and 
            Berwickshire are very worried indeed about the possibility of an accident 
            at the site and I share that concern.&quot;</P>
          <P>I do not know when John Home Robertson lost his concern, but I do 
            not think that the people of Scotland have lost their concern about 
            the dangers of nuclear power. However, it is not just a matter of 
            the dangers of nuclear power; it is about the economic case, as well. 
            British Energy has had to be bailed out by the Government to the tune 
            of £650 million. That bail-out has been questioned by the European 
            Commission&#151;it might be illegal.</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Please come to a close 
            now.</P>
          <p><strong>Chris Ballance: </strong>The Government has had to take on 
            at least £3.3 billion of liability for nuclear waste. Nuclear power 
            has not proved itself to be economical. The David Hume Institute report 
            has been written by people who are far too close to the nuclear industry.</P>

          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>You really must close 
            now.</P>
          <p><strong>Chris Ballance: </strong>I conclude: the European Commission 
            estimates that there are 500,000 to 800,000 potential jobs in renewables. 
            If Scotland becomes a world leader in wave power, it could get into 
            that tranche of jobs. We can succeed, but we must put more money into 
            development, and we must consider in particular&#151;</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>No, Mr Ballance. You

          <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) (LD): </strong>We can take it as 
            read that the profile of renewable energy in the Scottish Parliament 
            is high because the resource and potential that we have in Scotland 
            is huge.</P>
          <P>We need to get down to the nitty-gritty. There is a lot of it&#151;some 
            is large-scale and some is not. Targets are a useful tool, but we 
            should not get too hung up on them. To date, targets have focused 
            on electricity generation. The fact that electricity represents only 
            a fifth of our total energy demand has been made. Perhaps it would 
            be desirable for us to set targets on supplying from renewable sources 
            a percentage of total energy demand.</P>
          <P>Others have nailed the idea, which is expressed in the Tory amendment, 
            that we are developing wind power to the exclusion of all other technologies. 
            I do not think it is a fair comment either. Murdo Fraser was at the 
            meeting of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on the 
            Scottish economy at lunch time when George Lyon, who probably has 
            more wind farms in his constituency than does any other member, said 
            that he does not hear concern from constituents who have wind farms 
            in their area; he hears concern from constituents who have wind farms 
            proposed for their area and once they are in place the concern dissipates. 
            I agree that we need security of expectation. We must have confidence 
            that favourable trading regimes will be maintained to ensure continuing 
            investment in renewable energy.</P>
          <P>There is increasing acknowledgement of the wider aspects of energy 
            production and consumption, which is welcome. Several members have 
            said that the Cinderella of energy efficiency is coming to the ball. 
            Energy efficiency can make a significant contribution. Building standards 
            have been improved and could be improved further. Other members have 
            said that upgrading housing stock does a lot to tackle fuel poverty, 
            which is an important issue.</P>
          <P></div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Jeremy Purvis made a good point about how the public sector can help 
            create the market to pull renewable energy development. I would welcome 
            attention being paid to how we can fund social housing schemes, how 
            housing associations' procurement can be adjusted and how we can build 
            public buildings in ways that enable the use of photovoltaics and 
            geothermal and biomass energy. Alasdair Morgan said everything that 
            I wanted to say about wood fuel: there is enormous potential there 
            that we should exploit more.</P>
          <P>The use of domestic applications could be encouraged by small measures 
            such as installing two-way meters every time electricity meters are 
            renewed in a house. That would provide an incentive for a domestic 
            user to consider ways of reducing their energy consumption, from which 
            they would benefit financially.</P>
          <P>I would like more to be done to encourage and develop direct benefit 
            to communities that host renewable energy schemes. Some communities 
            have been very effective, but throughout Scotland people have to start 
            from scratch because they do not have access to information and advice 
            or they do not know where to find it. There is a role for both local 
            and central Government in that. I cannot help feeling that local government 
            must make quite a bit of money from the rates for wind farm developments, 
            some of which could be applied to providing advice and support to 
            communities, perhaps through community associations, as a result of 
            local authorities' negotiations with wind farm developers. That would 
            provide a direct community benefit to which communities are entitled.</P>
          <P>I endorse what Sarah Boyack said about the complementary roles of 
            local and central Government in the planning system. Several members 
            pointed out that we have robust guidance&#151;it just needs to be 
            used properly. Solar energy needs daylight, not sunshine, but I agree 
            that we need a secure energy supply and we need a balanced mix.</P>
          <P>As power stations come to the end of their life, there is an opportunity 
            to make considered decisions about how they should be replaced. All 
            technologies, including nuclear, have to be evaluated against each 
            other. On nuclear, zero CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission has to be set against 
            long-term radioactive waste creation. Nuclear energy is far from cheap 
            and we have to bear in mind that putting a lot of eggs in one basket 
            racks up the vulnerability of nuclear power stations.</P>
          <P>Christine May touched on coal-fired generation. We have almost forgotten 
            that modern generation can be much cleaner than the older technologies. 
            There is the potential to address the problem of the disposal of sewage 
            sludge. We are shutting down other ways of disposing of it. We do 
            not </div>

          <P>dump it at sea and we are being much more careful about how we are 
            dumping it on land, so perhaps we can derive benefit from it as a 
            fuel.</P>
          <P>I endorse what Brian Adam said about fuel cell technology. That is 
            another area in which very good work is being done in Scotland, especially 
            in the north-east. Fuel cell technology can take the intermittency 
            out of wind power. Tom Pederson of Vestas-Celtic Wind Technology pointed 
            out to us at the lunch time meeting that wind power and hydro power&#151;both 
            of which are abundant in Scotland&#151;can be balanced against each 
            other to deliver security of supply.</P>
          <P>John Home Robertson made it clear that we do not have the luxury 
            of time to footer about on our power supply; however, I do not agree 
            that nuclear power is an essential part of our future. If we spend 
            what we would need to spend on a new nuclear power station on other 
            technologies, we can deliver base load without nuclear power. Nevertheless, 
            he is correct to say that we need to get cracking.</P>
          <P>16:35</P>
          <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North East Scotland) (Con): </strong>This 
            has been an interesting debate. At times, it has been polarised, but 
            I am glad that the Executive chose to see it as an enterprise debate 
            rather than an environment debate. The Conservative party's policy 
            on renewable energy and the generation of electricity as a whole will 
            always be based on the fact that we need to ensure that this country 
            can continue to provide an affordable and adequate electricity supply 
            to underpin a growing economy. There are members in this chamber who 
            do not believe that growth in the economy is important&#151;[<em>Interruption</em>.]&#151;but 
            for the vast majority of us, growth is so important that we cannot 
            afford to take the radical risks with our electricity supply that 
            John Farquhar Munro appears to be taking with his hearing aid.</P>
          <P>It is extremely important that we realise that we are talking about 
            the stability of our future. The Deputy First Minister said in his 
            opening remarks that it is important that we look on renewable energy 
            production as an opportunity for industry. It is not just an opportunity 
            to expand into renewable energy technology: our energy policy underpins 
            the whole of our economy. That is the point on which the Conservatives' 
            decisions will always hinge.</P>
          <P>When Jim Wallace went through the Executive's five main challenges, 
            he said that he wants to reach the target of 40 per cent renewable 
            energy by 2020. That is a worthy target for any Government to set 
            and pursue, but I am convinced that it is unachievable. Yet, accepting 
            that moving towards that target will benefit the industry, I am </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7729">7729</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>prepared to accept that there is benefit to be had. He also said 
            that it is important to develop a range of technologies. I could not 
            agree more. The problem that we face at the moment is that the marketplace 
            that has been set up for energy and the timescale that has been set 
            dictate that a single technology will be pursued. That is why we have 
            a crisis in much of Scotland over where wind farms will be sited.</P>
          <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe: </strong>Does Alex Johnstone agree that wind 
            farms are not being produced to the exclusion of other technologies 
            for any reason other than the fact that the other technologies are 
            still at a developmental stage and are not quite ready to be delivered?</P>
          <p><strong>Alex Johnstone: </strong>Indeed, but the fact that the target 
            has been set on the timescale that has been given means that only 
            the mature or acceptable technologies that are available today can 
            be used to produce the 40 per cent. That target represents the decision 
            that it will be inland wind farms that will achieve that aim. The 
            minister also said that we need to exploit our opportunities. I agree, 
            but that is why we need a range of technologies. The target that has 
            been set will not be achieved, but it will cause distortion in the 
            industry.</P>
          <P>I agree with members of the Green party and others who have made 
            clear how important it is for us to reduce energy use wherever possible. 
            Energy efficiency is something that we must all understand is part 
            of the process. I am the first to admit that, too often when I speak 
            on the subject, I do not mention energy efficiency. Should I ever 
            do that again, members may be assured that I do understand its importance. 
            The Conservatives will continue to support measures to encourage energy 
            efficiency as they did when they were in government prior to 1997.</P>
          <P>We must address climate change. Whether or not we recognise global 
            warming as a threat, the fact is that we continue to pump huge amounts 
            of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Regardless of whether it is 
            necessary to address it for the long-term future or the immediate 
            future, we must address it as best we can, but given our earlier qualification 
            that we must also encourage adequate supplies of electricity, we must 
            be prepared to address reducing CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions in stages. 
            That is where Executive policies seem to miss the boat. They miss 
            many opportunities.</P>
          <P>Biomass has been the poor relation of renewable energy for some time. 
            Systems must be put in place to exploit the large quantities of timber 
            that, as Alasdair Morgan said, are currently unusable. Between 40 
            and 45 per cent of all cut timber is unusable as wood and is therefore 
            suitable for use as a source of energy. We must have the opportunity 
            to use that. It could be done through combined heat and power systems&#151;</div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7730">7730</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>technology that Scottish and Southern Energy tells me should be encouraged 
            further or the company will not invest in it further&#151;or it could 
            be done through manipulating the system for renewables obligation 
            certificates to ensure that the production of combined fuel, which 
            Scottish Coal is keen on doing through by-product timber, continues 
            to be an option. Executive policies would appear to have discouraged 
            the development of short-rotation coppicing in Scotland, so it is 
            important to have the opportunity to use our surplus timber, especially 
            when there is so much of it.</P>
          <P>I cannot finish without returning to nuclear power. We heard an excellent 
            speech from John Home Robertson. It was balanced and it contained 
            a view that parallels the view that Conservatives have held for some 
            time. If future electricity generation in Scotland is to be balanced, 
            we must accept that nuclear power has a role. Unless we make decisions 
            today that ensure that our nuclear capacity is replaced as plants 
            are closed down, we will suffer power cuts in the longer term. Those 
            power cuts will not only be inconvenient, they will undermine the 
            economy of Scotland, reduce standards of living and leave us with 
            a shrinking economy. We cannot afford to take that risk.</P>
          <P>16:42</P>
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP): </strong>Many members 
            agree that renewable energy from diverse sources is the most important 
            sector in the future development of energy in Scotland. However, others 
            take a different view. Putting the two groups together makes for an 
            interesting combination. The danger is that we will be misled into 
            believing that the vision of windmills on hills will put people off 
            renewable energy. I hope that the SNP's amendment will convince people 
            that renewable energy is a good thing. The SNP believes that diverse 
            sources of renewable energy are the way ahead. From the way in which 
            the Government has gone about its programme, we can understand that 
            wind farms are the easy part of renewable energy. That is why we have 
            seen a rash of developments.</P>
          <p><strong>John Scott: </strong>Which system would the member favour 
            to back up wind power, given that it needs a 60 or 80 per cent back-up?</P>
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson: </strong>The development of wave and tidal power&#151;which 
            has been long delayed by Tory Governments, by Labour Governments and 
            by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority's fiddling of the figures 
            for Salter's ducks, which has been admitted&#151;has been held up.</P>
          <P>If we consider the British context, we see that a dependency on nuclear 
            power is given a high priority, but we have to remember that Scotland

          <P>electricity production. The threat of blackouts, power cuts and so 
            on is thrown up as a spectre&#151;in the Scottish debate and in the 
            wider debate.</P>
          <P>Denmark set up an energy authority after the fuel crisis of 1973. 
            If we had control of all energy in Scotland, we could have a similar 
            overview and take a similarly comprehensive approach here. It is a 
            pity that only renewables are under the direct control of the Scottish 
            Executive.</P>
          <P>We can encourage businesses, but the fact that we are fighting with 
            one hand behind our back makes the situation more difficult than ever&#151;especially 
            given that WWF has suggested that 24,000 jobs could be created in 
            renewables. That is a considerable prize in parts of the country that 
            are job starved and in which there are low incomes. Those areas could 
            be receiving much income at present.</P>
          <P>People such as John Home Robertson and Brian Wilson on one side and 
            Murdo Fraser and Alex Johnstone on the other have adopted the attitude 
            that the nuclear option is clean. That argument has been put firmly 
            in its place. Carbon emissions are not the only issue. If we measure 
            the potential of offshore wave power against the costs of disposing 
            of nuclear waste, we may find that offshore wind power is cheaper 
            than many conventional forms of generation&#151;and certainly cheaper 
            than nuclear power. One problem that I have with the Unison briefing 
            from which people who support nuclear power are so happy to quote 
            is that it states:</P>
          <P>&quot;Renewable energy is actually more expensive than other forms 
            of generation.&quot;</P>
          <P>That is not the case if we take into account the problem of emissions 
            from coal-fired power stations and nuclear waste. If we are to take 
            a balanced view, we could do with having an energy authority to make 
            some of the arguments.</P>
          <P>The Government has made an excellent start on energy efficiency and 
            the SNP is very supportive of it. Today, I lodged a motion on an excellent 
            discussion at a conference in Caithness last week on the use of timber 
            in buildings. The conference not only favoured local use of local 
            materials, but recognised that many aspects of modern building could 
            reduce the costs of energy. As the Green party has suggested, we could 
            produce houses that are so energy efficient that they do not need 
            to be heated. We can develop such approaches&#151;they are part of 
            housing policy, which must be part of energy development policy. We 
            must ensure that energy development policy pays its way. I hope that 
            the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning will respond 
            to that point. The conference on tomorrow's houses today showed how 
            we can build our way towards using less energy.</P>

          <P>Community involvement concerns me a great deal. Some of the attitude 
            problems that exist in many parts of the countryside result from the 
            fact that people do not feel that they have ownership of the means 
            of production of energy. Because the large utilities are seen as the 
            main producers, there is immediate hostility to developments. Part 
            of the problem is that the Government has not been speedy enough in 
            putting community-controlled and community-developed energy in place. 
            Highlands and Islands Enterprise was paid by National Wind Power to 
            get its community unit going, but it took about five years for the 
            community in which I live to receive any benefit. That effort must 
            be matched by Scottish Enterprise, so that people can get in at the 
            ground floor&#151;either by acquiring proper levels of community benefit 
            through planning gain or by acquiring equity shares in developments 
            onshore and offshore. We would like to hear more on that issue.</P>
          <P>SNH and non-governmental organisations on the environment support 
            the provision of guidelines for the development of all renewables. 
            As our amendment indicates, the SNP also supports that. However, it 
            seems that the Government does not believe that central guidelines 
            for such developments are needed. That is a great lack. I am sorry 
            that there has not yet been explicit agreement to put in place guidelines 
            that tell people exactly how they should proceed in these matters.</P>
          <P>We should encourage support for developments by giving local people 
            control, producing local benefits and creating local heating systems. 
            Such initiatives are not high tech&#151;they are innovative ways in 
            which an ambitious Government should move. Existing large housing 
            schemes could benefit from local heating systems. I believe that 60 
            per cent of housing in Denmark benefits from such systems, because 
            they have been developed since the 1930s. Where were we when those 
            things were being done?</P>
          <P>Fundamentally, we should be more ambitious and take a grip of this 
            issue, in so far as that is possible under the devolved settlement. 
            In the Scottish context, renewables should be the main part of our 
            energy production. I hope that the Government will reflect that energy 
            by taking a grip of the subject and by putting renewable energy to 
            the fore of energy production in Scotland.</P>

          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 
            (Lewis Macdonald): </strong>The debate has highlighted the opportunities 
            and challenges of renewable energy. It has also made it clear that 
            our absolute commitment to maximise </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7733">7733</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>renewable electricity generation in Scotland, and the opportunities 
            for the economy that come from it, has wide support. I welcome the 
            support that we have received from various members. However, it is 
            clear that there are different views about how the increase in renewable 
            electricity generation should be achieved. That is why the debate 
            is important.</P>
          <P>The areas of agreement are significant. All parties agree that we 
            must support the development of a range of renewables technologies 
            if we are to meet the ambitious targets that we have set. Everyone 
            agrees that small-scale domestic and community projects can make a 
            significant contribution. Such projects are the focus of our highly 
            successful Scottish community and householder renewables initiative.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Ruskell: </strong>On 16 March, I received a letter from 
            Peter Peacock, who said that, under the Scottish community and householder 
            renewables initiative, schools and local authorities that are involved 
            in PPP contracts can apply for up to £100,000 in grant aid for renewable 
            energy projects such as wood burning heating systems, which have been 
            mentioned. How will the Executive promote the existence of those grants 
            to those who are involved in new PPP contracts in Scotland?</P>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Highlands and Islands Enterprise 
            and the Energy Saving Trust are working hard to promote the availability 
            of the grants, which are significant. The issue of PPP contracts was 
            raised earlier. There is the potential to build into those contracts 
            standards that relate to energy efficiency or the use of renewable 
            sources. Clearly, applications must be considered on a case-by-case 
            basis, but we would welcome developments that give local authorities 
            that opportunity.</P>
          <P>Some of the areas of disagreement must be addressed. It is entirely 
            false to suggest that we are ignoring the contribution that technologies 
            other than wind power can make. It is equally absurd to suggest that 
            the main fault in our renewable energy strategy is that we permit 
            too many applications to develop new wind power resources&#151;and 
            therefore to argue to limit the potential for development&#151;while 
            at the same time arguing that we should set higher targets for renewables.</P>
          <p><strong>John Scott: </strong>Given the accepted need to secure base-load 
            by backing up wind power generation with a dependable energy source, 
            does the minister favour coal, gas or nuclear?</P>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We favour the use of as wide a 
            range of renewable and associated technologies as possible.</P>
          <P></div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Some of the questions that have been asked are about the use of biomass 
            and coal. It was extraordinary to hear a Tory representative say that 
            we needed to strengthen the British coal industry. Anyone who remembers 
            the history of the Tories and the British coal industry will recognise 
            the hypocrisy that that involved.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD): 
            </strong>John Scott gave the minister a choice, but missed out hydrogen. 
            We all want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen is the one 
            source that is totally sustainable and friendly to the environment.</P>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I would be astonished if Jamie 
            Stone did not take the opportunity to mention hydrogen. He is right 
            on that point. Hydrogen is one of the technologies that FREDS&#151;the 
            forum for renewable energy development in Scotland&#151;will consider 
            later this year, to see how we can make progress.</P>
          <p><strong>Alex Johnstone </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></p>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I want to make progress.</P>
          <P>We want to position Scotland as a renewables-friendly country. We 
            must show that we are better placed than our competitors to attract 
            developers and jobs in all the renewables technologies. We will fail 
            to attract those who wish to develop the new technologies if we do 
            not demonstrate that we are serious about renewable energy by supporting 
            the existing commercial technologies of onshore and offshore wind 
            power and hydro power.</P>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The minister will agree that wind 
            farms can contribute hugely to Scotland's energy production, but does 
            he agree that they should be built in the right places and that more 
            than enough energy to provide for Scotland's needs can be delivered 
            without building wind farms in areas of Scotland that are designated 
            for their importance to Scotland's natural heritage?</P>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>It is certainly important to make 
            the point that whether wind power, hydro power or any other energy-producing 
            technology is involved, planning guidelines are in place to protect 
            the environment and communities' interests, which will result in inappropriate 
            and inadequate applications being thrown out. That is a completely 
            different proposition from the Conservatives' proposition that wind 
            power onshore is bad per se yet some of the other renewable technologies 
            that have not been developed to the commercial stage are per se without 
            fault, defect or concern.</P>
          <P>Roseanna Cunningham suggested that the planning guidelines that apply 
            to wind power developments that local councils consider do not apply 
            to larger developments that the Executive considers under the Electricity 
            Act 1989. That is </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7735">7735</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>not the case. Every authority that considers a planning or consent 
            application, including ministers, must take those planning guidelines 
            into account. The guidelines cover not only the environmental matters 
            that Rhona Brankin mentioned, but the cumulative impact of a series 
            of developments in the same location.</P>
          <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>I have heard the minister make 
            similar statements before. If he thinks that his position is correct, 
            how does he explain the demand for national guidelines not only from 
            members, but from organisations as diverse as developers and Friends 
            of the Earth?</P>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We want to encourage the development 
            of renewable energy. We will not do that by drawing a red line around 
            great sections of the country and saying that renewable energy shall 
            not happen in those areas. That would send completely the wrong signal 
            to developers and to communities and would fail to deliver on the 
            targets that we have set.</P>
          <P>If a planning issue exists, it concerns ensuring that planning guidelines 
            are up to date, that they reflect our objectives and that they achieve 
            the balanced judgments that have been described. I am delighted to 
            report that the United Kingdom Government is reviewing planning guidance 
            on renewable energy south of the border, with a view to bringing it 
            more into line with what we have had in the past two or three years 
            in Scotland.</P>
          <P>We have a planning policy that supports our energy policy&#151;that 
            is the way it should be. Significant community benefit issues under 
            planning policy have been raised. We look forward to seeing Highlands 
            and Islands Enterprise's conclusions on its proposals and we have 
            undertaken to consider how to apply the same principles in lowland 
            Scotland once the Highlands and Islands proposals have been made.</P>
          <P>In his opening remarks, Murdo Fraser suggested that our energy strategy 
            relies on wind power alone and that we are reluctant to talk about 
            wind power. He was wrong in both respects. We are happy at any time 
            to make the case for wind power as a key part of our energy strategy. 
            It is key not only in its own right, but because it opens the door 
            to new technologies.</P>
          <P>Alex Johnstone suggested that the timescale means that we can use 
            only wind and hydro power to reach our targets. The targets for 2010 
            will rely on existing technologies&#151;wind and hydro&#151;but by 
            setting for 2020 a target that is more than twice as high, we are 
            stimulating the development of the other technologies that we need.</P>
          <P>That is why FREDS is doing such valuable work. It will report in 
            May on what needs to be done to stimulate wave and tide power. I reassure 
            Shiona Baird and others that Richard Yemm of Ocean </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7736">7736</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Power Delivery is chairing the FREDS marine energy group. That is 
            the level of his commitment to Scotland and to remaining in Scotland, 
            which we very much welcome. The sub-group on biomass energy is examining 
            what needs to be done to encourage the use of wood fuel for electricity 
            and heat.</P>
          <p><strong>Shiona Baird: </strong>Will the minister take an intervention?</P>
          <p><strong>The Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </strong>The minister 
            is in his last minute.</P>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I cannot take another intervention.</P>
          <P>The point that I made reflects some of the concerns and questions 
            that have been raised. We recognise that issues beyond electricity 
            generation exist. Biomass has the potential to address some matters 
            such as space heating.</P>
          <P>Christine May and others asked about the fossil fuel base-load. It 
            is worth remembering that we have approved not only more than 400MW 
            of renewable energy in the past 18 months, but a 400MW gas-firing 
            station, part of which will run on coal firing with renewable sources. 
            A good deal is being done to address the security-of-supply issues 
            that have been mentioned.</P>
          <P>Social justice has of course been mentioned. Scotland now has the 
            highest thermal insulation standards in the UK. We have cut the number 
            of homes with the lowest energy efficiency rating and we are working 
            hard with the Department of Trade and Industry in considering, for 
            example, two-way metering to enable the connection of renewables production 
            to the grid.</P>
          <P>In response to the threat of climate change, which has rightly been 
            highlighted as underlying the debate, we are taking a range of actions 
            that will bring environmental benefits. Those actions will also bring 
            Scotland economic opportunities for business and for jobs. We have 
            a real world lead in many new technologies in the renewable energy 
            sector and we should continue to support them. In order to do so, 
            we should continue to make the most of the existing renewable technologies 
            to which we have access in Scotland.</P>

          <P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Trish Godman): </strong>The 
            final item of business is a members' business debate on motion S2M-1076, 
            in the name of Tricia Marwick, on multiple sclerosis awareness week. 
            The debate will be concluded without any question being put.</P>
          <p><em>Motion debated,</em></p>
          <P>That the Parliament pays tribute to the work carried out by the Multiple 
            Sclerosis Society in helping thousands of people with multiple sclerosis 
            across Scotland; welcomes MS Awareness Week, 18 to 25 April 2004, 
            as an ideal opportunity to raise awareness of a condition that affects 
            over 10,000 people in Scotland; recognises that there remain serious 
            shortcomings in treatment and support for multiple sclerosis in Scotland, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should develop a national 
            standard of care for people with multiple sclerosis to ensure that 
            levels of treatment and support are the same regardless of where in 
            Scotland they live.</P>
          <P>17:10</P>
          <p><strong>Tricia Marwick (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP): </strong>First, 
            I want to acknowledge the very real commitment of MSPs from every 
            party to the issue of MS and to people with the condition. Indeed, 
            their commitment has been highlighted by the amount of work that has 
            been done over the past four years to keep MS on the political agenda 
            through asking parliamentary questions and so on.</P>
          <P>The Parliament previously debated MS's effect on so many people in 
            Scotland in October 2000. That was a poignant occasion because many 
            MSPs either contributed to the debate or listened to speeches. In 
            fact, it was the last occasion that our first First Minister, Donald 
            Dewar, was in the chamber. Although he did not speak in the debate, 
            he sat and listened to members' speeches.</P>
          <P>Four years on, I welcome the opportunity presented by this debate 
            to assess the improvements that have been made in the care for MS 
            patients in Scotland. However, before concentrating on the advances&#151;or 
            lack of them&#151;that have been made since the previous debate, I 
            will give a brief explanation of the illness that we are discussing.</P>
          <P>MS is a complex disease of the central nervous system that impairs 
            the brain's ability to transmit instructions to the muscles. Although 
            different people are affected in different ways, in most cases the 
            symptoms become more severe over time. So far, there is no cure for 
            the disease.</P>
          <P>Scotland has the highest rate of MS in the world, with approximately 
            10,500 people suffering from the disease. No one knows why Scotland 
            has such a high number of MS patients, but we do </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7753">7753</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>know that the standard of care for people with MS remains unacceptably 
            low. That was the case four years ago and remains the case today.</P>
          <P>When we previously debated the issue, the Scottish needs assessment 
            programme&#151;or SNAP&#151;had just published a report that stated 
            that care for MS was</P>
          <P>&quot;substantially sub-optimal, inadequately resourced and unacceptably 
            fragmented&quot;.</P>
          <P>At that time, I called on the Executive to introduce a national strategy 
            and standard of care across Scotland to end the injustice of substandard 
            care for people with MS. However, only ad hoc and piecemeal improvements 
            have been made since then. We still lack a coherent and well-funded 
            national strategy and, when it comes to treatment, Scottish MS patients 
            still face a postcode lottery. The Executive's response to the problem 
            has been many warm words but precious little action.</P>
          <P>The October 2000 SNAP report recommended that managed clinical networks 
            should be established across Scotland for those with MS. However, 
            as no requirement was placed on health boards to adopt that recommendation, 
            there is currently only one MCN in the country, and that was set up 
            only through the commitment of individual specialists in Forth valley.</P>
          <P>The varying standards of care mean that MS patients are still discriminated 
            against depending on the part of the country in which they live. Four 
            years ago, members highlighted the lack of specialist MS nurses in 
            the national health service. Since then, there has been a welcome 
            increase in the number of nurses from seven to 14. However, that is 
            not enough: the Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland has argued that 
            at least double that number is required. Indeed, five health boards 
            provide no specialist nursing for MS at all. Moreover, the increase 
            in specialist nursing has been possible only because of the society's 
            financial assistance.</P>
          <P>Scotland's 44 neurologists recently wrote to the newspapers to profess 
            their embarrassment at the quality of care for people with MS. For 
            example, nine out of 10 neurology patients wait 266 days for an appointment. 
            That is unacceptable. Despite the minister Malcolm Chisholm's acceptance 
            that</P>
          <P>&quot;MS specialist nurses have enormous potential to improve patients' 
            quality of life&quot;,</P>
          <P>the Executive has still failed to provide adequate funds for such 
            nurses.</P>
          <P>Finally, I want to touch on the area of research. Well-funded research 
            is vital not simply to find a cure for MS but, in the meantime, to 
            develop treatments to improve the standard of life for people with 
            the disease. Again, the Executive has </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7754">7754</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>failed to make any serious inroads into addressing the lack of research.</P>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>Most 
            of the member's speech and most of what we read about MS is about 
            beta interferon, drugs, neurologists, specialist nurses and so on. 
            Will she also confirm that, as I have discovered recently through 
            a friend of mine, there are tremendous opportunities for help in the 
            complementary medicine sector, and that we should not ignore that 
            sector and concentrate just on very expensive drugs?</P>
          <p><strong>Tricia Marwick: </strong>Mary Scanlon makes a valid point, 
            and the methods to which she refers should also be explored alongside 
            the more traditional methods. Where those methods make improvements, 
            they should be considered.</P>
          <P>The current research is inadequate to tackle a disease that affects 
            so many thousands of people throughout Scotland. It gives me no pleasure 
            to be standing here lamenting the lack of progress since I last secured 
            a members' business debate on MS. However, the criticisms are all 
            valid and the time for warm words and assurances from the Executive 
            is well and truly over. We need action now.</P>
          <P>Mark Hazelwood, the director of MS Society Scotland, said today:</P>
          <P>&quot;The absence of a National Standard or framework for MS means 
            that the condition gets low priority. Even the most basic services 
            for people affected by MS are often absent ... The Scottish Executive 
            should set a standard that spells out the basics which everyone ought 
            to get, wherever they live. We're not asking for the moon. Such standards 
            were published in England and Wales last year, but in Scotland, as 
            yet, there is nothing, even though we have the highest rate of MS 
            in the world.&quot;</P>
          <P>A national framework for standards of care is essential to end the 
            geographical discrepancies in treatment. Such a framework must be 
            matched by increased funding for staffing, equipment, care for those 
            with MS and for research into the causes of MS and possible help for 
            those with the disease. Then and only then will Scotland's 10,000 
            MS patients be able to achieve the standard of living that they deserve.</P>
          <P>I hope that when he sums up at the end of the debate, the minister 
            will give us not just warm words but a timescale for action to deal 
            with the chronic lack of support and care for people in Scotland who 
            have MS.</P>
          <P>17:17</P>
          <p><strong>Susan Deacon (Edinburgh East and Musselburgh) (Lab): </strong>I 
            congratulate Tricia Marwick on securing this important debate. During 
            her recap of our previous consideration of the issue, she certainly 
            brought to life in my mind </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7755">7755</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>several memories of that debate and the many discussions that took 
            place at that time. I take this opportunity to reiterate my support&#151;and 
            I know that it is shared by many in the chamber&#151;for meeting the 
            needs of those with MS and their families, and our support and admiration 
            for the MS Society Scotland.</P>
          <P>It is a bit invidious for an ex-health minister to single out any 
            one organisation&#151;that might do it more harm than good&#151;but 
            I believe that the MS Society is a good example of an effective health 
            lobby group. It is not too cosy with the powers that be, nor does 
            it simply beat the decision makers around the ears every day. It comes 
            up with constructive but hard-hitting comments, criticisms and suggestions 
            about how to make progress, and it deserves recognition for that.</P>
          <P>The SNAP report that was published in 2000 has been referred to tonight, 
            and it is mentioned in the MS Society's briefing. I was in St Andrew's 
            House when that report was published and I acknowledge that there 
            are huge issues around how we translate such reports into practice 
            throughout the health service in Scotland. Anyone who has ever been 
            in or near ministerial office, or involved in running the health service, 
            knows that that is a big issue. I do not have time to go into it tonight, 
            but the minister might address that issue in more general terms. I 
            do not mind admitting that I am disappointed that implementation of 
            the SNAP report, or the development of services in line with the shortcomings 
            identified in that report, has not gone further, faster.</P>
          <P>Standards can be improved in different ways throughout the country, 
            but the key point is to ensure that they are indeed improved throughout 
            the country. I do not want to prescribe to ministers how best to secure 
            that levelling up, but I join the exhortation to level the standards. 
            Much of what needs to improve in support for MS sufferers and their 
            families does not need expensive investment. Much of it is about making 
            practical changes in the delivery of services&#151;for example, extending 
            the MS specialist nurse service. I have seen at first hand the fantastic 
            work that is done in the parts of Scotland in which the health service 
            has got that service right. I understand the frustration of people 
            who live in areas in which the health service is not getting it right. 
            If there is a single message that we can send out from this debate, 
            I hope that it is that the inequity of provision should not continue 
            for too much longer.</P>
          <P>I want to make a couple of further observations in the short time 
            that I have available. First, one reason why the issue of MS has not 
            been given the universal priority throughout the health service in 
            Scotland that it perhaps deserves is because it is one of a number 
            of chronic conditions that, sadly, often do not get the attention 
            that other </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7756">7756</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>acute conditions may get in the health debate and in the constant 
            haggling for resources.</P>
          <P>Secondly, I welcome the forthcoming launch of the Scottish neurological 
            alliance. Members might be aware of that initiative from information 
            that was sent to us. It is an incredibly valuable step forward that 
            will bring together a range of organisations representing different 
            conditions that have in common not only clinical aspects, but, crucially, 
            the needs of the individuals who have those conditions. I welcome 
            the development of the Scottish neurological alliance, which I hope 
            will bear fruit.</P>
          <P>17:22</P>
          <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con): </strong>I, 
            too, congratulate Tricia Marwick on bringing this debate to the chamber 
            and I echo Susan Deacon in congratulating the MS Society. I congratulate 
            the society on its dedication and efficiency and on the fact that 
            it is an open group that not only lobbies, but provides information 
            about what it does.</P>
          <P>Tricia Marwick indicated earlier what MS is about, but she said that 
            she was not sure why Scotland has so much of the condition. The rate 
            in England is around 160 per 100,000; in Scotland, it is almost 200 
            per 100,000. A genetic factor might be influential in the condition. 
            People of Celtic and Scandinavian origin are particularly at risk. 
            In my own north-east area, there is a high DNA base of Scandinavian 
            and Celtic blood, which might be the reason for the high incidence 
            and cluster of MS in Aberdeenshire, particularly its north-east corner.</P>
          <P>The SNAP report was mentioned earlier. It is easy for SNAP reports 
            to come out with a statement, but we must try to get from organisations 
            such as the MS Society information on how they would answer the SNAP 
            report. Such information could be put in the hands of MSPs and we 
            could add our weight to any constructive arguments that would move 
            ministers to listen a bit more carefully.</P>
          <P>We know that there should be rapid referrals, but we have heard figures 
            during the debate about how long it takes to get a referral and an 
            assessment. Referrals should be made not only by neurologists, but 
            by multidisciplinary teams, because all sorts of other factors come 
            to bear when people have MS.</P>
          <P>Recently, I visited the Stuart resource centre in Aberdeen, which 
            is a day centre for MS sufferers. I encouraged the people whom I met 
            to engage with MSPs in the north-east to ensure that they understand 
            at first hand from the patients and their families how best to get 
            across the information that MSPs should consider. They agreed to run 
            an MSP panel session in May, which they want to be </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7757">7757</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>as broad as possible. I hope that that local initiative will develop. 
            The local Aberdeen branch of the MS Society is organising that session, 
            but the society itself is obviously behind it.</P>
          <P>The Stuart resource centre is a valuable resource to which Aberdeen 
            City Council gives some support. The centre helps to give sufferers 
            a sense of independence. It also organises events for them and shares 
            information, and MS sufferers have access to various therapists there. 
            Such services must be encouraged and rolled out across Scotland.</P>
          <P>I mentioned clusters, which is where the postcode prescribing issue 
            comes in if a health board has a large number of sufferers in its 
            area. I ask the minister to explain clearly, so that we can understand 
            better, the basis for allocations that ministers follow when they 
            give money to health boards to support clusters of sufferers of any 
            chronic condition, or whether it is merely left to the health boards 
            to struggle and find their own way. Some time ago, I proposed top 
            slicing for a specialist budget to which health boards could apply 
            directly for extra help for specific clusters of conditions for which 
            very expensive treatments were required, but that proposal was rejected. 
            That was during the previous session, but I wonder whether the minister 
            would care to comment on it.</P>
          <P>Will the minister also say whether, to improve MS services, he has 
            looked at the situation in Glasgow, where the health board has talked 
            about deletion of or reduction in investment,? Will he look into that 
            situation closely to see what is happening elsewhere?</P>
          <P>It seems that this is not a particularly sexy subject. The MS Society 
            originally paid for 50 per cent of the funding for MS nurses over 
            a three-year period, in the hope that health boards would take over 
            the total funding, but that apparently has not been carried out across 
            Scotland. I ask the minister again to look into that matter.</P>
          <P>17:26</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP): </strong>I congratulate 
            Tricia Marwick on bringing the subject of MS before us yet again. 
            She does not do so only during MS awareness week; she has an assiduous 
            record of keeping MS in front of the Parliament. That is an extremely 
            important point.</P>
          <P>All of us who are present this evening are aware of the issues, either 
            because they affect our own constituents or because we have seen the 
            larger picture of what is happening in Scotland. We have to look at 
            the matter both locally and nationally. Last month, I was invited 
            for Sunday lunch by the Buckie and district support group in my constituency. 
            Lunch started at 1 o'clock and </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7758">7758</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>finished at 5 o'clock in the evening, because we were talking constantly. 
            There were 50 to 60 people there&#151;carers and those who were afflicted 
            by MS&#151;and they did not want speeches; they wanted me just to 
            circulate round the tables, to chat to people and to listen to their 
            problems.</P>
          <P>It was interesting that, at every table that I went to, I received 
            essentially the same story. People were frightened to speak out publicly 
            in front of others, because&#151;and I am not quite sure how to describe 
            this&#151;there was a sense that they did not really want other people 
            to know too much about them as individuals. However, the point that 
            I want to make to the minister is that I suspect that the general 
            concerns that were expressed in Buckie are reflected throughout the 
            nation of Scotland, and probably elsewhere too.</P>
          <P>The first difficulty that was raised was that of access to neurologists. 
            As Susan Deacon said, there is an opportunity to bring in other issues 
            while we deal with the specifics of MS. As someone who works on the 
            cross-party groups in the Parliament on epilepsy and on autistic spectrum 
            disorder, I am conscious of the same arguments coming from those spheres. 
            That issue must be addressed seriously. I do not expect the minister 
            to be able to conjure up neurologists out of thin air, but nonetheless 
            I think that it is an issue that we are all concerned about for a 
            variety of reasons, including its impact on MS.</P>
          <P>The other point that was drawn to my attention was that, post diagnosis, 
            little support seemed to be given to the person who was afflicted 
            or to their families and carers. David Davidson spoke about a north-east 
            cluster. In the Grampian NHS Board area, for example, there is one 
            trained MS nurse for 1,066 people. That is not a support mechanism. 
            Given the geography of the area, that service really must be improved, 
            and we have not really moved forward from the previous debate when, 
            as Tricia Marwick said, we were given warm words.</P>
          <P>It is important to recognise that the MS Society is undertaking a 
            great deal of research. Professor Chris Linington is currently running 
            a five-year project for the society. I understand that Professor Linington 
            previously spent some time working in Germany and was appalled by 
            the differences in treatment standards between the two countries.</P>
          <P>JK Rowling has brought a great deal of attention to MS and we are 
            grateful to her for her work. We must, as legislators, respond effectively.</P>
          <P>17:30</P>
          <p><strong>Jeremy Purvis (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD): </strong>As 
            always, it is a pleasure to listen to Mrs Ewing in a debate in the 
            Parliament and I also pay tribute to Tricia Marwick for again </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7759">7759</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>securing time to debate this very important subject. I also welcome 
            members of the MS Society Scotland who are in the public gallery.</P>
          <P>I make a formal declaration of interest. Before I was elected, I 
            advised the MS Society Scotland on communications and strategy and 
            helped to develop its lobby of the Parliament four years ago and its 
            work on the beta interferon campaign. I am no longer in that role; 
            I have a different role in this Parliament, and I am pleased to say 
            that there have been improvements in services. However, I greatly 
            regret that those improvements have been slow and inadequate.</P>
          <P>In the debate on MS, which Tricia Marwick secured and which took 
            place at the time of the lobby, Malcolm Chisholm, who is now the Minister 
            for Health and Community Care, said:</P>
          <P>&quot;I had not planned to speak in today's debate, but I was moved 
            to do so because of the lobby, which is the most effective that I 
            have seen in my eight years as an MP and now MSP.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official 
            Report</em>, 5 October 2000; Vol 8, c 1067.]</P>
          <P>Malcolm Chisholm recognised&#151;as other members have recognised 
            through the more recent lobby&#151;the absolute determination of people 
            who live with MS to campaign for others with MS for a higher level 
            of services that are better co-ordinated and a reduction in the barriers 
            to accessing those services.</P>
          <P>Regrettably, those barriers still exist and constituents who live 
            with MS in the Borders and Midlothian still have problems. I will 
            direct a few remarks at the situation in the Borders. The Borders 
            must not be one of the underperforming areas in Scotland in terms 
            of services to people with MS. Scotland has the highest incidence 
            of the disease in the world, as we have heard, but there is still 
            uncertainty about its causes. There is no uncertainty about the fact 
            that the NHS is not providing the services in the Borders that it 
            should provide. The NHS recognises that and the recent review of adult 
            neurology services within Borders NHS Board makes recommendations 
            for much-needed improvements in services for people with Parkinson's 
            disease, MS and epilepsy, which will involve exactly the kind of co-ordination 
            that we have talked about.</P>
          <P>I am aware that the matter is complex, as are other colleagues who 
            are in the chamber or who have taken a strong interest in the matter 
            during the past few years. The introduction to the review comments 
            that the population in the Borders is both small and widely dispersed 
            and that the provision of specialist services in general and neurological 
            services in particular is extremely problematic, particularly given 
            that a wide range of the population is affected in different ways.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7760">7760</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>I think that all members are sensitive to the difficulty of ensuring 
            that services are properly co-ordinated, but it is vital that the 
            health board act urgently on the recommendations in the review. In 
            particular, the recommendation for a specialist MS nurse in the area 
            needs to be implemented now. I have met NHS Borders and the MS Society 
            twice in the past two months to press for improvements and real progress 
            in getting a specialist MS nurse for the area. I am pleased that the 
            medical team has been tasked with implementing a number of the improvements 
            that the review suggests. The appointment of a specialist nurse would 
            make a major difference to people's lives. If I help in that process, 
            it will be a great satisfaction in the years to come.</P>
          <P>We should be in no doubt that the improvements that the health board 
            implements will raise the standard of services only to match national 
            standards, which are unfortunately still relatively below par. There 
            is an opportunity for the services to be developed in a co-ordinated 
            way in the Borders, with close co-operation between the health board 
            and Scottish Borders Council, which should share experiences and planning; 
            it is crucial that that happens in relation to occupational therapy. 
            Coterminosity and the single community health partnership in the Borders 
            will make it easier to implement the review's conclusions.</P>
          <P>I close with an appeal to the minister. Integrated services should 
            be budgeted for and commissioned, services should be designed and 
            delivered in co-operation with people with MS and there should be 
            proper communication and co-ordination. Together, those measures will 
            make a real improvement in the Borders; they could also become a national 
            standard of care, which is vital.</P>
          <P>17:35</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Nanette Milne (North East Scotland) (Con): </strong>I, 
            too, am happy to support the motion and to congratulate Tricia Marwick 
            on securing the debate. I am also happy to welcome the opportunity 
            that MS awareness week gives to improving public awareness and knowledge 
            of a condition that affects many people in Scotland. I agree that, 
            in many areas, treatment and facilities for patients leave a lot to 
            be desired.</P>
          <P>I have just checked up on the situation in Grampian, where there 
            are four neurologists&#151;who I presume deal with all neurological 
            diseases&#151;and, as Margaret Ewing said, one specialist MS nurse. 
            In addition, there are close links with the department of rehabilitation 
            medicine. Newly diagnosed patients are referred to the MS nurse and 
            those who suffer a relapse go straight to a neurologist. When I received 
            that information, I thought that the arrangements sounded </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7761">7761</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>reasonable, until I found out about the add-on that the waiting time 
            to see a neurologist is a year. I am sure that that situation is not 
            uncommon. Members should remember that MS patients are just one cohort 
            in the neurological spectrum.</P>
          <P>We were all impressed by the many sufferers who turned up at the 
            Hub last November to lobby us and explain their problems. It was clear 
            that many of them had made long journeys and endured significant discomfort 
            to meet us. They are to be congratulated on their endurance and determination.</P>
          <P>As a result of meeting patients from the north-east on that occasion, 
            I had the pleasure in January of visiting the Stuart resource centre 
            in Aberdeen, which David Davidson mentioned. The establishment of 
            the centre was made possible by a substantial legacy. As well as being 
            a wonderful meeting place for MS sufferers, it is a well-used facility 
            that was greatly appreciated by all the users whom I met on my visit. 
            It is sad that such good fortune does not come the way of all patients.</P>
          <P>I visited another support facility, in Dyce, Aberdeen, where massage, 
            positive pressure treatment and other therapies are offered to users 
            at a modest charge. There is another good resource in the city, which 
            is provided by NHS Grampian, but unfortunately it caters only for 
            people who are under 65 years of age. Users get most upset when they 
            are told that they must suddenly stop their attendance on their 65<SUP>th</SUP> 
            birthday. I hope to visit the facility next month to find out whether 
            there is any possibility of its being able to accommodate older patients 
            who have found it particularly beneficial. Those facilities make a 
            huge difference to the lives of MS patients in Aberdeen; it is just 
            a pity that they are not available everywhere.</P>
          <P>The people whom I met furnished me with a wish list of what they 
            consider to be bare necessities. It is only fair that I read out the 
            points on the list so that the minister can take note of them and, 
            I hope, consider at least some of them. The people whom I met want 
            prescription charges to be free for people with MS. They want to have 
            regular contact with a neurologist, which should include the opportunity 
            to have a magnetic resonance imaging scan at regular intervals. They 
            want all MS sufferers to be able to have beta interferon, if only 
            for a trial period. They want more training for general practitioners 
            and practice nurses and they want cannabis spray&#151;when it is available&#151;to 
            be offered to those sufferers who feel that they need it. They also 
            want age-appropriate respite care for people with MS and a national 
            standard of care.</P>
          <P>Many of the needs of MS sufferers that I have spelled out are common 
            to a range of neurological </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7762">7762</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>conditions. The message comes across loud and clear from all the 
            groups that members meet that there is a significant lack of consultant 
            neurological advice and that many more specialist nurses are needed. 
            I wonder whether the lack of such nurses might eventually be addressed 
            by the new GP contract, if GPs pull together and share specialist 
            nurse services within primary care settings. A national standard of 
            care of the kind that the motion requests is needed right across the 
            neurological spectrum.</P>
          <P>I hope that the minister will take on board the issues that Tricia 
            Marwick's motion raises and that he will widen his consideration to 
            include other neurological conditions that cause similar difficulties 
            for those who suffer from them.</P>
          <P>17:39</P>
          <p><strong>Eleanor Scott (Highlands and Islands) (Green): </strong>I 
            thank Tricia Marwick for securing a debate in which I am pleased to 
            take part. I will speak mainly from a Highlands and Islands perspective, 
            partly because that is my area, but also because of the high incidence 
            of MS there. Tricia Marwick pointed out that Scotland in general has 
            a high incidence of MS and I should add that, as one goes further 
            north, the incidence gets higher. I believe that Orkney and Shetland 
            have the highest incidence in Scotland. That is not just a genetic 
            curiosity; it leads to challenges in service delivery because, as 
            one goes further north, one gets further away from the centres of 
            population and the specialist centres.</P>
          <P>In the lead-up to the debate, I did what I suspect many members did&#151;I 
            phoned my local informant. My local informant, who happens to be a 
            party member&#151;she is an office bearer in the local party&#151;is 
            a service user who is involved in the local branch of the MS Society. 
            She told me about a service users' discussion group of which she was 
            a member about five years ago that looked at services and how people 
            felt about the level of service that they were getting. She told me 
            that there were lots of grumbles at that stage, some of which have 
            been partially addressed.</P>
          <P>One of the issues that the group looked at was neurology appointments. 
            Of course, not everybody in the Highlands lives in a remote or rural 
            situation&#151;there are centres of population such as Inverness, 
            which has a large district general hospital. The hospital, however, 
            has no neurology department. While my local informant was a member 
            of the group, neurology provision amounted to a visiting neurologist 
            who came from Aberdeen one day a month, I think. Since that time, 
            provision has increased and more visits are made. That said, appointments 
            are still quite hard to get. I have no idea what the waiting times 
            are. I was unable to find out about that before today's </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7763">7763</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>debate. Obviously, it is crucial to have neurology input, particularly 
            at the time of diagnosis, but that can be quite hard to get.</P>
          <P>My other point about the system of visits is that only the neurologist 
            comes to do the clinics in Inverness. If the patients could attend 
            a neurological department, they would have access not only to the 
            neurologist, but to the other support staff in the department. I accept 
            that it would be unreasonable to expect to have neurology departments 
            in places where the population does not justify that provision, but 
            I suggest that those issues have to be considered.</P>
          <P>Other members have spoken about MS nurses. There is now an MS nurse 
            in the Highlands, but she covers the whole of the Highlands and Islands 
            area, which is larger than Belgium. Members can imagine that, although 
            she is very much appreciated and liked, she does not have the capacity 
            to make an input into individual patient's cases in any continuing 
            way.</P>
          <P>My local informant told me that physiotherapy is another big issue 
            and that it has not improved over the piece. I understand that physiotherapy 
            tends to be offered only at the time of diagnosis, when patients tend 
            to get a burst of it, although there might be other short bursts if 
            they have an episode of deterioration. My informant told me that people 
            need to be given constant physiotherapy in order to prevent deterioration 
            and to keep them as active and mobile as possible. That treatment 
            is not available, because there is not the capacity in the NHS to 
            provide that level of service.</P>
          <P>Another issue that my informant raised was funding for MS therapy 
            centres. A centre in Inverness offers different treatments and has 
            a hyperbaric chamber. I know that some people are not too convinced 
            of the benefits of that treatment, but patients feel that it offers 
            relief. Although the centre also offers physiotherapy, people have 
            to pay for it. I think that the charge is £7 a shot, which is quite 
            a lot for someone who is on benefits. Counselling is also offered, 
            which is an important service for some patients, as well as hairdressing, 
            although, again, the full appointment costs have to be paid. I should 
            say that the ratio of women to men with MS is 2:1. I presume that 
            the reasons for that are similar to those that other members have 
            mentioned.</P>
          <P>Therapy centres offer a service that is not available otherwise, 
            but they are strapped for cash. The centre in Inverness gets some 
            health board funding but that has happened only relatively recently. 
            It fundraises constantly&#151;pretty much every day of the year&#151;to 
            keep up the services that it offers. I think that that is asking a 
            lot of the people involved.</P>

          <P>Mary Scanlon and Nanette Milne mentioned alternative therapies, which 
            do not have to be high tech or expensive. Nanette Milne mentioned 
            the possible therapeutic use of cannabis. Anecdotally, some patients 
            who suffer from distressing muscle spasms, which is part of the condition, 
            find that cannabis relieves those symptoms. It would be tragic if 
            those patients were to be driven to contravene a law simply to get 
            pain relief. The issue needs to be looked at as a matter of urgency.</P>
          <P>Although funding issues are involved, other problems could be addressed 
            through the provision of services that would not necessarily need 
            to be hugely expensive. Physiotherapy does not cost an awful lot of 
            money. To be honest, physiotherapists are not paid that much&#151;not 
            that I would want to justify that. We are talking about things that 
            are not high tech and that should be made available. All that is needed 
            is a bit of resource planning and management, some funding and a lot 
            of political will. I hope that that will be found.</P>
          <P>17:44</P>
          <p><strong>Murray Tosh (West of Scotland) (Con): </strong>I warmly congratulate 
            Tricia Marwick on securing this very necessary debate. I should declare 
            an interest of sorts, although it is of a non-material and non-financial 
            nature. The elder of my younger sisters has MS; indeed, she is in 
            an advanced stage of the condition. I say to Jeremy Purvis that she 
            lives in the Borders. Paradoxically, although specialist housing could 
            be provided for her, along with the expensive care package&#151;albeit 
            that that package works only because my mother, who is a full-time, 
            unpaid provider of fallback care, is also the manager of the people 
            who have been recruited to provide the care&#151;the medical side 
            of the package is erratic.</P>
          <P>Jeremy Purvis spoke about the gaps in provision in the Borders. Many 
            of us know about gaps in provision from our experience in our own 
            areas. I recently attended the MS Society lobby in the Hub, at which 
            I met a considerable number of constituents from the West of Scotland, 
            who all had one message that they wanted to put across to their representatives. 
            They were acutely aware that the level of service that was available 
            to them in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area was not as good as 
            the service provided by the Greater Glasgow NHS Board, which is itself 
            not necessarily the best provider in Scotland.</P>
          <P>I wrote a couple of letters on the matter to NHS Argyll and Clyde 
            to press the board on issues such as physiotherapy and specialist 
            nursing and I received constructive and sensible replies about the 
            circumstances that the health board was in. The point was made to 
            me that, if MS nursing was </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7765">7765</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>provided, it might soak up resources that could be better deployed 
            in recruiting nurses with a wider speciality, who could cope with 
            people with other neurological conditions. I could not argue with 
            that in principle&#151;except for the fact that those people are not 
            there either, because NHS Argyll and Clyde has a very substantial 
            financial deficit.</P>
          <P>I understand the principle of deficits and the need to bring expenditure 
            into line, but I make the simple point that none of the people with 
            MS in Argyll and Clyde or their carers is responsible for that deficit. 
            They are not responsible for the financial allocations. They want 
            an end to the postcode provision of what they see as desirable and 
            essential services. Those services are desirable because people want 
            them very much and they are essential because people know that the 
            progression of the disease can be eased or slowed by the application 
            of appropriate treatment.</P>
          <P>The MS sufferers know that they cannot get that, because there is 
            a financial problem in their health board. I have no doubt that the 
            health board would wish to provide the facilities, but it cannot. 
            The Auditor General for Scotland indicated in his recent report that 
            he suspected that NHS Argyll and Clyde has a cumulative deficit of 
            £70 million. In his judgment, that sum could not be retrieved. Given 
            the fact that the health board's financial position is so precarious, 
            the reality for the patients&#151;and I am sure that the MS patients 
            are only the tip of an iceberg in Argyll and Clyde&#151;is an inevitable 
            clinical impact. People there are not getting services because of 
            the deficit that the health board faces.</P>
          <P>I do not know whether there are structural reasons for Argyll and 
            Clyde NHS Board having such a large deficit and I do not know what 
            the answer is. I am sure that it must be very difficult for ministers 
            to grapple with an over-committed and overspent health board. The 
            bottom line is that the impact will be primarily on patients. If there 
            is a squeeze, it is patients such as MS sufferers who will find that 
            they do not have the services.</P>
          <P>It is appalling that, in our civilised society, we cannot find the 
            means to give those people whose quality of life has declined so rapidly 
            and descended to such dreadfully low levels access to the neurological 
            treatment, physiotherapy and medicines that they need. Some way has 
            to be found of ensuring that a level playing field is created for 
            people in such circumstances. As their time on this earth is limited, 
            and as the quality of life for people whose disease progresses so 
            quickly can diminish perilously fast, we must surely do something 
            to ensure that, in their remaining years, they are surrounded by a 
            care package and a level of provision that gives them a sufficient 
            quality of life.</P>

          <p></P>
          <P>It cannot be acceptable any more for us to allow such variations 
            to exist, whereby people in one area look in awe at what is available 
            in another area and say, &quot;Why can't we get this?&quot; It is 
            a challenge to our national health service for us to provide standards 
            that are nationally determined, nationally validated and nationally 
            sustained.</P>
          <P>17:49</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care (Mr Tom 
            McCabe): </strong>Like other members, I begin by congratulating Tricia 
            Marwick on securing a debate on this subject for the second time. 
            I hope that the fact that we are debating the subject again goes some 
            way to underline how seriously the Parliament takes this very important 
            issue.</P>
          <P>Tricia Marwick and other members have mentioned the work of the MS 
            Society. On behalf of the Scottish Executive, I take this opportunity 
            to express our appreciation of the role played by the voluntary sector, 
            and by the MS Society in particular. It provides counselling and support 
            for people with MS and their families, funds research into all aspects 
            of the causes and possible treatments of MS, provides information 
            services for health professionals, helps in the development of models 
            of care and runs holiday respite homes. We cannot say often enough 
            that its work is quite simply invaluable.</P>
          <P>The Scottish needs assessment programme review report, which was 
            published in late 2000, has been mentioned. It was initiated by an 
            expert group of professionals appointed by the Public Health Institute 
            of Scotland&#151;which, as members know, is now part of NHS Health 
            Scotland. The MS Society provided patient input to the assessment 
            programme. On standards of care and in other aspects of service provision, 
            the SNAP report concluded that there were wide variations in the accessibility 
            and quality of care for patients with MS and that good standards of 
            care were not being met throughout Scotland. It also made recommendations 
            for improvements.</P>
          <P>SNAP reports are intended to be tools for NHS boards to use in the 
            planning of services. About 49 other SNAP reports, covering a wide 
            range of conditions, have been published. It is understandable that 
            the support groups for all those conditions would have liked the Executive 
            to supervise the reports' implementation but, realistically, the Executive 
            could not manage the implementation of 50 SNAP reports without making 
            a major change to the way in which the national health service in 
            Scotland is run. We are still convinced that service planning is best 
            done locally.</P>
          <P></div>

          <p></P>
          <P>David Davidson mentioned funding. Health boards are not left to muddle 
            along with regard to funding. In recent years we have provided health 
            boards with finance that is around twice the level of inflation, which 
            is significant. The way in which we run the health service&#151;this 
            applies equally to some of Murray Tosh's comments&#151;is that we 
            leave service planning and decision making to be done locally. If 
            members are saying that they want to change that radically, they should 
            make that clear, but doing so would have a dramatic impact on the 
            way in which health services are delivered throughout Scotland. We 
            should be honest with ourselves, with the sufferers of a variety of 
            conditions and with the support groups that, quite rightly, try to 
            advance their cause.</P>
          <p><strong>Jeremy Purvis: </strong>Does the minister agree that a national 
            standard of care would at the very least provide guidance and information 
            to local boards about levels of co-ordination, service planning and 
            delivery that would be required so that the eloquent examples that 
            Murray Tosh gave of people experiencing postcode provision of care 
            would not continue?</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>I will talk in more detail about the 
            concept of the managed care networks later. I do not claim that the 
            standards of care for people with MS are up to the SNAP recommendations, 
            but I take issue with some of the comments that Tricia Marwick made 
            about the lack of progress. There has been significant progress.</P>
          <P>Margaret Ewing mentioned neurologists. Between 1999, when the SNAP 
            working group was gathering information, and 2003, the number of neurologists 
            in Scotland increased by 17 per cent. There are now nine more MS specialist 
            nurses in post than there were in 2000.</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Ewing:</strong> I have received a letter from Professor 
            Charles Warlow of the Western general hospital in Edinburgh in which 
            he points out that Scotland's neurologists are embarrassed by the 
            waiting times for MS and sets out the differences between Scotland 
            and Norway in this regard.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>I regret the embarrassment that neurologists 
            in Scotland have expressed. I have already said that there are more 
            neurologists now than there were in 1999 and we will work to try to 
            ensure that more are provided. However, the shortage of neurologists 
            is not an exclusively Scottish problem; it is a problem throughout 
            the United Kingdom and further afield. I hope that the neurologists 
            do all they can in conjunction with the Scottish Executive and health 
            professionals throughout Scotland to ease that embarrassment and to 
            improve services for MS sufferers.</P>
          <P>We are participating in the UK risk-sharing scheme and piloting managed 
            care networks for multiple sclerosis. I want specifically to mention 
        </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7768">7768</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>the risk-sharing scheme, as it is important. Beta interferon has 
            a unique history that has demanded a unique solution. Uncertainty 
            about the use of the drug meant that many patients missed out on treatment. 
            That is why the health departments and the drug companies agreed to 
            make the drug available in an innovative risk-sharing scheme. All 
            MS sufferers who are considered by their neurologist to be eligible 
            for treatment are able to receive that treatment on the NHS. As a 
            direct result of the scheme, many hundreds of patients in Scotland 
            are now receiving drug treatment.</P>
          <P>The scheme has benefited people with MS not just through their getting 
            access to beta interferon, but through the creation of new clinics 
            and an increase in the number of specialist staff. Assessing all potentially 
            eligible patients is a major undertaking and neurology services have 
            to carry out those assessments without disrupting the vital work that 
            they do in other areas. Therefore, many boards had to make substantial 
            investment in their neurology services. Although that meant that patients 
            throughout Scotland could not be started on treatment simultaneously, 
            the number of sufferers who are now on treatment proves that the investment 
            that was made is achieving results.</P>
          <P>The motion calls on the Executive to develop a national standard 
            of care for MS. As members will know, that would be a task for NHS 
            Quality Improvement Scotland. We created NHS QIS as an independent 
            advisory body, and its work programme for the financial year 2004-05 
            is already committed. However, to begin developing standards, the 
            Executive is funding a pilot MS managed care network in Forth Valley 
            that is led by a specialist nurse. NHS QIS will work with the Executive 
            and NHS Forth Valley to develop the quality assurance framework for 
            the network. That will take account of advice from a wide range of 
            sources and we hope that it will encourage future MS MCNs to adopt 
            the NHS Forth Valley quality assurance template. The overall aim is 
            to ensure consistency of standards throughout Scotland. We are keen 
            to work with the MS Society and health and social care professionals 
            to develop more MCNs. NHS Ayrshire and Arran is working up a business 
            case for pump-priming funding for one MCN, and we would be happy to 
            consider other proposals. We are about to write to NHS Argyll and 
            Clyde, following its bid for an MCN, with a view to taking that bid 
            forward.</P>
          <P>The first draft of the English national service framework on long-term 
            conditions, which focuses mainly on chronic neurological conditions, 
            is due to be published later this year. We have always said that we 
            will study the draft with interest, and we would encourage NHS QIS 
            to take on that task and consider the possibility of including the 
            development of clinical standards for neurological conditions in its 
            work programme for 2005-06. The </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col7769">7769</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>final decision will rest with the NHS QIS board. NHS QIS will be 
            helped in that task&#151;if it is able to take it on&#151;by the newly 
            formed Scottish neurological alliance, which Susan Deacon referred 
            to and which Malcolm Chisholm will launch later this month. The alliance 
            is a group of voluntary organisations that support a substantial number 
            of neurological conditions and which will work together towards common 
            goals. The MS Society has played a major role in that very welcome 
            development.</P>
          <P>I genuinely congratulate Tricia Marwick on bringing this subject 
            to the Parliament. I am glad to have had the opportunity to mark MS 
            awareness week and to express the Executive's appreciation of the 
            helpful and constructive contribution that the MS Society has made&#151;and, 
            I have no doubt, will continue to make&#151;towards achieving the 
            aim, which we all hold in common, of improving services for people 
            with MS and similar chronic and enduring illnesses throughout Scotland.</P>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>I conclude by stressing that although we fully understand the severity 
            of MS and fully appreciate the sincerity of the lobbying that the 
            Executive receives in relation to the condition, we have to remember 
            that there is a range of serious conditions for which people would 
            like clinical standards, individual allocations of finance and specific 
            responses. We need to take a wider approach to our health service 
            in Scotland. That is not in any way to underestimate the seriousness 
            of any condition; it is to say that we receive a range of requests 
            for specific attention. As we run a health service that is devolved 
            to the local level, and as we encourage health boards to develop services 
            that address local needs, that conflict becomes ever more difficult 
            to resolve.</P>
