<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The white paper
sets out the strategy for this approach: first, a concerted attack on health
inequalities; secondly, focused measures to improve the health of children
and young people; and thirdly, a series of major initiatives to prevent
Scotland's big three killers-cancer, strokes and coronary heart disease,
which together account for a quarter of all deaths.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Within that framework, the white paper
sets out detailed, practical proposals for action on seven priority areas:
child health, coronary heart disease, cancer, dental and oral health, sexual
health-in particular teenage pregnancies-mental health and accidents and
safety. I ask for members' backing and involvement to prioritise these
measures, based on the principles in the white paper and on the commitments
that the Executive set out in the partnership agreement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue of public health cuts across
party divides and geographical boundaries, but let us make no mistake:
it is by no means a terrain devoid of controversy. If new politics means
anything, it must be about our capacity to come together, address these
difficult questions and come up with the brave, imaginative solutions that
are needed to make a real impact.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I wish to illustrate a few of the challenges
that we face. Scotland has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy
in western Europe. Last year, more than 9,000 girls in Scotland under the
age of 20 became pregnant. More than 4,000 faced the trauma of termination.
More than 2,000 cases of sexually transmitted infection were reported in
young women aged between 15 and 19. We owe it to our young people to tackle
this issue with determination and innovation and to match that with feeling,
understanding and care.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>Can Ms Deacon explain how we will educate our young people about sexually
transmitted diseases and teenage pregnancies when, in the next three years,
the Health Education Board for Scotland budget will be frozen in real terms?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The emphasis that
has been put on sex education shows its importance. I will say more about
that in a minute.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are investing additional money in health
promotion activities across the board. As I will mention in a moment, that
is building on the work that HEBS is doing and also-crucially-on the work
that local health promotion units are doing in health boards. I remind
members that the health service and local health boards are experiencing
record levels of growth. That is an important backdrop to our policies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Susan Deacon:
</strong>I would like to cover some other points and will not take another intervention
at this stage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know that contraception and sex education
are sensitive issues, and that people have deeply held opinions on such
questions, but if we are to make a difference we have to be mature enough,
as politicians and as a country, to discuss them openly and honestly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Despite many attempts to improve oral hygiene,
our children still have an appalling record of tooth decay. The pain, distress
and disfigurement are real. In Glasgow, for example, the most common reason
for children under 10 being given a general anaesthetic is tooth extraction.
The poorest 10 per cent of children in Scotland suffer 50 per cent of the
dental decay. That is unacceptable. A generation has passed by since Scotland
last addressed the question of the fluoridation of public water supplies.
We owe it to the Scottish people and to our children to reopen that debate
in a spirit of open consultation that is based on the facts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Smoking is a similar issue. We all agree
that a reduction in smoking and passive smoking will reduce the incidence
of coronary heart disease, lung cancer and strokes. Let us be straight:
no other single lifestyle change could do more to improve our health as
a nation, but how far do we want to go? How do we best reduce the risk
and provide support both for smokers and non-smokers? I may not agree with
everything that Mr Henry, the member for Paisley South, has had to say
about smoking but I applaud him for having brought the debate into the
public domain.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we are going to make a real impact on
the health of the people of Scotland, that must start right at the beginning:
not at birth, but before it. How should we support pregnant women-particularly
those in our most deprived communities-and help them to eat better, drink
less and stop smoking? All those factors have a direct impact on the health
of a baby, continuing into childhood and adulthood.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What else can we do to improve the nourishment
of our children and babies? We know that breast-feeding is best for the
health of babies and mothers, but the incidence of breast-feeding in Scotland
is still among the lowest in Europe. How can we change the culture of our
society? How can we help mothers to take up and to continue breast-feeding,
should they choose to do so, during those early months? One thing is certain:
no one Government diktat or pronouncement will make a difference. We must
work together to raise awareness and to foster a change in cultures and
attitudes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Susan Deacon:
</strong>I would like to finish my speech. However, I shall accept a very brief
intervention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>A few weeks ago,
the minister visited Falkirk royal infirmary. I am grateful for the fact
that she notified me so that I could accompany her on her visit-a courtesy
that the First Minister and some of his ministerial colleagues unfortunately
do not follow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The minister may be aware that, since her
visit, there has been concern in the Falkirk area about suggestions-and
I put it no stronger than that-that maternity services may be removed from
Falkirk royal infirmary. There is a broader concern, throughout Scotland,
about a trend that began under the previous Government towards the centralisation
of many services, including maternity services. Will the minister take
it from me that it would be completely unacceptable to deprive mothers
of the right to have their children in Falkirk royal infirmary if that
is their wish?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>That was not quite
such a brief intervention as I had hoped for. However, I was happy to join
Dennis at Falkirk royal infirmary and was pleased that he was there to
help me to pull the curtains off the wall while I was unveiling a plaque.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is for health boards to consider how
best to deliver maternity services in their areas. However, I give Dennis
Canavan an assurance-with a great deal of conviction and as the mother
of a young child-that I want to ensure that throughout Scotland the best
possible provision is made for maternity services in every health board
area. I want local health boards to make that provision in a process of
consultation with the local communities, so that they can come up with
the solutions that are right for them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I shall say more about how we plan to implement
our agenda, although I know that I have time today only to touch on a few
strands of our plans. First, we must work across traditional boundaries,
be they political, sectoral or departmental. I want to remove the bureaucratic
barriers to action. I have asked officials in the health department to
put our health priorities on a fast track, not just within that department
but across a range of policies within the Scottish Executive. That will
bring together those at the sharp end to ensure that the drive is in one
direction for the benefit of the nation's health.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must also support those who are working
together locally to improve health. The link between health boards and
local authorities is central to this programme, and other organisations
and agencies in the public, private, voluntary and community sectors will
all have a role to play.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Care Committee's contribution to grasping the&nbsp;</font></td>

The committee has a key role to play in generating innovative and creative
solutions and in engaging with a wide range of organisations in the development
of ideas and proposals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A key element of how we get to work on
delivering improvements will be our programme of health demonstration projects,
which focuses on the health and well-being of children, the sexual health
of young people, coronary heart disease and cancer. Some &pound;15 million
will be invested to put in place innovative solutions at a local level
to provide test beds for action on which we can then build across Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another major element of our prevention
measures is childhood immunisation. I am particularly pleased to confirm
that I will shortly announce details of our new immunisation programme
to tackle meningitis C for the benefit of children across Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will also shortly be making a series
of new appointments, including national co-ordinators for diet and for
health demonstration projects, and public health and health promotion professionals
to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I said, we will work with the Health
Education Board for Scotland and with local health board promotion units
not only to build on their successes but to examine how we can maximise
the impact of our health promotion activities and messages. We are also
moving forward in our programme for the development of healthy living centres,
aided by lottery funding. The centres will improve health and well-being,
focusing in particular on those with the poorest health who are living
in our most deprived communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The list is by no means exhaustive, but
I hope that it serves to demonstrate the commitment and sheer determination
with which I, my deputy Iain Gray and the Scottish Executive intend to
tackle public health and to improve the health of the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No one individual, organisation or political
party has a monopoly of good ideas-the way in which this Parliament has
been designed to operate is a recognition of that fact. I give members
an assurance that the Executive will provide the vision, the values and
the sheer determination to tackle the root causes of ill health and to
lead the drive to improve the health of the Scottish people. I also ask
each and every member in this, our new Scottish Parliament, to join us
in that task. Together we can build a healthy Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the people of Scotland's health and working in partnership are key priorities
for the Parliament. I was delighted to hear Susan Deacon say that no government
diktat will make a difference in that, as that is the background to my
amendment. Although the</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"challenge for individuals . . . who can
do so much to improve and safeguard their own health"</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

a Healthier Scotland", I ask her to support my amendment to ensure that
we give greater emphasis to individuals taking responsibility for their
own health.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue was before the public eye last
week regarding cervical cancer screening-we discovered that many individuals
had been called for a smear test as many as eight times. I would like Susan
to use this opportunity not just to set out a framework for public health
but to encourage individuals, within this chamber and throughout Scotland,
to take greater ownership of their own health. I hope that she will support
me in raising the profile of individual responsibility, as is endorsed
in the white paper.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A successful project in Finland was based
on major lifestyle changes through concerted individual, community and
Government action. I ask the minister again to bring the individual into
this partnership.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are many wide-ranging aspects to
this debate on public health, and I hope that my colleagues Ben Wallace,
Alex Fergusson, David Mundell and David Davidson will have the opportunity
to contribute to it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The white paper on health addresses major
areas. It also includes nine specific funding pledges. This comes in a
week when an additional &pound;80 million is being given to education from
other budgets. I ask the minister to honour those nine funding pledges
and to state that there will be no reduction in the health budget to fund
additional promises in other areas just to keep the Lib-Lab pact on line.
I would also like a breakdown of the funding; I will be lodging a written
question to that effect.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Apart from the
nine specific funding pledges, the action plan also includes the creation
of two new national posts, at least one task force, six new strategies,
one more advisory panel, another new expert group and various other new
groups to co-ordinate activities. At least seven commitments in this white
paper are to include the councils. However, I bring to the minister's attention
the fact that neither the paper nor her speech mentioned including general
practitioners. Social inclusion would seem to include councils, but the
Scottish Conservative party would like assurances that GPs will remain
at the forefront of health delivery in Scotland and be fully included in
the new plans. The record of Scottish council social work departments in
delivering care in the community and blocking beds in our hospitals is
nothing short of a national scandal, and yet councils are given a priority
and recognition beyond that of the tried and tested backbone of the health
service-the GPs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the smoking ban in public places proposed
by Hugh Henry, as a new Parliament we must ask why, in December 1988, Donald
Dewar, as Secretary of State for Scotland in Westminster, signed up to
a voluntary agreement with the industry in response to the white paper
"Smoking Kills", yet now finds it necessary to support and legislate for
a ban on smoking in public places.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Mary Scanlon give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

some of the inaccuracies in Mary Scanlon's statement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>If Hugh Henry can
speak for Donald Dewar, I am happy to give way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>I would like to see
the evidence for Mary Scanlon's statement that I am calling for a ban on
public smoking. I have made no such call, and I am unaware that there has
been one. The proposals that I will introduce will not be on that basis.
Can Mary Scanlon provide clarification?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>I think that Hugh
Henry needs a better spin doctor. Having spent the summer in the Highlands,
I read the newspapers like everyone else, which assumed that he was calling
for a ban. He needs to employ another spin doctor.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">huge status and
a huge cost, but it is not generally recognised as cost-effective. For
as long as I can remember, we have identified the problems in Scotland's
health. For as long as I can remember, we have ploughed more money into
health-even more than our English neighbours-yet we are not making significant
inroads into the problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will give the minister three examples
of where we could move from bureaucracy and administration to front-line
delivery, which I acknowledge that the minister mentioned. I will give
three simple examples of what can be done. Part of the health promotion
budget should be given to GPs to help them engage more fully in health
promotion. Cardiovascular health could be monitored by GPs, as they know
all their patients and could take blood pressure and work to treat this
chronic disease early. GPs could also assist in a campaign to reduce smoking-that
could be tackled along with hypertension.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I visited various GPs and hospitals
during the summer, the most serious concern that people raised with me
was chlamydia. Chlamydia is given a passing mention in the document, yet
10 per cent of young, sexually active people are affected by it. It is
a symptomless problem that causes infertility. It affects both males and
females, yet there is no pilot project in Scotland to address the problem
and most health boards have not budgeted for the machine that is used for
early detection.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By strengthening the relationship with
GPs, we could also address the problem of young men not attending doctors'
surgeries. The suicide rate among young men is alarming and I have no doubt
that we are all concerned about it. Only 10 per cent of screening for chlamydia
is done on males. That could easily be addressed by bringing the GPs to
the front line of health delivery. The treatment is a simple course of
antibiotics, which can prevent infertility.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I use those three practical examples of
how we could improve health care as a distinct option to the grand, centralised,
bureaucratic and expensive approach outlined in the document. Where does
the document focus on applying direct, immediate help for young single
mothers who are smoking? Cigarettes are a cause of deprivation, as they
affect the household budget, and smoking-related illnesses cost the NHS
&pound;1.8 billion a year. Where is the direct help to bring young males
into GP surgeries and tackle the alarming suicide rate? I ask Susan Deacon
not to get buried in paperwork and focus groups, but to work with the Health
and Community Care Committee and health providers to promote good public
health in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

major structural change in the health service in Scotland, which it was
proposing to put into place a mere two months after the changes implemented
on 1 April this year? The SNP-we have stated it-has reservations about
the new structure, but we feel that it is more important for the morale
of the workers in the health service, and especially for patients, to allow
the new structure time to settle in. We will monitor it to ensure that
it delivers a first-rate health service in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have just heard from a party that, had
it won the Scottish election-I know that pigs might fly but, for the sake
of argument, members should bear with me-would have scrapped primary care
trusts and local health care co-operatives. Astonishingly, in the context
of this debate, it would have abolished the health boards, which play a

that one in three of Scotland's children lives below the poverty line,
that more than 20,000 Scottish children are homeless in any given year,

in Scotland. There can be no one in this chamber today who does not want
to improve the health and quality of life of our fellow citizens. I, for
one, believe that improving Scotland's health and eradicating poverty are
the number one challenge that faces this Parliament. If we are to achieve
that goal, we must take an integrated and-I hope-consensual approach to
the issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The key is to recognise-as, I believe,
the white paper goes some way towards doing-that poor public health cannot
be tackled in isolation. There is hardly a legislative area that does not
have an impact on poverty and ill health. That is why the SNP argues for
a minister with responsibility for public health, so that we can truly
raise public health to the top of the agenda. After all, community care
has-rightly-been recognised by the appointment of a responsible minister.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The appointment of a minister for public
health would underline our commitment to improving our nation's health.
The minister would play a pivotal role in an anti-poverty strategy. He
or she would be responsible for auditing-or, as I prefer to say, poverty-proofing-each
piece of legislation at a pre-legislative stage, and for analysing the
potential impact on poverty and public health of proposed legislation.
It is essential that we, as a Parliament, develop an anti-poverty strategy
for Scotland, with a dedicated key minister&nbsp;</font></td>

implementing it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is also imperative that the number of
public health consultants in Scotland be returned to at least its previous
level. In the past 10 years, we have lost almost 50 per cent of our public
health consultants. The reason for that is quite simple-the continued inclusion
of public health doctors in health board management costs. The truth is
that those specialists have been lost not by design, but by cuts by stealth.
It is easy for cash-strapped health boards to make cuts in an area that
is not as visible as others.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we are to restore the morale and the
effectiveness of the public health profession, it is essential that the
minister reassert the right of freedom of speech for public health consultants.
They must be allowed to speak out in the public interest without fear of
professional repercussions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I commend the target setting in the white
paper. Nobody can disagree with the sentiments that the minister expressed-at
least, that is what I thought until Mary Scanlon made her speech. If we
are to achieve those targets, new money will require to be invested in
key target areas-of which I can suggest a few. We need to start public
health training in the community and increase the number of skilled nurses
who are available to work with people to improve public health at local
level. Money must be invested to allow community nurses to gain further
public health qualifications. New resources should be focused on public
health initiatives in GP practices and in outreach work. I ask the minister
to set a target to provide every GP practice with access to a named learning
disability nurse by the end of this session.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another example of the Government putting
its money where its mouth is would be the target for dental health in children
under the age of five. The best way to encourage families to ensure dental
care for their children is for the parents to visit their dentist regularly.
That could be achieved with an investment of only &pound;4.5 million a
year to reintroduce a free annual dental check-up for everybody in Scotland.
That would help to make a visit to the dentist a family norm and encourage
good dental health from an early age.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>The minister mentioned
fluoridation of the water supply in her speech. The British Dental Association,
which recognises the problem of dental health in the under-fives, suggests
that the best way forward would be fluoridation. Does Kay Ullrich accept
that the British Dental Association might be right?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Kay Ullrich: </strong>Yes; that is why I
am sure fluoridation of water will be a high priority for the Health and
Community Care Committee. The issue must be debated and we would be happy
to do so.</font></td>

there is a role for government, health professionals, general practitioners,
nurses, community nurses, pharmacists and a range of other people. Indeed,
as we will see in the debate, there is a role for other professionals,
in social work and in education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the heart of this, however, there is
a role for the individual. Nobody makes people do the things that cause
them ill health. Sometimes they have no way out of it, but sometimes they
do. The cancer screening issue that Mary brought up highlighted that fact.

to the first session of this Parliament than the achievement of a significant
reduction in health inequalities in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome Kay Ullrich's speech and the
consensual approach that she adopted, but I very much disagree with Phil
Gallie and Mary Scanlon. Health inequalities widened considerably under
the previous Government; we can have debates-as Phil Gallie wanted-about
the level of health expenditure, but that widening is the simple reality.
The standard mortality ratio for someone in the poorest community in 1981
was 120 per cent of that of someone in the most affluent communities; by
1991 that had grown to 162 per cent.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mortality is not the only indicator. Only
last week, I read a report about mental health in Glasgow that showed clearly
that there were far more mental health issues in deprived areas, showing
that mental health, too, is related to poverty and life circumstances.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>Will Malcolm Chisholm
give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the issue in the Health and Community Care Committee and elsewhere.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the minister's emphasis on minus
one to five-the years of life, including the period in the womb, when all
the evidence shows that issues such as birth weight are so significant.
It is really good that the Executive is emphasising that. That too is related,
as the Acheson report in England reminded us, to levels of income. In terms
of welfare reform, we have to consider the income of pregnant women as
well as women in the early years of their children's lives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Food is a good example of how income issues
relate to the lifestyle issue of diet. I would like to expand on that,
but time does not allow me to do so. I will just say that in my constituency
there is an excellent food project called Barry Grub, which tries to provide
healthy food at wholesale rates in the Pilton area. We should consider
food co-operatives and initiatives so that the problems poor families have
buying healthy food are addressed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The emphasis on mental health in the white
paper is also very important. If I may advertise my constituency again,
I will mention that there is an excellent community mental health project
in my constituency, called The Stress Centre. The Executive should support
initiatives such as that, which address the higher levels of mental health
problems in certain areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the proposals for the task force make that point. The task force will involve
people from local communities, and that bottom-up approach is fundamental.

have no targets been set for reducing respiratory diseases?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Public health should be a contract between the health service and society-it

better public health. It blames much on life circumstances. I agree with
the observation that crime, low pay and conditions and poor education contribute
to ill health. I also support the housing measures and the fact that the
white paper recognises that poor housing contributes to poor health. However,
it also relies on the fact that the new deal is working, that new Labour

However, statistics that came out a few weeks ago show that cases of cancer,
cases of sexually transmitted diseases, waiting lists and teenage pregnancies
have all risen, this year and last year. Some of the statistics have bucked
the trend from the time when we were in government. It is hard to see how

The prime place for that responsibility to be exercised is in this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and
Fife) (Con): </strong>Will the member give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>No, I will not. I believe
that we have strong-overwhelming-scientific evidence of the causes of ill
health and of the steps that we need to take to improve the situation.
What is required from the health minister-and equally from those of her
ministerial colleagues whose responsibilities bear on health, which is
virtually all of them-is a consistency and firmness of purpose in making
the improvement of Scotland's health a key priority. All too often in the
past, public health and health promotion departments have been a cinderella
within the health service, knocked aside or downgraded when the pressures
on acute hospital services accumulated. What is needed is a continuing
commitment-through local government, housing and employment policies, as
well as through the health budget and the health service-to make tackling
health inequalities one of the Government's key objectives. The message
that I am getting from the minister is that that appeal has been heard.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The minister's speech, together with the
white paper, makes it clear that the campaign against poor health will
be closely tied to broader efforts to deal with social exclusion, concentrating
people's efforts across the sectors by working to a shared agenda. On the
ground, I detect a strong sense of common purpose among all those working
in health and in related fields to tackle those inequalities. That is what
they want to do, and that is what we in this Parliament have to empower
and encourage them to do.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Health has been given a high priority-not
only because of its importance in terms of people's social well-being,
but because the measurement of progress towards meeting health targets
provides us with an objective and robust method of assessing progress towards
social inclusion and equality. To meet the targets set out in the white
paper, we will need to advance partnership working and the co-ordination
of the work of different agencies in a way that builds on existing&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Despite the deep-seated health inequalities
in Scotland and the unacceptably high rates of coronary heart disease,
cancer and strokes in particular, it is my experience that a lot of hard
work is already being done to tackle our health problems. As the former
chair of the Glasgow Healthy City Partnership, I know that a great deal
has already been done on the ground to tap into the creativity of people
living in some of the more deprived communities, as well as the expertise
of health practitioners. Concrete efforts have been made to build paths
away from health disadvantage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Community health projects and projects
that focus on specific needs-and I must say that I could provide an even
longer list than Malcolm-have had a major impact. They work in developing
greater health awareness and providing much needed support to people for
improving their health. The centre for women's health in Glasgow is an
example of an internationally recognised centre of excellence. There is
a great deal of existing good practice in Scotland-we are not working from
the back of the field. People are coming to Scotland from elsewhere in
the UK and from Europe to look at what we are doing and to learn lessons
that they can apply to their circumstances. There is much that can be put
into effect very quickly given the commitment that is now being shown.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

health boards and trusts-but to spread the agenda more widely. People must
be encouraged to be more directly involved in improving their health. The
statement that the minister made today, which mentioned &pound;15 million
for demonstration projects, the encouragement that has been given to people
through the new opportunities fund and the bringing forward of proposals
for healthy living centres are all positive steps. Let us, however, be
clear that we are not engaged in a short-term sprint. This is a long haul

of plans and projects is a key part of the health strategy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is all good stuff, but at that point
I begin to have a bit of a problem. Susan Deacon was keen to tell us the
good news, but did not mention the other side, which is not such good news.
She talked about partnership and about working closely with the Health
Education Board for Scotland, but HEBS funding has been cut by &pound;400,000.
I fail to see how that would improve partnership working.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In addition, Government support for local
council spending is &pound;1.3 billion less in the first three years of
the Labour Government than it was in the last three years under the Tories.
That has meant a slashing of local authority budgets. It means that many
of the socially excluded communities that ministers are so fond of referring
to and of visiting have experienced savage cuts in many of the services
and projects that are important in tackling public health problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Public health problems can be tackled best
at community level using the services and projects there, but the cuts
have resulted in a loss of services to the neediest people in society.
I will give some examples.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Whitfield Health and Information Project
in Dundee closed last year when its funding ended. That project provided
advice on sex education, teenage pregnancies and diet and nutrition, among
other things-the very areas where we want improvement. The Glasgow North
Community Health Project has suffered a cut of &pound;15,000 to its budget.
That has reduced its ability to carry out much needed work in one of Scotland's
most deprived areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It does not stop there. The threat to projects
continues to this day. The funding of the Incite drugs project in Aberdeen
ended in July. Only through public appeal has that project managed to continue.
With only one of the three funding partners having agreed to future funding,
the project is under serious threat, yet it is involved in important drug
abuse prevention work and peer education with young people. It is the very
type of project that we want to tackle public health problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is not intended to be partisan. In
a previous life, many members from other parties have been involved in
working on such projects in very deprived communities. They know as well
as I do that there has been cut after cut to the examples of good practice
that Des McNulty mentioned. The minister has to take on board the fact
that we must secure those projects.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

want to pick up on. Will she make a statement about the important issue
of the shortage of vaccines, which is a matter of concern for many doctors?
I implore her to examine discrimination in health service delivery. Several
organisations have raised, through the Equal Opportunities Committee, the
issue of the lack of interpreting and translating services. For someone
whose first language is not English, it is difficult to communicate important
health information that will help towards a diagnosis, or to understand
a diagnosis when it is given; and it is stressful for both people and doctors
when patients do not fully understand the information that they are given.
The problem needs to be addressed and I hope that the minister will investigate
the matter.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD): </strong>The
two things that we should take away from this excellent debate were encapsulated
in Des McNulty's remarks about the need for building on examples of good
practice and for thinking long term. This is a subject where it is easy
to talk about quick fixes or about what will be necessary for the next
12 months.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The white paper, as refocused by the partnership
agreement, concentrates on the underlying causes of ill health and on the
importance of health promotion and of locally based health initiatives.
I welcome the minister's approach in involving the whole chamber, the whole
Parliament and the whole of Scotland in tackling health. That approach
has been welcomed by the whole chamber, with the possible exception of
the remnants of the ideologically driven Conservative group on our far
right.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Liberal Democrats are keen to pursue
the aspects of the partnership programme that link health to housing. If
the warm deal and healthy homes initiatives could help to rid Scotland
of the scourge of damp, cold houses which some members have mentioned,
that would be a major achievement for the Executive and the Parliament
and a major contribution to good health. It is entirely uninspiring that,
on the eve of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, far more people in Scotland
live in such accommodation with its associated health and morale problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">let us wait and
see what the partnership Government has achieved by the end of the period.
As the coalition parties have been in power only since 1 July, it is a
little premature to talk about investment figures over that three-year
period.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Returning to my main point that the emphasis
on social factors should not lead us to overlook the need to target specific
health promotion issues, I think that it was correct for the partnership
agreement to insist on such an approach rather than on the chimera of hospital
waiting lists. There will always be political pressures to deal with the
high-tech end of hospitals, because that attracts all the publicity, but
the priority should be placed on the slow, steady work of the health service.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In connection with that point, I was a
little concerned to read in the white paper of difficulties at the edge
between local government and health. It might not be that important to
have health officials sit on local government committees, but it is vital
that the link between the two services be as seamless as possible so that
the policy is not hide-bound by such matters as departmental difficulties.
We have to give much attention to drawing the strands together in different
ways.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My final point relates to cancer. We have
failed young women abysmally in the campaign to reduce tobacco usage. Why?
It seems slightly perverse because women are far better than men are at
going to the doctor. They go to the doctor about childbirth and associated
pre and post-natal care and are in contact with community organisations
of all sorts such as mother-and-toddler groups, weightwatchers groups and
yoga classes. It is possible to target young women more effectively. The
link between the health of young women and the unfortunate upward trend
in cigarette smoking, and similar links, can hardly be overemphasised.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A while back I was involved in litigation
in England-members might have read about it-on coal miners and their associated
problems. An extraordinary and significant fact that emerged was that a
moderate cigarette smoker suffers more damage to his lungs than he does
from 20 years down the mines with their dampness and dust.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Conservative amendment fails significantly
to recognise the role of the Government. The role of the Government in
public health is threefold: to resource public health, to co-ordinate policies
and to set ambitious but achievable targets to tackle the problems that
we have been talking about. The minister's speech and white paper hit the
issue on the head. Let us consider the details unitedly and try to deliver
those improvements in health.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Black report, commissioned in 1977
and produced in 1980, was the first significant report to link poverty
with ill health. The subsequent Conservative Administration shelved the
report and was partly responsible for the increase in the amount that had
to be spent on health over that period because the problems created by
the link between poor housing and ill health were not being addressed,
which were clearly set out in the Black report. I support Tricia Marwick
every time she calls for better insulation standards for Scottish homes
and for a rolling programme of insulation improvements, particularly to
public housing. If we could raise the basic building standards for housing
in Scotland, we would go a long way towards solving many of our problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Robin Harper: </strong>There are two additional
points. First, the UK made commitments at Kyoto to reduce CO<sub>2.</sub>
If we reduce the amount of fuel that is used in housing, which makes a
considerable contribution to CO<sub>2, </sub>that will help us to meet
our CO<sub>2 </sub>commitments made at Kyoto and we will also reduce pollution

her dentist had said that two issues were the reduction of the amount of
chocolate eaten and the introduction of fluoridation. There is a danger
of getting them in the wrong order. Why do we not first address the real
causes of dental decay? To address the causes of tooth decay, we need to
put in place essential education, changes in culture and in eating habits
and anything else that we can think of. In the fluoridation debate, there
are plenty of informed and reasonable arguments in favour of introducing
fluoridation and equally well-informed and progressive arguments against
fluoridation. I will stand against fluoridation and I hope that the argument
will be revealing, intense and sensible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alex Fergusson (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>It is with a certain amount of trepidation that I enter this debate,
because I acknowledge that my subject rolls into the fields of justice,
education and social services, as well as taking its primary place within
the health service. I strongly believe that my subject is not only one
of the greatest dangers to our health, as a nation, but is capable of damaging
the social structure of our society. It is a curse that knows no boundaries
of class, creed, wealth, colour or political affiliation and that frightens
all parents as their children grow up in today's society. It is a curse
that has an adverse affect on every community, no matter how large or small,
and that we must address, as a Parliament whose aim-indeed whose promise-is
to improve the lot of those in our society who can least help themselves.
I refer, of course, to drugs and to those who use, misuse and abuse them.
Any debate about those who supply them is for another occasion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As a Parliament, we will be guilty of the
utmost neglect if we are not able to concentrate on and prioritise the
issue of drugs in our first four-year term of office. The rewards of making
progress would be enormous; for example, there would be huge benefits in
terms of police resources. Just this week, I had a meeting with the chief
constable of Dumfries and Galloway, who informed me that 70 per cent of
crime in that region was directly drugs related.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There would be equally enormous benefits
to our social services and to our local authority resources, but the greatest
benefit would be to our health service and consequently to the health status
of our nation and its people. It is surely incumbent on this Parliament
to try to achieve those benefits because, as the minister said, we have
a magnificent opportunity to take a new initiative on this and other issues.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have spoken to many people who are involved
in drugs rehabilitation and I keep coming up against the view-interesting
and unusual these days-that there is plenty of money being thrown at the
problem. The Scottish Drugs Forum all-party working group's report states
that &pound;50 million annually is the current expenditure on response
to drugs use. However, I am constantly told that that &pound;50 million
is not being used in the most effective way. We need to find the most effective
ways, or best practice as it is better known, and we need to consider prevention
through education. There is an overwhelming need for a national strategy
rather than the fragmented one that is currently employed. Where we fail
to prevent or to educate, we need to listen to those who work in rehabilitation
and to listen and learn from those who have first-hand experience of the
pain and&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Given the belief that sufficient resources
are available, but that they could be better applied, the answer to some
of the problems lies in another of the Executive's buzz words, which also
appears in Mary Scanlon's amendment: partnership. This issue, above all,
is surely the perfect one in which partnerships should be employed-between
Government departments, local authority departments, the voluntary sector
and individuals. The Government's drugs expert, Professor Howard Parker,
predicts that we are on the verge of a new heroin epidemic, as if the present
one was not serious enough. The announcement of a new drug enforcement
agency, while welcome, brings problems of its own, not least in how that
agency will be staffed without diluting the expertise on the ground. The
agency will not in itself provide the whole answer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The credibility of the Executive, indeed
of the Parliament, is on trial to an extent, not least in the media. An
urgent, innovative and joined-up approach to the drugs menace in our society
would give us a golden opportunity for redemption. It will be to our eternal
shame if we do not grasp that opportunity. I support the amendment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>The
establishment of a Scottish Parliament with broad and accountable responsibilities
for health service provision in Scotland offers us a unique opportunity.
The white paper demonstrates that the Government's approach is to consider
the multi-factorial nature of Scotland's ill health and the fact that we
require multi-agency solutions. Many of us who have practised medicine
over the past 20 or 30 years have been engaged in the process of trying
to promote health in Scotland, of almost preaching to people about health,
and we have not made any substantial changes at all.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Government has begun to promote health
in an effective way by publishing a number of papers. Sir David Carter
drew attention to these important initiatives in his report, which was
published last month. The white paper, "Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action
in Partnership", to which Alex Fergusson alluded, is very important in
terms of what we are going to do in the drugs field. A further initiative
is "Smoking Kills", which was published in December 1998.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sir David repeatedly drew attention to
inequalities as the first challenge that has to be faced in every aspect

the establishment of the working families tax credit, the &pound;100 allowance

with local authorities will begin to deal with some of the housing problems
that we are faced with.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to tell members briefly about the
initiatives that the Government has taken in the heart of my constituency
in Clackmannanshire, which is an area of some deprivation. For example,
&pound;2.7 million was made available for a social inclusion partnership
and will support some of the efforts in the drugs field to which Mr Fergusson
referred. The establishment of community schools, and the widening of that
initiative, is very important in terms of health. The promotion of a healthy
alliance, and the opportunity to establish a healthy living centre-for
which we have submitted a bid-will help as well. Henry McLeish's visit
to the constituency yesterday concentrated on the central problem of unemployment.
Unless we tackle unemployment, we will not give people the self-esteem
that is vital to good health. These initiatives contribute to a comprehensive
strategy to renew my constituency and to deal with Scottish health problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Phil Gallie seemed to be feeling under
some attack when he spoke earlier. I say to him, yes, the Conservatives
did spend a lot more money on health, but what was that money spent on?
The number of administrators was increased from 1,000 to over 12,000 under
the Conservative Government, so the money was spent on administration,
not on the appropriate issues that we need to address. We have already
tried to start rolling that process back.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Turning to a point made by Robert Brown,
there is one area into which I believe that we need to go further than-from
what the white paper says-the Executive is prepared to go and on which
we must provide clear leadership for the rest of the United Kingdom. The
white paper contains a strategy on tobacco, and that strategy is also spelled
out in "Smoking Kills". However, I do not believe that that strategy deals
adequately with the problem of passive smoking. Sir David Carter's report
states that, in North Lanarkshire, 43 per cent of people interviewed within
a week of a survey being done mentioned passive smoking. Such figures are
unacceptable, and we cannot tolerate passive smoking.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

more important, to help others help themselves.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Richard Simpson, a GP, must be very frustrated
by the fact that people have called in to his surgery, have been given
information and Health Education Board for Scotland leaflets and have gone
off without getting the message. That is the underlying point. No amount
of bureaucracy or additional task forces will easily address that question.
We have a huge wealth of information on health care and on health issues-they
are analysed to death in paper after paper. What we need is a proper campaign
from the Executive to get across the message of personal health care to
every individual. I agree with those who said earlier that that begins
in the ante-natal clinic.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab): </strong>Will
Mr Davidson give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Certainly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Karen Gillon: </strong>Does Mr Davidson agree
that there are unequivocal links between health, poverty, housing and transport?
The issues that he has identified in relation to personal choice are often
not ones of choice for individuals. Poverty is often the most important
factor affecting a person's health. Does his party acknowledge the link
between poverty and ill health?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Certainly. I would
not deny that in the slightest, but I would make the point that it is only
one of the factors. I do not dispute that some people are in poor housing,
or that some pensioners suffer because they happen to own their houses,
do not qualify for some benefits and therefore cannot afford to heat their
houses. We must be a bit more circumspect about cherry-picking health issues.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are talking about a major opportunity
for this Parliament, and I welcome the fact that the minister has come
here so early in the parliamentary year. However, there is point enough

of the people of Scotland? Mary Scanlon's amendment was about linking in
and trying to assist the individual.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Please can we move on. Conservatives care
as much as anybody else about the health of the people in Scotland. There
are limited resources in the health service and it can no longer afford
to pick up the tab for something that should have been cut off earlier
on. If the Government is going to invest in early years intervention, we
are with them. That will not only release resources for the future, but
will reduce personal discomfort and pain in later life. I second Mary Scanlon's

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands)
(SNP): </strong>We have just heard the speech which described what the Tories
wished they had said in their amendment. Mary Scanlon's amendment does
not do what Mr Davidson was talking about at all. If we read it properly,
it says that the Government's role is so diminished-and of course everyone
understands that the individual has a responsibility and that much of the
change that will happen will result from individuals changing their attitude
and action-and tries to ensure that Government's role in the process is
removed. Frankly, that is no good, because the whole point of what we are
trying to achieve today is to make a cohesive move forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Chisholm said that if we cannot read
the white paper, we should just look at the cover, with the picture of
a jigsaw. It is more apt than Mr Chisholm thinks: there is one piece missing,

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Today's debate has been constructive and
the content has been very good. I hope that the ministerial team will take
from my comments the broad context that the Scottish National party is
onside with many of the objectives and specific measures of the white paper.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We want, however, to see much more done.
I want to focus on a couple of key issues. The first is deprivation. We
all-even the Conservatives-accept the link between poverty and ill health.
We need to examine income distribution much more, and the have-nots in
society, not just the overall level of wealth in Scotland. I hope that,
in his summing-up speech, Iain Gray will answer the question about the
absence of a Government target for dampness in housing, the cuts in the
housing budget and the negative impact that that will have. If we want
to believe in joined-up Government, it would be interesting to know why&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">that target is
not there and what the Government will do about it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That brings me to resources. As we all
know, the coalition is being kept together on the grounds that we need
to find an extra &pound;80 million from a whole series of budgets. I would
like to quote not the white paper, but the green paper, "Working Together
for a Healthier Scotland". It says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The combined problems of low incomes,
unemployment, poor housing, a degraded environment, and high levels of
crime impose an additional burden of ill-health on many families."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They place</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"extreme stress on communities, families
and individuals."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think that everyone would agree with
that, but if that is the case, why will the Government be reducing the
budgets for many of the areas which will impact public health? I understand
that the health budget is to be ring-fenced, but what about the other budgets
being cut? That will surely have a negative impact.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The other matter which we want to examine
is that of local authorities, because much work is done in partnership.
If local authorities' spending is falling, as it most assuredly is, that
will also have a negative impact. Let us look at the whole picture in context.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On dental care, the minister correctly
identified the position on the problem regarding under-fives. We need urgent
action of course, but if we compare the target in the white paper with
what went before it in the green paper, we see that the green paper mentions
a target set in 1991 to reduce the incidence of dental disease in under-fives
by 60 per cent. That target was meant to be reached by 2000. In the white
paper, exactly the same target is set to be achieved by 2010. It is hardly
ambitious; it is simply a restatement of an earlier target that was not
reached. I understand that that is not purely the fault of this Administration,
but is something that those in the former Conservative Government should
take on board before they get too keen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another important aspect of dental care
is covered by the SNP's alternative, as is the point about free dental
check-ups being used to get the family norm moving by getting people to
concentrate on preventive care.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On smoking, Hugh Henry told us that he
was misled by the <i>Daily Record</i>. Perhaps he was not well represented-I
dare say he will get a few allies on this side of the chamber. It is important
to know where the Executive stands on this matter.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I associate myself with the remarks made
by Dr Simpson. We need to examine seriously what he said on the need for
urgent action and for taking more action than what the white paper proposes.&nbsp;</font></td>

happen. I look forward to the Government taking a much tougher line on
that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the Conservatives'-correct-obsession
with the situation surrounding drug abuse and misuse, the white paper calls
for a concerted national strategy. That is what I thought Scotland Against
Drugs was all about. It is a pity for us in the SNP that we are returning
to a situation where the funding for tackling drug misuse is not ring-fenced
as it has been before.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scottish National party welcomes what

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Iain Gray (Edinburgh Pentlands) (Lab):
</strong>If we are to show how serious we are about dealing with the big issues
in Scotland, we could not have begun today with a better subject. We have
shown, during the debate, that we are serious about Scotland's health.
After all, what could be more important than the health of our nation,
especially when we have so far to go? We know that from one city or town
to another-even from one street to another in those cities and towns-life
expectancy differs significantly. For a newborn child that one statistic
can mean as much as twice the chance of surviving to the age of 15. Such
inequality cannot continue. When we talk of deprivation, what is it that
our fellow Scots are deprived of? They are deprived of their health and
ultimately of life itself. Of course, we must tackle the poverty and inequality
that are at the root of those statistics.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sadly, there is no of course about it.
I am pleased that our debate has shown so much consensus. For almost 20
years the link between ill health and poverty and inequality was denied,
in the face of all the statistics and facts. However, I am saddened that
some of the speakers in the debate continue to try to deny that link or
to say that addressing individual responsibility is somehow mutually exclusive
with recognising that link. Those approaches are not mutually exclusive.
I refer Mrs Scanlon to paragraph 129 in the conclusion to the white paper,
in which individual responsibility is clearly flagged up. Saddest of all,
though, was the fact that David McLetchie was not only unable to engage
in consensus politics on such an issue but unable even to bear to watch
someone else engaged in consensus politics. David, those are the old ways
and everyone else&nbsp;</font></td>

I think that the Scottish people will leave you behind, as they have done
already.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I cite one example of how ways of thinking
must change. Several Conservative members, including Mrs Scanlon, have
made efforts to move in the direction of consensus. Mary said that health
spending is one third of our budget. This is the key to understanding the
new approach: the health department budget is one third of this Executive's
budget, but every budget is a health budget. I advise Tricia Marwick that
that is why our budgets include measures such as the warm deal and other
measures to improve Scotland's housing. That is part of our approach to
the issue of health.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tricia Marwick: </strong>Will Iain Gray confirm
that during its first three years this Labour Government will spend &pound;176
million less on housing in Scotland than the Tories did in their last three
years?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>I confirm that by the
end of our period in office we will have spent-if I remember the figure-&pound;600
million more than the budgets that we inherited. We are investing hundreds
of millions of pounds in order to build new houses and to improve our housing
stock.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Will Iain Gray give
way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>I should not take interventions
in a summing-up, and I have already taken one.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To make the real difference we must pursue
and develop effective partnerships. That is important. Those partnerships
will include general practitioners. In the course of my duties as Deputy
Minister for Community Care I have yet to find a focus group, but I have
spoken to many GPs and I have visited their practices. They are at the
centre of health promotion for us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I refer to page 38 of the white paper where
the role of primary care trusts and local health care is referred to specifically.
The Executive is at the moment co-funding a study to provide guidance to
improve early recognition by GPs of signs that might lead to suicide, which
is a problem that we take very seriously. Access to learning disability
nurses for each practice is a suggestion that I find attractive, but as
you will know, there is a learning disability review under way and I expect
that they will have a view on that, and we will take it forward. When it
comes to general practice, what we are about is breaking down barriers
between professions; we are not about promoting turf wars between different
parts of our health service, as it seemed Mary Scanlon was doing at one
stage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have to seek new and innovative ways
of working to our common purpose. One reason for that is to maximise resources.
The white paper pledges resources to this strategy, including resources
for HEBS-there is no question of cuts&nbsp;</font></td>

budgets. We could argue for a long time about resources, but I want to
say two things quite quickly. We are investing &pound;1.8 billion in our
health services over the next three years because it is one of our spending
priorities, and there must be priorities in spending. But I say to Phil
Gallie, whatever the previous Conservative Government invested in the health
service is essentially irrelevant because it did not work. The appalling
statistics that we are discussing and that are referred to in the white
paper are the statistics that we inherited from them. Perhaps-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Not in the last minute.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Perhaps if they had acknowledged
the underlying causes at the time, as both Robin Harper and Des McNulty
said, you would have had more impact.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Most crucially, we must engage with the
communities where the greatest impact must be made. Des McNulty and Robert
Brown made that point. We will lay regulations in this Parliament to ban
tobacco advertising. Yesterday I was in Wester Hailes, my own constituency,
where over 40 per cent of people smoke. I was launching "Breathe Easy,
A Guide to Stopping Smoking". It is a partnership between the Scottish
Executive, Lothian Health Board, Edinburgh University and the local community
health agency. It was produced by an expert, Irene Keltie, who lived in
Wester Hailes, worked in Wester Hailes, smoked in Wester Hailes and gave
up in Wester Hailes. It does not lecture but engages with the people it
tries to address. That is the kind of innovation and partnership approach
that we need to make what we are doing work.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When I left Wester Hailes Irene showed
me the pages of names of people that she had signed up to the cessation
programme in an hour. She said to me, "This is what it is about". It must
be what we are about as well. The Parliament has the power to make the
difference. The Executive is determined to pursue the delivery of this
strategy across all departmental and other boundaries. We have a real opportunity
today in this chamber to cut across our own traditional boundaries and
stand four-square for better health, for a better life and more of it for
all of Scotland's people. Let us take that chance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
