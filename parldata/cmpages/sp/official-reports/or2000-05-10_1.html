                I want to say was written by my sister, who is terminally ill.

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I welcome the Deputy 
                First Minister to his place. I know that he will not take it amiss 
                if I say that I hope that his stay in that place is brief, as 
                everyone in this Parliament wants to see the First Minister back 
                in action, fit and well, as soon as possible. [<I>Applause.</I>]</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I imagine that the 
                next two months will be interesting for the Deputy First Minister, 
                who is, I understand, the first Liberal in a position of power 
                since David Lloyd George. I certainly hope that those two months 
                will be more successful than the two days that he enjoyed in the 
                post a couple of weeks ago, when he managed to turn a massive 
                parliamentary majority&#151;with the exception of the Conservative 
                party, of course&#151;against the iniquity of sales by sheriff 
                warrant into a humbling of the Executive as it tried to stall 
                the process.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although many comments 
                were made about the Deputy First Minister's performance then, 
                nothing that the SNP or other parties had to say could compare 
                with the words attributed to one of his own colleagues in last 
                week's <I>Scotland on Sunday</I>, which reported:</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Liberal Democrats 
                were incensed that their leader had been made to look 'a right 
                plonker', as one of them colourfully put it.&quot;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that he is in a 
                position of authority and power, I hope that he will insist that, 
                as a bare minimum, his Labour colleagues do not conspire to make 
                him look a right plonker over the next two months.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, things could 
                be entirely different over the next two months. Perhaps the Deputy 
                First Minister will go back to the Liberal Democrat manifesto 
                on which he fought the elections a year ago. Perhaps we will have 
                an announcement that proportional representation for local government 
                will be delivered in this session of Parliament; perhaps the private 
                finance initiative will be swept away and replaced by something 
                more acceptable to the public interest; or perhaps there will 
                be a declaration against the unnecessary 1p reduction in income 
                tax so that that money can be invested in public services.</font></P>

                a surprise to those on the Labour benches, but only a few weeks 
                ago Jim Wallace and I were together in the House of Commons lobbies 
                on a joint Liberal Democrat-SNP motion against the 1p reduction 
                in income tax, calling for the money to be invested in public 
                services. As we marched through the lobbies together, I wondered 
                whether, at some point in the shuttle journey from Scotland to 
                London, Jim had been transformed from a Government loyalist to 
                a rebel back bencher. I hope that, now that he is in charge, the

                I develop the point. [M<FONT SIZE="-1">EMBERS</FONT>: &quot;What 
                point?&quot;] Here it is: perhaps the signs of rebellion have 
                started already. On the radio this morning, the Minister for Rural 
                Affairs was asked about the damage that the strength of sterling 
                was doing to the food exporting industry in Scotland. His first 
                answer&#151;that there was not much that he could do about it&#151;did 
                not surprise me. However, I sat up, took notice and desperately 
                scribbled down his next comment: he said that there was a desperate 
                need for a currency realignment. He also said that he had made 
                clear to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in no uncertain terms 
                the difficulties that the strength of sterling was causing for 
                the food processing industry in Scotland.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was trying to imagine 
                the confrontation in 11 Downing Street between the Minister for 
                Rural Affairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Captain Mainwaring 
                was telling General Brown, &quot;Something must be done about 
                the strength of sterling and the food processing industry in Scotland.&quot; 
                Gordon Brown was replying, &quot;Don't panic, don't panic&#151;something 
                will be done in time.&quot;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am hoping for a change 
                in direction in the two months that the Liberal Democrats are 
                in charge of the Executive. However, I fear that we will continue 
                with the past year's muddle and confusion, which has stretched 
                from special advisers to the resignation of Lord Hardie and from 
                the Holyrood project to the debacle on warrant sales two weeks

                that his failure to prevent the SNP group from vetoing George

                to the Liberal Democrats, I should have made a leadership instruction.

                vote for the Holyrood project, I would have thought that one of 
                those members would want to step forward and take charge of the 
                project over the next few months.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To get back to the 
                muddle and confusion of the Executive parties, I think that we 
                can say, after a year, that two things are absolutely certain. 
                Those things may have been matters of debate in the Scottish Parliament 
                elections one year ago, but they are beyond debate now.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, there was the 
                argument&#151;replayed in the Executive's amendment today&#151;that 
                the constitutional settlement represented the &quot;settled will&quot; 
                of the Scottish people. I reflected, when I saw that amendment, 
                that the Deputy First Minister&#151;the acting First Minister&#151;is, 
                nominally at least, a federalist, so I was not clear how he could 
                believe that the current settlement represented the settled will 
                of the Scottish people. None the less, we now have substantial 
                evidence that the Scottish people, by a majority of three to one&#151;across 
                every political party's support&#151;do not share a belief in 
                the fixed point in time that is suggested by the Executive parties. 
                According to the BBC poll, people in Scotland want more powers 
                for the Scottish Parliament. We know that that must be true, because 
                even Tom McCabe, the Minister for Parliament, seized the initiative 
                on the radio yesterday morning and said that, of course, the Parliament 
                could develop in time and, of course, this was a process, not 
                a once-and-for-all event.</font></P>

                is welcomed and appreciated by the people of Scotland? The process 
                of our democracy, here in Scotland, will take place within the 
                benefits of a United Kingdom, but not after we have been ripped

                for Finance was asked exactly the same question on the radio this 
                morning, he did not give that position, but said merely that the 
                Parliament would grow; he did not mention the powers. So, according 
                to the Minister for Finance, we will grow, but not necessarily

                much boasting from the SNP benches, but a glance at the Scottish 
                opinion polls, or the by-election results, or the local election 
                results, would indicate that the SNP is alive and kicking and 
                overtaking the Labour party across Scotland. I think that we can 
                dispense with Lord Robertson's forecast. Some of us, of course,

                centre of what the Executive claimed in its programme that it 
                could do. I want to look at the economy and how it is performing 
                in Scotland. I want to look at public services and I want to look 
                at the reality of what is happening in local government services 
                round Scotland.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The economy is the 
                major boast of the new Labour party. According to Gordon Brown, 
                the economy is undergoing an unprecedented boom. The reality in 
                Scotland is that we now have fewer than 300,000 manufacturing 
                jobs for the first time since the industrial revolution&#151;that 
                is the reality of what is happening in the Scottish economy under 
                the governance of the new Labour party in London and in Scotland. 
                Of course, the argument that is made by the Executive is that 
                a decline in manufacturing employment is inevitable; it is to 
                be accepted in the modern world. How is it, then, that manufacturing 
                employment has increased in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and 
                Ireland over the past few years? They are all small, independent 
                countries in Europe.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we pointed out last 
                week, the Labour party spent 18 years in opposition telling the 
                Tory Government that the real unemployment figures were the International 
                Labour Organisation figures, not the claimant count. On those 
                real figures, Scottish unemployment is 7.5 per cent, which means 
                that 189,000 people are unemployed. If one looks round Europe, 
                one will see that we are not a country of low unemployment. On 
                comparable ILO figures, unemployment is lower in Luxembourg, the 
                Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Portugal, Denmark, 
                Ireland and Sweden, all of which are small, independent countries

                success, the Scottish economy is suffering huge economic underperformance; 
                there have been missed opportunities by the barra load, which 
                means lost opportunities for individuals round Scotland. Only 
                today, another 200 textile jobs in Kilmarnock have gone. As the 
                Minister for Rural Affairs was forced to recognise this morning, 
                the strength of sterling is an albatross round the neck of the

                told by the minister that health spending on medical equipment 
                did not decline from £100 million to £25 million, but declined 
                from £49 million during the Tory years to £25 million last year 
                under Labour. Admittedly, spending on medical spending is now

                I can say that everything ain't all right in the north-east of

                wonder whether the unionist ministers recognise the absurdity 
                of their position. The Minister for Children and Education says 
                that Scotland can run its education system but cannot run its 
                economy. The Minister for Health and Community Care says that 
                Scotland can run its health service better but cannot run its 
                social security system. Wendy Alexander thinks that she can run 
                everything better, but does not think that Scotland should have 
                European representation in its own right. That is an absurd position 
                and an unsustainable argument&#151;it will not stand the test 
                of time.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we debate the 
                future of Scotland, we are debating not the end destination, but 
                the time scale. A majority of the supporters of every political 
                party in Scotland believes that the Parliament will have more 
                power in the future. The Minister for Parliament thinks that the 
                Parliament will have more power within the context of the United 
                Kingdom. I believe that we are engaged in a process whose destination 
                is Scottish freedom and independence.</font></P>

                in the whole Parliament and in their constituencies have been 
                active in moving Scotland forward; regrets that the Executive 
                has failed to match the positive approach of Scotland during the 
                referendum campaign of 1997 and the continuing mood of Scotland 
                for radical change and progress; notes that in particular there 
                is a crisis in manufacturing, a reduction in local authority services 
                including housing, a lowering of morale in the education and health 
                services, growing impoverishment of the elderly, the reliance 
                on expensive PFI for public investment, a deterioration in the

                genuine consultation and good governance and a general confusion

                support of a majority of Scots for increased power for our Parliament 
                to tackle these problems; notes that independence and equality

                that the past 12 months have been a time of momentous change in 
                Scotland. A year ago this week, the Scottish Parliament&#151;which 
                was adjourned in 1707&#151;reconvened. That, for many of us, was 
                the achievement of a goal that had been fought for long and hard. 
                It was the start of a new and greater challenge for us all: to 
                make the Parliament work and to make it different and very much 
                better than what had gone before.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At an early stage, 
                we endorsed the principles that were set out by the consultative 
                steering group, which was chaired by Henry McLeish. Those principles 
                are: the sharing of power between the people, Parliament and the 
                Executive; accountability, openness and participation; and the 
                need to promote equal opportunities for everybody in all we do.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have embraced new 
                technology, not only in our voting system, but through the publication 
                of our proceedings and reports on the internet and through the 
                use of video-conferencing to link parliamentarians and constituents. 
                Parliament's committees have established themselves and have been 
                crucial to the achievement of greater power sharing, accountability 
                and openness in a way that is unrecognisable to the old hands 
                of Westminster.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members will recall&#151;as 
                I do&#151;that in February, the Equal Opportunities Committee 
                made a powerful case for including a question on religion in the 
                census. The Executive listened and changed its position and in 
                March the Parliament passed amending legislation, which now has 
                royal assent. In next year's census, there will be a question 
                on religion. In Westminster, the parallel bill languishes on a 
                long list of bills that are objected to regularly on Friday afternoons.</font></P>

                if all we did with our new Parliament was to transplant Westminster

                the opportunities that a system of proportional representation 
                would bring in challenging the parties to work together in partnership.

                was incomplete legislation and that it said that the Executive 
                ought to introduce legislation that would fill the gaps in Mr 
                Sheridan's bill. That committee took the view that we should pass 
                the bill and introduce a new bill. The Executive took the view 
                that we should not pass the bill, but still introduce a new one.

                grandiosely styled the debate as the &quot;State of the Nation&quot;. 
                Last week, we were led to believe that this was to be a debate 
                on Scottish independence. True to form, the SNP has reined back. 
                &quot;Independence&quot; creeps into its motion in line 10, where 
                we are asked to note it. In Alex Salmond's speech, the word crept 
                in at 10 minutes. At last year's election, independence ranked 
                only 10<SUP>th</SUP> on the SNP's list of priorities.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The people of Scotland 
                identify the SNP with one policy only, but the trouble with the 
                SNP is that it cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be 
                identified with that one policy. Only two months ago, Alex Neil&#151;who 
                was not here for the beginning of Alex Salmond's speech, which 
                might be significant&#151;said:</font></P>

                our policy'.&quot;</font></P>

                and the old ideas, the debate has moved on. At election after 
                election, the overwhelming majority of Scots vote for parties 
                that reject independence. Even in its motion, the SNP does not

                of which was by ICM for <I>The Scotsman</I>&#151;came to the conclusion 
                that 91 per cent of the population believe that the Parliament 
                has achieved little or nothing to date. Only the other day, in 
                a System 3 poll for the BBC, only 27 per cent of respondents thought 
                the performance to date of the Parliament was &quot;quite good&quot;.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ian Jenkins: </strong>Does 
                the member agree with that? The performance of the Parliament

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>David McLetchie: 
                </strong>I will come to that, because I will draw an important distinction 
                between the performance of members of the Parliament and the performance 
                of the Scottish Executive. That distinction is not frequently 
                made.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Executive's friends 
                and colleagues do not think it is doing much of a job either. 
                We see Labour members of the Parliament queuing up to distance 
                themselves from the Scottish Executive, presumably because they 
                fear&#151;rightly&#151;that its performance to date will cost 
                them their seats at the next general election. I have no wish 
                to intrude on those private feuds, but&#151;this is Mr Jenkins's 
                point&#151;I am angry and concerned that, in everyday parlance, 
                it is the Parliament that has to take the public blame for the 
                failures of the Scottish Executive, although it is the Executive 
                that has damaged the reputation of the Parliament. The people 
                in charge, not the institution, are at fault.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is a commonly held 
                view that politicians are more concerned with their own interests 
                than those of ordinary people. I think that that is, generally, 
                an unfair perception. The Executive, however, seems to be waging 
                a campaign not to change that perception but to reinforce it. 
                Accordingly, the number of ministers in Scotland enjoying the 
                perks, privileges and salaries of office has quadrupled, going 
                up from five three years ago under the previous Conservative Administration

                on the eve of one of the most important trials in Scottish legal 
                history, appoint himself to the bench and bring our legal system

                only to pander to the sectional interests of the politically correct. 
                The Executive has shown breathtaking arrogance in its handling 
                of the repeal of section 28. It has ridden roughshod over mainstream 
                opinion in Scotland and ignored completely the views of parents 
                on the issue. So much for the culture of consultation of which 
                the Deputy First Minister boasts. What bewilders people is that 
                the Executive happens to believe that the repeal of section 28 
                is worthy of parliamentary attention when there are many other 
                pressing problems for the Parliament to address.</font></P>

                to other fringe issues, such as land reform and fox hunting, which 
                are not high on most people's list of priorities and are hardly 
                the talk of the steamie. In contrast, rising crime is at the top 
                of almost everybody's list of priorities. What is the Executive's 
                response? It has cut the number of police officers, it is closing 
                three prisons and it has presided over an increase in the number 
                of dangerous criminals who are released early from prison. The 
                figures show that our acting First Minister has meekly accepted 
                a 10 per cent reduction in his department's budget.</font></P>

                something. As the budget consultation paper that was published 
                the other week shows, the justice department's budget is down 
                from £589 million last year to £528 million this year. If the 
                Deputy First Minister cannot win an argument in Cabinet on behalf 
                of his department, how can he expect to lead that Cabinet? He

                the budget document shows, is only £270 million&#151;14 per cent 
                of the tax revenues. Considering the taxes motorists pay, the 
                very least they are entitled to is a fair level of spending on 
                developing the roads network, yet in the budget document we see 
                that spending on new motorways and trunk roads in Scotland has 
                been cut from £120 million in 1996-97 to a derisory £18 million

                are all wedded to the same politically correct agenda. That Lib-Lab-Nat 
                pact is failing Scotland. On section 28, on transport and on land

                of parents, to tax ordinary family motorists off the road with 
                new tolls and taxes, and to fiddle with irrelevancies such as

                McLetchie will recall that there have been two opportunities in

                motion on genetically modified foods, on which the Tories abstained 
                and saved the Executive. The second was on warrant sales, when 
                the Tories supported the Executive even when everybody else in 
                the Parliament had deserted it. How can that be described as opposition?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>David McLetchie: 
                </strong>It has to be said, Mr Salmond, that we judge issues on their 
                merits: there is no opposition for opposition's sake. We opposed 
                those motions because we do not believe in them and they were 
                not in our manifesto. We stick to our policies and principles 
                in this Parliament and we vote accordingly. We will not ally simply

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The truth of the matter 
                in relation to the euro is that the SNP wants us to join a sinking

                with surrendering control of our economy to unaccountable bankers 
                in Frankfurt who will be more concerned with what goes on in Berlin 
                than what goes on in Bellshill, with Paris rather than Paisley, 
                and with Athens rather than Aberdeen. Not for the first time, 
                I agree with Jim Sillars in his conclusion that the SNP's headlong 
                rush into a European super-state will sound the death knell for

                along in 1999, it had revised that prediction to accept that a 
                deficit of £1 billion would exist in this financial year. No matter 
                what excuses SNP members have for that, and no matter how they

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>In 
                1997, the SNP accounted for debt repayments of around £4 billion. 
                In other words, there was an acceptance then that an independent 
                Scotland would take with it a proportion of the UK national debt. 
                For the purposes of the Scottish election campaign, the SNP conveniently 
                forgot about that. It lost that debt and decided that an independent 
                Scotland would not be liable for a share of the UK debt burden. 
                Again, no matter what arguments are used to justify it, there 
                can be no denying that two years can make a big difference to 
                accounting practices in the SNP. Does the SNP seriously think

                basis of an oil price of $25 per barrel. Given the erratic nature 
                of oil prices, which varied between $10 and $20 a barrel in 1999, 
                what would the SNP do in times of low oil prices? Spending on 
                priority public services, such as education and health, would

                am not saying that, and I will go on to answer that point. The

                Let us take a warning from our friends in Quebec. There, voters 
                have rejected independence in two referendums, but still the nationalist 
                party comes back for more. It is a neverendum&#151;the concept 
                that John Swinney advocated as a model for Scotland. The poor 
                voters of Quebec will be required to go in and out of the polling 
                booths until they deliver the desired result, and that could happen 
                in Scotland too.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the meantime, there 
                is economic instability, and uncertainty is the result. Decisions 
                about investment are stymied and minority communities are unsure 
                of their future. A divisive tone is set by the suggestion that 
                someone is a true patriot only if they support an independent 
                state. I reject that, as does this Parliament and the people. 
                The SNP talks about Scotland being a normal small European state. 
                What would be normal about the costs and upheavals that would 
                be required to bring about a separate state?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is normal is being 
                a powerful member state of the European Union&#151;like Spain, 
                Germany and France&#151;in which regional and national autonomy 
                is combined with a strong voice on the international stage and 
                in which decisions are taken at the appropriate level, combined 
                with economies of scale. Most of all, it is about the focus not 
                being on constant preoccupation with constitutional trivia and 
                navel gazing, but on most people's priorities: new schools, new 
                hospital developments, the lowest unemployment for decades and 
                a strong and growing economy. That record of achievement will 
                carry Labour and its Liberal Democrat partners to election victory 
                and the SNP&#151;with its policy of independence&#151;to election 
                defeat.</font></P>

                (LD): </strong>Today there is a palpable excitement on the Scottish 
                National party benches, as the word independence has been mentioned. 
                However, it is very sad that so far&#151;with the exception of 
                Fiona Hyslop towards the end of her speech&#151;there is a palpable 
                reluctance to debate what independence means.</font></P>

                like to thank the SNP for allowing us to examine the core issue 
                of its belief in a separate and independent Scotland. Although 
                we have to deal with the turmoil of daily political life&#151;constituency 
                work and so on&#151;at the end of the day, politics is about competing 
                ideals and the different visions that we in this chamber put forward

                face at home, the top priority and the No 1 issue for the SNP

                do not agree with it. I think that we are moving logically and 
                naturally within the United Kingdom towards a federal end result, 
                which is the alternative to independence that is being presented. 
                Iain McWhirter claims that the SNP is also moving towards that 
                position.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The nationalism that

                independence in Europe. It is designed not to frighten the horses. 
                The SNP may soon follow the Welsh and forget about independence 
                altogether. However, others say that independence has been restored 
                to its central role. In today's debate, we have not yet dealt 
                with the consequences of independence, except in Allan Wilson's 
                excellent speech, so I will do so.</font></P>

                support for housing benefit. Far from contributing towards finding 
                solutions to problems on a common basis, the SNP wants to up the 
                drawbridge and opt out of the whole thing. Liberal Democrats cannot

                Independence is not freedom; borders are not freedom. Our freedom,

                Alex Salmond as a &quot;potato president&quot; or a &quot;putative 
                president&quot;. Much of what Alex Salmond said today could be 
                described as being the words of a potato president. He spoke for

                not using its powers properly. What was her conclusion? Not that

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today's debate is, 
                in a sense, a political expedient to protect Alex Salmond. We

                unhappy that Alex will not put independence back at the top of 
                the agenda. In the language of SNP members, we hear what they 
                really think about this Parliament. They call it a &quot;pretend 
                Parliament&quot;, not a real Parliament. It is a difficult situation 
                for Alex Salmond; I sympathise with him. He tries to talk about 
                the achievements of the Parliament, but he is dragged back by 
                people who say that it is a pretend Parliament that is doing nothing.</font></P>

                SNP wants the Parliament to work, it should want to make happen

                not wasted any opportunities to denigrate and to make facile comments 
                about many of the things that have happened. We need consider 
                only one example. Mike Russell launched himself into condemning 
                the Parliament for awarding medals, saying, &quot;This is a disgrace&#151;you're 
                just in and you've voted to award yourselves medals. What have 
                you done to deserve it?&quot; He said that, irrespective of the 
                fact that that decision had not been taken by the Parliament, 
                and was made before the election. Is that the same Mike Russell 
                who, shortly thereafter, took £2,800&#151;the equivalent of the 
                cost of 56 medals&#151;from the Parliament to go on a trip to 
                India? Where is Mike Russell's consistency in those circumstances?</font></P>

                to other parties but, at the same time, they will say quite clearly

                Apart from the subsidy to Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd, 
                the powers and plans are pathetic&#151;the Executive has nothing 
                to say on the privatisation of National Air Traffic Services. 
                Aviation is important to us as a nation, given our geographic 
                location and the fact that we now have a truly global economy. 
                Why are both Ireland and Iceland, with smaller populations, better 
                served for direct flights? The Executive is not flying high: as 
                far as aviation is concerned, it is grounded on the runway.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On maritime issues, 
                it is absurd that, at the start of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century, 
                an island nation such as Scotland finds that its main ferry port 
                for exports is Hull, a town located many miles away in a neighbouring 
                country, and accessed by a poor road network. Links to the continent 
                were superior before the union, never mind before the Executive. 
                Why was it easier to get to Europe in the days of sail than it 
                is now with the new generation of fast ships? Far from having 
                the wind behind it, the Executive has not even set sail.</font></P>

                is more the minister for potholes. Studies aplenty have been carried 
                out; in fact, such is her fondness for consultancies that we have 
                studies into studies. As I have said before, how many studies

                of Scotland) (Con): </strong>I want to begin by sharing with members 
                an extract from an article that I found in a journal just last 
                night. The article states:</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The promises 
                made during the devolution debate will leave a dangerous legacy 
                for First Minister Donald Dewar and Labour. They promised us the 
                world . . . and they must now deliver for fear of voters seeing 
                Holyrood as a gumsy dog that's all bark, with Millbank controlling 
                the bite.&quot;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the entire year 
                preceding the election for this Parliament last May, I warned 
                anyone who would listen that the promises being made by senior 
                politicians in the Labour party on what a Scottish Parliament 
                would deliver for the people of Scotland were not only unrealistic, 
                but dangerously irresponsible.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been repeating 
                that warning ever since, because in the never-ending search for 
                votes, the fantasy was fed&#151;on a diet of ever-increasing pledges&#151;that 
                the electorate's delivery of a new Labour Executive would for 
                ever rid Scotland of all her ills and deliver to her people a 
                paradise of which they had only dreamed.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The electorate delivered 
                that Executive and even got something that they did not ask for 
                and did not really deserve: a prop-up mechanism to make sure that 
                Labour always got its way, called the Liberal Democrats.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is no wonder that 
                the electorate are somewhat disillusioned: they have an Executive

                three hours to debate the vital subject of Scotland's preparedness 
                for the millennium bug and, if my memory serves me right, the

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This Executive has 
                some queer sense of priorities and of democracy; and frankly it 
                has been some let-down for Scotland's people.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The pity is that, as 
                the start of the Scottish National party motion points out, the 
                individual MSPs, the committees and the Parliament are working 
                actively and remarkably well to move Scotland forward post-devolution. 
                As David McLetchie pointed out, the tragedy is that neither the 
                press nor the public yet distinguish between the Executive and 
                the Parliament: what we have is a Parliament that is working, 
                but an Executive that is failing time after time to deliver the 
                impossible dream that it fostered and promoted.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I agree with the first 
                part of the SNP motion. However, the SNP predictably falls into 
                the same trap that has become Labour's curse: it promises the 
                earth through independence and &quot;equality of status&quot;, 
                which I think is a relatively new phrase. Although I certainly 
                agree that it will be up to the Scottish people to determine Scotland's 
                constitutional future as far as independence is concerned, I will 
                strongly argue about this &quot;equality of status&quot; business. 
                It is abundantly clear, even to a country lad such as me, that 
                our present constitutional status&#151;as a country with its own

                </strong>There is no split on our benches. I am sure that we will have

                me that in poll after poll, and&#151;most important&#151;in election 
                after election, the people of Scotland have voted consistently 
                and overwhelmingly against the SNP's separatist view and in favour

                usually a good start to any speech&#151;to a couple of old rockers 
                in the Scottish National party ranks. I taunted those old rockers 
                just after the national council, when John Swinney was going about 
                like a Cheshire cat and Alex Salmond like a dog with two tails; 
                they were really pleased with themselves. I put it to the old 
                rockers that the battle for independence was lost and the union 
                was safe. They told me, &quot;You must be joking. Watch this space.&quot; 
                That is why we are having this debate today. The issue has been

                won and who lost. There is no doubt who is in charge on the back

                is a fair summary of the performance of the SNP over the past

                disaster and gloat over misfortune. Why? It has been said already&#151;because 
                they want the Parliament to fail. They need it to fail, and they 
                are doing everything in their power to see that it fails. They 
                have voted against more money for the national health service 
                and for education; they voted against scrapping tuition fees. 
                The motion is a sad reflection of the SNP's priorities. Independence 
                is above everything else&#151;above jobs, above schools, above

                has cost our shipbuilding communities dear. We are not surprised 
                to have come full circle, because how does the SNP negotiate independence 
                at the same time as it negotiates a share of the Ministry of Defence 
                contracts for Yarrow's and Ferguson's in Govan? How can it do 
                that? When push comes to shove, there can be no doubt. If it is 
                a choice between the workers in Govan and independence, the SNP 
                has made its case quite clear: it is independence, and to hell

                (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): </strong>I support the positive 
                and constructive amendment lodged by Jim Wallace. There is no 
                doubt that our Parliament, working together with the Scottish 
                Executive, has in its first year achieved a great deal for the 
                people of Scotland. I should like to highlight some of the achievements 
                so far.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bringing the process 
                of government closer to the people is one achievement, and it 
                is essential. When the Rural Affairs Committee travelled to the 
                community of Laid in Sutherland, I was most impressed by the residents' 
                moving reaction to the fact that we had come to their small community 
                to hear their views on land reform&#151;land reform, David McLetchie&#151;and 
                community development. They made the point that that would never 
                have happened with Westminster. I would like to remind David McLetchie 
                that land reform is important to the people of the Highlands and 
                Islands, but as usual he is not listening.</font></P>

                I am on that point, I suggest that this chamber would rightly 
                resist any attempt to interfere in the good work of the committees. 
                I see John McAllion in the chamber. I would like to highlight 
                the good work that he, as convener of the Public Petitions Committee,

                that the Executive is giving for the abolition of tuition fees, 
                and the boom that that has produced in our colleges. I quote <I>The

                Scotland) (SNP): </strong>This is perhaps one of those debates in which 
                more heat than light is generated. One of my greatest experiences 
                in politics was the referendum two years ago, when Scotland took 
                a giant leap forward by setting up this Parliament. It was the 
                crossing of the Rubicon, which put the negative politics of fear 
                of the Conservatives behind us.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am disappointed that 
                many of the tactics that the Conservatives used against devolution 
                are being employed to argue against independence. It is important 
                to recognise that, if we in Scotland trust ourselves to run Scotland 
                in limited ways under devolution, we should trust ourselves in 
                all things. Surely if we can trust ourselves part of the way, 
                there is nothing to stop us trusting ourselves all of the way.</font></P>

                to be a successful country in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. In 
                1977, Norway and Scotland were eeksie-peeksie and had identical 
                GDPs per head. Today, Norway is 25 per cent richer. What did Norway 
                do in 1977 that Scotland did not? The Norwegians discovered oil; 
                we discovered oil. They used it, but we failed to embrace the 
                opportunity it gave us.</font></P>

                the former Militant activist, who is now a squeaky new Labour

                look around to see what is happening in some of the progressive 
                European countries, rather than wedding himself to a 19<SUP>th</SUP>-century

                thank Andrew Wilson for that point. It shows that pluralism can

                the fact that in Denmark the rate of tax as a percentage of GDP 
                is 48 per cent higher than it is in the UK?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Denmark 
                makes that choice because it has the opportunity to do that. Many 
                countries in Europe have lower taxes. Scotland might want to make 
                that choice if we had the opportunity. I suggest that, if we had 
                the chance, Robert Brown might find that we have more in common 
                than he does with the right-wingers in the Labour party who argue 
                for cuts in tax. The point is that independence and normal status 
                would give us the opportunity to make that choice. I would be 
                interested to hear whether the federal model that the Liberal 
                Democrats have invented today would give us that ability. We have 
                not heard a word about what that would mean or what its powers 
                might be.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would say to Duncan 
                McNeil&#151;who has left the chamber, but I hope not for long&#151;that 
                I understand his concerns for manufacturing and I know that he 
                has a trade union background. However, when he slags off the 1979 
                no-confidence vote, I would point out that he is in coalition 
                with a party that voted with the SNP on that occasion. Since Labour 
                came to power, 22,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost. For the 
                first time in history, there are more people employed in manufacturing 
                in Ireland than there are in Scotland. Ireland has a population 
                far smaller than ours, yet it is generating more jobs in manufacturing. 
                Duncan McNeil should focus on that and consider his trade union 
                background. There are far more things that we could be doing as 
                a normal part of Europe than we can constrained within the United

                in Switzerland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria and Norway. 
                Even Sweden, Denmark, Portugal and Ireland have lower unemployment. 
                We must ask what powers devolution gave us that are different 
                from those we had before. What can we do now to tackle the problem 
                of unemployment? Creating legislation cannot tackle unemployment;

                all, that is the party's only substantial policy, even if it is 
                substantially wrong. However, it is surprising that it should 
                have taken the SNP so long to lodge such a motion. Perhaps the

                of the Scottish public who have continually made clear their unwillingness 
                to vote for independence, or should they concentrate on undermining 
                the Scottish Parliament, placing before it motions on reserved 
                matters, arguing that more devolution would be better and hoping 
                that that would eventually lead to the separation of Scotland

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider some of the 
                issues that the SNP has chosen to debate over the past year: the 
                Act of Settlement, air traffic control and the Barnett formula. 
                Those are all reserved matters. That is evidence of the SNP's 
                reluctance to accept the settled will of the Scottish people and

                a devolved Parliament within the UK. However, for the separatists

                I was fascinated by Kenny MacAskill's invocation of the late Bobby 
                Kennedy as some kind of prophet of Scottish independence. I tried 
                hard to make that leap of imagination, to see Scotland not as 
                it is, but as it might be. Try as I might, I cannot quite see 
                Scotland as an island, as Kenny described it in his speech. When 
                I was at school, it was Britain that was entirely surrounded by 
                water, not Scotland. At my dad's knee in Springburn, I learned 
                an old Irish song, in which the Irish pitied the Scots because

                by water. That leap of imagination has always been central to 
                the politics of the SNP but, in speeches by the likes of Kenny 
                MacAskill, it sometimes gets out of control.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The core of the SNP's 
                argument is that the only possible Government for a successful 
                Scotland is an independent one, with what it describes as equality 
                of status with the other countries in Europe. Indeed, I heard 
                Andrew Wilson on the radio this morning, arguing&#151;in an attempt 
                not to frighten anyone&#151;that the SNP's demands are really 
                very modest. All it is asking for is normal status in Europe.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But that is not the 
                only choice available to Scotland. It is not the only choice available 
                in Europe. Independence is certainly a choice; it is a choice 
                that has been taken recently by many European countries: Lithuania, 
                Estonia and Latvia, to name a few. However, there are other choices. 
                The people of Catalonia and of Bavaria and of the L&auml;nder 
                in east and west Germany went down another road. They chose home 
                rule; they chose self-government. They chose autonomy within a 
                multinational state, because that state also brought benefits 
                to the people in those countries.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scotland has a choice 
                of futures. As my old friend George Galloway used to put it, we 
                can choose to use Vilnius as the model for the future of Edinburgh, 
                or we can choose to use Barcelona. No offence to Vilnius, but 
                I would like Edinburgh to be seen in terms of a city such as Barcelona.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It may well be that 
                62 per cent of Scottish voters want the Parliament to have more 
                power, but that does not mean that they want an independent Parliament 
                in Scotland. There are many different terminuses between where 
                we are now and independence at the end of the road. The Scots 
                do not want to go all the way to the end of the road.</font></P>

                to glance at the opinion polls for evidence that the SNP is in 
                line with the people. Look at yesterday's opinion polls. On the 
                question of voting intentions in a Westminster election, a Labour 
                lead of 11 percentage points over the SNP in March has been turned 
                into a lead of 18 percentage points. That does not sound to me 
                as if the Scottish people are inexorably on the march towards 
                independence.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ian Bell, one of the

                anyone that it is still relevant to the Westminster contest. That

                Scottish Parliament showed no overwhelming support for the SNP 
                position&#151;on the first and second votes, the SNP and Labour 
                were virtually neck and neck. The critical point is that neither 
                the SNP nor Labour is in any position to win an outright majority 
                of seats in this Parliament. With the proportional representation 
                system, no party will win a majority of seats. That would have 
                been unlikely with the old four-party system, and it is even less 
                likely with the six-party system that we have now.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reason why the 
                SNP has had what is the equivalent of the clause 4 debate that 
                took place in the Labour party is that its members know that the 
                game is up. Never again will they be able to make the old argument 
                that when the SNP wins an election, it will negotiate independence. 
                Now they talk about growing gradually towards independence and 
                having a referendum.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SNP will require 
                the support of voters of every party to secure independence but 
                it will not admit that to its fundamentalist supporters. That 
                is why we have heard all the rhetoric of independence this afternoon. 
                I see that Margo MacDonald is not here. I hope that she was not 
                told to stay away. She would not tell the same story that Alex

                and Bute) (LD): </strong>This has been our first chance to debate the 
                SNP's flagship policy of independence, and it has been illuminating. 
                It has highlighted the contradictions at the heart of SNP policy: 
                contradictions in its ideas about the route map to independence, 
                the kind of Scotland it would want after independence and whether 
                to be constructive in the Parliament. The SNP's answer to everything 
                has been that independence would deliver the promised land. Yet, 
                as many speakers have already highlighted, independence was No 
                10 in the party's list of priorities and has been well camouflaged 
                in today's debate. Alex Salmond mentioned it only three times.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is independence to 
                be achieved by the fundamentalist route or the gradualist route? 
                John McAllion highlighted that problem in his speech. The SNP's 
                latest position&#151;a referendum after the next Scottish election, 
                leading to independence by 2007&#151;was endorsed by only 60 per 
                cent of the membership at the recent SNP national council meeting.

                Which ones voted against him with Margo MacDonald and Alex Neil, 
                neither of whom is in the chamber today?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another major contradiction 
                is what kind of country this independent Scotland would be. Would 
                it be a low-tax, deregulated economy or a European model of high 
                taxation and high regulation? We are often told, and have been 
                told in today's debate, that we should emulate Denmark, Norway 
                or Sweden. Alex Salmond said at a Scottish Council Development 
                and Industry event last night that we must adopt radical reforms 
                and cut corporation tax and business rates. How can that position 
                be squared with the SNP front benchers' promise of more than £3 
                billion of extra public spending?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What about the SNP's 
                much-trumpeted comparisons with other small European countries? 
                Alex Salmond believes that we should emulate the Irish example: 
                low personal and corporation tax and an open economy. However, 
                as I tried to explain to an earlier speaker, Ireland has a health 
                service that is means-tested at £11,250.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More recently, SNP 
                spokesmen have trumpeted the example of countries such as Denmark, 
                Finland and Norway, which they claim have high levels of investment 
                in public services. What the SNP does not say is that direct and 
                indirect taxes in those countries as a proportion of gross domestic 
                product are 46 per cent higher in Denmark than in Scotland, 33 
                per cent higher in Finland and 20 per cent higher in Norway. How 
                does Alex Salmond square that level of tax with his supposed aim 
                of making Scotland a low-tax, business-friendly economy to compare 
                with the economy of Ireland? That is a complete contradiction. 
                What kind of country would independent Scotland be?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SNP claims that 
                it wants the Parliament to work, yet George Reid, who wants to 
                take on the job of setting up our future home, the Holyrood building, 
                was barred from doing so by a majority vote at the SNP parliamentary 
                group meeting. That puts political opportunism before the survival 
                and success of the Parliament. That should have been a non-party

                Yet when the spotlight is on nationalist policies there is nothing 
                there but contradiction, opportunism and a party riven between 
                fundamentalists and gradualists. There is nothing that will deliver

                am trying to do that. Mr Salmond says that, in that poll, an allegedly 
                small sample of Conservatives wanted more power; however, more 
                power is not synonymous with independence. As I understand it, 
                independence is the political agenda of his party. If Mr Salmond 
                insists on using my winding-up speech time to advance the arguments 
                that he should have proposed during his lead speech, as I have

                Mr Salmond a persuasive set of arguments for independence, I have 
                heard and seen nothing on that subject. Indeed, a most uncharacteristic 
                and blushing coyness overtook Mr Salmond because, I suspect, he 
                detects from the Scottish people no hunger for independence, no 
                interest in becoming the highest-taxed part of the United Kingdom, 
                no interest in flinging to the four winds the defence of the nation&#151;relying 
                for defence on an unconvincing hotch-potch of half-baked facilities&#151;and 
                no interest in a political agenda that, judging from SNP speeches 
                in this Parliament over the past year, ranges from uncosted and 
                unlimited spending proposals to republican neo-Marxism. The candles

                this debate were taking place in other parts of Scotland, the 
                question that the people would ask is this: in the first year 
                of the Parliament, did the Executive expect or want a farce over 
                the building of Holyrood, which will cost five times the original 
                estimate; an Executive ministerial team of 20, with perks and

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Minister for 
                Enterprise and Lifelong Learning (Henry McLeish): </strong>This debate 
                has been characterised by three key messages. The first message 
                is that, despite the protestations of the SNP, there have been 
                real achievements in the first year of this Parliament. That is 
                to the credit of the Parliament and the Executive and it shows 
                the wisdom of the Scottish people, who voted in elections and 
                referendums to ensure that we had this opportunity.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second message 
                was the rather downbeat, dispirited and disappointing speech from 
                the leader of the Opposition. The sour note that was injected 
                into our proceedings characterises the SNP. If long faces could 
                speak, they would have been a more fitting testimony to what Alex 
                Salmond was saying than anything that I can say at this juncture.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In sharp contrast to 
                that was the third message, which was given by Jim Wallace in 
                an excellent speech. He said that it is the partnership between 
                Westminster and the Scottish Parliament that is delivering for 
                Scottish people. The SNP puts the party first&#151;that is nothing 
                new. I would like to think that this Parliament has some consideration 
                for the Scottish people, who voted to put us here.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SNP motion is unbelievable 
                if it is dissected forensically. What the SNP does not want to 
                mention, but I want to speak about, is independence, divorce, 
                separation and the break-up of Britain. What do we get in the 
                motion? Seven moans in the run-up to a tentative embrace of independence. 
                Does not that give us a clue about the frenzied state of confusion 
                in the SNP at present?</font></P>

                go along with many of the comments that Henry McLeish has made, 
                except to say that Mr Salmond made one good point. He referred 
                to today's announcement of the loss of 200 jobs in the textile 
                industry in Kilmarnock. Just a month or so ago, the minister boasted 
                with some pride about the Executive's handling of the textile 
                industry. Will he now acknowledge that the textile industry in 
                Scotland is in crisis, and will he do something about it?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>We 
                never boast about job losses in any form, and Phil Gallie knows

                deal with the problem. We have debated it before and we will debate 
                it again soon. I look forward to responding to Mr Gallie's comments

                SNP leader taking over his role. Photographs of Alex Salmond over 
                those 10 years show how he has changed; it is interesting to see

                debate is taking place. Is it about the welfare of Scots? No. 
                That is evident from the debate. Is it about taking Scotland forward? 
                Of course it is not. It is about the fact that the fundamentalists 
                have got the leadership by the throat and, with the conference 
                coming up, they are having a debate at public expense as a warm-up 
                exercise. That is ridiculous; people who are listening, watching 
                and reading will know that the SNP takes advantage of the public 
                purse because its members are in a panic about the fundamental 
                fault line that divides them.</font></P>

                of the motion in the name of Alex Salmond puts into context an 
                important part of Parliament's work. It is about the commitment 
                of members working in committees, in Parliament and in their constituencies 
                to move Scotland forward.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is an essential 
                part of what Parliament has been able to do to assist in the government 
                of Scotland. The remainder of the motion highlights the reality 
                of some of the issues that we face. I did not hear the Deputy

                quarter of this year&#151;said that things were still very difficult 
                in the manufacturing sector. Since the Labour party came to government 
                in Westminster, 22,000 jobs have been lost in the manufacturing

                create the right economic climate for the agriculture and manufacturing 
                sectors. I met the Minister for Rural Affairs on the platform 
                at Paddington yesterday. He was leaving London as I arrived. Perhaps 
                he had been to see the chancellor to give him a rollicking about 
                the level of interest rates, although I doubt it.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The debate has hinged 
                on aspirations for Scotland. One of the SNP's aspirations&#151;which 
                we share with Mr Finnie&#151;is to release the wealth of Scotland 
                that is trapped in Gordon Brown's war chest and invest it in Scotland. 
                We also have aspirations for this Parliament to become an independent 
                Parliament. Duncan McNeil should make no mistake about that.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a contradiction 
                at the heart of the Executive. We have heard from the Deputy First 
                Minister that devolution is the settled will of the Scottish people. 
                This is one of the rare occasions on which I have heard him say 
                that. I heard Mr Rumbles and Mr Brown refer to federalism, or 
                pseudo-federalism, or perhaps even quasi-federalism. What on earth 
                has happened to federalism? Are the Liberal Democrats still committed 
                to it? They are committed to it at Westminster, but heaven knows 
                whether they are committed to it in Edinburgh. They say one thing 
                down there, but they do another up here. That is true about taxation, 
                public services, local authorities&#151;you name it.</font></P>

                Parliament. He said that we were involved in a process, that things 
                would change and develop and that we might get more powers. I

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr David Davidson 
                (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>I am delighted to have obtained 
                this debate, which gives the north-east the opportunity to have 
                two of its most serious concerns debated&#151;the upgrading of 
                the Aberdeen to Peterhead road and the construction of a peripheral 
                route round Aberdeen. I welcome the cross-party support that I 
                have received for my motion.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even when I was a young 
                lad in Aberdeen, the city was very busy. Even then, the city council 
                was trying to put in pedestrian protection schemes. I remember 
                as a youth&#151;which was not last week&#151;that the dualling 
                of the A90 started with the co-operation of other councils. Today, 
                roads in the city and in many of the surrounding areas suffer 
                from gridlock, a term that was used by a senior policeman only 
                the other day. The lack of a modern and effective trunk road system 
                in a major Scottish city is a disgrace. It is not only a major 
                cause for concern for the local economy, as there are also environmental 
                and safety concerns.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is a scandal that 
                the pan-European dual carriageway network grinds to a halt at 
                the Bridge of Dee, forcing heavy vehicles and buses through the 
                city and along minor roads, such as the B977 and the B979. Those 
                roads cannot cope. They are dangerous and expensive to maintain.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vehicles that make 
                it across the Bridge of Dee are faced with 17 sets of traffic 
                lights when they try to get to the north end of Anderson Drive, 
                through densely packed housing areas, reaching the bottleneck 
                at the Bridge of Don to the north and tailbacks almost every day, 
                at any hour, going out to the airport.</font></P>

                small, country roads around Aberdeen. That produces pollution 
                and is a hazard to all, costing businesses time and money.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gridlock of the 
                city causes tremendous economic difficulty to those who live and 
                work to the north of Aberdeen, particularly those in north Aberdeenshire, 
                Banff and Buchan, Gordon, across the coast through Moray, and 
                even in the Inverness and Huntly areas. Those areas would all 
                benefit from a bypass.</font></P>

                think that the figures are accurate&#151;that simply negotiating 
                the difficulties of Aberdeen city costs in excess of £1 million 
                a month.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The A90 is mostly single 
                carriageway, with dangerous bends and junctions and poor sightlines. 
                It is used by hundreds of large lorries that are essential to 
                the economy, particularly in the area up towards Peterhead and 
                Fraserburgh. I remind the Parliament that agriculture in Aberdeenshire 
                depends on the movement of stock and material by road.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, at this point, 
                I must thank the Minister for Transport and the Environment for 
                responding to my campaign on the Hatton bends. I know that I am 
                not the first to mention that issue, nor will I be the last, but 
                I am pleased that the minister has now responded to us.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, there are 
                more problems on the A90 than that. Aberdeenshire Council would 
                be willing to share the long list with the minister. Two such 
                problems come to mind: Hatton village crossroads, which is beginning 
                to be a major problem, and the Inverugie bridge.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fishing ports and 
                many other areas in the north depend totally on the A90 for transportation, 
                for business purposes and commuting to work. Every day of the 
                week, there are tailbacks, bumps and bangs, and the frustration 
                caused by the difficulties on the road results all too often in 
                accidents&#151;unfortunately, some of those accidents have tragic 
                outcomes. We cannot allow that situation to continue any longer.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dualling of the 
                Balmedie to Tipperty stretch of the A90 is being held in abeyance 
                officially. I ask the minister to give that project proceed-to-construction 
                status, as a next step towards the improvement of that road.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Peterhead economy 
                has taken many hits in the past and now RAF Buchan and Peterhead

                Other sites just outside the city would benefit from a bypass, 
                which has been talked about for years. We must consult further 
                on its route, as housing and working patterns have changed since 
                the idea was first developed. However, it is essential that the 
                idea is progressed as soon as possible.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The north-east Scotland 
                economic development partnership commissioned a study by Halcrow 
                Fox, which will report soon, on the options for alternative transport 
                strategies for Aberdeen and the north-east. With the agreement 
                of the partnership, I can tell members that the report will almost 
                certainly conclude that an integrated transport strategy incorporating 
                a western peripheral route gives the greatest significant benefit 
                across a range of factors. However, any western peripheral route 
                must connect with the northbound A90; there is no point in developing 
                the bypass otherwise.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conclusion&#151;and 
                I will try to be brief because I know that others wish to speak&#151;Aberdeen 
                and the north-east must be allowed to share equally in the development 
                of Scotland's infrastructure. The heady days of rising employment 
                in oil and gas, fishing, agriculture, food processing and engineering 
                are over. Despite the headlines, employment is dropping and the 
                region has many black spots of deprivation and exclusion. To build 
                a new economy, we need sustainable employment and a safer and 
                cleaner environment for everyone, all of which will require a 
                reasonable infrastructure.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I hope that, today, 
                the minister will tell the north-east that she has listened to 
                us, accepts the need for these road improvement projects and agrees 
                to work in partnership with councils and agencies to deliver those 
                vital parts of an integrated transport strategy for the area as 
                soon as possible. I thank her for responding to me in the past.

                it. I will certainly stick to three minutes: as I have explained 
                to David, because of the change in members' business, I have to 
                leave the debate to make a speech on the anniversary of the Parliament. 
                However, I want to make a few brief points on this important issue.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, although I congratulate 
                David Davidson on securing the debate, he should have the modesty 
                to admit that these issues have been raised by constituency MPs 
                and councillors from the north-east of Scotland for some years. 
                Obviously, as the constituency member for Banff and Buchan, I 
                greatly welcome the progress on the Hatton bends. However, it 
                has been a sair fecht over the years to get the Hatton bends&#151;which 
                has frequently appeared on project designs or on lists to be done&#151;to 
                reach this stage in its development. I welcome the minister's 
                commitment to the project.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although I agree with 
                the bulk of David Davidson's case for improvements to the A90 
                and the western peripheral route, I want to raise two particularly 
                important points. First, Banff and Buchan is not stuck in the 
                middle of nowhere in the north-east of Scotland. It has one of 
                the largest gas terminals in Europe at St Fergus; the largest 
                whitefish port in the whole of Europe; another major fishing port 
                in Fraserburgh; and there are other key industries in the community. 
                Given that economic infrastructure and its contribution to the 
                economy, I think that the inhabitants of Peterhead, Fraserburgh 
                and Buchan are entitled to ask why the road infrastructure is 
                still so poor and why the dual carriageway ends mysteriously just 
                outside Banff and Buchan. This is an economically vital and vibrant 
                place with a huge amount of heavy road traffic.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, as there 
                is not an inch of railway line in the whole of the Banff and Buchan 
                constituency, everyone has to go by road, either using an inadequate 
                bus network or in private cars. The fact that there is no alternative 
                to road transport should be a factor in the minister's calculations, 
                unless she can announce that there are to be new railways in Banff 
                and Buchan. However, I suspect that is beyond even her powers 
                as the Minister for Transport and the Environment.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, I want to 
                raise a point that would apply as much to other improvements to 
                the A90 as to the western peripheral route, and which would certainly 
                enjoy great support. In many areas of Scotland, people have deep 
                uncertainty and opposition to proposed road schemes. We have seen 
                such opposition in the west of Scotland, for example, in recent 
                years. However, there is cross-party, substantial&#151;I will 
                not say unanimous, but certainly overwhelming&#151;public support 
                for the western peripheral route and for any improvements to the 
                A90. That should be an </font></P>

                them should have some connection. I hope that the fact that the 
                north-east of Scotland is substantially behind the improvements 
                that have been mentioned in the debate so far will be a factor 
                in the minister's thinking and calculations on the subject.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis Macdonald 
                (Aberdeen Central) (Lab): </strong>I, too, congratulate David Davidson 
                on securing the debate and on combining two important aspects 
                of the roads and transport policies for Aberdeen and the north-east.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As members would expect, 
                my main interest is in the construction of the bypass, or the 
                western peripheral route, round the city of Aberdeen, and how 
                that fits into a wider strategy. Clearly, we need a better road 
                system in the area; we need a system that addresses freight traffic 
                going from areas to the north of the city to areas to the south, 
                and the linked question of commuter congestion on routes in and 
                out of the city. In creating that system, we also need to see 
                how far we can divert traffic off the roads altogether. Alex Salmond 
                said, quite rightly, that Banff and Buchan lacks any railway lines, 
                but that is not true of the whole of the north-east. I welcome 
                the proposals for developing an Inverurie to Stonehaven commuter 
                rail system that will help to speed people into and out of the 
                city and to take some traffic off the roads.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I also welcome the 
                moves that have been made to make Aberdeen airport more user-friendly 
                regarding delayed flights in the evenings. That is important.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the rail side, the 
                integration of road and rail requires investment in the main routes 
                from Aberdeen, in particular the Aberdeen to Edinburgh route, 
                for which there is a proposal to save half an hour on the journey 
                time. The proposal is to do that over 10 years, but I see no reason

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I also want to mention 
                the role of sea transport, which is important and growing; it 
                must be linked to the things that Mr Davidson spoke about. Members 
                will be aware of the growing international trade through Aberdeen 
                harbour. There are twice-weekly freight sailings to Norway and 
                to Amsterdam and weekly container ships to Rotterdam and Antwerp, 
                as well as the tourist links through Shetland to Faroe and Iceland.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we develop our 
                transport strategy, it is essential that we protect and maintain 
                the opportunity for sea-to-road and sea-to-rail transfer in Aberdeen. 
                That means that heavy road freight traffic in the city will always 
                continue. Protection of the position of the harbour and the maritime

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) 
                (LD): </strong>There is no doubt that there are glaring gaps in the 
                strategic road network in the north-east. One of those gaps is 
                the section of the A90 between Tipperty and Balmedie in my constituency, 
                which remains the only length of single carriageway between Ellon 
                and Dundee, apart from the urban section through Aberdeen.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The A90 is the key 
                route from Aberdeen to the north-east corner of Scotland. It is 
                a key route for agricultural produce, for fish from the biggest 
                whitefish port in Europe, as Alex Salmond said, and for the oil 
                industry. It is also an extremely busy commuter route and an arterial 
                public transport route. It services a rural park-and-ride initiative 
                with sites at Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Mintlaw and Ellon and takes 
                people to the busy park-and-ride facility at Bridge of Don on 
                the outskirts of Aberdeen.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The stretch of single 
                carriageway, with few safe overtaking opportunities, is a constriction 
                on the free flow of goods and travellers. That has economic consequences 
                which add&#151;perhaps, admittedly, only slightly&#151;to the 
                much more severe consequences of the constriction caused by the 
                overloaded road network through Aberdeen, which other members 
                have dealt with.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other and more 
                important aspect of that stretch of road is safety. The accident 
                statistics speak for themselves: over a three-year period, there 
                have been 23 minor accidents, four serious accidents and, tragically, 
                three fatalities. The safety aspect is the strongest argument 
                for dualling this stretch of road.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was disappointed 
                that the road was not included in the first batch of major projects 
                that were prioritised in the strategic roads review. The completion 
                of a decent, pan-Scotland strategic roads network and the filling 
                in of the gaps in the north-east could have been given higher 
                priority, but it is one of the three projects that are held in 
                abeyance and I hope that it will take highest priority of those 
                three.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Slowly, and drip by 
                drip, the north-east has faced measures that have restricted its 
                economic prosperity. The higher fuel costs and Government changes 
                to road tax have left our hauliers unfairly penalised, and have 
                also deterred tourists from coming to our part of the world. Our 
                farming, which is increasingly under pressure, already faces an 
                uncertain future, and the lack of good transport links makes our 
                producers even less competitive with people in the south and in 
                the rest of Europe.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am sure that it has 
                not been missed by many north-east members that last year, eight 
                of the 10 constituencies in Scotland that experienced an increase 
                in unemployment were in the north-east. An upgraded A90 and peripheral 
                route are vital if we are to compete with the rest of the United 
                Kingdom and open up the north-east. Better transport links for 
                us in the north-east will help us to achieve equal status, and 
                I hope will allow our businesses the same chance as those further 
                south in Scotland.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the subject of road 
                safety, last year deaths on Grampian roads amounted to one fatality 
                per week. I tell the Executive that by completing the dualling 
                of the A90 and upgrading the junctions we can expect fewer fatalities, 
                but I urge that more be done. I welcome the Executive's road improvement 
                programme, but by doing more, it will demonstrate that the north-east 
                deserves a chance equal to the rest of Scotland to compete economically.</font></P>

                Scotland) (SNP): </strong>To some extent we are going back over ground 
                that we covered last June in a similar debate, but I make no apology 
                for that. With regard to some of the things that have happened 
                since then, I hope that the minister will be able to give more 
                positive responses than she was able to give on that previous 
                occasion.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the significant 
                changes has been south of the border, where Mr Prescott is apparently 
                sitting on a large amount of money, which will be available to 
                tackle the transport strategy. I hope that the minister has been 
                able to achieve a significant share of that money. I do not doubt 
                that that will be announced in the near future. Like Ben Wallace, 
                I lay claim to the north-east's share of that money, in particular 
                to try to implement the integrated transport strategy that the 
                local authorities, in partnership with other interests, have been 
                working so hard to deliver.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The changes at Hatton 
                bends are welcome, but they are only a small part of what is required.

                in its plans for the future. We realise that unlimited money is 
                not available, but to have that measure accepted into the overall

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I wish to refer briefly 
                to the rest of the integrated transport strategy. Like Lewis Macdonald, 
                I welcome some of the rail changes that are coming. However, I 
                am disappointed that, so far, the minister has felt unable to 
                endorse the view that we ought to have a feasibility study into 
                the reopening of the Dyce-Ellon rail link, and that we ought to 
                look at what might be possible at Dyce airport, particularly in 
                the light of the transfer of the goods depot from the present 
                joint station site to Raiths farm, and the possibility of improving 
                that area. As part of the franchising arrangements, consideration 
                should be given to starting a number of train journeys from Dyce 
                rather than Aberdeen. That would be most helpful. I will leave 
                it at that in order to allow others to take part.</font></P>

                this debate. As Brian Adam mentioned, this is the second debate 
                that we have had on the transport needs of Aberdeen and the north-east.

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are now significantly 
                further on in considering the transport needs of Aberdeen and 
                the north-east. As David Davidson said, the Halcrow Fox study, 
                which was commissioned by NESDEP to examine the options for the 
                future of the transport system in the north-east, has been completed 
                and will be made public very shortly. It is significant that NESDEP&#151;the 
                economic partnership of both councils, Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce 
                and Scottish Enterprise Grampian&#151;commissioned that study, 
                because it gives a unified view of the transport requirements 
                of the north-east. There is increasing unanimity about the future 
                of transport across all organisations and, dare I say it, all 
                parties in the region.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A major component of 
                the strategy is the western peripheral route, and improvements 
                to the A90, including dualling sections of the road north of Aberdeen, 
                such as that between Balmedie and Tipperty. However, we need to 
                focus on the entirety of the vision for transport in the north-east, 
                as described in Aberdeen City Council's transport strategy. Roads 
                are only a part of the picture. To produce a transport system 
                that meets the needs of everybody&#151;commuters, pensioners, 
                city and country dwellers, business people, families&#151;we need 
                to consider the strategy holistically. The strategy must meet

                Council schemes are funded by the Scottish Executive's public 
                transport challenge fund. Aberdeen City Council has received more 
                than £12 million over the past three years to develop bus lanes

                months that we have discussed transport links in the north-east 
                of Scotland. That should tell the minister how big an issue transport 
                is in the north-east of Scotland. People want the Scottish Parliament 
                to deliver on improved transport links, as Westminster did not.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The UK's fishing industry 
                is based in the north-east of Scotland. The minister will be aware 
                that fishermen have to get their produce to market while it is 
                fresh. They have to get it to the processors and down south and, 
                in many cases, to the continent while it is fresh. Therefore they 
                need improved transport links.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are schemes on 
                the A96 at Coachford and Newtongarry. There is the Bridge of Dee 
                to Ellon road scheme to improve safety in urban Aberdeen. There 
                is also a range of schemes to the south of Aberdeen&#151;from 
                Aberdeen to Dundee and from Dundee to Perth. I know that that 
                does not appear to be local investment, but in terms of the access 
                issues that Brian Adam and Richard Lochhead raised, it is important 
                to think about the A90 as a national stretch of road.</font></P>

                the point about the A90 between Balmedie and Tipperty. We have 
                made road improvements that will benefit the area. I know that 
                there are particular stretches that members would like to add.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much of the investment 
                lacks the glamour of the Rolls-Royce new-build schemes, but it 
                is worth £7.5 billion and is as important to Aberdeen and north-east 
                Scotland as it is to the rest of Scotland. Our improvements focus 
                on safety-related issues and bringing the network up to standard 
                following years of under-investment. The investment will cut </font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have been criticised 
                for not pressing ahead with every scheme that people would like 
                to be implemented. As Minister for Transport and the Environment, 
                I am conscious of the need for transport investment across Scotland, 
                but we must face the realities of the development of transport 
                policy. Brian Adam acknowledged that we must make choices and 
                set priorities. That is a difficult issue. When we consider the 
                issue of expenditure on new roads, we must face up to the consequences 
                of less investment elsewhere, for example, in education or health. 
                We must face up to those issues honestly.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is why the Executive 
                has been developing a more transparent method of allocating resources. 
                We want local people to understand that the five appraisal criteria&#151;integration, 
                accessibility, safety, economy and environmental impact&#151;of 
                the strategic roads review are being implemented. That is why 
                the Fochabers to Mosstodloch route came through. We have implemented 
                several routes in Scotland. However, any new road investment must 
                meet the appraisal framework.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We need to go further. 
                Members made several comments about the need for an integrated 
                approach. Elaine Thomson talked in particular about the impact 
                of new investment in Aberdeen, which is trying to tackle the issue 
                of congestion that David Davidson raised in his opening remarks. 
                We need to make the links between different transport improvements 
                by using a common framework. We will take into consideration Alex 
                Salmond's point that not every constituency has access to the 
                national rail network. Those are the issues that we must consider 
                when we assess future priorities.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is the context 
                in which any upgrading of the A90 must be considered. I am glad 
                that members welcome the proposed realignment scheme at Hatton 
                bends, which is just the sort of vital but unglamorous improvement 
                that has been ignored for too long. I can confirm today that, 
                subject to satisfactory completion of the necessary statutory 
                procedures, the work, worth £650,000, will commence in 2001-02.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nora Radcliffe raised 
                the issue of the Balmedie to Tipperty route, which was considered 
                in the strategic roads review. As members know, the scheme was 
                held in abeyance and will, in due course, be considered alongside 
                other emerging priorities for inclusion in any future trunk road 
                scheme. That means that there will not be short-term improvements 
                on that stretch of the road, but we keep safety on all stretches 
                of road under review and have commissioned research&#151;</font></P>

                I must continue.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are studying accidents 
                to consider the priorities for small scheme improvements, which 
                can be taken forward in the short term. Therefore, there is some 
                prospect of work being carried out.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second issue raised 
                by Mr Davidson in his opening remarks was the Aberdeen western 
                peripheral. As members have correctly identified, we have been 
                there before in one of our very first debates in Parliament. Then 
                and during a subsequent visit to Aberdeen, I made the Executive's 
                position clear. The western peripheral is not a trunk road, nor 
                is there any realistic prospect of the Executive trunking it&#151;that 
                would be an empty gesture. The cost of £85 million is, quite simply, 
                unaffordable in the light of the other severe pressures on the 
                trunk road programme that we have talked about.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Richard Lochhead: 
                </strong>Will the minister give way?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>No, 
                I will not.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, back in June, 
                I urged Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Council to look 
                again at the scheme in the context of their emerging local transport 
                strategies, which is precisely what they have done. I urged them 
                also to reconsider the plan in the light of the alternative funding 
                mechanisms that might be open to them. The local congestion powers 
                that we will bring forward in the transport bill, for example, 
                might be one answer. Alternatively, the western peripheral could 
                be promoted using the existing powers in the New Roads and Street 
                Works Act 1991.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is to the councils' 
                credit that they have begun to re-examine the case in the wider 
                context with NESDEP. That is an excellent example of real partnership 
                working and I would like to take this opportunity to signal my 
                support for their efforts thus far. The work is now nearing completion 
                and publication. I look forward to hearing the detail over the 
                summer. The next stage must be to consider the impact on local 
                communities and the arguments being raised there.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many ways 
                in which the Government can assist in that process. My officials 
                recently met the councils. I am keen for them to do so again and 
                for them to participate in NESDEP. Officials are already working 
                with Edinburgh and Glasgow on their key transport priorities. 
                In my statement to Parliament on 10 February, I signalled my support 
                for authorities that are committed to developing a charging scheme, 
                by offering, on a case-by-case basis, matching financial support 
                towards their research and development costs.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know that a lot of
