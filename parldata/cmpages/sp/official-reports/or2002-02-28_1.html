              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr Murray Tosh): </strong>Good morning. 
                The first item of business is a debate on motion S1M-2702, in 
                the name of Mr Mike Rumbles, on the general principles of the 
                Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Bill. I invite members 
                who wish to speak in the debate to press their request-to-speak 
                buttons now. I call Mike Rumbles to speak to and move the motion.</P>
              <P>09:30</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_3" id="MakeMarkAuto_3"></A>Mr Mike Rumbles 
                (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): </strong>I am pleased to 
                be able to introduce this committee bill, which seeks to establish 
                a Scottish parliamentary standards commissioner. Not only is this 
                a milestone in that it is only the second committee bill to be 
                introduced into Parliament, but it is an important step in ensuring 
                that the Parliament maintains the highest possible standards of 
                conduct.</P>
              <P>The bill represents the culmination of a nine-month inquiry. 
                I pay particular tribute to past and present Standards Committee 
                members, including the Minister for Parliamentary Business&#151;who 
                will respond for the Executive today&#151;and to the clerking 
                team for their commitment and hard work, which helped to make 
                the bill reality.</P>
              <P>The ability of Scottish parliamentary committees to initiate 
                legislation sets us apart from the Westminster parliament; it 
                also differentiates us from many other legislative institutions. 
                The bill has the unanimous support of Standards Committee members 
                and is an excellent example of the effectiveness of the committee 
                system in delivering legislation.</P>
              <P>Recent debate at Westminster has underlined the bill's importance. 
                The bill will enable a standards commissioner to investigate complaints 
                against MSPs in a thorough, fair and impartial fashion. Unlike 
                Westminster's, our commissioner will have statutory powers to 
                summon witnesses </P>

              <P>and to compel production of evidence. We view that as being essential 
                to guaranteeing the independence and authority of the post.</P>
              <P>Before I discuss in detail the provisions of the bill, it might 
                be helpful to take members through the reasons for the Standards 
                Committee's decision to introduce the bill. During the committee's 
                inquiry, we considered four possible models for investigating 
                complaints against members: first, retaining the then status quo 
                of the Standards Committee's carrying out investigations, as we 
                did in the so-called lobbygate affair; secondly, investigation 
                by the standards commission, which was then being proposed under 
                the Ethical Standards in Public Life (Scotland) Bill; thirdly, 
                investigation by a standards adviser or officer; and finally, 
                investigation by a standards commissioner.</P>
              <P>We took evidence from a wide range of witnesses including academics, 
                lawyers, and the parliamentary commissioner for standards at Westminster. 
                The committee concluded that the injection of an independent element 
                into the investigative process was vital if the public were to 
                have confidence in the handling of misconduct complaints against 
                members. It was clear that the Standards Committee's retention 
                of responsibility for carrying out initial investigations would 
                not provide that confidence. We also rejected any role for the 
                standards commission, because we were convinced that it would 
                be constitutionally inappropriate for individuals who were appointed 
                by the Executive to have responsibility for the conduct of MSPs.</P>
              <P>There would have been advantages in pursuing the standards officer 
                route, not least because there would have been no need for enabling 
                legislation; the appointment could therefore have been made speedily. 
                However, the committee felt that the lack of statutory powers 
                for a standards officer, who would have to rely on the committee's 
                powers under the Scotland Act 1998 to summon witnesses, would 
                impact adversely on the independence of the post.</P>
              <P>The key proposal in the bill, therefore, is to provide the standards 
                commissioner with adequate powers to carry out rigorous investigations 
                into misconduct allegations against members, in relation to their 
                parliamentary duties. Members might find it helpful if I clear 
                up an area of confusion that has crept into media reports about 
                the ministerial code and the parliamentary code of conduct. All 
                MSPs, including ministers, are covered by the Parliament's code 
                of conduct when acting in their parliamentary capacity. Ministers, 
                when acting in their ministerial capacity, are subject to the 
                ministerial code, which is the responsibility of the First Minister.</P>

              <P>on lobbying, for example, the Executive indicated that it would 
                consider changes to the ministerial code in the light of the committee 
                inquiry's recommendations. I will express briefly a personal view, 
                which is that the First Minister might want to consider the bill's 
                approach as a possible blueprint for similar future arrangements 
                for the ministerial code. However, I stress that that is a matter 
                for the First Minister.</P>
              <P>The Standards Committee is convinced that a standards commissioner 
                who is appointed under an act of the Scottish Parliament and given 
                specific statutory powers to compel the production of evidence 
                is crucial to securing the independence and credibility of the 
                parliamentary commissioner for standards. We hope that the commissioner 
                will not need to draw on those powers, but they will exist and 
                will help cement public confidence in the Parliament's ability 
                to deal with complaints against members.</P>
              <P>Adequate powers are only part of the story, where public confidence 
                is concerned. The bill's procedures for appointing and removing 
                the commissioner will be a bulwark that will ensure the post's 
                independence. The bill proposes clear appointment procedures that 
                are consistent with the core values of openness and transparency 
                that underpin the Parliament. The commissioner may be appointed 
                for up to five years, with the possibility of re-appointment for 
                a similar period. The appointment will be made as a result of 
                an open recruitment process. The best candidate will be recommended 
                to the chamber on a Standards Committee motion and the appointment 
                will be agreed by Parliament.</P>
              <P>The Standards Committee is determined that the successful candidate 
                will be appointed on merit, in accordance with the principles 
                that are laid down by the committee on standards in public life 
                and the current guidance that has been issued by the commissioner 
                for public appointments.</P>
              <P>The proposed removal procedures will also provide security of 
                tenure, thus augmenting the commissioner's independence. The bill 
                requires that the commissioner can be dismissed only if a motion 
                to dismiss is put to the Parliament and receives a two-thirds 
                majority of those voting.</P>
              <P>The bill sets out a clear procedure for the submission of complaints 
                against members and it lays down the process by which complaints 
                will be investigated by the commissioner. The bill provides that 
                investigations will be carried out in private and independently 
                of the Standards Committee; it also proposes that the committee 
                cannot direct how an investigation is carried out. The committee 
                can direct the commissioner to consider complaints that do not 
                meet the bill's procedural requirements; for example, if the complaints 
                are not in writing. However, it is for the </P>

              <P>commissioner to consider whether a complaint warrants full investigation.</P>
              <P>The bill provides only a snapshot of part of the complaints process, 
                so colleagues might find it helpful if I briefly revisit the four-stage 
                investigative procedure that was endorsed by the Parliament in 
                November 2000.</P>
              <P>The first two stages of investigation are contained within the 
                bill and will be the commissioner's responsibility. Stage 1 is 
                an initial sift to determine whether a complaint is admissible. 
                The commissioner will make an initial consideration of a complaint, 
                usually by seeking clarification of the complaint from the complainer 
                and a response from the MSP.</P>
              <P>Stage 2 is a full investigation, which is carried out in private 
                and independently of the Standards Committee. The bill gives the 
                committee powers to make directions to the commissioner; for example, 
                the committee will be able to issue guidance on investigative 
                fundamentals that should apply to all stage 1 and 2 investigations 
                that the commissioner undertakes. Those fundamentals could include, 
                for example, a requirement on the commissioner to inform witnesses 
                that they have the right to have a third party present at interview.</P>
              <P>Stages 3 and 4 of the investigative process are outwith the remit 
                of the bill. Stage 3 is the Standards Committee's consideration 
                of the commissioner's report, which will be made at the conclusion 
                of his or her investigation. I expect that the Standards Committee 
                will decide in each case to undertake initial consideration of 
                such reports in private. That will be necessary because the committee 
                might decide to refer the report back to the commissioner for 
                additional inquiries. Publicity could prejudice that. However, 
                I emphasise that all subsequent elements of stage 3 will normally 
                take place in public. For example, oral evidence and&#151;most 
                important&#151;the committee's decision on whether a member has 
                breached the code, will be in public. The committee's report, 
                the commissioner's report and any relevant evidence will also 
                be published.</P>
              <P>The final stage of the process is stage 4, which is Parliament's 
                consideration of the Standards Committee's recommendations for 
                sanctions. That debate would be on a motion on behalf of the committee.</P>
              <P>When the Standards Committee's proposals to introduce the bill 
                were debated last May, they received full cross-party support. 
                By supporting the introduction of a standards commissioner through 
                the bill, we send a message that the Parliament is committed to 
                ensuring the highest standards of probity. I commend the bill 
                to members and call on them to support its general principles.</P>

              <P>09:40</P>
              <P><strong>The Minister for Parliamentary Business (Patricia Ferguson): 
                </strong>On behalf of the Executive, I congratulate the Standards Committee 
                on the thoughtful and careful work that has gone into the preparation 
                of the bill. I say that having been party to some of that work. 
                I was not present for the latter deliberations, but I have watched 
                keenly as they have moved on. We welcome the committee's proposals 
                and will give the bill our full support.</P>
              <P>The present arrangements for the investigation of complaints 
                against members of the Parliament are set out in the code of conduct, 
                which is non-statutory. Following a detailed inquiry and an extensive 
                consultation process, the Standards Committee concluded that those 
                arrangements should be replaced by legislation. That is the purpose 
                of the bill.</P>
              <P>The key ingredients of the bill can be summarised briefly. The 
                bill provides for the appointment of an independent standards 
                commissioner who will have statutory security of tenure. The appointment 
                process will be open and transparent and the commissioner may 
                be re-appointed for another term of up to five years. The commissioner 
                will investigate complaints independently and will have the same 
                statutory powers to summon witnesses and compel production of 
                evidence as the Parliament enjoys under section 23 of the Scotland 
                Act 1998. The commissioner will, having carried out an investigation, 
                report his or her findings to the Standards Committee in the first 
                instance. It will then be for the committee and the Parliament 
                to decide whether there has been a breach of the code and, if 
                so, what action to take. Both the committee's report and the commissioner's 
                findings will be published in full.</P>
              <P>The proposals have been carefully formulated to establish an 
                independent and credible commissioner who will have wide powers 
                of investigation, while properly leaving the final decision on 
                what action to take in the hands of the Parliament. Although there 
                is scope for debate about the precise detail of the proposals&#151;I 
                look forward to engaging in that debate at stage 2&#151;it seems 
                to me that the committee's approach strikes the right balance.</P>
              <P>I hope and believe that the bill will command support across 
                the political spectrum. The establishment of an independent commissioner 
                who will have clear and transparent powers of investigation will

                fact is that politicians are no longer trusted or respected by 
                the people whom we are elected to serve. However, there can be 
                no doubt that the Scottish Parliament has been unfairly tarnished 
                by events in another place.</P>
              <P>Of course, we are a new Parliament, set up to provide a new way 
                to govern our nation. We do not want to be forever comparing ourselves 
                with Westminster&#151;as far as Scotland is concerned, Westminster 
                is the past and the Scottish Parliament is the future. However, 
                under the current situation, I am afraid that we must make the 
                comparison. If we are to be the open, accountable and transparent 
                Parliament that we aspire to be, we must ensure that we do not 
                inherit the bad practice that has become such a feature of that 
                other place.</P>
              <P>Where will the bill make a difference? As Mike Rumbles said, 
                the standards commissioner will be appointed by an open recruitment 
                process. It is essential that the successful candidate is seen 
                to have been appointed on merit and that he or she is not seen 
                as a product of either cronyism or patronage. It is also essential 
                that the standards commissioner have powers that are independent 
                of both the Standards Committee and the Parliament.</P>
              <P>Perhaps the most important feature of the bill is the fact that 
                it will give the commissioner statutory powers to summon witnesses 
                and compel evidence. Those are crucial powers that are not available 
                at Westminster. The lack of those powers allowed MPs and ministers

              <P>thumb their noses at the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards's 
                request for their co-operation in giving evidence. The bill will 
                ensure that the Scottish Parliament has no truck with such behaviour.</P>
              <P>We cannot repeat those words openness and accountability too 
                often, so I applaud the decision that stages 3 and 4 of the complaints 
                process will be held mainly in public. That will allow initial 
                investigations to be held in private, which will protect the complainer 
                and the member from what could be prejudicial publicity. At stage 
                3, when the commissioner's report is published, oral evidence 
                and the committee's deliberations will be in public. In that way, 
                the bill strikes the right balance between preventing trial by 
                tabloid and ensuring that members of the Parliament are accountable 
                to the electorate and that their integrity is seen to be above 
                reproach.</P>
              <P>I want to talk about something that could be perceived to be 
                a weakness in the bill. The bill has been developed within the 
                framework of the Scotland Act 1998 and the Scottish Parliament's 
                standing orders. Therefore, the onus remains on the Standards 
                Committee to recommend to Parliament whether sanctions should 
                be imposed. If that recommendation is made, it is up to the Parliament 
                to decide whether to accept the committee's recommendation. Given 
                current public opinion, we must admit that that could be perceived 
                to be a very big weakness. After all, the Standards Committee 
                and the members of the Parliament could be seen to be politically 
                weighted. This is where we elected members face our biggest challenge. 
                As my party's chief whip, I say here and now that there will be 
                no whipping of Scottish National Party members on any report from 
                the commissioner or on any recommendation that the Standards Committee 
                might put before the Parliament. Our challenge is simple: we must 
                put the integrity of Parliament before any party-political interest. 
                We cannot allow the Parliament to be put in the obscene position 
                of having a member who, having been found guilty, escapes because 
                of party politics without even a slapped wrist. Saving our pals 
                cannot be an option.</P>
              <P>Make no mistake&#151;this is our opportunity to put clear blue 
                water between this Parliament and that other place. This is our 
                opportunity to say, &quot;Vive la diff&eacute;rence.&quot; We 
                must be ruthless in our dedication to achievement of the highest 
                possible standards for this new Parliament. When yet more sleaze 
                is reported from that other place, I want the people of Scotland 
                to be able to say, &quot;The Scottish Parliament just isn't like 
                that&quot;.</P>

              <P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I am glad 
                to support what has been said. The bill is the end product of 
                a nine-month inquiry that the Standards Committee carried out. 
                The committee reviewed four possible approaches to investigating 
                complaints against members and took evidence from a considerable 
                range of witnesses. I am convinced that the right policy decision 
                was made. It is important that the bill will inject an independent 
                element into the complaints process. During our inquiry, many 
                witnesses emphasised the need for an independent commission. That 
                became a central feature of our decision to propose a commissioner 
                and we believe that it will increase public confidence in the 
                Parliament and parliamentarians.</P>
              <P>The statutory process and powers to compel the production of 
                evidence are also key features that will enhance the commissioner's 
                independence by ensuring that he or she need not rely on the Standards 
                Committee's powers. They will also ensure that the commissioner 
                is able to get to the heart of a complaint and provide a comprehensive 
                report at the conclusion of his or her investigation.</P>
              <P>In addition to the need for thoroughness, it is essential that 
                investigations be carried out with all possible speed. It is important 
                to complainers, members and the wider public that complaints are 
                dealt with efficiently. It is envisaged that, in most cases, initial 
                consideration of a complaint will take no more than two months 
                and that any investigation that is required following that consideration 
                will take no more than six months.</P>
              <P>However, the Standards Committee acknowledged that some investigations 
                might be complex. The time limits are therefore not absolute requirements 
                under the bill. Instead, the bill requires the commissioner to 
                report on the progress of an investigation if the initial investigation 
                is not completed within two months and if the full investigation 
                is not completed within six months. The Parliament can then be 
                alerted to the reasons for the delay. The commissioner has the 
                power to report at any time on the progress of an investigation 
                and the Parliament can at any time require the commissioner to 
                provide a progress report.</P>
              <P>Transparency and openness characterise much of what we seek to 
                achieve in the Parliament. Those principles underpin the approach 
                not only of the bill but of the complaints process that has been 
                developed. The bill proposes transparent appointment procedures 
                and sets out clear rules on the submission of complaints.</P>
              <P>Although the commissioner's investigations will be carried out 
                in private and independently of the committee, much of stage 3 
                and all of stage 4 of </P>

              <P>the complaints process would, as Mike Rumbles rightly said, take 
                place in public. The commissioner's and the committee's reports 
                will become public documents. Justice must therefore not only 
                be done, but be seen to be done.</P>
              <P>As has been said, the bill has the unanimous backing of the Standards 
                Committee's members. When the committee's proposals for a commissioner 
                came before the Parliament previously, they received all-party 
                support. I hope that members will support the bill.</P>
              <P>In view of Kay Ullrich's comments about the standing of politicians, 
                perhaps I might say a brief word about politicians and the nature 
                of their work. Churchill summed up their role:</P>
              <P>&quot;Politicians rise by toils and struggles; they expect to 
                fall: they hope to rise again. Nearly always in or out of office, 
                they are surrounded and sustained by great parties. They have 
                many companions in misfortune. Their work with all its interest 
                and variety continues. Politicians know they are but the creatures 
                of the day. They hold no golden casket enshrining the treasure 
                of centuries to be shattered irretrievably in their hands. They 
                are ready to take the rough with the smooth along the path of 
                life they have chosen for themselves. Yet even politicians suffer 
                some pangs.&quot;</P>
              <P>It is my contention that, if there are high standards, there 
                will be many fewer pangs.</P>
              <P>The historian F S Oliver said of the profession of politics:</P>
              <P>&quot;With all the temptations, dangers and degradations that 
                beset it, politics is still, I think, the noblest career that 
                any man&quot;&#151;</P>
              <P>or woman&#151;&quot;can choose.&quot; I believe that we are taking 
                one small step towards making that a reality.</P>

              <P><strong>Susan Deacon (Edinburgh East and Musselburgh) (Lab): </strong>I 
                fear that Lord James Douglas-Hamilton's philosophy and insights 
                are a hard act to follow. Nonetheless, I am pleased to have the 
                opportunity to speak in the debate and to open for the Labour 
                party.</P>
              <P>I am the newest arrival on the Standards Committee, but I have 
                been pleased to be involved in the latter stages of development 
                of the bill. I pay tribute to my Labour colleagues who have been 
                involved for considerably longer and have played a central role 
                in developing the bill. The Labour party is fully committed to 
                the principles of the bill and to the maintenance of high standards 
                in public life. We give our absolute and unqualified support to 
                the principles of the bill.</P>
              <P>It is important that, as well as considering the detail, we remind 
                ourselves of the context of the bill. A great deal of debate and

              <P>a significant milestone in the development of the Parliament, 
                but is also part of a much bigger tapestry. That tapestry runs 
                back to the debate before devolution, in which we heard people's 
                high aspirations for the Parliament and what its politicians would 
                do for them, and to the work of the cross-party consultative steering 
                group, which shaped and developed many of the principles that 
                we have translated into practice in the Parliament. Since the 
                Parliament was established, much more has been done to ensure 
                that the aspirations of openness, accessibility, transparency 
                and high standards of conduct have been translated into practice. 
                It is important that we regard the bill as part of that bigger 
                tapestry.</P>
              <P>It is important&#151;particularly in the context of the cynicism 
                about politics and about politicians that we hear&#151;to remind 
                ourselves that a great deal has been done to ensure that, in our 
                fledgling Scottish Parliament, the highest possible standards 
                of conduct are maintained. The bill sets out a robust package 
                that is right for Scotland. It is designed to meet the needs of 
                the Scottish Parliament&#151;a modern Parliament, a Parliament 
                for a 21<SUP>st</SUP> century Scotland. As other members have 
                said, it is important to acknowledge how much consideration and 
                work have gone into developing the detailed provisions of the 
                bill.</P>
              <P>As the bill has been developed, examples from many other places 
                have been considered, including a place a little south of here. 
                It is right and proper that, where appropriate, practices from 
                there and elsewhere have been replicated. Equally, the decision 
                has been taken to differ where that has been felt to be right 
                and appropriate. That is as it should be; the Scottish Parliament 
                should draw on the very best practice.</P>
              <P>Mike Rumbles eloquently and fully set out the details of the 
                bill. However, like others, I will emphasise some of the key elements 
                of which we can be particularly proud. We can be proud that the 
                bill will give statutory powers to summon witnesses and to compel 
                them to give evidence. We can also be proud that the bill will 
                ensure the commissioner's independence. Not least among the provisions 
                are those that will provide security of tenure. The commissioner 
                can be removed only by the agreement of two thirds of members 
                voting on a motion to dismiss the commissioner that comes before 
                Parliament. Those are not small matters; they will make a difference.</P>
              <P>I was struck at the press conference at which we launched the 
                bill by a question that several journalists asked, which was whether 
                the standards commissioner will be a full-time job. We chorused 
                quickly that we hoped that it would not be. I do not say that 
                flippantly. Although it is important that we put in place the 
                most robust provisions possible for a standards commissioner </P>

              <P>and for high standards of conduct in the Parliament, it is for 
                all of us to ensure that those high standards are maintained. 
                We all hope that the commissioner will not be inundated with complaints. 
                Equally, it is vital that the public knows that when complaints 
                come forth, an independent person will uphold their interests 
                and, where necessary, hold us responsible for our actions.</P>
              <P>I hope that in the months to come members will become absorbed 
                in the detailed technicalities of the bill; as with any bill, 
                they are many. It is right and proper that we concentrate on that 
                detail. However, I hope that in doing so we will not lose sight 
                of the big picture. I am pleased that other members have touched 
                on that big picture. The picture is the need to maintain&#151;indeed, 
                to rebuild&#151;trust in politicians, parties and institutions 
                and the need for us to ensure that the public can hold us to account 
                and that independent mechanisms exist whereby they can do so.</P>
              <P>High standards of probity and general good conduct will not of 
                themselves restore politics to the standing that it once had and 
                that we all aspire to its having again. However, such standards 
                are an important step toward ensuring that that standing is restored. 
                I hope that, just as we worked together to develop the bill and 
                get it to this stage, we will continue to work within and across 
                parties to make progress with the bill and get it on the statute 
                book. More important, I hope that we will continue to work together 
                to maintain, develop and enhance the Parliament's standards in 
                order to demonstrate that we politicians have at heart the interests 
                of the people whom we represent. I hope that, at all times and 
                in all the ways that are within our powers, we will maintain the 
                highest possible standards.</P>

                of an independent standards commissioner, who will have comprehensive 
                powers to investigate complaints made against members of the Parliament. 
                The independence of the commissioner is a necessary guarantee 
                of impartiality and objectivity.</P>
              <P>The upholding of proper standards in public life is important 
                to all those who have the privilege of serving at any level of 
                government. The vast majority of people in elected office, of

              <P>parties and, more important, their constituents. That has had 
                an adverse effect on the important business of politics. The behaviour 
                of that minority has led to an increase in the level of scrutiny 
                over the past decade or more, and to a growing, legitimate demand 
                that standards in public life not only be high, but be seen to 
                be high.</P>
              <P>The consultative steering group built on the Nolan committee's 
                recommendations, and the Parliament and its Standards Committee 
                have taken an appropriately robust approach. That is all to the 
                good. The establishment of the post of Scottish parliamentary 
                standards commissioner will lend itself to the attempts that are 
                being made to restore public confidence in the serious business 
                of politics. I hope that the cynicism with which a number of our 
                fellow citizens regard politicians and the political process can 
                be addressed successfully if we all&#151;every one of us&#151;pledge 
                ourselves to a greater transparency and show our willingness to 
                open up the process to disinterested scrutiny.</P>
              <P>I welcome the open appointment process as detailed in the bill. 
                It is indicative of the Parliament's desire to ensure that the 
                Scottish parliamentary standards commissioner has security of 
                tenure and that their independence is assured. Unlike his or her 
                Westminster counterpart, the commissioner will have statutory 
                powers both to summon witnesses and to compile evidence. That 
                is positive; it is all to the good. I would contend that the bill 
                represents a more robust package than that available to our colleagues 
                down south. We can show the way.</P>
              <P>I register my appreciation for the work undertaken by the Standards 
                Committee in its nine-month inquiry into the handling of complaints 
                against MSPs. The Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner 
                Bill is the product of the committee's labour. I believe that 
                the bill is a clear sign of the Parliament's willingness to invite 
                independent, transparent scrutiny. The people of Scotland demand 
                and deserve no less. I commend the general principles of the bill 
                to the Parliament.</P>

              <P>with complaints.</P>
              <P>We were concerned to formulate a clear process that could be 
                understood by the complainer, by the person complained about and 
                by the wider public, and that could be applied in all circumstances. 
                We were also particularly concerned to establish that, at each 
                stage, the principles of natural justice should be properly observed 
                in the interests of MSPs, of the Parliament more generally and 
                of the wider public. That is an important dimension, which has 
                already been touched on in the debate.</P>
              <P>It is not sufficient that justice is done; it is important in 
                our context that the processes by which justice is done are clear 
                and transparent and are open to appropriate scrutiny. After a 
                long process of deliberation, we decided that we wanted to have 
                an independent standards commissioner. I warmly endorse that decision 
                and the fact that it has been carried forward into the bill. There 
                is a broad measure of cross-party support for that role and for 
                its being filled by an independent person.</P>
              <P>As we all know, there has been much debate about the process 
                of handling complaints down at Westminster. We should take some 
                credit for the fact that we have not had a similar debate about 
                the process of dealing with complaints here at Holyrood. That 
                is partly because we have established clearer principles and a 
                better procedure for dealing with complaints, whereby the person 
                investigating the complaints will be clearly independent and the 
                Parliament itself will transfer its statutory powers to allow 
                that person to carry out their function. Those are good principles.</P>
              <P>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton gave us a long quote from Churchill, 
                which I must say was read out in a very Churchillian way. It was 
                an appropriate point about the significance of standards in relation 
                to the whole stature and credence of politics. The job of politician 
                is often a difficult one, and one is always subjected to measures 
                of critical scrutiny, whatever one does and whichever party one 
                belongs to.</P>
              <P>To do our job properly, we need a set of clear procedures and 
                a clearly understood framework within which to operate, which 
                provides us with protection and the public and the Parliament 
                with safeguards. It is so important to get the balance right, 
                and I think that we have, overall, achieved that in the bill.</P>
              <P>I want to highlight some issues that I am not clear about, having 
                not been involved in the discussions on the subject over the past 
                18 months. One issue that was extensively discussed when I served 
                on the Standards Committee was that of how anonymous complaints 
                should be tackled. My firm view is that we should not really tolerate 
                anonymous complaints. If people have a </P>

              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_7" id="MakeMarkAuto_7"></A>Tricia Marwick: 
                </strong>Perhaps I can set Des McNulty's mind at ease. Anonymous complaints 
                fail the second admissibility test, which deals with procedural 
                defects, at stage 1 of the investigative process. The bill requires 
                that complaints be made by an individual person, be signed by 
                that person and that they provide their name and address. The 
                commissioner must refer any procedurally defective complaints 
                to the Standards Committee, and the committee can then direct 
                the commissioner either to dismiss the complaint or to disregard 
                that defect.</P>
              <P>The committee will also have the power to make a class direction 
                for anonymous complaints, which will require the commissioner 
                to refer those immediately to the committee without considering 
                the first or third tests at stage 1. In other words, it will determine 
                whether the complaint is relevant and warrants a full investigation.</P>
              <P>It is therefore not anticipated that anonymous complaints will 
                be dealt with by the commissioner or by the committee.</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_9" id="MakeMarkAuto_9"></A>Des McNulty: 
                </strong>I am grateful for that clarification, although I am not entirely 
                sure that the way in which the bill is framed necessarily makes 
                that as clear as it ought to be.</P>
              <P>Section 11 covers the withdrawal of complaints, and I draw members' 
                attention to subsection (2) in particular. We need to be clear 
                that, if a complaint is made and is then withdrawn, that carries 
                the onus that the complaint is without foundation. I do not think 
                that people should be in a position to submit complaints and then 
                withdraw them part of the way through the process without the 
                member concerned being explicitly exonerated as a result.</P>
              <P>That protection is important for members, but it does not take 
                anything away from the fact that we have achieved clarity and 
                certainty through the way in which we have established the investigatory 
                procedure. It is very positive that major problems have not arisen 
                from the operation of the standards process. That means that we 
                have got the process substantially right. I hope that, through 
                the bill, we will put into legislation procedures that will consolidate 
                the system completely. For that reason, I welcome the bill.</P>

              <P>someone who is not a member of the Standards Committee, I congratulate 
                the committee on the excellent work that it has done on the bill. 
                No doubt it has many more hours of work to do.</P>
              <P>Kay Ullrich was right to say that lawyers and journalists have 
                an even worse reputation than politicians have. I exempt my trade 
                of economist from that kind of reputation. All of us recognise 
                that there is an opinion abroad among the electorate that all 
                politicians are the same. Many people automatically regard politicians 
                as sleazebags who cannot be trusted. The onus is on politicians 
                from all parties to prove that that is not the case.</P>
              <P>I welcome the fact that the bill is a committee bill, which indicates 
                that there is broad consensus on this matter in the committee. 
                I also welcome the fact that in this debate there has been broad 
                cross-party consensus. It is absolutely essential that every member 
                of the Parliament signs up not only to the letter but to the spirit 
                of what is intended under the bill.</P>
              <P>Susan Deacon made a very valid point when she said that we should 
                not automatically reject what Westminster or other Parliaments 
                do, simply because they are other Parliaments. Similarly, we should 
                learn from where they have made mistakes, so that we do not repeat 
                those. The bill contains provisions that indicate that we have 
                learned the lessons of what has happened at Westminster.</P>
              <P>I welcome in particular the strenuous efforts that the bill makes 
                to ensure that the commissioner is as independent as possible. 
                However, I ask the Standards Committee at stage 2 to consider 
                a couple of ways in which that independence could be reinforced.</P>
              <P>First, it should be clear and unambiguous that the public appointments 
                code that will be updated in the forthcoming public bodies bill 
                should govern the appointment procedure for the new standards 
                commissioner, from the interview process through to the appointment 
                itself. That would reassure people that in relation to parliamentary 
                appointments there was no cronyism of the sort that we have witnessed 
                in relation to Executive or governmental appointments. Such a 
                provision would be a useful addition to the bill.</P>
              <P>My second point relates to the Standards Committee. I welcome 
                the fact that statutory powers will be given to the commissioner, 
                who will report to the Standards Committee. It will be up to the 
                Standards Committee to decide whether to recommend to the full 
                Parliament sanctions against a member or members. One problem 
                that arose at Westminster was that the committee that decided 
                whether to recommend sanctions was politically loaded one way. 
                Allegedly, it took a </P>

              <P>political decision about whether to recommend sanctions.</P>
              <P>My point may relate not so much to the bill as to the standing 
                orders and procedures of the Parliament, but as a matter of principle 
                we should ensure that the Standards Committee always has an independently 
                minded convener. There is no doubt that we have one at present&#151;sometimes 
                much to the chagrin of the party to which he belongs. Ideally, 
                the convener of the Standards Committee should be a member of 
                a non-Executive party&#151;certainly, they should belong to a 
                non-majority party.</P>
              <P>It is also important that we consider the composition of the 
                Standards Committee, to ensure that no one party can dominate 
                the committee. In that way, I hope that we will be able to avoid 
                a repetition of what has happened at Westminster.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>I want to take a moment to reassure Alex Neil 
                about the operations of the Standards Committee. I hope that he 
                is aware that there has never been a vote in the committee. We 
                do not operate on party-political lines. On the occasions when 
                we have dealt with complaints against members, members have never 
                shown any party-political bias&#151;at least, no such bias has 
                been detectable.</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>I recognise that as a fact and I welcome it 
                as such. However, today we are discussing rules and procedures 
                that will govern the issue of standards not just during this session 
                of Parliament, but for a much longer period. I accept that the 
                current Standards Committee has met the high standards to which 
                members have referred. However, we want as far as possible to 
                ensure that the rules make it very difficult&#151;if not impossible&#151;for 
                us to repeat the mistakes of Westminster, where politicised decisions 
                were taken by the Standards and Privileges Committee.</P>
              <P>Another issue that I would like to raise is the issue of directions, 
                in relation to which the Standards Committee has major powers. 
                That fact underlines the need to reinforce the independence of 
                the Standards Committee.</P>
              <P>The main purpose of the bill is to catch those who have breached 
                the code of conduct or who have brought Parliament into disrepute 
                in some other way. However, we should not use the provisions of 
                the bill to witch-hunt any member of the Parliament or to pursue 
                petty complaints by one member against another. As the bill makes 
                clear, its provisions should be restricted to serious allegations 
                of misconduct. The bill should not be used to settle personal 
                political scores, either within the Parliament or between individual 
                citizens and members of the Parliament.</P>

                extra minutes.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I would hate Alex Neil to 
                draw the wrong conclusion. In fact, he has spoken for six minutes 
                and 39 seconds. There is an error on the clock, which has added 
                the previous speaker's time to his.</P>
              <P>10:17</P>
              <P><strong>Tricia Marwick (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP): </strong>When we 
                entered the Parliament in May 1999, we were determined that it 
                would not be sullied by sleaze or by a repeat of the scandals 
                that took place at Westminster in the 1990s, which did great damage 
                to the reputation of politics and politicians.</P>
              <P>However, we were not driven just by the need to be different 
                from Westminster. From the outset, members of this Parliament 
                believed that it should be a model of probity. That belief has 
                driven the members of the Standards Committee, past and present, 
                not only to produce a bill that makes provision for the appointment 
                of an independent standards commissioner, but in the other work 
                that they have done, which is the cornerstone of the Parliament. 
                I refer to the rigid code of conduct that has been drawn up, the 
                possible registration of commercial lobby companies and the members' 
                interests order. All those measures will be in place by 2003. 
                By the end of the first session of the Scottish Parliament, structures 
                will be in place that will enable the Scottish people to have 
                confidence both in the procedures of the Parliament and in the 
                politicians who are members of it.</P>
              <P>In February 2000, the Standards Committee introduced a rigorous 
                code of conduct, which was endorsed by the Parliament. Members 
                will recall that at that time the Standards Committee made a commitment 
                to put in place robust arrangements for enforcing the code. The 
                Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Bill is the result 
                of the committee's endeavours in that regard. We believe that 
                the proposals contained in the bill, together with the exacting 
                requirements of the code of conduct, will ensure the highest possible 
                standards in the Parliament. They may also go some way towards 
                dispelling public cynicism about politicians.</P>
              <P>Under the Scotland Act 1998, the Standards Committee has the 
                power to carry out investigations. It is to the credit of members 
                of the Standards Committee that they wanted to ensure that there 
                was some independence in that process. That is why we have come 
                forward with the Scottish Parliamentary Standards </P>

              <P>Commissioner Bill today. The appointment of a commissioner would 
                bring that independent element into the complaints procedure. 
                He or she will consider complaints and carry out investigations 
                in private and independently of the Standards Committee. Secondly, 
                the bill will give the commissioner statutory powers, which will 
                enable him or her to carry out those investigations effectively. 
                That is an important distinction from the arrangements at Westminster.</P>
              <P>Refusal to co-operate with the Scottish Parliament's standards 
                commissioner will not be tolerated, although we hope that the 
                commissioner will not have to use their powers in that respect. 
                The power to summon witnesses to give evidence will also enhance 
                the independence of the post. The commissioner will not have to 
                rely on the committee's powers under the Scotland Act 1998. When 
                Elizabeth Filkin gave evidence to our inquiry, she was satisfied 
                at that time that she had no powers independent of the Standards 
                and Privileges Committee at Westminster. She felt that there was 
                no need for her to have such powers, because she worked well with 
                the committee at Westminster. I suspect that she does not think 
                that now.</P>
              <P>The next aspect of the bill that I highlight relates to the procedure 
                for appointing and removing the commissioner. Those are transparent 
                and will ensure that the appointment is made strictly on merit. 
                We envisage an open recruitment process with the post being advertised. 
                The commissioner can be removed only by a two-thirds majority 
                of those voting, thus providing security of tenure. The appointment 
                and removal provisions will also serve to underpin the independence 
                of the post.</P>
              <P>The committee has also indicated that there will be an open and 
                transparent recruitment process. The commissioner will be appointed 
                by the Parliament on the recommendation of the Standards Committee. 
                It is envisaged that that recommendation could be the subject 
                of a debate in the chamber if need be.</P>
              <P>Any evidence taken by the committee at stage 3 of the complaints 
                process will be in public session, as will the committee's decision 
                on the complaint. I emphasise that the commissioner and the committee's 
                report into investigations will be published with relevant evidence.</P>
              <P>Alex Neil's point about the make-up of the Standards Committee 
                struck me. Mike Rumbles and the members of the Standards Committee 
                have operated thus far in a strictly non-partisan manner. I pay 
                tribute to all my colleagues on the committee, past and present, 
                who have worked in that way. The Standards Committee is probably 
                the one committee of the Parliament that has worked in such a 
                way. I am struck by what Alex Neil said and I think that we could

              <P>terms of the standing orders and procedures to ensure that an 
                underpinning is there.</P>
              <P>The Standards Committee is currently undertaking a review of 
                the members' interests order, which has had a fair amount of publicity 
                recently. The bill also covers breaches of the order, but makes 
                it clear that the commissioner's power will apply to any legislation 
                that replaces the order.</P>
              <P>We will shortly publish our interim conclusions for consultation 
                with a proposal for a further committee bill this year. I urge 
                every member to get involved in that consultation process to ensure 
                that we have legislation on members' interests that is transparent 
                and proportionate.</P>
              <P>I am happy to take interventions but, failing that, I will continue.</P>
              <P>The reputation of the Parliament stands or falls on the integrity 
                of its members. That is inextricably linked to confidence in the 
                arrangements for handling complaints of misconduct. I believe 
                that the bill will provide a strong foundation for such confidence 
                in the probity of Parliament and its members.</P>
              <P>I turn briefly to another point that Alex Neil made about petty 
                complaints and the role of the commissioner. Some people have 
                said that the bill is very complicated and perhaps it looks extremely 
                complicated. The bill essentially defines relationships between 
                the independent commissioner, the Standards Committee and the 
                Parliament. It is inevitable that it has to be a fairly complicated-looking 
                bill. I am sure that members of my party and other parties, who 
                will consider the bill at stage 2, will find themselves working 
                through that.</P>
              <P>Alex Neil is right that the standards commissioner should not 
                be used for petty fights between members.</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>I am sure that my intervention is a relief 
                to everybody&#151;I am talking about the timing.</P>
              <P>I refer to the specific point that Des McNulty raised about not 
                having anonymous complainants. The quid pro quo for not having 
                anonymous complainants&#151;and I agree with that&#151;is that 
                where someone puts their name to a complaint, their rights are 
                protected as well. They cannot be scapegoated by the member whom 
                they have named.</P>
              <P><strong>Tricia Marwick: </strong>Alex Neil makes a good point. That is 
                precisely why, at stages 1 and 2, the investigative process will 
                be in private. That is to protect both the complainant and the 
                person about whom a complaint has been made.</P>
              <P>We are certainly not looking to appoint a witch-finder general 
                as part of the bill. That would be </P>

              <P>entirely the wrong message for members. We do not anticipate 
                having a Ken Starr who will consider one complaint, go on to another 
                and another and try to unravel some sort of spaghetti. It is absolutely 
                essential that the commissioner investigate specific complaints 
                and not general complaints that would allow investigations to 
                keep going and going. There has to be a beginning and end to that 
                process. I believe that the bill will provide a strong foundation 
                for confidence.</P>
              <P><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>One of the issues that it is important to 
                understand, both at this stage and at stage 2 of the bill, is 
                that the courts in Scotland can review the processes adopted by 
                the Parliament. Therefore we are subject to the procedures of 
                administrative law in the way in which we conduct the process. 
                That has informed the discussions of the Standards Committee and 
                has informed the way in which matters are handled. We have to 
                operate in line with legal best practice, not just what we think 
                is best practice, but the operating procedures of Scottish law. 
                That is an important underpinning for the bill.</P>
              <P><strong>Tricia Marwick: </strong>I agree with Des McNulty's point. Any 
                legislation that we pass can be subject to review by the courts. 
                Indeed the Scottish Countryside Alliance took to judicial review 
                a decision of the Standards Committee that cleared Mike Watson 
                early on in our lifetime. That found that the Standards Committee's 
                decisions had been entirely appropriate. We have already been 
                subject to judicial review and I expect that any decisions of 
                the Parliament would naturally be judicially reviewed.</P>
              <P>In the absence of more interventions, I conclude that I believe 
                that the bill will provide a strong foundation for confidence 
                in the probity of the Parliament and its members. I call upon 
                colleagues of all parties to endorse the general principles of 
                the bill and to ensure that it has a safe passage. More important, 
                we must give the independent commissioner our full support for 
                the work that he may do, but I hope will not have to do.</P>

              <P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr Murray Tosh): </strong>Our next 
                item of business is a debate on motion S1M-2752, in the name of 
                Irene Oldfather, on the European Committee's ninth report 2001&#151;&quot;Report 
                on the Governance of the European Union and the Future of Europe: 
                What Role for Scotland?&quot;</P>
              <P>10:29</P>
              <P><strong>Irene Oldfather (Cunninghame South) (Lab): </strong>It is appropriate 
                and fitting that today, as the convention to review the future 
                of Europe begins, we in the Scottish Parliament should begin to 
                debate our contribution to that future. I say &quot;begin&quot;, 
                because I hope that over the next two years the European Committee 
                and the Parliament will continue to contribute to and develop 
                that debate.</P>
              <P>The European Committee began its deliberations on the issue almost 
                a year ago and took seven months to conclude its inquiry. The 
                resulting report has been well received throughout Europe. It 
                is important that I place on record the fact that we appreciate 
                the responses to our work from legislatures, academics and interested 
                bodies across Europe. We look forward to promoting the report 
                further in Brussels next week, when the committee will meet the 
                European Commission.</P>
              <P>Before I talk about the body of the report, I take this opportunity 
                to thank committee members for the time that they spent on the 
                inquiry. There were volumes of written evidence and hours of oral 
                evidence&#151;sometimes the oral evidence sessions lasted a day. 
                Members deserve to have their work acknowledged.</P>
              <P>I would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that we took 
                evidence from regional representatives from throughout Europe. 
                We made history in the chamber when we made use of simultaneous 
                interpretation into and from several Community languages to take 
                evidence from representatives of regions and authorities from 
                throughout Europe. On behalf of the committee, I record our thanks 
                to the clerks. I am sure that members agree that the clerks did 
                a tremendous job in assimilating the substantial written and oral 
                evidence to produce the final report.</P>
              <P>The present structure of Europe was designed to accommodate the 
                original six member states, but the new Europe will involve some 
                27 member states. The Europe of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century will

              <P>century. That is why we must take time to examine the question 
                of reform. Member states and the European Commission have recognised 
                the need to connect with ordinary citizens as a necessary part 
                of that reform. The European Committee believes that the process 
                of engaging with our citizens is a priority.</P>
              <P>It is astonishing and disturbing that almost the same number 
                of people voted in ITV's recent &quot;Pop Idol&quot; competition 
                as voted in the most recent European Parliament elections. In 
                recent polls, the UK population is consistently the least well 
                informed about the activities of the European Union in comparison 
                with other nations. It is against that background that we seek 
                to extend the debate on Europe from intellectual elites to ordinary 
                people. The fact that that will not be easy is not a good enough 
                reason for standing back. I acknowledge the role that was played 
                last year by the Jean Monnet European centre of excellence when 
                it organised, with the European Committee, a well-attended conference, 
                the purpose of which was to extend the debate to ordinary people. 
                However, I note that, last year, there were 13 such regional conferences 
                in France.</P>
              <P>Let me be clear. Contrary to popular belief&#151;for which the 
                media must take some responsibility&#151;Europe is not over there 
                and it is not about foreign affairs. We cannot afford to bury 
                our heads in the sand. Europe is about the things that matter 
                to ordinary people: sustainable jobs; economic development; improving 
                our environment; high quality in our food safety; and enhancing 
                our quality of life. The challenge of raising awareness of the 
                issues should not be exclusive to politicians. We are all stakeholders 
                when it comes to explaining how the European Union affects our 
                lives. It is worth noting that the Scottish Parliament commands 
                unprecedented attention from the fourth estate, yet there are 
                no longer any Brussels-based correspondents who report directly 
                to Scotland on EU matters. That is a matter of regret.</P>
              <P><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>Irene Oldfather 
                made a relevant point when she referred to the effect of Europe 
                on people's jobs. Does she agree that it is reasonable for different 
                countries in Europe to have different workplace conditions, given 
                the range of activities in, and cultures and habits of, the countries 
                that make up Europe? Those differences will become clearer if 
                we end up with 27 member states.</P>
              <P><strong>Irene Oldfather: </strong>I agree with Phil Gallie about the principle 
                of cultural diversity. However, it is important that we set standards 
                for employment conditions throughout Europe.</P>
              <P>Better governance means opening up the debate on Europe to a 
                wider audience. It also means greater participation, transparency

              <P>accountability. In order to improve participation and accountability, 
                people must understand the system. The principle of simplifying 
                treaties was one of the committee's key recommendations, on which 
                there was considerable consensus from those who gave evidence. 
                In the run-up to previous intergovernmental conferences, I have 
                often found agreement on that principle, but achieving change 
                is not easy. The committee's view was that the next IGC must tackle 
                the treaties. We will hamper the establishment of new ways of 
                working in Europe and greater understanding by citizens if we 
                do not deal with that principle this time. In order to illustrate 
                the point, I have with me an old, outdated and abridged version 
                of the treaties. We do not want to change the meaning of the treaties, 
                but citizens should be able to read and understand information 
                about who does what on Europe without growing old in the process.</P>
              <P>I will say a few words about transparency, which the European 
                Committee believes can play a part in redressing the democratic 
                deficit. I begin by talking about transparency at the European 
                Union level. When we took evidence, the committee returned time 
                and again to the lack of transparency in meetings of the Council 
                of Ministers. When the Minister of State for Europe, Peter Hain, 
                gave evidence to the committee, he acknowledged the need for greater 
                transparency when decisions were taken during Council meetings. 
                Nowhere else within the democracies of the world do legislatures 
                take decisions that affect citizens in that way. How on earth 
                can we expect politicians, interest groups and citizens to have 
                an interest in the machinations of EU decision making if decisions 
                are made behind closed doors? If we had a clearer picture of what 
                happens in Council meetings, there could be better scrutiny of 
                the EU by national and regional Parliaments. That would help the 
                process of transparency and scrutiny in the United Kingdom and 
                would assist in placing matters in the public domain.</P>
              <P>Allied to those steps is the need for greater scrutiny of the 
                comitology process, in which officials often flesh out the important 
                detail of measures. The European Committee, in common with MEPs 
                who gave evidence, would like to open up that process and to make 
                it accountable. In the committee's view, the way in which to do 
                so is not to create a new institution over there, but to have 
                much better scrutiny of the EU over here.</P>
              <P><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I welcome 
                the member's comments on transparency, particularly in relation 
                to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive. Does she 
                agree that the joint ministerial committees that meet within the 
                UK must be much more transparent? The Scottish Parliament is kept 
                in the dark about what is discussed at those meetings.</P>

              <P><strong>Irene Oldfather: </strong>The committee's view was that there should 
                be greater transparency. In a minute, I will speak about how we 
                could achieve that within the United Kingdom and within the Scottish 
                Parliament.</P>
              <P>The European Scrutiny Committee in the House of Commons and the 
                European Union Committee in the House of Lords share the view 
                of transparency that I expressed. I welcome the comment in the 
                Executive's response to our report that it commits itself</P>
              <P>&quot;to developing better arrangements for reporting to Committee 
                around meetings of the EU Council of Ministers.&quot;</P>
              <P>The committee welcomes that step forward and we are developing 
                procedures to ensure that that work is carried out efficiently.</P>
              <P>I come now to an important point about liaison in the run-up 
                to the IGC. The European Committee and the Scottish Parliament 
                must continue to ensure that our voices are heard in the run-up 
                to the IGC. The committee has written to the Executive and the 
                UK Government about the issue and we will ensure that, in the 
                coming months, we play an integral part in leading the debate 
                in the UK on better decision making in Europe. The Scottish Parliament 
                is well placed to do that because it is Europe's newest and youngest 
                Parliament and it is committed to transparency, openness and accountability.</P>
              <P>I note that, in its response to our report, the Executive suggested 
                that a way forward on the IGC was to</P>
              <P>&quot;continue to champion an open and wideranging debate on 
                the subject and to co-ordinate our efforts in Scotland with those 
                of the UK Government&quot;.</P>
              <P>Let me put down a marker that is consistent with the committee's 
                principles, which I outlined earlier: the internal UK debate must 
                not be between Executives only and it must not be held in private. 
                The joint ministerial committees are a useful tool for discussions 
                between Administrations, but to parliamentarians and the public 
                at large they are a closed shop. There must be wider involvement 
                and wider debates.</P>
              <P>On the role of constitutional regions in the legislative process, 
                we believe that such regions should have a strong role in early 
                access to the Commission, which recognises the importance of Parliaments 
                such as ours across Europe. I believe that that could improve 
                law making in Europe, because it would influence how laws are 
                made in the same way as we in the Parliament take evidence at 
                stage 1 in committees. That would be a positive development. I 
                hope that the Executive will support the committee by recognising 
                the need for a new relationship with the Commission on the development 
                of EC legislation. That could begin to </P>

                to the process.</P>
              <P>The committee has begun to develop links with similar regions 
                across Europe. There is a great deal of interest in our Parliament 
                throughout Europe and beyond. It would not be possible to engage 
                actively with every region that wants to enter into partnership 
                with us. I recommend that we set ourselves guidelines for partnerships 
                with other regions. The guiding principle should always be practical 
                and demonstrable benefit to the people of Scotland. Next week 
                in Brussels, the committee will meet representatives from the 
                regions of Catalonia, Flanders and Saxony-Anhalt. I look forward 
                to discussing areas of future co-operation that will offer real 
                benefit to our peoples.</P>
              <P>I have a couple of closing points to make. In the Executive's 
                response to our report, the minister agreed with many of our recommendations, 
                although he did not agree with those on the scrutiny reserve and 
                access to the courts. I hope that the minister will keep an open 
                mind on those matters in the months ahead, when decisions and 
                debate will occur in the Parliament and across Europe.</P>
              <P>Europe continues to enlarge and expand eastwards, incorporating 
                new friends and offering new markets. In economic terms, an enlarged 
                European Union could mean an extra 175 million for the Scottish 
                economy. More important, it will help to create greater peace 
                and stability for the people of Europe. Its relevance to the legislative 
                work load of the Parliament will continue to be immense. Between 
                now and 2004, the Parliament must continue to contribute to the 
                debate at every possible level.</P>
              <P>Only three years ago, a debate such as today's would not have 
                been possible&#151;there was no Scottish Parliament. Although 
                there is a long way to go, let us never underestimate just how 
                far we have come. I look forward to hearing the contribution of 
                colleagues.</P>

                committee's ninth report of 2001. I commend the committee on the

              <P>Henry was the committee's convener. I am sure that he deserves 
                the thanks of the Parliament for the contribution that he made.</P>
              <P>The debate is timely, as the convention on the future of Europe 
                meets for the first time today. We have the opportunity to discuss 
                the relevant issues in the Parliament. We should reflect on Irene 
                Oldfather's closing sentiments. Three years ago, we did not have 
                a Parliament in which a particularly Scottish viewpoint could 
                be expressed. We should value the fact that we have the opportunity 
                to express such a viewpoint.</P>
              <P>Although we await the contribution of the Conservative party, 
                a debate on Europe in the Parliament proceeds on the basis of 
                a reasonable degree of consensus about the importance of Scotland's 
                relationship with the European Union, if not on the basis of unanimous 
                agreement. I hope that we can have a healthy debate that allows 
                proper discussion, rather than one in which people get totally 
                bogged down in trenches and make no progress.</P>
              <P>I have the opportunity to set out the Executive's position on 
                the governance and the future of Europe, which are two of the 
                most important issues that face the European Union. They are vital 
                not only because they affect Governments and are the preserve 
                of Parliaments, but because, as Irene Oldfather said, they have 
                considerable significance for the Scottish people and their counterparts 
                across Europe.</P>
              <P>One of our key concerns should be the perceived failure of the 
                European institutions to connect with the ordinary citizen. Irene 
                Oldfather made the point that more people voted in the &quot;Pop 
                Idol&quot; final than in the European elections. I think that 
                I voted for Will. No, I voted for Gareth. I used that point until 
                someone pointed out that, as far as we know, in the European elections 
                people vote only once.</P>
              <P>The debate is about devising a modified framework of governance 
                that will enable the European Union to work more openly and effectively 
                to achieve what individual citizens want&#151;tangible things, 
                such as greater prosperity through full employment, better electronic 
                communication, cleaner water, cleaner air, the preservation of 
                our natural heritage and safer streets and communities through 
                a collective attack on organised crime. That is why the Executive 
                takes the debate seriously and has offered its views on how the 
                framework should be modified.</P>
              <P><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>I welcome the minister's comments. I 
                am glad that he is taking the debate seriously. Given that the

                the convention?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>Later in my speech, I will say something substantive 
                on how we ensure that a Scottish voice and Scottish viewpoints 
                are expressed and channelled into the convention.</P>
              <P>In many areas of policy, joint action across Europe will have 
                a far greater impact than action that is taken in isolation by 
                any individual country. For that reason, we attach considerable 
                importance to the work of the European Union and are clear that 
                we should and will make a meaningful contribution to it. We intend 
                to play an active role in Europe and will continue to consolidate 
                and extend that role, not least through our participation in the 
                future of Europe debate. Therefore, we are delighted that the 
                committee has devoted its time and energy to reporting on that 
                subject. The report itself marks an important Scottish contribution 
                to the debate.</P>
              <P>The Executive's approach to the future of Europe debate is based 
                on five key elements. We are pro-Europe, because of the significance 
                of the EU to Scotland's prosperity and to improving the quality 
                of people's lives. We are pro-United Kingdom, because our agreements 
                with the UK Government give us more power than a small nation 
                would otherwise have. Furthermore, the Executive and the UK benefit 
                from access to an influential layer of European government, which 
                was denied pre-devolution. We are pro-reform, because change is 
                needed to give a greater democratic legitimacy to European decision 
                making. We are pro-sub-member state Government involvement. If 
                any member could come up with a better phrase than &quot;pro-sub-member 
                state Government&quot;, I would welcome their contribution. Such 
                Administrations can play a vital role in restoring the democratic 
                equilibrium and in linking the citizen with the European institutions. 
                We are pro-debate, because we are convinced that openness is the 
                best route for generating effective solutions and for bringing 
                citizens on board.</P>
              <P>In putting forward its views, the Executive has concentrated 
                on a series of practical measures that it believes will realise 
                a more open, effective and relevant European Union. There should 
                be a statement of subsidiarity principles to ensure that the EU 
                acts only when its action would be more effective than action 
                at the member state or Scottish level. To ensure that subsidiarity 
                is properly applied, we have proposed the introduction of an independent 
                subsidiarity watchdog. Although we have an open mind on the form 
                that that body will take, our preference is for a political body, 
                as subsidiarity is a political concept. That body should have 
                the power to act before legislation is finalised and should have

              <P><strong>Ben Wallace (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>Have the Scottish 
                Executive and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities had 
                a response from the UK Government to their joint position, just 
                as the Executive responded to the committee on the ideas that 
                it put forward?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>There has been no specific response yet, but 
                I indicated that the Commission has taken on board many of the 
                points that the Scottish Executive and COSLA made to it. That 
                is very much part of the debate.</P>
              <P>The debate on subsidiarity is important because, when the European 
                Union acts, it should do so proportionately and in a way that 
                respects national and regional identities. There should be an 
                assessment of how the potential financial impact of legislation 
                compares to the benefits, so that we can be sure that the outcome 
                justifies the effort.</P>
              <P>We make the general point that the sub-member state Administration, 
                which is closer to the people and is often responsible for implementing 
                Commission proposals, should have a greater involvement in the 
                EU decision-making process. Our suggestion does not seek to press 
                member states to give up powers, but the European Union should 
                recognise situations in which a member state has already devolved 
                power.</P>
              <P>When the Commission is developing policies, it should consult 
                implementing authorities at the pre-legislative stage. That consultation 
                should be based on a code of practice, which would ensure that 
                the Commission is made aware of any fundamental problems at the 
                formative stage. That would also enable those who are charged 
                with achieving targets to be involved in setting them. To facilitate 
                more comprehensive consultation, we believe that greater use can 
                be made of information technology.</P>
              <P>On implementation, we have proposed that the EU should look at 
                a range of measures to achieve objectives instead of always resorting 
                to detailed legislation. We suggest that there should be more 
                framework proposals, which would provide implementing authorities 
                such as the Scottish Executive with the scope for a flexible, 
                decentralised approach. We also suggest that there should be more 
                short, strategic laws. Such an approach would enable an Administration 
                that is closer to the people to achieve the objectives in a way 
                that is more sympathetic to local circumstances.</P>
              <P>Finally, we believe that the whole legislative process&#151;from 
                the Commission to the European Parliament to the Council of Ministers&#151;should

              <P>more transparent. Indeed, transparency was one of the themes 
                of the European Committee report. As Irene Oldfather pointed out, 
                the Executive's response to the report indicated that we are in 
                favour of a more transparent legislative process within the European 
                Union so that interested bodies can know how draft legislation 
                is modified.</P>
              <P>Inevitably, some of the proposals in the European Committee's 
                report go beyond our thinking at this stage and there are a few 
                proposals with which we disagree. Irene Oldfather mentioned the 
                scrutiny reserve. As she acknowledged, we have committed ourselves 
                to working with the European Committee by reporting on meetings 
                of the Council of Ministers. We will seek to ensure that arrangements 
                are put in place so that, as far as possible, the committee is 
                given the opportunity to feed its views to the Executive at a 
                point at which those views can realistically be reflected in our 
                discussions with the UK Government. At this stage, we favour that 
                option rather than the formal scrutiny reserve. However, I give 
                Irene Oldfather the reassurance that she sought that we are willing 
                to revisit the issue once we have had some experience of the new 
                arrangements in operation.</P>
              <P>In passing, I think that it is worth mentioning that the work 
                that went into the report is of some note. For the first time 
                ever, during the committee's inquiry, a UK minister gave evidence 
                to a committee of the Scottish Parliament. The fact that Peter 
                Hain gave evidence to the committee is indicative of his commitment 
                to encouraging the debate and of the ready willingness of Her 
                Majesty's Government to listen to the Scottish viewpoint.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>Before responding to Richard Lochhead's point,

              <P><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>The minister mentioned that Mr Hain's 
                participation in the inquiry was welcome. Is not it somewhat ironic 
                that Mr Hain will give evidence to the Parliament but the Secretary 
                of State for Scotland will not?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I have many responsibilities, but they do 
                not include answering on behalf of the Secretary of State for 
                Scotland. I was delighted that Peter Hain came to the Parliament 
                and I think that the committee responded well to him. I believe 
                that Peter Hain has offered to return at some stage to engage 
                once more with the committee in its debate on the European Union.</P>

                In anticipation of views that may be expressed, let me be clear 
                that it would be unrealistic for all sub-member state Administrations 
                to be present. However, I am confident that all sub-member states 
                will exert influence and get their views across. It is inconceivable 
                that the Catalans and the Bavarians will not try to make their 
                views known; the same principle applies for Scotland. It is essential 
                that Scottish views are understood and that Scottish thinking 
                contributes to the debate and feeds into EU deliberations.</P>
              <P>The Executive has an active role in the debates on the governance 
                and future of Europe. We have already participated in four future 
                of Europe debates. The Executive and COSLA have submitted to the 
                European Commission a joint paper on governance, from which several 
                proposals have been taken up. The proposals that have been accepted 
                include the recommendation that enhanced consultation should be 
                based on a code of practice and that there should be greater flexibility 
                of implementation. We also worked with our European partners to 
                produce the Flanders declaration and the Li&egrave;ge resolution.</P>

                once again.</P>
              <P>When there is a matter that is particularly relevant to Scotland, 
                one of the best ways of defending Scottish interests in Europe 
                is to seek to take the lead role for the UK representation in 
                the Council of Ministers. Since devolution, the Scottish Executive 
                has led the UK delegation at three meetings of the Council of 
                Ministers. Will the minister explain the criteria that are used 
                to determine which meetings of the Council of Ministers the Scottish 
                Executive seeks to lead?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>The criterion is common sense. Perhaps that 
                is as good an answer as any. A dialogue goes on between the Scottish 
                Executive and the UK Government. Even when a Scottish minister 
                may not be nominally in the lead, that does not mean that the 
                Scottish minister cannot participate in the meetings of the Council 
                of Ministers.</P>
              <P>Last November, I attended the meeting for justice and home affairs, 
                for which David Blunkett was in the lead. David Blunkett positively

                for me to remind other member states that Scots law is different.

              <P><strong>Mr McAllion: </strong>The <em>Financial Times</em> reported that 
                Scottish ministers have attended about 12 per cent of all ministerial 
                meetings in Brussels, whereas representatives of the German L&auml;nder 
                were present at about a third of all such meetings. Do the Germans 
                attend too often or do Scottish ministers not attend often enough?</P>

                </strong>It is fair to say that there are more German L&auml;nder than 
                the one Scottish Administration. It might be interesting to see 
                the breakdown to discover how often individual German L&auml;nder 
                are represented. It would not be appropriate for me to attend 
                justice and home affairs council meetings that deal with reserved 
                matters such as asylum. Our decision on whether we attend is based 
                on the specific agenda of the meeting.</P>

              <P><strong>Dr Ewing: </strong>The minister mentioned that he attended the 
                November meeting of the Council of Ministers, at which he spoke 
                about Scots law protection, which concerns me deeply. In the European 
                Parliament, Neil MacCormick attempted to keep the protection of 
                the 110-day rule, but all the Labour and Tory members abstained 
                or voted against his amendment. That was not a good example of 
                representation from our MEPs. Did the minister raise the issue 
                of the 110-day rule at the November meeting?</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_16" id="MakeMarkAuto_16"></A>Mr Wallace: 
                </strong>I cannot remember the specific issue with the 110-day rule, 
                but nothing has emerged that will compromise the 110-day rule.</P>

              <P>Once the details of the forum and structured network are known, 
                we shall encourage civil society in Scotland to participate. That 
                is important. It is right to point out that the debate should 
                not take place simply between Governments or between parliamentarians. 
                Indeed, paragraph 67 of the committee's report states:</P>
              <P>&quot;we agree with Alex Orr who in his evidence to the Committee 
                said:</P>
              <P>'It is also important that the debate does not simply engage 
                with the &quot;intellectual elite&quot;, but embraces the whole 
                of civil society. For this purpose, the holding of a limited number 
                of public meetings, as well as a link from the Scottish Executive 
                site to the &quot;Future of Europe&quot; site on the FCO website, 
                will assist in engaging with the public'&quot;.</P>
              <P>The fact that Alex Orr is a private citizen who gave evidence 
                to the committee makes his comments even more pertinent. We are 
                looking into the possibility of the Scottish Executive website 
                being helpful in that debate.</P>
              <P>Given the extensive range of avenues available, I am confident 
                that Scottish views will be known and reflected and that we will 
                maintain our position as a serious player. The Executive will 
                continue to be active in matters of governance and the future 
                of Europe as debates unfold. We advocate an open and wide-ranging 
                debate and therefore welcome and take note of the European Committee's 
                report. We hope that the efforts to date of central Government 
                and local government will, in the year ahead, be matched by participation 
                and input from businesses, academics, the trade unions and, indeed, 
                the citizens of Scotland and other member states, so that the 
                Europe of the future&#151;as we look forward to an enlarged Europe&#151;better

                allow herself to be excluded from decisions on arrangements that 
                may last for decades. There is perhaps no better illustration 
                of the Executive's negligence than its failure to secure places 
                for Scotland on the convention. We are debating this crucial issue 
                here in Edinburgh, but our European neighbours are meeting elsewhere 
                and this Parliament and Government will be posted missing.</P>
              <P>It was left to the SNP to secure Scotland's only two representatives 
                at the convention: Professor Sir Neil MacCormick MEP and Councillor 
                Keith Brown will be present, ensuring that Scotland is represented. 
                The European Committee will welcome that, because it supported 
                full and active Scottish participation.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I know that Richard Lochhead would not 
                willingly mislead the Parliament, but he might acknowledge that 
                Lord Maclennan was a Scottish Liberal Democrat MP&#151;and, before 
                that, a Labour MP&#151;for a long time and that he, a Scot, is 
                there at the convention. He is there as a substitute for a full 
                member and not simply as an observer. Mr Lochhead might also acknowledge 
                that Sir John Kerr, a Scot, is a key figure in the whole convention 
                set-up. Therefore, to suggest that Scotland is dependent only 
                on the SNP to have anyone anywhere near the scene is totally misleading.</P>
              <P><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>I assure the minister that he cannot 
                pull the wool over the people of Scotland's eyes. The people he 
                mentions are representing the Westminster Government but no one 
                is representing the Scottish Government or the Scottish Parliament. 
                That is a fact. I urge the minister to give a commitment today 
                that he will work with Scotland's sole representatives on the 
                convention to ensure that our views are taken on board.</P>
              <P>Impending enlargement may be the catalyst for the current debate, 
                but change is long overdue. We should never lose sight of the 
                fact that the European Union has been successful in ensuring peace 
                through economic co-operation. Europe has also brought people 
                of different cultures together and has allowed neighbouring states 
                to act together on issues of common interest. Much economic and 
                social progress has been inspired by European co-operation. Indeed, 
                in the dark days of Westminster rule, Europe was often the source 
                of the few progressive social and environmental policies that 
                made their way to Scotland.</P>
              <P>Too many Scots now view European institutions as remote, power 
                hungry and stuffed with highly paid and overly bureaucratic officials

              <P>businessperson what Europe means to them, the answer will be 
                that it means inflexible and often damaging regulations, and endless 
                paperwork. That situation has arisen for several reasons. One 
                is the lack of influence that Scotland wields over European policy 
                and the failure to use what limited influence is available to 
                us to ensure that Scotland's views are taken into account. We 
                are reminded of that every time ministers get to their feet at 
                question time and explain that it is Europe that takes the decisions 
                on genetically modified crops, export bans on Scottish meat, state 
                subsidies and fishing and farming regulations. What little influence 
                is available, the Scottish Executive fails to use. We need look 
                no further than the coalition's atrocious record of attendance 
                at the Council of Ministers.</P>
              <P>In a parliamentary answer to a question of mine, the minister 
                said that between March 2000 and December 2001, the Scottish Executive 
                was represented at only 12.8 per cent of meetings of the Council 
                of Ministers. That is an atrocious rate of attendance, which has 
                already been referred to by Labour members. It is no wonder that 
                the European Committee is calling for more involvement in such 
                meetings and, indeed, for an automatic right to attend the Council 
                of Ministers.</P>
              <P>The Executive has led at only three meetings of the Council of 
                Ministers since devolution&#151;twice on education and once on 
                health. Mr Wallace says that the criterion for leading is common 
                sense; if common sense is the criterion, why on earth are we not 
                leading the United Kingdom delegations on matters to do with agriculture 
                and fisheries?</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Lab): </strong>Is 
                Mr Lochhead seriously suggesting that all the useful work that 
                is done at meetings of the Council of Ministers or elsewhere is 
                actually agreed on the day during some kind of cosy chat among 
                those who attend? Is it not the case&#151;as Angus Robertson MP 
                pointed out when giving evidence to the European Committee&#151;that 
                the SNP's ambition is for individual parliamentarians to do a 
                lot of travelling to European institutions to find out what is 
                going on?</P>
              <P><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The member is displaying his ignorance. 
                However, he is right to suggest that much of the work is done 
                before meetings. If the member investigates the Scottish Executive's 
                attendance at the thousands of working groups that take place 
                every year prior to meetings of the Council of Ministers, he will 
                find that its rate of attendance is 10 times worse than its rate 
                of attendance at the Council of Ministers.</P>
              <P>As the European Committee's report points out, the treaties enable 
                member states to delegate their votes on the Council to sub-member 
                state Governments, yet we have the ludicrous situation in Scotland

              <P>predominantly Scottish as fisheries, Scottish ministers are so 
                weak that they will not stand up to London and demand the lead 
                role in negotiations. Contrast that with the situation in Belgium, 
                where the Flemish have taken the lead role for that member state 
                as of right since the beginning of this year. Why can the same 
                thing not happen in Scotland?</P>
              <P>We know that we cannot rely on London ministers&#151;even the 
                National Farmers Union of Scotland now says so. Jim Walker of 
                the NFUS appeared before the Rural Development Committee in September. 
                He said:</P>
              <P>&quot;There is a fundamental weakness in the political set-up 
                in this country, as we seem unable to influence&#151;we cannot 
                influence&#151;at the highest level the negotiations that take 
                place in Europe&quot;.&#151;[<em>Official Report, Rural Development 
                Committee,</em> 18 September 2001; c 2147.]</P>
              <P>Even Scottish industries are coming round to the SNP's viewpoint 
                that the current arrangements simply do not work for Scotland.</P>
              <P><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>The member surely ignores the fact that, 
                at the very highest level, a number of representatives of Scotland 
                operate on behalf of Scotland and the United Kingdom within Europe&#151;for 
                example, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the former Foreign 
                Secretary. The member must take such facts on board.</P>
              <P><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>I inform the member that what is required 
                is for this Government and this Parliament to be represented in 
                the decision-making processes, so that votes are cast on behalf 
                of Scotland.</P>
              <P>Scottish ministers prefer to rely on secretive and cosy little 
                joint ministerial councils in a vain bid to influence London's 
                European policies. There have been only two JMCs on Europe since 
                devolution, and Labour's internal problems prevented it from attending 
                one of those. Labour has actually attended only one JMC on Europe 
                since devolution. The closer London gets to the negotiating table, 
                the further Scotland is from its mind. Despite the opportunities 
                offered by Scotland's new constitutional status, Scotland continues 
                to be sidelined and silenced in Europe. Ministers are caught in 
                the headlights. They are too timorous to stand up to London, but 
                the people of Scotland rightly expect them to deliver.</P>
              <P>Another reason for reform is that Europe does too much at the 
                centre. If the Scottish public is to continue to support Europe, 
                we should never take that support for granted. If this Parliament 
                is to retain legitimacy, only decisions that have to be taken 
                at European level should be taken there. Subsidiarity should be 
                Europe's guiding principle rather than some airy-fairy academic 
                concept. We need only look at the common fisheries policy to see 
                what happens when subsidiarity is not put into practice.</P>

              <P>The SNP believes that we should support a Europe that allows 
                all its nations, regions and communities to have a say in the 
                decision-making process. The EU exists for its citizens and not 
                for political elites. We need a people's Europe where all communities 
                are listened to and involved. It is therefore essential that the 
                people of Scotland are at the heart of the forthcoming debate 
                on the reform of Europe.</P>
              <P>Scottish ministers should aim to maximise our influence in Europe. 
                Under devolution, that means securing mechanisms that allow Administrations 
                with considerable legislative powers, such as the Scottish Parliament, 
                a direct role in decision making and, as the committee argued, 
                access to institutions such as the European Court of Justice. 
                If we do not ensure that Scotland's voice is heard, the report 
                that we are debating today will be left to gather dust on the 
                shelf. The SNP's objective is to place Scotland at the heart of 
                decision making through independence in Europe. Real influence 
                will be acquired only by securing a seat at the top table alongside 
                other small independent European nations. Is it any wonder that 
                Scotland is Europe's invisible nation, given the Scottish Executive's 
                current policy?</P>
              <P>The SNP wants Scots to grow up in a confident and vibrant Scotland 
                that stands alongside our neighbours at the heart of EU decision 
                making. We want to grow up in a Europe that recognises the need 
                not only for co-operation but for diversity and democratic legitimacy 
                at international, national, regional and local levels. Scotland 
                is lumbered with a Government that does not know whether it is 
                coming or going in Europe. Ministers are unclear about their role 
                and unwilling to stand up to London. It is time for the Scottish 
                Government and the Scottish Parliament to seek maximum influence 
                in Brussels to ensure that we help to shape the future of Europe.</P>

              <P><strong>Ben Wallace (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>I welcome the

                European governance and how that will plug into an enlarged European 
                Union. I would like to bring the debate back to the report and 
                the discussions about the future of Europe, rather than talk about 
                who did not turn up to what ministerial meeting&#151;the usual 
                fantasy politics of the SNP. That is obviously part of the SNP's

              <P>I spent last week's recess in Savoie in France. Savoie, much 
                like parts of Scotland&#151;</P>
              <P><strong>Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab): </strong>Mr Wallace 
                was sliding downhill as usual.</P>
              <P><strong>Ben Wallace: </strong>I was not minister for tourism at the time, 
                so it was all right.</P>
              <P>Savoie is sandwiched between Italy and Switzerland. Like many 
                regions in the EU, it feels alienated. As a result, there has 
                been a surge in nationalism in that part of Europe. Savoie feels 
                alienated from how decisions are made within France and within 
                the European Union. That issue is at the heart of why we are beginning 
                the debate on European governance.</P>
              <P>Today, we have round one of the convention in Brussels. Unlike 
                the SNP, I do not believe that every sub-nation state should have 
                a place in that, as a convention of some 750 people would be pushed 
                to come to a conclusion. I have faith that my colleagues in Westminster 
                will put forward our views. I talk to them a lot, trying to ensure 
                that we get a position and fight for the best that we can get. 
                That is the best way to reach a practical framework.</P>
              <P>The Scottish Executive and COSLA have produced a clear position&#151;I 
                do not agree with it, but at least they did it in advance. In 
                contrast, Peter Hain is going to Europe with no clear position; 
                he will discuss most things in secret and, as usual, the decisions 
                will probably be made in secret. That is not the way to deal with 
                the problem of people feeling alienated from Europe. It will be 
                another step away. People will ask how the convention came up 
                with the framework. France has held regional meetings. Ministers 
                have gone out to discuss with people what they think the future 
                European structure and institutions should be. It is a shame that 
                we start day one by aggravating the problem that we are trying 
                to solve.</P>
              <P><strong>Irene Oldfather: </strong>Would the member accept that the Minister 
                of State for Europe has agreed to come to the committee and work 
                with us to formulate a position on the convention?</P>
              <P><strong>Ben Wallace: </strong>The minister came to the committee and did 
                not give any position. That is the point: we need to have a position 
                from which to start the debate. The European Union produced the 
                green paper in July 2001. That was the framework and we all discussed 
                it. Nearly every member state has discussed that green paper and 
                used it as its starting point. Mr Blair chose to go to Warsaw, 
                where he stated that he wanted a second chamber, but was not very 
                clear about the future of Europe. Mr Hain wrote a very good book

                to his book, Mr Hain is an enemy of Europe&#151;the book was very 
                anti-EU and anti-euro. Clearly things have moved on since he got 
                a ministerial position.</P>
              <P>The questions were put out by the EU for us to discuss. The UK 
                position is important because it is through that position that 
                we in Scotland engage in the debate. Did Mr Hain answer the question 
                as to whether he wanted a second chamber? He moved from Tony Blair's 
                position to that of &quot;Perhaps, maybe&quot;. Mr Hain said that 
                he wanted greater transparency in Europe, but he was not prepared 
                to open up the Council of Ministers. He did not discuss the number 
                of commissioners or MEPs. He did not discuss many of the things 
                into which we are trying to have an inquiry. That is not the way 
                to go about things. If we do not have a position, we cannot have 
                a debate and we cannot engage people in Scotland in deciding how 
                the future should be shaped.</P>
              <P><strong>Irene Oldfather: </strong>Does the member accept that this is the 
                beginning of the debate? The minister came to the committee and 
                we invited him back&#151;he is coming in a month or so. That visit 
                will be an opportunity to engage in the debate further. The European 
                Commission has not even closed its consultation yet. Today, we 
                are engaging in the debate.</P>
              <P><strong>Ben Wallace: </strong>Irene Oldfather is slightly wrong. If the 
                European Commission can produce a framework and if the Scottish 
                Executive, COSLA, the Conservatives, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats 
                can produce a position, why on earth can the UK Government not 
                produce a basic position on which we can have a discussion? The 
                positions that it has indicated have moved over the past 18 months&#151;from 
                second chamber to no second chamber and from no subsidiarity panel 
                to a subsidiarity panel. That is the problem. We cannot engage 
                with Peter Hain's views, because we are not allowed to be involved 
                in the process.</P>
              <P>Should we be so grateful that the minister might come to the 
                European Committee after the agenda of the convention has been 
                set? Why can we not be there in advance? I am not asking for a 
                right of access to the convention, as the SNP is. I am asking 
                to be treated with decency&#151;the decency that my constituents 
                deserve&#151;and to be consulted on the position and to have a 
                discussion. Every other member state in Europe talks to its citizens 
                about the future of Europe. I do not think that the current position 
                is good enough if we are to solve the problems of future governance.</P>

                part of the EU, does not?</P>
              <P><strong>Ben Wallace: </strong>As the member knows, Scotland is part of 
                the UK, which has a right to be in the convention. If Richard 
                Lochhead is saying that every sub-nation state should have a position 
                on the convention, there would be hundreds of positions. Let us 
                ensure that whatever we engage in through the UK is subject to 
                proper consultation and open discussion.</P>
              <P>I said that the Scottish Executive and COSLA were up front in 
                that. There is a remarkable similarity between the positions of 
                COSLA and the Scottish Executive, and Richard Spring, the MP who 
                came up to give the Conservative position. I welcome that. It 
                is good news that we are working in sync on some issues.</P>
              <P>Europe has to put its money where its mouth is&#151;it must match 
                words with actions. What does further integration mean? What does 
                bringing Europe closer to the people mean? We cannot say that 
                we are bringing people closer to decision making if we are taking 
                powers away from member states or extending the qualified voting 
                majority. That does not add up. If one believes in bringing decisions 
                closer to the people of Europe, one should devolve more decisions 
                downwards and have greater belief in a subsidiarity panel, to 
                ensure that decisions are made at the right level for the right 
                people.</P>
              <P>Europe must decide where it wants to go. People have a genuine 
                fear that more powers will go to the centre, leading to a state 
                of Europe. Some will say that it is a federal state of Europe. 
                If we decide to have a directly elected president&#151;one of 
                the options in the governance inquiry&#151;and a constitution, 
                we must recognise that those are elements of a federal system. 
                There is a debate to be had. It is possible to bring people closer 
                to decision making in Europe in a federal system. Conservatives 
                do not think that that is the right way to go. Nevertheless, if 
                we had a federal system like that of America, it would bring more 
                decisions closer to the people. However, that would be at the

                do not agree with the European charter of fundamental rights and 
                dissented on that matter in the report. I had serious questions 
                on direct access to the Court of Justice, as did the Scottish 
                Executive. However, we must make clear what we want in respect 
                of making decisions in Scotland and influencing Europe. We cannot 
                have it both ways. If there is no open system of consultation

              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </strong>There will

              <P><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab): </strong>Not many members 
                are in the chamber, although the debate is one of the most important 
                that the Parliament will have. This is the start of a process. 
                The debate is important to get into nitty-gritty issues that Irene 
                Oldfather and Ben Wallace mentioned.</P>
              <P>Changes in European governance affect every person in Scotland. 
                We face a major challenge in communicating those changes and engaging 
                the citizens of Scotland in dialogue about them. If we are to 
                be successful in that debate, we must get back to first principles 
                and think about why we are in Europe and what Europe should deliver.</P>
              <P>After the second world war, the aim was to bring economic stability 
                and peace to Europe. We should think about such fundamental issues 
                and the development of a social Europe, which the Labour party 
                has strongly supported. Latterly, Europe's aim has been to take 
                collective action on global environmental problems. We are in 
                Europe because of such reasons.</P>
              <P>Enlargement will bring more nations into the European structures. 
                It will require different ways of working and a model of interdependence 
                between different states, with different powers at different levels. 
                The real challenge is not to create a superstate, as Ben Wallace 
                suggested, but to create a set of institutions with democratic 
                and transparent decision-making processes that people feel have 
                legitimacy.</P>
              <P>The European Committee report is excellent. It gives marker points 
                that we need to argue for with the Executive, within the UK and 
                with many other voices throughout Europe that are arguing for 
                exactly the same things.</P>
              <P>Scotland has the best of both worlds. We are part of the UK, 
                which is a key and powerful member state. With a Labour Government, 
                the UK has built up more respect in Europe. The Government does

              <P>There is also a challenge for MSPs, if we are to do our jobs

                CalMac tendering process, on getting the go-ahead for the Rosyth 
                ferry with the freight facilities grant and on many fishing industry 
                issues that have arisen in the past couple of years. Where we 
                work together constructively and argue our case, we are successful. 
                There should be co-operation.</P>

                take an intervention later, but I want to proceed.</P>
              <P>A key issue that the committee raised is the need to improve 
                the Parliament's scrutiny of the Executive's work. I welcome Jim 
                Wallace's constructive response on that. We cannot easily tackle 
                the issue. If we are to get the right result in the UK and in 
                Scotland, the Government must have some ability to engage in negotiations 
                and dialogue without everything being open to discussion.</P>
              <P>There are challenges running up to each Council meeting. Council 
                meetings do not just drop from the sky&#151;they are the result 
                of years of discussion between member states and at the sub-member 
                level. There are real opportunities for us, but we require to 
                prioritise if we want to be effective. That also means making 
                demands on the Commission. I agree strongly with Jim Wallace's 
                and Irene Oldfather's comments on the importance of Europe engaging 
                in pre-legislative discussion, as we have done in the Parliament. 
                That can gear up Europe's citizens, businesses and stakeholder 
                organisations to play a constructive part in the process.</P>
              <P>We need to monitor what is happening in Europe and engage in 
                dialogue at an early stage, so that we can prepare for opportunities 
                that arise. For example, the proposed directive on waste electrical 
                and electronic equipment is not the most exciting directive, but 
                cleaning up Europe by dealing with electronic waste effectively 
                is a major challenge. The challenge is to prepare and act now 
                rather than wait until the directive reaches us. The Executive 
                should take a lead and Scottish businesses should see opportunities.

              <P>Devolution reflects a huge step forward from the old nation states 
                of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century. It reflects the interdependence

                states, constitutional regions and sub-national and regional alliances

                morning.</P>
              <P>The challenge for Scotland is to build alliances with like-minded 
                nations and regions and to add our voice to the process in Europe 
                for democratic, transparent and more accessible institutions. 
                The European Committee's report gives us a good starting point 
                for that debate.</P>

              <P><strong>Colin Campbell (West of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I welcome the 
                report and thank the European Committee clerk and his team for 
                the prodigious effort that they put into it.</P>
              <P>I want to consider blockages in the information flow between 
                people and institutions of the European Union. I shall address 
                blockages that impinge on MSPs because, if we cannot get things 
                right, there is little chance of informing the population properly.</P>
              <P>In the joint submission to the EU by the Scottish Executive and 
                COSLA, the Executive said:</P>
              <P>&quot;We propose that the legislative process (from Commission 
                to European Parliament and Council) should be more transparent 
                to enable interested bodies to know how the draft legislation 
                is being modified.&quot;</P>
              <P>That recognises the obstacles that are faced by every agency 
                that is trying to penetrate the inner workings of the Commission 
                or the Council of Ministers. As long as there is unjustifiable 
                secrecy, there will always be a suspicion in the public mind that 
                politicians may be selling out the best interests of their domestic 
                electorates. If such secrecy is widespread in Europe, it severely 
                damages the EU and erodes the principles for which it stands.</P>

                was asked which elected representatives had briefed the UK delegation 
                on health prior to the EU health council in Brussels in November 
                2001. His reply was that the discussions are confidential. Last 
                year, Jack McConnell gave the same response to a question about 
                who had been involved in preparatory talks for the November 2000 
                IGC.</P>
              <P>I do not know why there is such reluctance to part with even 
                the bare bones of information about talks between Scotland and 
                the UK, such as topics or names of the elected representatives. 
                Is there an administrative blockage, a psychological blockage, 
                or is it just that some people are stuck with the status quo? 
                If devolution is a process and not a destination, the blockage 
                must be cleared. To give no information at all can give the impression 
                that no discussions took place. I know that that is not the case, 
                but giving no information leaves the feeling that perhaps we were 
                not as well represented as we might have been.</P>
              <P>There are some healthy signs of change. When asked recently who 
                had led UK delegations at the Council of Ministers, the Deputy 
                First Minister provided three names. A question asking which Scottish 
                Executive people had been present at Council of Ministers meetings 
                produced the names and a list of 26 meetings at which they spoke 
                when appropriate. I do not like the subordinate feel to that phrase, 
                but they spoke when appropriate. Those responses hint at a more 
                transparent way ahead. I welcome that.</P>
              <P>The Scottish Executive response to the European Committee's report 
                states:</P>
              <P>&quot;we believe arrangements can be developed which, while respecting 
                the provisions of confidentiality, will provide the Committee 
                with a greater opportunity to contribute to the Executive's discussions 
                with the UK Government on EU matters.&quot;</P>
              <P>The SNP welcomes that concurrence with the European Committee's 
                report, and will do all that it can to promote transparency and 
                positive dialogue. Given that the Deputy First Minister is prepared 
                to announce publicly in the chamber the date and outline of meetings 
                of joint ministerial committees, as part of that move to transparency, 
                perhaps he will instruct his officials to provide the same information 
                in advance of JMC meetings directly to the European Committee.</P>
              <P>I am sure that unionist colleagues can logically understand&#151;if 
                they apply their logic to it, although their emotional attachment 
                to the United Kingdom will prevent them from admitting it&#151;that 
                the removal of the United Kingdom tier, and the provision of direct 
                Scottish representation in the European Community as a normal 
                nation, would improve Scotland's negotiating position, and access 
                to and information from the European Union.</P>

                European Committee's report on EU governance, which is a substantial 
                and worthwhile contribution to the debate from a Scottish perspective.</P>
              <P>Enlargement of the European Union is something for which we have 
                long argued, as part of our Conservative vision of a wider and 
                more flexible union of nation states. However, there is no doubt 
                that enlargement has implications for the European Union's decision-making 
                structures. The Scottish Conservatives want to make a positive 
                and constructive contribution to the debate. That is one reason 
                why we are hosting the conference of the European People's Party-European 
                Democrats group in the European Parliament in Edinburgh in June.</P>
              <P>Our constructive approach does not mean a blind or uncritical 
                acceptance of policies that are not in this country's interest; 
                that is why we oppose membership of the single currency. It is 
                worth remembering that Sweden has remained outside the euro zone, 
                and that the Danes rejected the euro in a referendum. Does anyone 
                suggest that they are anti-Europe? It is, of course, a perfectly 
                sane and rational position to be pro-Europe but anti-euro. Only 
                crazy Secretaries of State for Scotland who need lessons in logic 
                more than they need lessons in French fail to understand that 
                or wilfully choose to misrepresent it.</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: </strong>On the subject of being perfectly rational, 
                is it rational to be opposed to the euro in principle, even if 
                joining the euro is in this country's interests?</P>
              <P><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>It is inconceivable that joining the 
                euro could be in this country's interests, because it has enormous 
                constitutional significance&#151;which relates to the debate about 
                governance&#151;as well as economic significance. One can converge 
                economic and monetary policies without abandoning one's currency, 
                as is the case with many other adjoining nation states in the 
                world. One does not need to surrender all of one's sovereignty 
                or power to a central bank to correlate economic policies between 
                one member state and another. For example, the United States, 
                Canada and Mexico, where such policies are closely co-ordinated, 
                represent a far larger market than the European Union.</P>
              <P>Equally, we do not believe that the present drift towards a more 
                integrated and centralised European Union is in this country's 
                interests. That is why we voted against the Treaty of Nice, along 
                with our footballing friends in the Republic of Ireland. Such 
                a drift is not sensible in an enlarged European Union, because

              <P><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>That is a good question, but the situations 
                are not comparable. I am in favour of Scotland being part of the 
                United Kingdom. The arguments against the Scottish Parliament 
                were well known and well rehearsed. The miserable performance 
                of the Scottish Executive in the Scottish Parliament during the 
                past three years has diminished confidence in this institution 
                rather than improved it. The miserable performance of the SNP 
                has not encouraged anybody either.</P>
              <P>At the heart of this debate about the future of the European 
                Union is the question of democracy and accountability, which is 
                encapsulated in the arguments over the extension of qualified 
                majority voting. Our position is that there should be no further 
                extension of QMV on European legislation, as it transfers too 
                much power from the electorates in member countries and their 
                national Parliaments to European Union institutions. QMV will 
                undermine, not enhance, democratic accountability. Unanimity means 
                that no decision can be taken that is, in effect, against the 
                wishes of a national parliament.</P>
              <P>When the power to make laws is moved to Brussels, it is not only 
                centralised but moved from open discussion and debate in Parliaments 
                to debate behind closed doors, where no one can follow the deliberations 
                and the votes. In that respect, I welcome the recommendation in 
                paragraph 223 of the European Committee's report that meetings 
                of the Council of Ministers, when they are performing a legislative 
                function, should take place in public. That would be a substantial 
                improvement on the present position. I endorse that recommendation.</P>
              <P>The threat that the integrationist mentality poses to democracy 
                has been illustrated vividly by the treatment of the Republic 
                of Ireland since it had the temerity to reject the Treaty of Nice 
                in a referendum. The European Union seems intent on treating that 
                vote as if it never took place and pressing on regardless, ignoring 
                the inconvenient fact that the Irish people do not think that 
                the treaty is in their national interest, and that legally the 
                treaty must be ratified by all 15 member states. That does not 
                bode well for democracy in Europe and should serve as a warning 
                to all those who naively believe that an independent Scotland 
                in the European Union would be in a stronger position than Scotland 
                currently enjoys as part of the United Kingdom.</P>

              <P>The Conservative approach is based on extending the democratic 
                control of peoples in the member states over legislation coming 
                out of Brussels. In short, that means putting into practice the 
                principle of subsidiarity. Decisions should be taken at the most 
                appropriate level. In many cases, that will mean devolving decisions 
                to national Governments, which can then decide whether they need 
                to be decentralised further to institutions within member states.</P>
              <P>Our political opponents largely want to see Scotland submerged 
                in a more closely integrated and centralised political and economic 
                union, either within the United Kingdom or on our own, but they 
                know that that is unpopular so they are engaged in a campaign 
                of federalism by stealth. Our opponents talk repeatedly about 
                incrementals and the next step; we talk about fundamental issues. 
                It is time for all parties in this debate to put their cards on 
                the table and talk about the endgame to which they aspire, not 
                just the next trick.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I thank the 
                European Committee clerks, the Scottish Parliament information 
                centre and the advisers to the committee for producing the report, 
                which is a useful first step in our debate about developing democracy. 
                I welcome the debate on the basis that today sees the first meeting 
                of the convention that will discuss the future constitution of 
                the European Union; it is a timely piece of history.</P>
              <P>Unfortunately, we are a number of years behind the real debate 
                in Europe that informs the IGC. The real debate in Europe is about 
                whether we want a Europe that is an economic market or a Europe 
                of political structures that suit the peoples of Europe and not 
                the states. In Scotland, with the existence of this Parliament, 
                we are living in a radically new political world. Wales and Northern 
                Ireland have Assemblies. The nature of the United Kingdom has 
                changed, and the United Kingdom, unionist parties and unionist 
                voters must think seriously about their input to democracy through 
                the sieve or censorship of Westminster and the UK Government.</P>
              <P>A new world order is developing in Europe, but we are trapped 
                in old order ideas of nation states, grasping at and holding desperately 
                on to their power, competing and arguing with one another in the 
                Council of Ministers. That is not the natural way to deal with 
                democratic development.</P>
              <P>After several years' debate about access to democracy in the 
                European Union, Catalunya has established its own convention.

              <P>I call states-in-waiting or stateless nations, desire to put 
                pressure on Brussels, not their own central Governments, to make 
                Brussels recognise that subsidiarity must be applied. If powers 
                have been granted to regions or nations, Brussels must recognise 
                them. I firmly believe that that is how we should progress the 
                debate. Our argument is not with a United Kingdom Government of 
                any colour, but with the Commission and the European Parliament, 
                which have failed to recognise their principle of subsidiarity.</P>
              <P>The debate is merely a beginning. We must get away from the idea 
                that giving away anything in the debate on the convention and 
                on the future of democracy in Europe limits and demeans the nation 
                state. The extension of democracy demeans no state and diminishes 
                no power. It empowers the people&#151;that is the basic principle 
                of democracy.</P>
              <P>In the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century and through the IGC, we have an 
                opportunity to build the Europe that we want. The SNP supports 
                the concept of a Europe of the peoples. Everyone in the unionist 
                parties supports the concept of a Europe of the nation states. 
                I say that that is an abdication of responsibility, but I believe 
                that unionism is an abdication of responsibility for any Scot, 
                Welshman or Irishman. We must take responsibility for ourselves, 
                and, more important, for future generations.</P>
              <P>Between now and 2004, the creation of a constitution will be 
                discussed. That could affect our children and our children's children. 
                I do not understand the desperate worry about giving up power. 
                This country has entered into economic, military and political 
                alliances throughout the past 1,000 years, and some of them have 
                endured considerably longer than the union. We hope that the European 
                Union will endure considerably longer than the UK union will.</P>
              <P>We must take that long-term vision. What do we want Europe to 
                be? Do we want it to be purely an open and free market, as many 
                neo-liberalists in the Liberal party and the Labour party and

              <P><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>This morning's debate has reflected the 
                fact that we have moved on in the past couple of decades. Lloyd 
                Quinan seems to be talking about people from the Labour party 
                of 20 years ago. We recognise that the classic nation state of 
                the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century has moved on. Europe is more complex. 
                It has a mixture of nation states and cross-regional alliances. 
                It would help if Lloyd Quinan debated the present position, rather 
                than the past.</P>

              <P>unsure what point Sarah Boyack was trying to make. I do not accept 
                that the nation state is purely a 19<SUP>th</SUP> century concept. 
                That is a concept of British political historians and political

                in mainland Europe hold.</P>
              <P>The importance of the debate is exemplified by what is happening 
                in Spain between the Basque autonomous community and the Spanish 
                Government. Because it lacks involvement in the convention, the 
                Basque Government is retaining the taxation that it collects on 
                behalf of the Spanish Government. It will refuse to hand that 
                over until it has assurances about the democratic structures for 
                which Spain will argue. We should be in the same position. We 
                must recognise the importance of the debate in every country, 
                and, most important, for every citizen.</P>
              <P>11:44</P>
              <P><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>I congratulate 
                the European Committee on compiling the report, which took six 
                months' hard work. The report has much content and is worth reading, 
                but I suspect that few people will read it with the attention 
                that it deserves.</P>
              <P>As Irene Oldfather said, the report is intended to stimulate 
                further discussion. I take that on board, so I will find it slightly 
                difficult to support Irene Oldfather's motion, which asks us to 
                support all the report's recommendations. Many of the recommendations 
                are good, but I disagree with many conclusions, which gives me 
                difficulty. However, I suspect that I will support the motion 
                later, as I recognise Irene Oldfather's good intentions.</P>
              <P>I cannot deal in five minutes with six months' work on the report, 
                but I will pick up on one or two recommendations. I am concerned 
                about a recommendation by the committee's adviser, who seems to 
                think that the Executive is undermanned on European affairs. She 
                proposed considerable expansion of Scottish Executive officialdom's 
                involvement in European issues. That would be a mistake and the 
                recommendation is regrettable. As Sarah Boyack suggested, officials 
                here and in Whitehall must work together on the key issues that 
                will benefit the United Kingdom as a whole, Scottish citizens 
                and citizens of the UK's other home countries.</P>
              <P>The recommendation in paragraph 208 on simplification and rationalisation 
                of European regulation and rulings should lie at the heart of 
                the run-up to the IGC. We all face that problem. When we examine 
                simplification, we must consider the way in which the United Kingdom

              <P>regulation. Perhaps too often, I blame Europe for all our ailments, 
                but the UK often faces problems because of the way in which European 
                law has been implemented here. I believe that officials are sometimes 
                over-enthusiastic about dotting the i's and crossing the t's. 
                We must examine that.</P>
              <P>The report recommends</P>
              <P>&quot;that serious consideration is made to the creation of 'partners 
                of the Union status' for bodies such as the Scottish Parliament&quot;.</P>
              <P>That goes over the top. Our partnership is with the UK Government. 
                For the United Kingdom and people in Scotland, strength in Europe 
                comes from a united voice in Europe.</P>
              <P><strong>Irene Oldfather: </strong>Does the member recognise that in some 
                of the recommendations, including that which he quoted, the committee 
                is talking about access to the European Commission? Having that 
                access at a pre-legislative stage would give us the influence 
                that Phil Gallie said that he wanted, to provide better legislation 
                that connects with people.</P>
              <P><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>I accept that. Irene Oldfather emphasised 
                my initial point that the report is intended to stimulate debate 
                and get minds moving. Such clarification is helpful. It is needed 
                not only on paragraph 209, but on a raft of issues that the report 
                raises.</P>
              <P>The report has been produced in the run-up to the IGC. I am concerned 
                about the reason for the establishment of the IGC. Other nations 
                have other ideas. Just last night, the French Europe minister 
                said that, with the introduction of a single currency and plans 
                for a European arrest warrant, a common army and a unified legal 
                system,</P>
              <P>&quot;we are building something which is profoundly federal or 
                a true union of states&quot;.</P>
              <P>If the IGC goes down that line, it will be distanced from the 
                devolved ideas that all in the Parliament are supposed to embrace.</P>
              <P>We believe that people in the United Kingdom should be able to 
                establish their own opinions and that we should be able to deal 
                with the issues for our citizens in the way that we feel is most 
                appropriate, but others in the IGC may have another agenda. That 
                was underlined by Ben Wallace's comment that it is all-important 
                for the UK Government to publish a white paper that states clearly 
                the UK approach to the IGC. To do so would mean that no one in 
                this country would have any doubts about the objectives that we 
                seek.</P>

              <P>in The Hague and met a generation of lawyers of my age who were 
                passionately in favour of creating the European institutions.</P>
              <P>In 24 years in Europe, my stance has not changed. I remember 
                well that I met Irene Oldfather on many occasions in Europe. I 
                am aware that the passion that I feel for Europe is shared throughout 
                the chamber and that it crosses the party divide. I say that quite 
                genuinely.</P>
              <P>In my time, I found it odd that the Labour party was split on 
                Europe before it became very pro-Europe, unlike the Tory party, 
                which was very pro-Europe before it changed its stance. It is 
                odd to have been in Europe for so long and to have seen so much 
                change. I saw Parliaments gaining powers, but Parliaments always 
                want more powers. That is also true of Europe&#151;indeed, the 
                European Parliament does not have enough powers.</P>
              <P>I have questions for the minister who is to sum up for the Executive. 
                In the run-up to the IGC, will the Executive press for better 
                access to political units within member states? Will it press 
                for the point that Irene Oldfather made in her opening speech 
                about simplification of the treaties, which is vital? Will it 
                press for the Council of Ministers meetings to be held in public 
                when the council meets in a legislative capacity? Many people 
                become disenchanted with Europe because such meetings are not 
                held in public. Will the Executive press for the Scottish Parliament 
                to have direct access to the European Court of Justice? We are 
                not far from that position, but if local authorities have access 
                to the court and the Scottish Parliament does not, surely that 
                deficit should be corrected.</P>
              <P>The European umbrella affects 80 per cent of our devolved powers, 
                so it is vital that we have more access to Europe. I am pleased 
                that the report admits that there is a lack of access and seeks 
                ways to improve it. To that extent, I am happy to support the 
                report.</P>
              <P>As everyone knows, I want Scotland to be a normal country&#151;one 
                that sits at the top table. It is ironic that all the unionist 
                parties in the chamber accept the right of Malta to be at the 
                top table and the right of Luxembourg, which has not a single 
                bit of coastline, to make decisions about fishing. The unionist 
                parties believe sincerely that we are better off with the UK Government 
                negotiating on our behalf.</P>
              <P>I have so many examples of the UK not doing a good job for Scotland

                When the Chunnel was built, the UK Government did not ask for 
                any money for Scotland&#151;or for the north of England. That 
                shows how good a job the UK Government did in representing Scotland.</P>
              <P>Not long before the Scottish Parliament was established, the 
                legal affairs committee of the EU visited Edinburgh. Henry McLeish, 
                the former First Minister, gave an assurance to the committee, 
                which was composed of some of the most distinguished professors 
                of law from across Europe. He said that, when Scottish interests 
                dominated&#151;fishing comes to mind&#151;a Scottish minister 
                would automatically undertake the negotiations. Sadly, that assurance 
                has not been honoured. It seemed a good idea and, at the time, 
                I believed him.</P>
              <P>Irene Oldfather mentioned the need for early scrutiny. If we 
                consider the absurdity of applying the working time directive 
                to fishermen in fairly small crews, we can see that Scotland should 
                have been in on those negotiations at an earlier stage. Instead, 
                we are presented with the opportunity to scrutinise only when 
                such directives are almost written in tablets of stone. That is 
                a pity, but with the attitude that is expressed in the report, 
                we could change that situation.</P>
              <P>I find it sad that the unionist parties are happy that Scotland 
                has eight MEPs when Denmark has 16 and Ireland has 15. Scotland 
                has four members on the Committee of the Regions whereas Denmark 
                has nine. The Committee of the Regions is an underestimated body. 
                I did not believe that it would come so quickly into force. If 
                members look at Scotland's representation on the committee, one 
                could say that we need nine members to represent all the regions 
                of Scotland including Shetland, the Borders, the Western Isles 
                and the kingdom of Fife. It is sad that, when we could use nine 
                seats, we are told that we have to be happy with four.</P>
              <P>It is even sadder to see that the unionist parties are content 
                with that sub-status. That is the saddest thing about the Scottish 
                Parliament and many people outwith the Parliament agree about 
                that. I remember well my personal friendship with Jo Grimmond 
                and Johnnie Bannerman, who must be turning in their graves. They 
                wanted the powers of Canada in a federal UK, but the Liberals 
                are presently low in ambition.</P>
              <P>It is often said that Scotland would have to apply for membership 
                of the EU. The official new view of Lord Mackenzie-Stuart and 
                of Dr Noe, the leader of the European Commission, is that that 
                is not so. Under international law, when a state divides into 
                two bits&#151;Norway and Sweden are an example&#151;the treaties 
                that covered the original state automatically cover the bits. 
                That has been proved </P>

              <P><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP): </strong>I, too, 
                support the report that is before us today. I will concentrate 
                on the Scottish Executive's written and oral response to the report 
                and, in particular, on the issues of direct access and transparency 
                and one or two of the report's recommendations.</P>
              <P>Before I do that, I want to reflect on the fact that even the 
                Scottish Executive's introduction to its written response gives 
                the game away on its position. Five key driving principles are 
                given for the Scottish Executive strategy. Members will be delighted 
                to hear that the Executive is pro-European&#151;that is probably 
                a reasonable start&#151;and that it is pro-debate, which, given 
                that we are having a European Committee debate on Europe, is good.</P>
              <P>The language in the section of the driving key principles that 
                explains why the Executive is pro-UK is interesting. Apparently, 
                it is pro-UK not least because</P>
              <P>&quot;that allows decisions to be made in the right place.&quot;</P>
              <P>There is no explanation, simply an assertion that that is the 
                case. That shows that the Executive takes more interest in&#151;indeed, 
                is obsessed with&#151;where a decision is made than in whether 
                the decision is right for Scotland. That would seem to be more 
                of a justification for Westminster than a justification of a rationale 
                on European thinking.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Hamilton: </strong>Mr Fitzpatrick may say that from a sedentary 
                position, but lack of access is not an SNP gripe. I assume that 
                Jim Wallace will speak again in the debate&#151;if not, I am happy

              <P>&quot;ignoring Scotland's needs in the EU council of farm ministers.&quot;</P>
              <P>Mr Lyon also said that, if Scotland followed Ms Beckett's policy, 
                we were heading for &quot;disaster&quot;. That interesting article,

              <P>&quot;Mr Lyon's outspoken comments are understood to have been 
                cleared with the party leadership.&quot;</P>
              <P>That is an interesting point for Mr Wallace to clarify. Did Mr 
                Lyon clear that statement and, if he was criticising Ms Beckett 
                and her attitude on behalf of Scotland's farmers, where does that 
                leave Mr Wallace's attitude to the SNP? How can he say that we 
                are griping?</P>
              <P>Mr Lyon also said:</P>
              <P>&quot;I know from my contacts in Brussels that Ms Beckett was 
                posted missing from the Scottish interest in this. She simply 
                did not support the Scottish position.&quot;</P>
              <P>As I said, those comments, condemning Margaret Beckett and the 
                absence of her support for Scotland, were cleared by the Liberal 
                Democrat party leadership. The SNP did not make them.</P>
              <P>I make no apologies for quoting again from Jim Walker of the 
                NFUS, who believes that the lack of direct access is a systemic 
                problem and who said that it was</P>
              <P>&quot;a fundamental weakness in the political set-up of this 
                country&quot;.</P>
              <P>He did not think that it was a question of the failure of Ross 
                Finnie&#151;another Liberal Democrat&#151;but instead said:</P>
              <P>&quot;I do not believe that any rural development minister will 
                be able to fulfil the functions that we believed they were to 
                take on when agriculture was devolved to the Scottish Parliament&quot;&#151;[<em>Official 
                Report, Rural Development Committee</em>, 18 September 2001; c 
                2147.]</P>
              <P>In other words, the lack of direct access is impinging on the 
                ability of a devolved Administration even to do its job properly, 
                never mind to move on to debate the next stage in the process. 
                Two Liberal Democrat members have been undermined by the minister's 
                comments this morning. The absence of representation and the derisory 
                turnouts at Council of Ministers meetings&#151;Scottish ministers 
                have attended one in eight&#151;are not SNP gripes. We are simply 
                identifying a systemic Scottish problem, which must be addressed.</P>
              <P>It is argued that we do not need to attend Council of Ministers 
                meetings because we are part of the process. I even heard former 
                minister Sarah Boyack sort of sneer that we do not even need to 
                be part of the working party groups for the same reason. However, 
                the problem is that we do not know that we are part of the process.

              <P>was right to highlight the secrecy that surrounds much of this 
                issue. We do not know what policies will be discussed at the Council 
                of Ministers meetings. We do not know the information that comes 
                from the UK to Scotland&#151;that is secret. We do not even know 
                the details of the discussions about who will be allowed to attend. 
                It is ludicrous that we do not know who can go or&#151;more to 
                the point&#151;why people cannot go. If we want to examine transparency, 
                we should start by examining our own attitude within the current 
                set-up before we look at the future.</P>
              <P>I will end with one specific point about the recommendation in 
                paragraph 243, which concerns the automatic right to attend meetings. 
                The committee recommended that the concordats be revisited. However, 
                the Executive rejected that and said that it is</P>
              <P>&quot;entirely satisfied with how the Concordats have operated&quot;.</P>
              <P>The Executive does not want to attend EU meetings, even though 
                we have the right to do so under article 203 of the EC treaty. 
                The rationale behind that decision is interesting, because it 
                is ridiculous. Apparently, we cannot attend Council meetings or 
                change the concordats, because the concordats are, by their nature, 
                &quot;non-binding&quot;. That argument is ludicrous. If the concordats 
                are &quot;non-binding&quot;, that holds true for everything in 
                them, not just the bits that we do not fancy.</P>
              <P>The Executive's second reason for rejecting the recommendation 
                in paragraph 243 is that such a right could not be granted to 
                all devolved Administrations because of &quot;practical considerations&quot;. 
                Are we to assume that there are not enough chairs or that the 
                table is not big enough? What on earth does &quot;practical considerations&quot; 
                mean? If it matters that Scotland is represented in Europe, surely 
                we can do better than that. Frankly, that is not a sustainable 
                answer to the question of why we cannot redraw the concordats.</P>
              <P>The Executive should trust itself. It is in the unique position 
                of having an Opposition that wants to give it more power and more 
                of a say, but it seems far too timid, or too modest, to accept 
                that responsibility on Scotland's behalf.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>We now move to wind-up speeches.

                Hugh Henry, the new convener, Irene Oldfather, and the committee 
                members and staff for putting so much work into the report.</P>
              <P>The report offers a valid and serious contribution to the key 
                issues surrounding the debate. Many points have been raised this 
                morning; however, despite Duncan Hamilton's energetic speech, 
                I was disappointed to hear nothing new or different from the SNP. 
                Furthermore, apart from Sarah Boyack's thoughtful speech, I find 
                it worthy of note that many Labour members have kept their light 
                under a bushel instead of&#151;as Ben Wallace pointed out&#151;shedding 
                some light on the Labour and UK Government position on many of 
                the issues. Perhaps they do not want to have a fixed position 
                because their position will need to change according to public 
                opinion. No one can criticise the Conservatives for not clearly 
                setting out our views on the matter.</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: </strong>Will Mr Mundell set out the Conservative 
                position on the euro?</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>I did not agree to take that intervention, 
                but I will respond to it. If Mr Fitzpatrick had been listening, 
                he would have heard Mr Ben Wallace, Mr McLetchie and Mr Gallie 
                clearly express our views on a number of issues.</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick</strong> <em>rose&#151;</em></P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>I must press on.</P>
              <P>As Irene Oldfather said in her opening speech, we have not gripped 
                the imagination of people in Scotland and the UK on European issues 
                or secured the public debate that is needed. We must all address 
                that situation. One of the most interesting recent statistics 
                shows that 14 per cent of people in the UK thought that America 
                was a member of the EU. Moreover, when people who claimed to have 
                a clear understanding of the EU were pressed on their knowledge, 
                it was discovered that they did not understand how the various 
                mechanisms worked.</P>
              <P>We can agree with the SNP on one point, however. In his evidence 
                to the European Committee, Professor Neil MacCormick called for 
                simplification of the treaties. That call is valid and we support 
                the report's emphasis on transparency and accessibility. Indeed, 
                we support the report's recommendations, because they underpin 
                the Conservative view of a flexible and dynamic EU.</P>

                not that seem very distant? In 1957, the Treaty of Rome created 
                the European Economic Community, which had six members. The first 
                enlargement happened in 1973&#151;when the UK, Denmark and Ireland

                Maastricht in 1993, when the EEC became the EC. Another major 
                shift came in 1997 with the Treaty of Amsterdam, which saw the 
                strengthening of the European Parliament's role. With ten central 
                and eastern European countries preparing for membership and with 
                pressure from sub-member state legislatures for more influence 
                in policy making and the decision-making process, 2004 will see 
                another major change in Europe's shape and modus operandi.</P>
              <P><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>With respect to 1957 and historical events 
                thereafter, does the member agree that the common agricultural 
                policy has been a millstone around Europe's neck? Given the imminent 
                entry of many eastern European countries to the EU, would not 
                the IGC be far better to direct its attention to that issue?</P>
              <P><strong>Nora Radcliffe: </strong>The answer is yes and no. Although we 
                must tackle that issue, the right mechanisms must be in place 
                to enable us to do so. Both aspects are equally important.</P>
              <P>If we want the Europe that emerges from the IGC to be to our 
                liking, now is the time to think hard about what we want and to 
                ensure that our voice is heard. That voice will be immeasurably 
                stronger if we can show that it is genuinely the voice of the 
                people and that we have managed to engage our people in the debate 
                about the future shape of Europe and how it works. The report 
                is a good start in that process&#151;many people have put much 
                work and thought into it. However, unless it is but a strand in 
                a much wider and more extensive debate we&#151;as the Scottish 
                Parliament&#151;will have failed the Scottish people.</P>
              <P>Sadly, UK Governments have in many ways in the past failed the 
                people they represent in matters European. That has happened not 
                only because they did not do enough to involve themselves in the 
                decision-making process in Europe, but because of the way in which

              <P>have failed in Britain. They have failed to inform the British 
                people about what was happening in Europe, they have failed to 
                implement European legislation effectively&#151;the recent fridge 
                debacle is a case in point&#151;and they have used Europe, often 
                quite unfairly, as a convenient scapegoat and whipping-boy.</P>
              <P>The blame should not rest solely on Governments, however. The 
                media have not exactly been positive about Europe and have colluded 
                in the scapegoating that I mentioned. Even in these more pro-European 
                times, it is extremely disappointing that not one of our national 
                papers has a correspondent in Brussels, when what happens there 
                has such an impact on our lives. It is notable that today there 
                is no mention in <em>The Herald</em> of the first meeting of such 
                an important convention&#151;its European pages were all about 
                Euro 2008. That is fine in its place, but other more important 
                things are happening.</P>
              <P>If we are talking about blame, we must all, with a few honourable 
                exceptions, admit to a share. How many of us have, as citizens 
                of Europe, taken a close interest in what the Commission, the 
                Council of Ministers, the Council of Europe, the Committee of 
                the Regions and the European Parliament are doing? It is a waste 
                of time and energy to dwell on or to apportion blame. It is more 
                productive to accept that perhaps all our efforts to engage in 
                Europe in the past have not been as effective as they could and 
                should have been, and to bend our minds to how we engage ourselves 
                and encourage others in shaping the Europe of the future.</P>
              <P>The European institutions acknowledge that they have allowed 
                themselves to become too remote from citizens. There is an honest 
                desire among them to reconnect and to communicate better. The 
                Scottish Parliament might be the youngest in the Union, but we 
                can take pride in offering as a model the way in which we came 
                into being and the way in which we try to operate in a real and 
                inclusive partnership with our people.</P>
              <P>The European Union allows us to work co-operatively with our 
                nearest neighbours to our benefit, and to foster peace, prosperity, 
                equity and environmental responsibility within and outwith our 
                boundaries. I commend to the chamber the report and, more important, 
                the wider campaign to involve the Scottish people in the development 
                and success of the European Union of the future.</P>

            <TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
              <P>We commend the European Committee for the thoroughness of its 
                report, for the relevance of its recommendations and for providing 
                the opportunity for the debate. The committee must be heartened 
                by the widespread support here and in Europe for its findings. 
                One of the most important issues now and in future is representation 
                of Scotland in Europe. Members know that the SNP's view is that 
                we suffer the worst of both worlds, because Scotland neither has 
                independent representation, nor does it enjoy the benefits of 
                sub-national government.</P>
              <P>In respect of the EU Council of Ministers, for example, it is 
                totally unacceptable that Scotland has no automatic right to be 
                represented in UK delegations, even when devolved matters are 
                being discussed and decided upon. I welcome the European Committee's 
                acknowledgement of that deficit but, like others, I am disappointed 
                by the Executive's response, which confirms its satisfaction with 
                current concordats.</P>
              <P>Governance&#151;the topic of the report&#151;is about the way 
                in which the EU makes and implements decisions. It is increasingly 
                recognised that good governance is about bringing decision making 
                closer to citizens. A recurring theme in the debate&#151;rightly 
                so&#151;has been the need to close the gap between European institutions 
                and European citizens and to make the work of the EU more relevant, 
                more comprehensible and more accessible to people.</P>
              <P>The Committee of the Regions is the official voice of local and 
                sub-national government in Europe. It was set up in 1994 and began 
                its third mandate in February this year, which is when I became 
                a member. It has a vital role as the protector of the principle 
                of subsidiarity&#151;another recurring theme in the report and 
                the debate. I want to restate our position: it is entirely appropriate 
                for Councillor Ken Bodfish, the leader of Brighton and Hove City 
                Council, and others like him to be on that committee, but that 
                is entirely inappropriate for MSPs. The removal of local government 
                members runs counter to the legitimacy of the Committee of the 
                Regions as the defender of local democracy. Despite our objections 
                to that, I intend to advocate the cause of Scotland. Indeed, I 
                was led to believe that putting Scotland's interests first was 
                an aim that is shared by all members of the Scottish delegation. 
                It would be very satisfying to have a &quot;team Scotland&quot; 
                approach, but from my limited experience, we seem just to be fighting 
                the same battles along the same party lines but in a European 
                context.</P>
              <P>My first introduction to the Committee of the Regions was a welcome 
                letter from the leader of the UK delegation. It contained the

              <P>&quot;I know that the contribution of Labour colleagues was of 
                particular importance in ensuring that UK interests were well

              <P><strong>Irene Oldfather: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P>
              <P><strong>Irene McGugan: </strong>In a moment.</P>
              <P>That was followed three days later by a second letter, drawing 
                attention to the &quot;deliberate&quot; mistake:</P>
              <P>&quot;I mentioned the contribution of Labour colleagues, but 
                of course this was a typo and should have read all colleagues.&quot;</P>
              <P>Indeed it should.</P>
              <P>I have a word of advice for Nicol Stephen, a fellow member of 
                the Committee of the Regions, who was unable to attend the first 
                meeting of the UK delegation. Richard Lochhead might want to note 
                that that is another meeting that Scottish ministers did not attend. 
                Nicol Stephen gave his proxy vote to a Labour councillor. The 
                first issue under discussion was a motion&#151;proposed by a prominent 
                English Liberal Democrat&#151;that we cease to elect our office 
                bearers under the old first-past-the-post system and bring ourselves 
                into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century by utilising a form of proportional 
                representation. Although he had the support of the SNP, he lost 
                the vote. The deputy minister might like to know that his proxy 
                vote was cast against his own colleague and in opposition to one 
                of the main principles of his party.</P>
              <P>The convention on the future of Europe, which holds its inaugural 
                meeting today, provides an historic opportunity to review the 
                role and image of EU institutions that impact on the lives of 
                our people. It offers an opportunity to debate proposals that 
                will effectively modernise and democratise European Union institutions. 
                It is important that the people of Scotland are fully involved 
                in that process. We must promote such engagement. That was wholly 
                recognised by the committee, but only to a degree by the Executive, 
                which is a bit disappointing.</P>

              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services (Peter 
                Peacock): </strong>When we discussed the structural funds at a recent 
                debate, I made it clear that I am an unashamed Euro-enthusiast. 
                I share the passion for Europe that Winnie Ewing, Irene Oldfather 
                and others have described.</P>
              <P>The development of the European Union over the past 40 to 50 
                years is one of the achievements not only of the previous century 
                but of any century. Nation states across the globe have formed 
                alliances over time and have seen those alliances shift, but the 
                EU is one of the strongest alliances ever to have been created. 
                Irene Oldfather was right to talk not only about how far the Scottish 
                Parliament has come, but about how far Europe has come in the 
                past 40 years.</P>
              <P>I was always impressed in a previous job when I spoke to Winnie 
                Ewing and others on my visits to the European Parliament and, 
                when I was a member of the European Committee of the Regions for 
                a number of years, to enter that hemicycle in Brussels and see 
                up to 700 people discussing with each other matters that were 
                common throughout Europe. As a council leader at that time, I 
                dealt with matters with others who were doing similar jobs throughout 
                Europe. Only 40 or 50 years earlier those nations were lobbing 
                shells at each other and destroying Europe, but Europe now is 
                strong.</P>
              <P>As Sarah Boyack said, the European Union is fundamentally about 
                a peace and security that is built on prosperity and strong trading 
                links. The Executive strongly supports the process of enlargement. 
                It is right to continue to build a base of prosperity and unity 
                that will promote greater peace throughout Europe. However, the 
                EU faces a major set of challenges from the enlargement process. 
                It is clear that new or modified governance arrangements will 
                be required. As many speakers in today's debate made clear, those 
                new arrangements will need to be open, transparent and relevant&#151;and 
                seen to be relevant&#151;to people throughout the EU and will 
                need their consent.</P>
              <P>The new arrangements will need to respect the value and the place 
                of national Parliaments and recognise the diverse regions and 
                the sub-member states that exist throughout the EU. In that context, 
                Lloyd Quinan's analysis of the situation is fatally flawed. The 
                debate is not only about nation states and the people. That reflects 
                an overly simplistic view of where we are. Europe </P>

              <P><strong>Mr Quinan</strong> <em>rose&#151;</em></P>
              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Let me finish the point. A directly elected 
                European Parliament in addition to member states, which included 
                member states and sub-member states, is not desirable. New institutions 
                have been developed to reflect the regional diversity that exists 
                throughout Europe. We have institutions such as the Economic and 
                Social Committee&#151;ECOSOC&#151;which is part of that process, 
                and a range of social partners and civic societies around that. 
                The debate is about how one ensures that those intricate parts 
                of Europe operate in future for the better governance of Europe 
                and about recognising existing diversity.</P>
              <P>We also need, in that process, to ensure that subsidiarity is 
                recognised. Members have talked about that issue today. We must 
                protect subsidiarity. As well as the European Committee's views 
                on doing that, we have suggested a mechanism. We also recognise 
                the need for the long period of debate that we are now entering. 
                As Ben Wallace indicated, the Executive made its position clear 
                on that in its initial joint submission with COSLA and in its 
                response to the European Committee's good report on the range 
                of issues that emerged.</P>
              <P>We are pro-European, as I indicated, and we are pro-UK for the 
                reasons that other members indicated in today's debate. The Scottish 
                position is stronger by being part of the UK delegation&#151;and 
                having the strength of that nation state in all discussions&#151;than 
                it would be if it were apart from that. We are also pro-reform. 
                We think that there is a need for reform to make Europe more relevant 
                to people over time so that they respect the institutions and 
                make progress. We also support sub-member states' involvement 
                and want to see that expanded.</P>
              <P>We are also pro-debate. It is sad that, despite the fact that 
                many good points were made in today's debate, virtually none of 
                them came from the SNP. Its display really was sad and pathetic. 
                The SNP always focuses on whether there are seats at the table 
                of the current convention, but does not focus on what it would 
                say if it ever got to the top table. It was clear from today's 
                debate that the SNP has nothing to say. Its position is simply 
                about symbolism, not about substance. I am afraid that that reflected

              <P>Members of other parties made most of today's strong points. 
                They expressed the need to look seriously at the European debate, 
                to find ways forward in a complex situation and to address particularly 
                the points that Winnie Ewing made. She was the only SNP member 
                who made serious points about the European debate. She asked what 
                the Executive would do about better access to Europe for political 
                units within a state, about treaty simplification and about the 
                openness of council procedures while they were in their legislative 
                mode. I can confirm that we will press on all those matters, because 
                the Executive wants to see change in them. However, we have a 
                different view about access to the court system.</P>
              <P>As I indicated, the Executive wants this debate on Europe to 
                take place. We are anxious for people in Scotland to be allowed 
                to participate fully in the debate and we will help to facilitate 
                that over time. The European Committee's report is a first-rate 
                means of helping to stimulate that debate in Scotland and to take 
                these serious matters forward. I look forward to all parties in 
                the chamber taking a much more serious approach to the substance 
                of the debate in future.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab): </strong>This report 
                has been a major undertaking for the European Committee and, like 
                other members, I would like to thank the two conveners who have 
                been involved in the process: Hugh Henry, who started the work, 
                and Irene Oldfather, who completed the operation. I also thank 
                Stephen Imrie, the clerk, and his colleagues in the committee 
                office.</P>
              <P>The dictionary definition of governance is the exercise of authority. 
                However, the debate that is being conducted throughout the European 
                Union goes much further and is to do with clarifying the relationship 
                between citizens and those who make decisions on their behalf 
                at every level of government. Goodness knows, that is difficult. 
                Most people are overwhelmingly indifferent about the process of 
                government until something goes wrong. It is a sad commentary 
                on all our democracies that there has to be a crisis before people 
                take an interest in the process of government. However, we are 
                all working to improve that situation.</P>
              <P>It is worth remembering that the Scottish Parliament is the main 
                feature of a seismic change in the governance of the UK that started 
                in 1997. We have begun the process of making the governance of 
                Scotland accountable to the people </P>

                prevail over the ingrained habits of manipulation and secrecy 
                among people who started their careers in Whitehall's Scottish 
                Office. I see that that fact is being acknowledged by various 
                people in the chamber.</P>
              <P>It is difficult enough to achieve good governance in Scotland 
                and the UK. Obviously, it is far more complicated in a multinational 
                union of 15 member states that will soon take in 10 more countries. 
                However, it is extremely important that we succeed in building 
                up public confidence in the new European order.</P>
              <P>You will recall that, yesterday, Presiding Officer, you and I 
                were present at a ceremony in one of our committee rooms at which 
                the Bosnian ambassador made a presentation to the family of a 
                Scottish volunteer who was killed by a sniper in Sarajevo in 1993. 
                The failure of governance in Yugoslavia, when citizens lost their 
                respect for the institutions of their federal Government, when 
                the economy and the social fabric of their state collapsed and 
                when educated people who had lived together in a successful multinational 
                state suddenly descended into the savagery of ethnic cleansing, 
                demonstrates the sort of thing that can go wrong. If I had not 
                seen it with my own eyes, I would not have believed that such 
                horrors were possible.</P>
              <P>I happen to be a member of the first generation of Scots in recorded 
                history that has not been involved in some kind of European or 
                colonial conflict. We do not know how lucky we are. We have an 
                overriding duty to develop public support for the European Union, 
                not only to protect Scotland's economic interests but, most important, 
                to reduce the risk of conflict for future generations of Scots. 
                We must be actively engaged in the development and enlargement 
                of the EU. Many of us were encouraged by Peter Hain's comments 
                last week about progress towards British participation in the 
                euro currency, but I would not expect the Tories to agree with 
                me on that subject. For the purposes of this debate, I hope that 
                the Parliament will endorse the agreed conclusions of the report 
                of the European Committee on the subject of governance.</P>
              <P>The Scottish Parliament is already leading a constructive debate 
                about the role of regions and nations within member states in 
                the constitutional development of the EU. Subsidiarity might be 
                an awful word, but it is an excellent principle and we must ensure 
                that that principle is practised. To that end, the European Committee 
                is actively promoting contacts with other regions with legislative 
                competence in Germany, Spain and Belgium.</P>
              <P>We must achieve far greater openness and accountability in the 
                work of the EU to ensure that </P>

                task by developing better representation of Scottish interests 
                in our dealings with the European Council of Ministers and the 
                Commission and by co-ordinating our activities with Scottish members 
                of the European Parliament. As I was a minister representing Scottish 
                interests, I have some experience of how the system works and 
                can say that the line that was taken by the nationalists in this 
                debate, that there is no input from the Scottish Executive and 
                the Scottish Parliament on European issues, is plain nonsense. 
                We have powerful influence in the UK, the European Council of 
                Ministers and the Commission.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Home Robertson: </strong>I do not have time.</P>
              <P>This debate about governance, following the Treaty of Nice, should 
                pave the way for greater accountability at every level of Government 
                throughout the EU. It is extremely important that Scotland should 
                be fully engaged at every stage of that process. The European 
                Committee has made a positive contribution to that debate and 
                I hope that our report will be taken on board by the convention 
                that started work today under the leadership of Valery Giscard

              <P><strong>Stewart Stevenson (Banff and Buchan) (SNP): </strong>I bring to 
                the attention of Parliament a matter that has arisen since the 
                Parliamentary Bureau considered the business motion. It has arisen 
                in relation to the plan for the stage 3 debate on the Sexual Offences 
                (Procedure and Evidence) (Scotland) Bill on Wednesday next week. 
                I think that the majority of members are strong supporters of 
                that bill. I and my SNP colleagues certainly are.</P>
              <P>At yesterday's meeting of the Justice 2 Committee, we took evidence 
                on the Executive's stage 2 amendment 16. That amendment was substantial 
                in size, complexity and possible implications for Scots law. The 
                principles of the amendment will receive broad support from many 
                members, as they do from me. However, the committee took evidence 
                from the Law Society of Scotland and from Professor Gane of the 
                University of Aberdeen on the amendment. The upshot of that was 
                that they sounded a substantial note of caution about whether 
                one part of the amendment would be operable.</P>
              <P>I will not cover the substantive issue just now&#151;the stage 
                3 debate is the proper forum for that. I will make a point about 
                processes and the risks that may be associated with rushing legislation. 
                We have not rushed the bill&#151;we first voted on it at stage 
                1 many months ago&#151;but the committee has found itself in a 
                position in which there are only 48 hours to consider whether 
                we wish to amend section 8B, which was introduced by the Executive's 
                stage 2 amendment 16. Furthermore, we do not have the <em>Official 
                Report</em> of the evidence taken yesterday. That creates difficulties.</P>

              <P>I would have preferred that the debate be postponed for a week, 
                but I do not think that that will be possible. I therefore take 
                the opportunity to urge the Executive to look carefully at section 
                8B, to consider the evidence that was given to the committee yesterday 
                and to determine whether, with the resources that are available 
                to it, the Executive will be able to fine-tune the amendment to 
                address the points that were raised in yesterday's evidence, preserve 
                the integrity of the bill and support women throughout Scotland 
                in their fight against the heinous crime of rape.</P>
              <P>12:32</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Parliamentary Business (Euan Robson): 
                </strong>The amendment to which Stewart Stevenson refers is the Executive's 
                amendment on previous convictions, which was passed at stage 2. 
                Ministers regretted having to lodge the amendment at stage 2, 
                but the issue is complex and more time was needed to get it right. 
                Ministers did not want to delay the introduction of the bill, 
                which would have been a disappointment and a worry to victims 
                groups.</P>
              <P>The amendment was lodged on 5 December and considered during 
                the second day of stage 2 on 18 December. It was passed with the 
                committee reserving the right to take evidence on it prior to 
                the stage 3 debate. The committee took evidence yesterday. Although 
                that left only two days to lodge non-Executive amendments, committee 
                members would have been aware of that when they scheduled the 
                meeting. There have been 10 weeks in which the committee could 
                have taken oral evidence or obtained written submissions. It is 
                not appropriate to request postponement of stage 3 for the first 
                time at what is a late hour.</P>
              <P>Women's and victims' groups are anxious that the bill, which 
                is important for the protection of complainers, be enacted as 
                soon as possible. I assure Stewart Stevenson that the Executive 
                will examine the detail of section 8B closely to ensure that it 
                is proper.</P>

              <P><strong>1. Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what guidance it has given to local authorities 
                on the closure of secondary schools. (S1O-4726)</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Education and Young People (Nicol 
                Stephen): </strong>None.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Quinan: </strong>I thank the minister for that somewhat short 
                reply. Is he aware of Renfrewshire Council's plan to close St 
                Brendan's High School in Linwood and St Cuthbert's High School 
                in Johnstone and of the fact that 95 per cent of the members of 
                the school boards have rejected the idea of the closure of the 
                schools? Does not he agree that it would be appropriate for him 
                to issue guidance on the closure of schools instead of taking 
                the rather offhand attitude that he has taken so far in replying 
                to the question?</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The member asked what guidance there is 
                and I gave an accurate answer, but perhaps I could explain more 
                fully what the statutory procedures are.</P>
              <P>When an education authority wants to change the provision of 
                education, including the amalgamation or closure of a school, 
                there is a statutory requirement for it to engage in a formal 
                consultation process. Under the statutory procedures, which Lloyd 
                Quinan might care to know are set out in the Education (Publication 
                and Consultation Etc) (Scotland) Regulations 1981, the authority 
                would have to consult parents and the school boards. The authority 
                must allow a minimum of 28 days for representations to be made 
                to it before reaching a decision. There are also statutory requirements 
                for a school closure proposal to be referred to Scottish ministers, 
                but I will not go into detail about that at present.</P>

                accident analysis has been carried out on the A9 and its recommendations 
                will be considered.</P>
              <P><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>The minister will be aware of my previous 
                interest in the Ballinluig junction on the A9. I have in my hand 
                a copy of the closed-circuit television surveillance report from 
                BEAR Scotland, which was published today. It recommends that consideration 
                be given to re-siting the camera to provide an improved view of 
                through traffic and vehicle manoeuvres, which seems to vindicate 
                local people's opinion that the CCTV camera was sited in the wrong 
                place. Given that there seems to be an admission of inadequacy 
                in the report and that the view of local representatives is that 
                we need a grade-separated junction, will the minister now instruct 
                a further report that is based on a re-sited camera?</P>
              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We will use the evidence from the camera. 
                We will also use the evidence from other studies that we have 
                carried out at the junction. I am sure that Murdo Fraser is aware 
                that we have announced our intention to hold an exhibition at 
                Ballinluig in April this year to bring to the community's attention 
                the favoured options and to elicit its comments on those.</P>
              <P>We recognise the need for action at that spot. That is clear 
                from the report that was published today. Before making final 
                decisions, we will consider carefully the evidence and the responses 
                of the Ballinluig community and the public to the exhibition in 
                April.</P>
              <P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>As the question is geographically 
                specific, I will call Keith Raffan.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Keith Raffan (Mid Scotland and Fife) (LD): </strong>Does the 
                minister agree that although the Ballinluig junction is one of 
                the worst examples on the A9, many other parts of the road are 
                extremely dangerous? Does he also agree that one way in which 
                we can improve safety on the A9 is by increasing the dualling 
                of that road? Will the minister tell us when he expects the Executive 
                to be able to propose plans for dualling other stretches of the 
                A9?</P>
              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Keith Raffan knows well the state of 
                the roads programme on the A9. As for other trunk roads, we do 
                not anticipate further major projects emerging now, as was explained 
                in the chamber recently in reference to the strategic roads programme.</P>
              <P>We are looking at a number of areas on the A9 where improvements 
                can be made. We expect that, in addition to Ballinluig, there 
                will be improvements to the junctions at Auchterarder and at Blackford 
                in connection with developments in those areas. We expect the 
                developers to bear a significant part of the cost of those improvements.</P>

              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services (Peter 
                Peacock): </strong>Scottish Executive representatives meet COSLA on 
                a regular basis to discuss matters of mutual interest.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Harding: </strong>At his next meeting, will the minister take 
                the opportunity to question why, in view of the &quot;substantial 
                increase&quot;&#151;in the minister's own words&#151;in funding 
                to local government, most councils have increased council tax 
                well above the rate of inflation while cutting services? Is this 
                the Executive's new stealth tax?</P>
              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>As Mr Harding rightly pointed out, the 
                Executive has been extremely generous in its grant settlement 
                this year, as it has in the past two years, giving more than 10 
                per cent more additional resources. Most councils have brought 
                in council taxes exactly on the targets that they predicted last 
                year. In many cases, councils have brought in council taxes below 
                that target. That is because of the generous grant that the Scottish 
                Executive gives.</P>
              <P><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>Instead of listening to 
                the prophets of doom and gloom, will the Executive ask COSLA to 
                encourage all Scottish local authorities to support the joint 
                bid for Euro 2008, which would be of immense benefit to the whole 
                of Scotland and to Scottish sport, tourism and the economy?</P>
              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>That matter would not normally be on the 
                agenda for meetings with COSLA, but I am more than happy to raise 
                it at my next meeting. I am sure that, as always, COSLA will act 
                in the interests of Scotland.</P>

              <P>allocated an extra 11 million over the next two financial years 
                to support the task force's recommendations, which are a blueprint 
                for preventing and alleviating homelessness. I was further pleased 
                to announce that the Cabinet has agreed a legislative slot later 
                this year to deliver the task force's recommendations in statute.</P>
              <P><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>I am sure that the minister will join me 
                in congratulating the housing and homelessness organisations and 
                the individuals who have contributed successfully to the work 
                of the task force.</P>
              <P>When implementing the recommendations, will the minister undertake 
                to confront directly perceptions about people who become homeless? 
                In particular, will he undertake to promote recognition of some 
                of the causes of homelessness, including unemployment, relationship 
                breakdown, domestic abuse, illness and addiction, so that people 
                who become homeless are recognised as being not different or failed 
                but human beings of the same worth as anyone else in Scotland?</P>
              <P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Angus MacKay is right. That is not surprising, 
                given his professional background as a campaigner for a homelessness 
                charity. The involvement of such a wide range of experts in the 
                task force gives it its strength.</P>
              <P>The report includes firm recommendations to improve the provision 
                of health care, employment opportunities and social support for 
                the homeless. All too often, the problems that lead to homelessness 
                are problems that could strike any of us or our families at any 
                time. The monitoring group, which is the successor to the task 
                force, will expect us to do work to ensure that there is wider 
                understanding of that among the public. Addressing homelessness 
                involves addressing a housing problem, but there is often an attitude 
                problem that must be addressed as well.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>To what extent does 
                the minister believe that the withdrawal of housing benefit to 
                16 and 17-year-olds by the Tories in the 1980s impacted on homelessness 
                among young people? What representations&#151;if any&#151;has 
                the Scottish Executive made to Her Majesty's Government over the 
                past three years to seek the restoration of those benefits?</P>
              <P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>If Kenny Gibson reads the report, he will find 
                that it makes recommendations on issues that it believes to be 
                major contributors to homelessness. If it does not comment on 
                the issue that he raises, that is perhaps because the experts 
                feel that it is not the issue that has the greatest impact on 
                homelessness. What he will find in the report are recommendations 
                about areas of the benefits system in which the task force believed

                Executive whether it will meet any costs incurred by Lothian University 
                Hospitals NHS Trust's reappraisal of the managed equipment services 
                public-private partnership for the new Edinburgh royal infirmary.

              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care (Hugh Henry): 
                </strong>No. The trust is resourced for management costs and the appraisal 
                of procurement options is a normal activity that falls within 
                those costs.</P>
              <P><strong>Ms MacDonald: </strong>I thank the minister for that reply, but 
                I inform him that the reappraisal was brought about because of 
                the Executive's decision to reconfigure the hospital trusts. The 
                expenditure anticipated by the original trust, which negotiated 
                the new equipment, has been thrown out of kilter because of the 
                Executive's decision. I think that the Executive has a moral duty 
                and I hope that the minister agrees.</P>
              <P><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>No. The hospital trust and Siemens were unable 
                to reach an agreement that would provide the trust with the best 
                value for money. The decision to pursue a review requires the 
                approval of the trust's management board. That was given when 
                the board met on 8 February. It is a local decision, which was 
                taken in the best interests of the health service. I think that

              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services (Peter 
                Peacock): </strong>Decisions about council tax levels are a matter 
                for each council.</P>
              <P><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>I would have liked to thank the minister 
                for his answer, but as it was not much of an answer, I will not 
                bother.</P>
              <P>Does the minister agree that the council tax is unfair, that 
                the burden of council tax falls more on the low-paid and pensioners 
                in Scotland and that council tax is higher in the poorest local 
                authorities than it is in any other part of Scotland? Will the 
                minister join me in supporting an income-based, progressive and 
                fair tax instead of the ridiculously unfair council tax?</P>
              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Tommy Sheridan knows very well that I will 
                not support him in that move, as I set out in a recent debate. 
                The council tax is a progressive tax. The value-of-property aspect 
                is one indication of that. Secondly, when the benefit system is 
                applied to the tax system there is a progressive element. Much 
                council tax benefit is targeted at exactly the kind of communities 
                that Tommy Sheridan mentioned.</P>
              <P>Unlike the Scottish service tax that Tommy Sheridan advocates, 
                the council tax is a local tax. His tax is a central tax, which 
                would remove discretion from local authorities. Another effect 
                of Tommy Sheridan's proposal would be to lose Scotland 300 million 
                of council tax benefit, which directly helps the people whom he 
                professes to be concerned about in Scotland. His tax proposals 
                would increase the burden on below-average earners in Scotland.</P>
              <P><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>Does the minister 
                recall that at the previous question time, the First Minister 
                reported that Scottish Borders Council had the second-lowest council 
                tax in Scotland? Does the allocation of the block grant take account 
                of the fact that wage levels in the Borders are among the lowest 
                in Scotland and that on a wage:council tax ratio, the level of 
                council tax charge in the Borders is equivalent to that in Edinburgh?</P>
              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The correct figure is that Scottish Borders 
                Council has the lowest mainland council tax levels in Scotland 
                for this year.</P>
              <P>The allocation of resources to local authorities is based on 
                a complex set of formulae, but fundamentally it is based on need. 
                Of councils in Scotland, Scottish Borders Council receives the 
                eighth-highest level of grant. In that sense, it is among the

                on the books, will the minister reciprocate and encourage Councillor 
                Tulley, who is the leader of the council, to apply for special 
                borrowing?</P>
              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>No, I will not. Such matters are for the

                an application for a loan of the sort that Christine Grahame mentioned,

                level of council tax on the mainland. Other councils in Scotland 
                have higher council tax levels and provide the same level of services. 
                Scottish Borders Council also has balances at its disposal. In

              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Pauline McNeill is right that IT will 
                improve the delivery of patient care in many ways and will free 
                up staff time by reducing bureaucracy. I saw some of the advantages 
                on Monday, when I visited the Belford hospital in Fort William 
                and local GPs. I saw GPs and their patients who benefit from the 
                big advances in IT that have been spearheaded in the Highlands 
                and elsewhere.</P>
              <P>One advance is the quick transmission of test results; another 
                factor, which Pauline McNeill mentioned, is the electronic booking 
                of appointments. That system means that before people leave their 
                GP's surgery, they can see when their appointment will be. That 
                is bound to reduce the proportion of people who do not show for 
                out-patient appointments, which at present is 11 per cent of all 
                out-patient appointments.</P>
              <P><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Will the minister 
                confirm that most of the IT money to which he referred was for 
                a rescue package for the instant appointments system? Will he 
                confirm that, according to Labour's programme for government, 
                the new appointments system was supposed to be in place by 2002? 
                Will he acknowledge that the new system is likely to be at least 
                one year late and will be significantly over budget?</P>
              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The money was by no means for a rescue 
                package. Highland NHS Board was in the first tranche of health 
                boards that were involved in the system. All the other boards 
                have come on stream and the system has now started everywhere 
                in Scotland. Highland NHS Board and four other health boards are 
                in the vanguard. Shona Robison should welcome the many advantages 
                for patient care in the measures that I have mentioned. When I 
                had a recent meeting with nurses, they praised the initiative, 
                because it means less time spent on bureaucracy and more time 
                spent on direct front-line patient care.</P>

                the minister concerned that only 30 per cent of GP practices are 
                linked to the system for the electronic booking of appointments 
                and transmission of patient test results? Is he concerned that 
                immediate discharge letters are e-mailed to GP practices from

                is why we announced an extra 2 million this week to accelerate 
                the development of the system. Mary Scanlon should praise the

                to information that they provide. When I visited Fort William,

                issue. It has a marked effect on health, public disorder, underage 
                drinking and the local economy by robbing legitimate outlets of 
                the trade that they should have. We should perhaps persuade shopkeepers&#151;</P>
              <P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>That is all very interesting, but 
                we must have a question.</P>
              <P><strong>Donald Gorrie: </strong>I was going to ask the minister what he 
                is going to do about it.</P>
              <P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>What are you going to do about 
                it, minister?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I agree with Donald Gorrie's analysis of the 
                problem. The fact that such fraud robs substantial revenue means 
                that there is less to be shared and less to the block grant that 
                we would get.</P>
              <P>It is fair to give credit to the United Kingdom Government. Estimates 
                show that its efforts to tackle cross-channel smuggling reduced 
                the revenue lost in 2000-2001 by 76 per cent compared to the revenue 
                lost in 1999-2000. The Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament 
                are able to resource our police forces and, not least, the Scottish 
                Drug Enforcement Agency, because the problems of drug smuggling 
                tie in with the kind of activities with cigarettes and alcohol 
                to which Mr Gorrie referred.</P>
              <P>Last night the House of Commons passed the Proceeds of Crime 
                Bill, on which there has already been a Sewel motion in this Parliament. 
                When that bill is passed through Westminster it will give us additional 
                measures with which to tackle this serious problem.</P>

                his face, perhaps I should ask him whether he knows what strip

                Executive will participate in the development of that relationship 
                and has no plans to review its arrangements with Consignia.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>What action will the Executive take to ensure 
                that small businesses in rural Scotland, such as those located 
                in my constituency, are given support in order to ensure that 
                they are not adversely affected by the deregulation of postal 
                services?</P>
              <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>From the rural development perspective, 
                there are two points in which we would be most interested when 
                we have discussions with the Department of Trade and Industry. 
                The first is the maintenance of Consignia's universal service 
                obligation to provide at least one collection every working day. 
                The second is to ensure the roll out of the DTI pilot that I spoke 
                of on the previous occasion on which this matter was discussed 
                in the chamber. The project, which is known as &quot;Your Guide&quot;, 
                would give business consumers access to a one-stop-shop approach 
                to a range of services, covering 80 per cent of commercial activity

                by 72 per cent, the number of post offices fell by half, the Saturday 
                service was scrapped and door-to-door delivery in rural areas 
                ceased? Will he ensure that the DTI and Postcomm are told in no 
                uncertain terms that privatisation is unacceptable and that we

              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Education and Young People (Nicol 
                Stephen): </strong>The Scottish Executive's teacher recruitment campaign 
                is designed to appeal to all sections of the community. To highlight 
                the importance of encouraging more men in primary teaching, the 
                2001 teacher recruitment advertising campaign deliberately featured 
                a male teacher working in a primary school.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>I thank the minister for that initiative.</P>
              <P>Given the growing number of single mums and the low number of 
                male primary school teachers, does the minister agree that, if 
                we are to have greater social cohesion&#151;which some might call 
                social inclusion&#151;greater effort must be made to encourage 
                more male teachers in primary schools? That would mean that more 
                male role models were available to our children.</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>We are very conscious of the issue, the 
                scale of which is clear. The school census in the year 2000 indicated 
                that around 7 per cent of primary teachers were male. The NFO 
                System Three Social Research survey that followed up on the recruitment 
                advertising campaign showed a small decrease, among those who 
                had seen the advert, in the number of people who viewed primary 
                teaching as &quot;mainly for women&quot;.</P>
              <P>I agree that a balance is appropriate and that it is vital that 
                we provide the right role models&#151;male or female&#151;for 
                our young people. If Brian Monteith or any other member has specific 
                proposals, ministers would be prepared to consider them. The important 
                point is that during the next few years we need to recruit many

                agree that primary school teachers&#151;the vast majority of whom 
                are women&#151;are doing very important work? In spite of the 
                problems that society faces, it is the fact that women are prepared 
                to tackle the problems that gives us hope for the future.</P>
              <P>Will the minister join me in congratulating those primary schools 
                in Glasgow that have succeeded in shifting significantly the attainment 
                figures for pupil literacy and numeracy? In any consideration 
                of how to make primary teaching a more attractive career, will 
                he note that the rate at which women secure promoted posts is 
                not in proportion to their numbers in the work force and will 
                he reflect on the message that that gives to women primary teachers 
                and their pupils?</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I am happy to agree with and endorse those 
                comments. All the evidence suggests that our primary schools are 
                doing a very good job and that that job is improving&#151;attainment 
                is increasing across the board. We must not be complacent. My 
                personal view is that we need a mix of male and female teachers, 
                as well as a mix of younger and older, more mature teachers. That 
                is important for Scottish society.</P>

                NHS dental treatment in some parts of Scotland, including Argyll 
                and Bute, which are due principally to staffing shortages. Work 
                is under way nationally to improve the supply of dentists and, 
                in conjunction with the profession, we are considering a number 
                of proposals. To recognise the position of dentists in remote 
                areas, we will introduce from 1 April 2002 remote areas allowance 
                and will also increase continuing professional development allowances.

                salaried dentists in Argyll and Bute. It has been the habit of 
                the Executive to look favourably at any applications for salaried

                aware that a shortage of dentists is not the only problem for 
                rural communities in Grampian? People who live in those communities 
                must wait for up to four years to see a dental surgeon at the 
                local hospital. Will the minister tell the chamber what she is 
                doing to reduce waiting times for such treatment at the local 
                hospital?</P>
              <P><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>As I said, we are considering a number of 
                proposals to encourage provision in the area. The two proposals 
                that I mentioned will make an impression on the waiting lists 
                that the member refers to. We are also looking at encouraging 
                dentists to return to practice, encouraging older dentists to 
                stay on longer and increasing provision for the support of dentists 
                by assistants. Each of those initiatives will improve waiting

                or otherwise&#151;failed. Given the fact that Dumfries and Galloway 
                has only half the number of dentists that is required, will the

                the Scottish Executive's Cabinet. (S1F-1690)</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>Our Cabinet discusses 
                issues of importance to the people of Scotland. Next week, we 
                shall discuss crime and transport. We shall certainly not discuss 
                Mr Swinney's new priority of taking Scotland out of the United 
                Kingdom. He may want to break up the national health service and 
                separate off our railways, but I assure him that our priorities 
                are not borders and politicians, but jobs, education, health, 
                transport and crime.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>The strategy has been a success already. On 
                day one, we have got the First Minister talking independence. 
                Let us start talking independence, then, because we will have 
                a few more rounds of this debate in the next 14 months.</P>
              <P>I want to ask the First Minister about the funding of the health 
                service from general taxation. Ten days ago, the First Minister 
                said:</P>
              <P>&quot;There is no need for us to raise taxes&quot;.</P>
              <P>On Friday, the First Minister said that tax rises</P>
              <P>&quot;will be very good news&quot;</P>
              <P>for the health service in Scotland. Which one is it?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>On Friday, I said that the extra expenditure 
                that might be available as a result of the decisions of the Chancellor 
                of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister would be very good news 
                for the people of Scotland.</P>
              <P>I am delighted to take on the challenge that Mr Swinney would 
                like to set. This morning, he outlined his No 1 priority, which 
                is to take Scotland out of the United Kingdom. One of the most 
                immediate impacts of that would be to reduce Scotland's health 
                budget by 1 billion. Scotland has a better health service not 
                only because that service is part of the national health service, 
                but as a result of the economic decisions of the UK Government.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>The only problem with the First Minister's 
                explanation of his comments on Friday is that it is not true. 
                On Friday, the First Minister said:</P>
              <P>&quot;If Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are prepared to increase 
                taxes ... then that will be very good news for doctors, nurses 
                and most importantly for patients.&quot;</P>

              <P>ministers, or will he take the decision for himself?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I would be very happy to see increased 
                money being available for the Scottish health service. I note 
                that the Scottish nationalist party's current policy&#151;although, 
                like many others, it might change in the course of this week&#151;is 
                to increase taxation for ordinary families in Scotland but to 
                reduce business taxation. That is what one or two of his members 
                seem to be plugging around the boardrooms of Scotland. Mr Swinney 
                might wish to reduce company taxation and increase personal taxation, 
                but that is not the policy of the Labour party or of the partnership.</P>
              <P>Mr Swinney might also want to address the fundamental issue. 
                As a percentage of gross domestic product, spending on health 
                in Scotland is significantly higher than in most of the other 
                smaller European Union countries to which he regularly refers 
                in the chamber. Will he admit today that an independent Scotland 
                would spend less on health and have a poorer health service than 
                a Scotland that is part of the UK?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>The one statistic on health service funding 
                that the First Minister failed to mention is that Scotland's share 
                of UK health spending is falling year on year and it is falling 
                under a Labour Government.</P>
              <P>The First Minister still has not answered. He still has not explained 
                whether he is prepared to allow other people to take the decisions. 
                However, it seems pretty clear that he will wait for the chancellor 
                to take his decisions. While we wait for the chancellor, Scottish 
                patients are waiting for treatment. Is it not time that we had 
                a Parliament that did not wait for others to take decisions, but 
                that took its own decisions? Is it not time that we had a normal, 
                independent Parliament?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>Mr Swinney may want us to make that 
                choice, but the reality is this: public expenditure on health 
                in Scotland, as a percentage of GDP, is significantly higher than 
                it is in the vast majority of the small nations in the European 
                Union; the number of acute in-patient beds in Scotland per 1,000 
                population is among the highest of the small nations in the European 
                Union; the number of general practitioners in Scotland per 1,000 
                population is, in fact, the highest of the small nations in the 
                European Union; and the number of hospital beds in Scotland is 
                almost double the number in England per head of population. Those 
                are the benefits that Scotland has as part of the United Kingdom. 
                Mr Swinney wants to break up the national health service; we do 
                not. We want to build the national health service and put patients, 
                nurses and doctors first. That is exactly what we will do.</P>

                Minister when he will next meet the Prime Minister and what issues 
                he intends to raise with him. (S1F-1688)</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>The Prime Minister 
                and I had a very successful meeting last week with Cyclacell in 
                Dundee&#151;an outstanding example of Scottish innovation and 
                business pulling together. I am sure that our next meeting will 
                be just as worth while.</P>
              <P><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>I am sure that the First Minister and 
                the Prime Minister will not be discussing waiting lists, because 
                I notice today that the First Minister has abandoned talking about 
                that issue and has abandoned the very standard on which Labour 
                said in the previous two elections that it would be judged. A 
                clearer admission of failure would be hard to find.</P>
              <P>If Labour members will not talk about waiting lists, will they 
                talk about the problem of bedblocking, which is one of the main 
                reasons for people having to wait longer for treatment? In Parliament 
                last month, during the debate on Executive priorities, the First 
                Minister promised us that the Scottish Executive would publish 
                &quot;an action plan&quot; to tackle bedblocking by &quot;early 
                next month&quot;. Those were his words. Here we are on 28 February 
                and nothing has been announced. When can we expect some action 
                on the action plan?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>Mr McLetchie can expect some action 
                within the next few days. I am sure that he will welcome it when 
                it happens.</P>
              <P>I am very happy to talk about waiting lists. There has been hard 
                work by the new waiting list unit, which, if I am right, Mr McLetchie 
                condemned, saying that it was inadequate. Last week, the unit 
                announced that 100 patients would be taken from Tayside and operated 
                on in Fife. The unit has consistently announced that people in 
                Scotland would be treated in beds in health board areas other 
                than their own and in the private sector, bringing down waiting 
                lists and bringing down waiting times. The unit was described 
                as inadequate and as a waste of time, but it is in fact making 
                a difference to patients right across Scotland. I am happy to 
                talk about that any time.</P>
              <P>I am also happy to make it absolutely clear that the size of 
                the waiting list in Scotland should not be our primary performance 
                target in the health service&#151;our primary performance target 
                should be waiting times. Every nurse, every patient, every administrator 
                and every doctor to whom I spoke in Edinburgh royal infirmary 
                this morning confirmed that waiting times should be the primary 
                indicator. That is exactly what we will now concentrate on.</P>

              <P><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>It has taken the First Minister a long 
                time to waken up to that. He should perhaps apologise to people 
                in this country for the deceits practised by the Labour party 
                in the elections of 1997 and 1999, when it said that waiting lists 
                were the standard by which it would be judged.</P>
              <P>I am pleased that we are finally to see the action plan, albeit 
                belatedly. As everyone knows, over the past three years under 
                the Executive, the problem of delayed discharges has been getting 
                seriously worse and not better.</P>
              <P>I wonder whether the First Minister heard the observations of 
                his colleague down south last week. Mr Milburn said:</P>
              <P>&quot;The old Berlin Wall between health and social care really 
                must go.&quot;</P>
              <P>We believe that the unification of the health-related social 
                work budget and the health budget is long overdue. There has been 
                a Berlin wall in that area and we have been advocating unification 
                for some time as the best means of ending bedblocking and delayed 
                discharge in Scotland. Will the First Minister consider the adoption 
                of that eminently sensible policy?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>Mr McLetchie is well aware that we 
                are working towards that sort of joint management of budgets. 
                Although he might want to take responsibilities away from local 
                authorities&#151;I notice that Ms Sturgeon expressed a similar 
                view last week, when she advocated ring fencing of budgets, in 
                direct contradiction of the SNP local government spokesperson&#151;that 
                is not our view. We want joint management and performance targets. 
                That is the system that will make a difference to our health and 
                social work services and will ensure that they work better together. 
                It will ensure not just that bedblocking is dealt with, but that 
                the whole process of caring for our elderly is treated seriously 
                and delivered effectively.</P>

                and end the immorality whereby this generation is loading the 
                next generation with a huge burden? Does he realise that, when 
                Scotland becomes independent, we will get rid of profiteering 
                on the back of public sector workers?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>Alex Neil's leadership speech has 
                come a day late, given John Swinney's announcement this morning. 
                The time has come and gone&#151;John is back on the independence 
                trail.</P>
              <P>No public project in Scotland should go ahead under any financing 
                method that does not provide best value and value for money for 
                the taxpayer. That is the bottom line for any decisions that we 
                take. That is why in some circumstances we choose to use public-private 
                partnerships, but in the vast majority of circumstances we use 
                public capital procurement.</P>
              <P>It is absolutely disingenuous of Alex Neil to say that services 
                would in some way be better in Scotland if Scotland were ripped 
                out of the United Kingdom. As Alex Neil knows, there would be 
                less finance around and therefore our health service and other 
                vital public services would automatically decline. In the general 
                election back in 1999, he and his colleagues campaigned against 
                the very projects that are making a real difference to the constituents 
                that he is meant to represent. The constituents of Central Scotland 
                have benefited from new schools in Falkirk, the Strathclyde police 
                training centre and from Hairmyres and Wishaw hospitals&#151;those 
                projects would not have happened if he had had his way. Next year, 
                the electorate will remember him for that.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr John McAllion (Dundee East) (Lab): </strong>Speaking as someone 
                who never got the chance to make a leadership bid, never mind 
                a leadership speech, may I ask whether the First Minister is aware 
                that the new waste energy plant in my constituency was built under 
                a public-private partnership and is largely financed by a combination 
                of public investment and council contracts for waste disposal? 
                Does he think it right in those circumstances that officials of 
                the company that run the plant can refuse to provide me&#151;the 
                elected member for the constituency in which the plant is sited&#151;with 
                key information about the plant on the ground that the information 
                is commercially confidential? Surely it is time to end the commercially 
                confidential cop-out and to tell the private sector that, if it 
                wants to become involved in public services, it has to play by 
                public rules and standards of accountability, rather than by private 
                ones.</P>

                projects that have been established&#151;in education, health 
                and other areas&#151;have been delivered by the private sector 
                on time, within budget and to high standards of design and maintenance. 
                That control exists because the public sector and politicians 
                in this chamber and in local authorities throughout Scotland take 
                their responsibilities seriously and deliver such standards. The 
                specific example that the member gave from Dundee involves the 
                local authority, which I imagine would have had some control over 
                the contractual position. However, I would be happy to look into

                survey's overwhelming support for the proposal to ban the use 
                of implements against children. We have noted the narrow minority 
                against the proposal to ban smacking children under the age of 
                three. Jim Wallace has made it clear that we welcome a mature 
                debate on the age at which the line should be drawn. I have no 
                doubt that the Parliament will debate the matter when the proposed 
                criminal justice bill is introduced.</P>
              <P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>Does the First Minister appreciate 
                that Scotland's parents have given a signal that the proposed 
                legislation is unworkable, unnecessary, unwarranted and unenforceable? 
                As the majority of Scotland's parents and the British Prime Minister 
                take that view, is not it time that he did, too?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>A description of proposed legislation 
                as unworkable and unenforceable by someone who voted for the poll 
                tax is a bit rich. It is important that we set standards in our 
                society for anything that relates to acts that might be portrayed 
                as, or may in fact be, violent and dangerous. I fundamentally 
                believe that we should have a strict rule against striking children 
                with implements and I would be surprised if any member, even on 
                the Conservative benches, disagreed with that. I also believe

                often crucial to the answers that are given? Does he agree that, 
                since the publication of the report to which Lord James Douglas-Hamilton

              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>This is a serious issue. There should

                The current proposals reflect the consultation that took place 
                last year and the mature way in which many organisations and individuals 
                responded to it. I am sure that, when the Parliament debates the

                Minister what support the Scottish Executive is giving to curling 
                and other winter sports. (S1F-1701)<A NAME="OpenQuestionTime" id="OpenQuestionTime"></A></P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>I am sure that 
                members would want me not only to welcome the Presiding Officer 
                back to the chamber this afternoon, but to congratulate Alain 
                Baxter as well as the curling team on their successes in the winter 
                Olympics in Salt Lake City. [<em>Applause</em>.] There were plans 
                to recognise the contribution of all members of the team in respect 
                of their appearance at the winter Olympics later in the spring. 
                That will now be a special occasion for us in Edinburgh in recognising 
                the achievement of the winners in particular.</P>
              <P>Support for curling and other winter sports is provided through 
                sportscotland and the Scottish Institute of Sport. Curling is 
                one of the institute's nine core sports and all Scottish medallists 
                from the winter Olympics were supported through our lottery sports 
                fund programmes. Following that success, I want to encourage more 
                participation in winter sports and to maximise the potential for 
                increased tourism to Scotland.</P>
              <P><strong>Karen Gillon: </strong>I thank the First Minister for his answer 
                and associate myself with his comments. Does he accept that the 
                grass roots of a sport such as curling are particularly important 
                and that it is essential that we ensure that support is available 
                to curling and other sports at a grass-roots level, as well as 
                at an excellence level? The provision of such support and the 
                necessary </P>

              <P><strong>The First Minister:</strong> I agree. It was interesting to learn 
                in Perth last weekend of Perth and Kinross Council's programme 
                to ensure that all primary-age children in the area have an opportunity 
                to take part in a 12-week curling programme, so that they experience 
                the sport at a young age. When I met representatives of the Royal 
                Caledonian Curling Club on Tuesday, I was told that one of their 
                main concerns for their sport, which is one of Scotland's great 
                traditional sports, is that fewer young people are taking part. 
                Our programmes&#151;through sportscotland, the Scottish Institute 
                of Sport, the talented athlete programme and the lottery sports 
                fund&#151;support not just curling, but the other of the nine 
                priority sports in Scotland. They will continue to focus on improving 
                the participation of young people by getting them involved in 
                sport, which will at the same time boost those great Scottish 
                sports.</P>
              <P><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP): </strong>Does 
                the First Minister accept that Glenmore Lodge in my constituency, 
                which is Scotland's national outdoor centre, should receive more 
                support if we are to encourage the winter sports success that 
                we have seen with Alain Baxter and others? If so, will he reverse 
                the cuts in funding that that excellent institution has received 
                in recent years?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister:</strong> It would be unfortunate to sully such 
                a week of celebration in Scotland with that kind of cheap political 
                point. It is important for us to recognise&#151;[<em>Interruption.</em>] 
                Members on the nationalist benches might not want to hear this, 
                but now and again in Scotland we sometimes get things right. Those 
                Scottish sportsmen and women got support through the lottery sports 
                fund and Government programmes. They got sports psychologists, 
                physiotherapists, training programmes, fitness programmes and 
                competition programmes and they were supported when they travelled 
                overseas. That boost to them, which was supported by the previous 
                Conservative Government, the Labour Government and by this Labour-Liberal 
                Democrat coalition, has resulted in success for Scotland in the 
                Olympics. That is something that all parties in the chamber should 
                celebrate. To make cheap political points out of the situation 
                does not do those athletes a service and it runs down the chamber.</P>
              <P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I take back what I said earlier. 
                The last question is from Margo MacDonald.</P>
              <P><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>I have a vested interest 
                to declare: our eldest grandson has just got into the Scottish 
                ice hockey squad at the age of 13, so we are not all girns on 
                this side of the chamber.</P>

              <P>I ask the First Minister to request a cost-benefit analysis of 
                the investment in winter sports as opposed to summer sports. Not 
                that I want to deprive summer sports of investment, but we have 
                seen that winter sports probably have much more to offer than 
                we previously thought in terms of input into the economy. Tourism 
                is the first and foremost benefit. Will he make sure that VisitScotland 
                gets off the mark, recruits those Scottish Olympians and gets 
                them on top of an open-topped bus on tartan day?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister:</strong> I have to say&#151;he hesitates for 
                a moment&#151;that, looking at Margo MacDonald, I did not think 
                that she had a grandson. I agree with her on this occasion. This 
                is not just about curling and it is not just about winter sports. 
                I will provide another example. The world badminton championships, 
                which took place in Glasgow two or three years ago, contributed 
                2 million to the local economy. Although the publicity around 
                Euro 2008 and the importance of football to Scotland should be 
                recognised, there is also a case for us to recognise that a number 
                of other sports are played in communities throughout Scotland, 
                by families and individuals, and that those sports are important, 
                too. They are important in their own right, but they are important 
                for Scotland's potential on the world stage and for Scotland's 
                economy. We should do all that we can to boost all those sports, 
                as well as talk about football in the chamber, which we seem to 
                do rather a lot.</P>
              <P><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> Before I leave the chair, I thank 
                the First Minister and the chamber for welcoming me back, but 
                I would like the chamber to record its thanks to George Reid and 
                Murray Tosh, who have borne a heavy burden during the past three

              <P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr Murray Tosh):</strong> The next 
                item of business is a debate on motion S1M-2563, in the name of 
                Cathy Jamieson, on the general principles of the Education (Disability 
                Strategies and Pupils' Records) (Scotland) Bill. I invite members 
                who wish to speak to press their request-to-speak buttons. I call 
                Cathy Jamieson to speak to and move the motion and trust that 
                she will continue the precedent that she established of welcoming 
                my former pupils in the public gallery.</P>
              <P>15:35</P>
              <P><strong>The Minister for Education and Young People (Cathy Jamieson): 
                </strong>I am glad to uphold that precedent with your permission, Deputy 
                Presiding Officer. I would not otherwise have dared to say that 
                I am glad to see pupils from Belmont Academy, which is in my constituency. 
                I congratulate them on their work in producing the &quot;Belmont 
                Banner&quot;, the school's newspaper, of which I have many copies. 
                All members are welcome to see me later and take one.</P>
              <P>The debate is important, so I will take time to outline why we 
                have introduced the bill. As many members know, the Disability 
                Discrimination Act 1995 will apply from September to all areas 
                of education. The Executive has introduced the bill to complement 
                the DDA and to extend to Scotland duties that are similar to those 
                that the DDA will apply to local education authorities in England 
                and Wales. The bill will also secure parents' independent right 
                to access their children's school records. We need to ensure that 
                every child in Scotland can make the most of educational opportunities, 
                realise his or her full potential and build on his or her talents 
                and skills.</P>
              <P>The DDA will make it unlawful throughout Britain for education 
                providers to discriminate against pupils on the ground of disability. 
                I am sure that everyone agrees that that change is welcome. It 
                will mean that schools and education authorities must ensure that 
                disabled pupils are not placed at a substantial disadvantage in 
                relation to other pupils. Schools will need to consider how they 
                can make reasonable adjustments to ensure that pupils can access 
                education and associated services. At the same time as we maintain 
                a focus on individual needs, we can make changes that will benefit 
                many pupils who have disabilities. That is why we need the bill.</P>

              <P>and grant-aided schools to prepare accessibility strategies, 
                we will encourage them to focus on long-term strategic planning 
                for improvements, to identify priorities in their areas and to 
                promote inclusion. Their accessibility strategies will be intended, 
                over time, to increase for pupils who have disabilities access 
                to the curriculum, the school environment and school information. 
                They will consider the need for changes in all schools, nursery 
                schools and other pre-school education that local authorities 
                provide directly.</P>
              <P>The aim is not to start something new or to make changes overnight. 
                Accessibility strategies will ensure that responsible bodies can 
                build on and develop the planning that is in place for educating 
                pupils who have disabilities. For instance, in their improvement 
                plans under the national priorities and in their children's services 
                plans, local authorities are planning for pupils who have disabilities.</P>
              <P>The bill complements and supports other legislation and policies 
                for children who have special educational needs. Such children 
                do not necessarily have physical disabilities, but there is a 
                large overlap between the groups. The inclusion programme, through 
                the excellence fund, has provided significant funding to promote 
                inclusion of children who have special educational needs. About 
                75 per cent of that funding also benefits children who have disabilities.</P>
              <P>We want to ensure equality of opportunity for all pupils, especially 
                those who have special educational needs and disabilities. That 
                is a key part of the national priorities. We expect that local 
                authorities' accessibility strategies will form part of their 
                improvement plans. That will ensure that the Executive receives 
                copies of strategies and can monitor how authorities are progressing. 
                It also means that that is not a requirement for yet another plan. 
                Responsible bodies can dovetail their accessibility strategies 
                with the planning they already do, which will avoid duplication.</P>
              <P>Many independent schools have experience of including pupils 
                who have disabilities and see that as part of their regular business-planning 
                cycles. We are not asking people to make sudden changes. The Disability 
                Discrimination Act 1995 does not expect schools to be able to 
                support children who have the most complex needs. The Executive 
                is clear that, in terms of mainstreaming and as far as it is possible 
                to undertake it, we want to promote the inclusion in mainstream 
                schools of pupils who have disabilities and other additional support 
                needs.</P>
              <P>However, we acknowledge that there are still many children who 
                have complex needs, but in whose best interests it might not be 
                to place them in a mainstream school. Those children will continue 
                to be educated in special schools, which </P>

              <P>can offer them the high level of support that they need. In determining 
                where a child should be placed, the views of the parents and the 
                child should be taken into account to a large extent.</P>
              <P>However, I believe that the great majority of children who have 
                disabilities should be able to benefit from education in a mainstream 
                school&#151;in the local authority or the private sector, as is 
                available at present&#151;if they wish to do so. They should, 
                wherever possible, be able to follow the same curriculum as their 
                peers. They should be able to access the whole school and all 
                its activities. They should also be able to learn using information 
                that is provided for them in a format that is suitable for their 
                needs.</P>
              <P>We also acknowledge that supporting children who have an increasingly 
                wide range of needs is a challenge for schools. That is why planning 
                is so important. For inclusion to be successful, we must plan 
                to remove from schools and nursery schools throughout Scotland 
                the barriers to participation. Some of those barriers might be 
                physical, but some are attitudinal.</P>
              <P>Much good practice exists. Many schools are already successful 
                in promoting inclusion. The Executive continues to encourage that 
                by providing finance for staff training through the special educational 
                needs specific grant and through other funding to support inclusion. 
                We want accessibility strategies to enable local authorities and 
                schools to identify what further improvements are needed and to 
                plan to carry out those improvements.</P>
              <P>Of course local authorities and schools will continue to have 
                flexibility in developing their own approaches. They all start 
                from different base points and all have different pupil populations 
                and challenges to face. That means that their priorities will 
                be different. It is not appropriate for the bill to prescribe 
                exactly what must be done and when. The responsible bodies should 
                work that out through consultation. They should consult closely 
                those who might be affected by the strategy and those who have 
                relevant expertise, including colleagues, school staff, pupils, 
                parents, health professionals, social workers, voluntary organisations 
                and others.</P>
              <P>Accessibility is an area that is constantly developing and changing. 
                It might be hard for some of us to imagine a time when every school 
                in Scotland will be completely accessible to all pupils. Much 
                as we would like that to be the case, there will always be room 
                for improvement. Nonetheless, we hope that the bill will stimulate 
                continual improvements over time.</P>
              <P>It might take many years for all schools to become fully accessible 
                to pupils who have physical disabilities, but other changes can

                will be made available to local authorities in grant-aided expenditure 
                and in ring-fenced funds such as the inclusion programme, we recognise 
                that that will not be enough to do everything that local authorities 
                would like to do in the first three-year period.</P>
              <P>However, in consulting on and developing strategies, responsible 
                bodies will find that there are many changes that they can make 
                quickly. Some of those might be in the delivery of on-going programmes. 
                For example, some local authorities have strategies for rolling 
                out training to school staff on issues such as supporting children 
                who have autistic spectrum disorders. Some might be working with 
                other agencies to promote awareness about disability and diversity 
                to school pupils. Others might have negotiated contracts with 
                specialist providers to allow information to be made available 
                to pupils in a range of alternative formats. Clearly, such initiatives 
                can benefit a wide range of people, not just school pupils and 
                staff. I stress again that the bill is not just about buildings 
                and physical access, but about providing a range of resources.</P>
              <P>Some MSPs have expressed concerns about how we will ensure that 
                the bill is effective and about how it will be publicised and 
                monitored. In addition to consulting widely, responsible bodies 
                will be encouraged to be proactive in promoting their strategies 
                once they are in place. They might wish to provide a summary to 
                interested parties, such as school staff, parents and pupils, 
                or they might ask head teachers to make parents, staff and pupils 
                aware of how the strategy will lead to improvements in their school.</P>
              <P>Responsible bodies will also have to make copies of their strategy 
                available to anyone who requests it. Many members will be pleased 
                to hear that my colleague Nicol Stephen proposes to lodge an amendment 
                at stage 2 to make it clear that strategies must also be made 
                available in alternative formats if people request them.</P>
              <P>Although I do not have much more time, I want to comment briefly 
                on the monitoring role. I assure the Parliament that Her Majesty's 
                Inspectorate of Education and the Scottish Commission for the 
                Regulation of Care will be involved in that process. Furthermore, 
                the Executive will ensure that it receives copies of accessibility 
                strategies to find out whether progress is being made and to identify 
                areas that need further improvements.</P>
              <P>Finally, we must not forget that the bill has another important 
                purpose. Until March 2000, parents in Scotland had an independent 
                right to access their children's school records. However, that 
                right was unintentionally removed when the Data Protection Act 
                1998 came into force in March 2000.</P>

              <P>15:47</P>
              <P><strong>Irene McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>The SNP warmly 
                welcomes the use of primary legislation to introduce education 
                accessibility strategies, and fully supports the bill's general 
                principles. However, there was general agreement within and outwith 
                the Education, Culture and Sport Committee that, in order to provide 
                a really robust process, the bill must be strengthened in certain 
                areas. I want to highlight a few issues that need to be addressed.</P>
              <P>Most important, we want to know how we will ensure that the strategies 
                increase accessibility. Under the bill, responsible bodies could 
                take a minimalist approach, but there is no point in introducing 
                legislation if it can be largely ignored. As the minister said, 
                monitoring and evaluation are crucial and there is a feeling that 
                they should not be left to supplementary guidance, but require 
                an amendment to the bill. Such an amendment might usefully clarify 
                the priority that HMIE will place on inspecting strategies and 
                their implementation and its role in that process, and might also 
                include a requirement for accessibility strategies to be sent 
                as a matter of routine to HMIE and the Scottish Executive.</P>
              <P>There is an equally important question about what a child, young 
                person or parent can do if duties are not being discharged. Because 
                the bill makes no specific provision for complaint or redress, 
                it requires amendment that will allow families the means to pursue 
                that course of action with some expectation of satisfaction.</P>
              <P>During evidence-taking meetings, the question was flagged up 
                of how children, young people and their parents will know about 
                the strategies. I note that the minister is not minded to require 
                responsible bodies to publish their accessibility strategies and, 
                in fact, the bill requires local authorities only to be reactive 
                to requests to </P>

              <P>inspect the strategies. However, evidence to the committee suggested 
                strongly that a proactive approach to dissemination should be 
                considered, and I acknowledge the minister's comments on that 
                point. I would like her to consider how we might take such an 
                approach, as it would parallel the requirements in the Standards 
                in Scotland's Schools Act 2000 and could easily be achieved through 
                existing requirements on local authorities to produce summary 
                plans.</P>
              <P>There was also an issue about how those plans would connect with 
                other planning requirements. Incorporation of accessibility strategies 
                with existing plans would be very much in line with joined-up 
                government and joined-up policy and practice. I hope that the 
                guidance will make a clear recommendation that local authorities 
                and schools should link their accessibility strategies to their 
                existing requirements to provide annual statements of improvement 
                objectives and school development plans, both of which must already 
                address equal opportunities requirements. It would also seem sensible, 
                in the interests of integration, for those strategies to fit with 
                children's services plans. All of that would in consequence help 
                the monitoring and evaluation role that I highlighted.</P>
              <P>Many local authorities expressed concerns about their role in 
                supporting pre-school provision with partner providers, and the 
                difficulties of meeting the costs of adapting their properties 
                to the required standards. That was particularly the case where 
                voluntary and private sector businesses were involved. In his 
                oral evidence to the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, the 
                deputy minister stated that private and voluntary sector providers 
                of pre-school education that operate in partnership would not 
                be required to prepare accessibility strategies because they are 
                defined as service providers and are therefore subject to the 
                Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</P>
              <P>However, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the 
                committee were concerned that some implications of the bill might 
                discourage local authorities from partnership with multiple small 
                providers, and that they might in some way make it difficult for 
                the private and voluntary sectors to continue to make provision, 
                with the knock-on effect that there would be a lack of choice 
                for families. That would be in no one's interests and I am sure 
                that that is not the intention behind the bill. However, I trust 
                that the minister's interpretation is correct and that there is 
                no loophole that would lead to any reduction in pre-school provision&#151;particularly 
                on a partnership basis, which is very important&#151;especially 
                in rural areas.</P>
              <P>The SNP urges support for the general principles of the bill 
                and encourages the minister to note the concerns that were expressed

                That would ensure a meaningful, robust and useful addition to 
                disability legislation, which will be of real benefit to a number 
                of children throughout Scotland.</P>
              <P>15:52</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>On behalf 
                of the Conservatives, I am pleased to welcome the bill. We welcome 
                it because it aims to improve access to school education for pupils 
                who have disabilities and restores the right of parents to access 
                their children's records. Those are both laudable aims. However, 
                during early consideration we raised a number of issues that might 
                be dealt with at the next stage by amendment, or might be considered 
                by the Scottish Executive as being appropriate for guidance subsequent 
                to the bill's enactment.</P>
              <P>When the Education, Culture and Sport Committee took evidence, 
                a concern that came up time and again was the question of resources. 
                That has been touched on and I suspect that it will be mentioned 
                continually throughout every stage of the bill's passage. Resources 
                cannot be dealt with legislatively, but it is crucial that the 
                issue is considered when planning for the act's application. I 
                need only point to the application of the McCrone pay settlement 
                and how there is now great concern being expressed by local authorities 
                and other groups that the financial implications were not adequately 
                thought through. Many groups, such as mature teacher-training 
                entrants, music instructors, education advisers, educational psychologists 
                and rural local authorities signalled that there could be problems. 
                If we do not consider that while debating the impact of the bill&#151;how 
                it will be applied in regard to resources&#151;I will be concerned 
                that the good intention of the bill, which I have no doubt will 
                be supported throughout the chamber, will not be met. We must 
                listen to the points that have been made by the people who write 
                to us and lobby us. My colleague, Murdo Fraser, will pick up some 
                points on certain aspects of the bill in regard to disabilities.</P>
              <P>I turn to pupils' records. The right of parents to access their 
                children's records came about through Alex Fletcher's Education 
                (Scotland) Act 1980 and the consequent School Pupil Records (Scotland) 
                Regulations 1990. Unfortunately, as the minister said, the Data 
                Protection Act 1998, which covers paper records, removed that 
                right. It is notable that that issue was addressed in 2000 in 
                the House of Commons, but we are progressing the issue two years 
                later. I am pleased that the issue is at last being dealt with, 
                but it is to be regretted that it has taken so long, because evidence 
                shows that having lost the right of access to pupils' records, 
                parents began to </P>

              <P>encounter difficulty from local authorities in accessing the 
                records. Local authorities would say that the right was lost and 
                that they no longer had the duty to provide the information. Given 
                that local authorities had been giving information that was requested 
                by parents, it is highly regrettable that the authorities subsequently 
                fell back on a bureaucratic attitude and decided that they should 
                withhold that information.</P>
              <P><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>On pupils' 
                records, which form a minor part of the bill, there are two key 
                issues. One issue is confidentiality, which is important, and 
                the other issue is to do with correcting yet another drafting 
                mistake, of which there have been far too many. However, if Mr 
                Monteith has evidence about local authorities that are refusing 
                to give information, even during this interregnum, will he name 
                them so that we can consider why they are doing that?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>Certainly. I have no difficulty in saying 
                that the authority in question was Fife Council. I do not want 
                to go into more detail, because the matter is currently under 
                consideration. However, I flag up the issue as one that bears 
                further investigation. If that practice is found to be taking 
                place in a number of authorities, rather than its being possibly 
                only one case&#151;which might be an isolated case within a local 
                authority, rather than its being that authority's policy&#151;we 
                must frown upon that and draw it to people's attention.</P>
              <P>We welcome the changes in greater access for pupils who have 
                disabilities and in record of needs provision, but we think that 
                they are overdue. We are pleased to support the bill.</P>
              <P>15:57</P>
              <P><strong>Ian Jenkins (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD): </strong>The 
                motion is easy to support. I cannot imagine that anyone would 
                disagree with the bill's general principles, which seek to ensure 
                that responsible authorities will produce and implement strategies 
                to improve access to school education for pupils who have disabilities. 
                The bill also makes provision for parents' access to their children's 
                school records.</P>
              <P>The provision about parents' access to records is uncontroversial. 
                Brian Monteith introduced important evidence about that provision. 
                There was no adverse comment during the consultation period and 
                we support that provision without further comment.</P>
              <P>The establishment of accessibility strategies is a more significant 
                provision that should make a substantial difference to educational 
                opportunities for pupils in Scotland who suffer from a wide range 
                of disabilities and whose needs require more systematic and effective

              <P>previously been the case.</P>
              <P>The minister outlined the requirements for strategies to improve 
                the physical environments of the schools, the communication of 
                information to pupils and their parents, and&#151;which is important&#151;not 
                only physical access to schools, but access to the school curriculum. 
                Those provisions also extend in various regards to children who 
                are under school age.</P>
              <P>As I said, no one would quarrel with the bill's principles. However, 
                in the course of taking evidence, issues arose around those principles' 
                implementation in practice. First, there is a genuine problem 
                about financing of the bill's implementation. There is undoubtedly 
                concern that the physical adaptation of school buildings and the 
                additional human resources that will be required for the bill's 
                implementation will be extraordinarily difficult to quantify and 
                therefore difficult for the Executive and responsible bodies to 
                resource.</P>
              <P>The implementation of the strategies, for example, will involve 
                substantial professional development in teacher training and giving 
                disabled children access to the curriculum, and it will require 
                facilities for health support services and so on inside schools.</P>
              <P>In passing, I point to the particular problems of local authorities 
                that have large numbers of small rural schools that serve discrete 
                and sometimes isolated communities. Those authorities' cumulative 
                total of adaptation costs is potentially substantial and they 
                do not always have the critical mass that can draw together support.</P>
              <P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Mr Jenkins made a valid point about small 
                rural schools. Some authorities might regard those rural schools 
                as too expensive to continue in operation if the authorities cannot 
                meet the bill's requirements. We must consider that matter.</P>
              <P>There is also the issue of the large cost of adaptations for 
                particular children. For example, if an old primary school&#151;even 
                one that has many pupils&#151;needs a lift, that can sometimes 
                be an enormous cost and can lead to a need to change the building. 
                Consideration of that issue should make us realise that money 
                is at the root of the issue.</P>
              <P><strong>Ian Jenkins: </strong>I agree.</P>
              <P>In the long term, we do ourselves no favours if we gloss over 
                those genuine concerns because they relate to complicated and 
                sensitive issues that relate to the lives of individual pupils 
                and families. We must be wary of raising expectations, only to 
                frustrate the legitimate ambitions of young people. That is why 
                monitoring of the strategies is important. HMIE and the Scottish 
                Commission for the Regulation of Care will play an important role

              <P>in that.</P>
              <P>We have also addressed representations that the bill is unclear 
                about how differences would be resolved in the event of parental 
                or pupil dissatisfaction with a strategy or its implementation. 
                We have heard that the bill would be improved by the inclusion 
                of some appeals or mediation process. I hope that that can be 
                examined later.</P>
              <P>Criticism has been made of the lack of a time scale for implementation 
                of the bill's provisions and the strategies that are produced. 
                Again, we must strike a balance between idealism and realism. 
                I welcome the open and realistic tone of the minister's remarks. 
                We must recognise that the aspirations of the bill cannot be achieved 
                overnight or in the short term. We must also seek to ensure that 
                accessibility strategies are not nebulous documents that express 
                vague commitments. It is important that they are working documents 
                that move matters forward with a properly monitored, structured, 
                progressive and achievable programme.</P>
              <P>We are happy to endorse with enthusiasm the principles of the 
                bill. It is an important bill that seeks to improve the lives 
                of our children. In the long run, however, the bill's success 
                will be judged on how we put those principles into practice.</P>
              <P>16:02</P>
              <P><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab): </strong>My colleagues in the 
                Labour party and I have long held the belief that education is 
                the key to unlocking opportunity in later life. It is not the 
                privilege of the few but a fundamental and basic right for all 
                our children and young people. Access to schools and to the school 
                curriculum is critical if disabled children and young people are 
                to be helped to reach their full potential.</P>
              <P>The bill brings all those key principles together. It builds 
                on the recommendations of the disability rights task force and 
                at long last rectifies the glaring omission in the Disability 
                Discrimination Act 1995, which specifically exempted education 
                from its provisions.</P>
              <P>The central element of the bill is the duty it places on all 
                education authorities, grant-aided schools and independent schools 
                to produce and implement an accessibility strategy. Such strategies 
                are to do with improving access for all disabled pupils not only 
                to the school building but, of equal importance, to the school 
                curriculum. We need to remember that, for many children with a 
                learning disability or a sensory impairment, accessibility does 
                not stop at the provision of physical access. Indeed, during the 
                consultation at stage 1, concerns were expressed by the committee 
                that using terms such as &quot;in writing&quot; </P>

              <P>might be too narrowly interpreted and would exclude alternative 
                formats such as Braille. I am therefore particularly pleased and 
                reassured by the minister's response that an amendment will be 
                lodged by the Executive at stage 2 to ensure that the bill will 
                be truly inclusive and that the possibility of any misinterpretation 
                will be avoided.</P>
              <P>If we are to achieve the step change that we want in the experience 
                of disabled children in their school years, it is essential that 
                we have in place a robust mechanism of monitoring and evaluation. 
                Accessibility strategies will only ever be as good as their implementation. 
                We need to ensure that they are living, breathing documents rather 
                than ones that simply gather dust on a shelf. One way to do that 
                is to make an explicit linkage with schools' objectives for improvement 
                and development plans and children's services plans. With HMIE 
                routinely evaluating the quality of strategies and monitoring 
                their implementation, I believe that we will see a difference. 
                I ask ministers to consider that again before stage 2.</P>
              <P>Another issue that I ask ministers to reflect on before stage 
                2 is the view that we need some form of appeals mechanism when 
                an accessibility strategy fails to meet somebody's expectations 
                or fails to address reasonable needs. I hasten to say that I am 
                not attracted to a cumbersome and overly bureaucratic system, 
                but I ask ministers to consider independent mediation, which has 
                been used successfully in other areas and provides a swift and 
                effective response in the interests of the child.</P>
              <P>In conclusion, the principles of the bill have been warmly welcomed 
                by the Education, Culture and Sport Committee and by a variety 
                of statutory and voluntary organisations that have experience 
                and interest in the sector. Much more important, the bill will 
                be welcomed by parents and children as a critical step in ensuring 
                equality in education. It provides the opportunity to help to 
                unlock the potential in every child, irrespective of ability.</P>

                the consensus by warmly welcoming the bill. However, it is important 
                that what the bill can achieve is kept in context.</P>
              <P>As Jackie Baillie said, we should all cherish the right for any 
                child to have education. Sadly, over the years, many disabled

                found themselves left at the school gate as the school was not 
                suitable for them because of their disability. Anything that seeks 
                to end such discrimination against young people is welcome.</P>
              <P>I will refer to a couple of sections of the bill that require 
                clarification. Section 1(2)(b) refers to &quot;associated services&quot;. 
                It appears that that term is a reference to extra-curricular activities 
                that take place within the school campus. It is important to keep 
                in mind that schools can undertake extra-curricular activities 
                outwith the school campus, such as going to a museum. I am aware 
                that museums and other service providers are covered by the Disability 
                Discrimination Act 1995 and that it is difficult for the minister 
                to address the issue. However, we may need to put something in 
                guidance alongside the bill to ensure that when the section is 
                being interpreted it is clear that extra-curricular activities 
                outwith the school campus are also to be considered; when the 
                children go to the museum or elsewhere, a child who has a disability 
                should not be left behind because of a lack of suitable disabled 
                facilities.</P>
              <P>Like Jackie Baillie, I welcome the fact that the minister is 
                seeking at stage 2 to lodge an amendment to section 1(3) on alternative 
                formats for the provision of accessibility strategies.</P>
              <P>Section 4 makes provision for obtaining records and for those 
                who are providing the records to supply copies and</P>
              <P>&quot;to charge such fees as they think fit&quot;</P>
              <P>although it adds in brackets</P>
              <P>&quot;(not exceeding the cost of supply)&quot;.</P>
              <P>The Justice 1 Committee has been debating a similar issue in 
                relation to the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill. Concern 
                has been expressed that it may be much more costly to obtain such 
                records in an alternative format than it would be to get a photocopy 
                of the records. It is essential that disabled people are not put 
                off requesting the records in an alternative format. The minister 
                might want to reflect on the issue and consult her colleagues 
                who are dealing with the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill, 
                because we are anxious to ensure that a charging mechanism that 
                is introduced under that legislation also meets the needs of disabled 
                people and does not discriminate against them in terms of cost.</P>
              <P>I will mention a couple of wider issues. I welcome the fact that 
                the bill deals with access to school buildings and the curriculum. 
                Only yesterday, the Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care,

              <P>young people who require equipment to access facilities such 
                as schools. It is all very well for schools to have disabled access 
                provisions and to talk about access to the curriculum, but many 
                young disabled people cannot get the wheelchair that they require 
                to go to school. As an example, Playback mentioned a young girl 
                who had to wait for more than a year to get the right wheelchair 
                to go to school.</P>
              <P>If we are to make school buildings and the curriculum accessible, 
                we must ensure that service providers such as the national health 
                service meet the needs of young disabled people by providing them 
                with equipment that will allow them to use the facilities that 
                the bill will make available.</P>
              <P>I want to refer to the continuing problem that a number of local 
                authorities experience in relation to children with special educational 
                needs who are in facilities that are outwith their area. Local 
                authorities cannot accommodate all children in their area. During 
                a recent briefing by Falkirk Council, which a colleague attended, 
                the director of education highlighted the fact that the cost of 
                placing young people with special educational needs outwith the 
                local authority area has increased by 50 per cent in the past 
                year. That trend puts considerable pressure on local authorities 
                that are trying to meet the needs of disabled people who require 
                special educational establishments.</P>
              <P>Although I welcome the bill, we must ensure that there is proper 
                joined-up thinking and working in Government departments to ensure 
                that there is a proper package for disabled children, irrespective 
                of which school they attend or which local authority area the 
                school is in. I hope that the minister will take this opportunity 
                to ensure that there is a proper strategy for disabled children, 
                not one that covers only the curriculum and school buildings.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh (Eastwood) (Lab): </strong>I welcome the bill. 
                Although, considered in isolation, it addresses only one aspect 
                of educational need, it should be seen as one plank in a raft 
                of measures that are designed to improve equality of opportunity 
                in schools. The bill complements the Disability Discrimination 
                Act 1995 and stands alongside the presumption of mainstream education 
                that is in the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Act 2000 and 
                the work that is under way to revise and reform our record of 
                needs system.</P>
              <P>The immediate benefits of the bill should not be underestimated.

              <P>Dyslexia is often referred to as a hidden or invisible condition, 
                but it is nonetheless disabling. I had the pleasure of meeting 
                a dyslexia support group in my constituency and of listening to 
                a young man who spoke eloquently of his school experience. What 
                that obviously bright and able pupil said challenged my preconceptions 
                of how special educational needs are addressed in schools.</P>
              <P>I had always thought that primary schools were better than secondary 
                schools at offering a mainstream education to pupils with special 
                needs. Certainly, I believe that in some ways primary schools 
                offer a more inclusive and less disjointed educational environment 
                to their pupils than larger and more regimented high schools, 
                but the experience of the pupil whom I met contradicted my belief. 
                Despite his abilities, he found himself behind his peers at reading, 
                writing and spelling, which he found intensely frustrating. With 
                other dyslexic pupils, such frustration often finds its outlet 
                in disruptive behaviour, but in his case it led to low self-esteem, 
                a lack of self-confidence and a miserable school life. When he 
                moved to secondary school, his needs were recognised and, because 
                teachers no longer picked him up constantly about his spelling, 
                he flourished and excelled at his studies.</P>
              <P>To address effectively the type of problem that that pupil faced, 
                the importance of early diagnosis and assessment of need cannot 
                be underestimated. Those measures must be backed up by the implementation 
                of effective support. Most dyslexic pupils do not benefit from 
                a record of needs, but I hope that the Executive's warmly welcomed 
                consultation on that subject will tackle that gap.</P>
              <P>The bill will address many of the difficulties and frustrations 
                that are felt by dyslexic young people and their families in dealing 
                with schools and education authorities. The bill will address 
                both the powerlessness experienced by those families and the lack 
                of information that is available to them. I welcome the minister's 
                opening speech, which explicitly stated that the bill's provisions 
                are not limited to children with physical disabilities. However, 
                I ask the minister to confirm that the definition of disability 
                that is used in the bill&#151;</P>
              <P>&quot;a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial 
                and long-term adverse effect on&quot;</P>
              <P>a person's</P>
              <P>&quot;ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities&quot;&#151;</P>
              <P>will apply to children with dyslexia. It is my understanding 
                that it will and that the bill therefore gives pupils and parents 
                a new power and a new method by which to demand equal treatment 
                at school.</P>

              <P>consulting pupils and families when they draw up their disability 
                strategies provides an avenue through which awareness of the needs 
                of dyslexic pupils can be raised. The details concerning the way 
                in which parents will be involved and the complaints or appeals 
                procedure to underpin those rights and responsibilities will have 
                to be spelled out in more detail at stage 2. Nonetheless, those 
                developments are very welcome.</P>
              <P>Although the bill is important in its own right, it must be supported 
                by other measures and not just by legislation. Training for teachers 
                of young people with dyslexia and many other pupils with special 
                needs who want to enjoy a mainstream education is a priority. 
                The need for teacher training was highlighted by one of the two 
                parents who responded to the consultation on the bill, and that 
                chimes with my own experience.</P>
              <P>I hope that the bill will mark a further step towards achieving 
                our aim of increasing accessibility to our school system. It should 
                help young people with a range of needs to develop to their full 
                potential, enriching both their lives and the lives of those around

                a committee amendment at stage 2 because we felt that the failure 
                to include portable buildings would discriminate against Gypsy 
                Traveller children, who are already excluded from education, as 
                we pointed out in an earlier report. It would also discriminate 
                against children in the settled community, as some schools have 
                portable buildings in use on their grounds for many years We welcome 
                the commitment to cover those buildings in the accessibility provisions.</P>
              <P>We also welcome the move towards Executive guidance on accessible 
                formats and the statement that &quot;in writing&quot; automatically

                preferred formats. I hope that the Executive will bear that offer 
                in mind. I also hope that the Executive's guidance is the first 
                step towards a coherent strategy for accessible formats for the 
                public sector in Scotland and something that will be automatically 
                adopted in future legislation. We have had to amend recent legislation 
                because that issue was not taken into account.</P>
              <P>Nonetheless, there are some issues that I feel have not been 
                addressed today or in the letter from the deputy minister and 
                I would be grateful if he could address them in summing up. In 
                section 3(1)(b), the consultation criterion remains &quot;as they 
                think fit&quot;. The Equal Opportunities Committee felt that that 
                should be deleted from the bill and that the Executive should 
                set a minimum standard for adequate consultation. I would welcome 
                the minister's comments on that in his summing up.</P>
              <P>I ask the minister&#151;as Jackie Baillie did&#151;to address 
                the concern that it is not clear how the Executive will ensure 
                that responsible bodies will be pursued if they fail to develop 
                and implement appropriate strategies. I also ask him to say why 
                there seems to be no support from the Executive for a simplified 
                appeals system to deal with both special educational needs and 
                disabilities.</P>
              <P>Finally, will the minister inform us of the Executive's intention 
                to change current guidance on quality indicators in &quot;How 
                good is our school?&quot; in the light of the bill, because changes 
                will obviously have to be made?</P>
              <P>I hope that I do not sound too negative about the bill, because 
                I think that the Executive has gone a long way to addressing the 
                concerns that the Equal Opportunities Committee and many organisations 
                that campaign for rights for disabled children in Scotland raised. 
                My comments are in no way meant to deflect from the laudable intent 
                of the bill, which the Equal Opportunities Committee warmly welcomes.</P>

              <P>aspect of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. We also acknowledge 
                that pupil records issues need to be addressed. The bill combines 
                two issues that have been missed for a considerable time.</P>
              <P>As Irene McGugan said, we would like responses on key issues 
                that the committee identified. We specifically want responses 
                on how we integrate accessibility with the general issue of planning 
                and developing buildings in the first place. That is worth exploring.</P>
              <P>The second big concern is how effective the complaints procedure 
                will be, because there might be circumstances in which the parents 
                also suffer from the disability of the children. Again, we should 
                maximise the opportunity for information to be explained and for 
                parents to be involved.</P>
              <P>Michael Matheson identified the grey area of associated services 
                and the links that need to be made within social work, health 
                and education services to identify those that are exempt at present 
                and how to bring them broadly within the framework.</P>
              <P>There is still concern in the committee about how we proactively 
                disseminate information. Further explanation for stage 2 would 
                be welcome and would satisfy committee members and those who have 
                written to us and to other MSPs about that issue. Children in 
                Scotland has identified other issues that are worth exploring.</P>
              <P>The process is continuing. We are having a debate about what 
                we think are accessibility strategies. Such strategies are different 
                from what they would have been two, three or 10 years ago and 
                will be different three, five or 10 years from now. There is a 
                lot of space for identifying how language is used within the framework 
                of the legislation to make it more flexible. Jackie Baillie has 
                had experience in the field and raised the question of how we 
                continue to monitor, review and act on that. That is welcome.</P>
              <P>I do not totally agree with Mike Russell and that might come 
                as a shock to him, but we are on much safer ground here&#151;at 
                least this is not a Sewel motion, which we have been animated 
                about in the chamber before. I welcome the fact that we sought 
                legislation because, although the matter could have been addressed 
                by a Sewel motion, it is more appropriately addressed by a bill, 
                given the impact on devolved matters.</P>
              <P>We have to have the resources to support the bill, but we also 
                have to change mindsets, which we are continuing to challenge. 
                We can have a spanking new investment, but if we have not consulted 
                the users who experience it, we will not get the maximum benefit 
                from it. We have to ensure that we engage in consultation with

              <P><strong>Murdo Fraser (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>I reiterate 
                Brian Monteith's comment that the Scottish Conservatives welcome 
                the bill.</P>
              <P>I will make two brief points on disability strategies, both of 
                which relate to the question of costs. A number of members, including 
                Ian Jenkins, referred to the costs involved in first drawing up 
                and then implementing a strategy and to the burden that those 
                costs would put on education authorities. I trust that the deputy 
                minister will address that question when he winds up. Ian Jenkins 
                also made a good point about the impact that such costs might 
                have on small rural schools.</P>
              <P>A related issue is that of the costs for independent schools. 
                I have an interest in independent schools, not because I went 
                to an independent school but because I believe in freedom of choice 
                for parents. In an area such as Perth and Kinross, which falls 
                within the Mid Scotland and Fife region, independent schools are 
                an important part of the local economy. They directly employ around 
                700 people and indirectly support many other jobs in the community.</P>
              <P>The Minister for Education and Young People is aware that I have 
                been in correspondence with her on the subject of the impact of 
                disability strategies on independent schools&#151;in fact, this 
                week she wrote to me on that very topic. Not so long ago, the 
                Labour party had a policy of opposing independent schools, but 
                I trust that we are in a new age and in more enlightened times. 
                I also want to mention the situation of independent schools that 
                are grant aided, such as specialist schools for the deaf and the 
                blind.</P>
              <P>Independent schools often find themselves in a difficult economic 
                position. In Perth and Kinross over the past two years, Croftinloan 
                School in Pitlochry has closed and Rannoch School has come under 
                pressure. There is a misconception that independent schools are 
                dripping in wealth. Extra burdens that are put upon them could

              <P>The briefing from the Scottish Parliament information centre 
                refers to correspondence from the bursar of Fettes College&#151;the 
                alma mater of the Labour Prime Minister&#151;in which concern 
                was expressed about the</P>
              <P>&quot;potential financial consequences of adequately resourcing 
                disability access strategies.&quot;</P>
              <P>The Executive estimates that the cost of drawing up a strategy 
                will be 8,400. In itself, that is not a substantial sum, but 
                it all adds up. The cost of implementing a strategy is of more 
                concern. For example, the costs could be very high for a boarding 
                school.</P>
              <P>The bursar of Fettes College referred to the problems associated 
                with listed buildings, which could involve substantial costs. 
                For some listed buildings, such as Fettes College or George Heriot's 
                School, the alterations that would be required to comply with 
                a disability strategy would be extremely expensive, if not impossible 
                to meet. There is concern in the independent school sector about 
                those issues and I ask the deputy minister to respond to them 
                when he winds up the debate.</P>
              <P>I conclude by welcoming the bill, which will promote equal access 
                to schools for pupils with disabilities.</P>
              <P>16:28</P>
              <P><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I also shall 
                be brief. There is overwhelming unanimity in the chamber about 
                the bill. We are now into discussions about the detail of how 
                the bill will proceed through stages 2 and 3.</P>
              <P>I am glad to have the support of Frank McAveety on the issue 
                of Sewel motions. It was quite a relief to have his support, although 
                that was an unusual event. The bill is an example of why Sewel 
                motions should be used sparingly, although the subject matter 
                could have been dealt with through the use of a Sewel motion. 
                By introducing the bill, not only has the Executive given the 
                chamber an opportunity to debate the issues and members an opportunity 
                to lodge amendments, but it has given civic Scotland and individuals 
                an opportunity to make representations and to be heard. That could 
                not have happened if the matter had been dealt with through the 
                use of a Sewel motion. The bill is a good example of legislation 
                that should go through the parliamentary process, although that 
                may take time and effort. The Executive should not deal with such 
                matters by giving away our right to legislate.</P>
              <P>Three key issues in the bill have clearly emerged during the 
                debate: demand; will and intention to meet that demand; and resources 
                to underpin the ability to meet that demand. I </P>

              <P>commend the minister on her speech, much of which I agree with. 
                However, I believe that she underestimates the demand that will 
                exist. By definition, parents of children who have special educational 
                needs are usually very involved in their children's education 
                and acutely aware of the difficulties that their children have.</P>
              <P>I suspect that the bill, which will be warmly welcomed, will 
                also mean that parents have very high expectations from early 
                on. Although it will be necessary to phase in the support that 
                is available, let us not alienate parents by doing so in a way 
                that appears to be penny-pinching. I am glad that the detail of 
                the finance indicates that money that is additional to the 9 
                million is available. There will be significant financial demands 
                on the public purse for schools. Mr Jenkins has indicated some 
                of those.</P>
              <P>A considerable amount of work is required to make a building 
                or buildings suitable once a strategy has been produced. I mentioned 
                a lift in a primary school that I know. Many other schools&#151;perhaps 
                those that have old buildings&#151;will require considerable adaptation. 
                I hope that when the deputy minister responds, he will take on 
                board the fact that demand will be considerable.</P>
              <P>Teachers and those who run the schools must have the will to 
                make sure that the bill works. By and large, that will is there. 
                The minister was absolutely right to say that mainstreaming cannot 
                be imposed on schools. I was a member of the Education, Culture 
                and Sport Committee that undertook a report on special educational 
                needs. Mainstreaming is a hope, an encouragement and a way in 
                which we want people to look at education. However, it cannot 
                be a demand, because children are all different and schools are 
                all different.</P>
              <P>Teachers must be helped to understand how mainstreaming works. 
                For some children it will never work; for others it will work 
                very well. We must proselytise for the bill within schools, to 
                persuade teachers to take the chances and make the extra effort 
                that will enable children to go into schools, to mainstream and 
                to have the facilities in those schools that they need.</P>
              <P>If we can understand the demand, if we can recognise the need 
                to create the will within schools and if we can provide the resources, 
                the bill will make a huge difference over a period of time.</P>
              <P>Unfortunately, the issue of pupil records represents another 
                example of bad drafting somewhere else producing a problem that 
                requires resolution by the Parliament. That has become something 
                of a hobby-horse of mine, and the deputy minister has suffered 
                as a result of that in committee. We must look seriously at drafting.

                need. That has been the nature of the debate and I am sure that 
                it will be the nature of the stage 2 proceedings. I ask the Executive 
                to keep it that way. Let us be constructive about the bill and 
                let us not stand on our dignity on the drafting of amendments. 
                I support the bill.</P>

              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Education and Young People (Nicol 
                Stephen): </strong>I would like to continue the constructive tone. 
                I agree with Michael Russell's final remarks about the spirit 
                in which the bill has been debated so far. We have already signalled 
                important changes that we intend to bring forward at stage 2. 
                I hope that, as a consequence of following up on some of the remarks 
                that have been made in the debate, we might bring forward further 
                amendments or be prepared to make commitments in relation to guidance 
                or regulations.</P>
              <P>I welcome the support of Irene McGugan on behalf of the SNP and 
                of Brian Monteith on behalf of the Conservative party. I also 
                welcome the enthusiastic support of Ian Jenkins. I agree with 
                him and the other speakers who said that the accessibility strategies 
                must be living, working, effective documents that make a difference.</P>
              <P>Michael Matheson made a particularly worthwhile contribution. 
                In relation to his comments on associated services and museums, 
                I want to reiterate and develop the points that I made in committee. 
                The phrase &quot;associated services&quot; covers planning for 
                school trips and other activities outside school. However, school 
                trips are normally planned by individual schools and, to comply 
                with the DDA, they should take into account the needs that any 
                individual child may have.</P>
              <P><strong>Dr Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands) (SNP): </strong>Will the 
                minister give way?</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I shall, but let me just finish.</P>

              <P>Schools should take reasonable steps to ensure that such children 
                can participate fully in school trips. For example, schools cannot 
                force a museum to be accessible, but as museums are already subject 
                to the DDA, they should be accessible to all those with disabilities.</P>
              <P>I am happy to give way now.</P>
              <P><strong>Dr Ewing: </strong>Should accessibility strategies always include 
                deaf children who do not attend schools for the deaf?</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Yes, of course. To answer Dr Ewing's question, 
                let me say that I was pleased that contributors to the debate&#151;especially 
                Jackie Baillie&#151;stressed that the bill's purpose is to provide 
                children who have physical disabilities not only with access to 
                school buildings but with access to the curriculum. The bill also 
                provides for children who have non-physical disabilities and for 
                the wide range of disabilities that individuals might face in 
                the course of their education. The bill is not only about installing 
                lifts and ramps.</P>
              <P>Irene McGugan, Jackie Baillie and Ian Jenkins asked about the 
                power to complain and the power to appeal and about the opportunity 
                for mediation. Parents can complain and will have access to the 
                conciliation and mediation that is provided by the Disability 
                Rights Commission under the DDA. Such mediation is also provided 
                separately under the special educational needs framework, for 
                which the Parliament is responsible. As members will know, we 
                are examining whether we need to review the record of needs and 
                whether there is a need for mediation. The bill's aim is not to 
                set up a new or separate mediation or appeal framework but to 
                ensure that a strategic approach is taken so that schools and 
                authorities have a responsibility to plan for accessibility.</P>
              <P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>The minister has highlighted the link 
                between the bill and the record of needs legislation, of which 
                he has acknowledged that radical reform is needed. Can he indicate 
                the Executive's time scale for reforming the record of needs legislation?</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The short answer is no. I cannot give such 
                an indication today. Announcements on legislative proposals are 
                made as part of the full legislative programme that is announced 
                by the First Minister. However, having conducted the review of 
                the record of needs, we are keen that legislation should be introduced 
                in due course. I am sure that those of us who take a close interest 
                in such matters will continue to press to ensure that that takes 
                place soon.</P>
              <P>Kate Maclean remarked on the words &quot;as they think fit&quot;, 
                which appear in section 3(1)(b) of the bill. The people who should 
                be consulted have not been listed in the bill because it is difficult

                cover. In our view, to list those who should be consulted would 
                be to constrain the responsible bodies.</P>
              <P>It is intended that guidance will specify which groups should 
                be consulted as a minimum. Under the Standards in Scotland's Schools 
                etc Act 2000, education authorities have a duty to take into account 
                the views of children and young people. However, following on 
                from today's debate, we will examine the issue closely and examine 
                what words need to be in the guidance. We shall try to ensure 
                that the committee is happy with our proposals.</P>
              <P><strong>Irene McGugan: </strong>Will the minister take an intervention?</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I would be happy to take one final intervention.</P>
              <P><strong>Irene McGugan: </strong>I very much appreciate the minister's giving 
                way. Will he clarify what he said a moment ago about the avenues 
                for redress that are available under different statutes? How will 
                that work? How would someone who complains or seeks satisfaction 
                under the terms of this bill obtain redress under the terms of 
                another piece of legislation, such as the special educational 
                needs legislation or the DDA? Is that viable and sensible?</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>That is an issue that we debate often. 
                All of us are anxious to ensure that there is as much consistency 
                as possible between the disability legislation and the special 
                educational needs legislation. Some may feel that, ideally, the 
                two would be integrated. However, we have a large volume of disability 
                legislation and a significant volume of special educational needs 
                legislation. Different Parliaments are responsible for that legislation 
                and there are complexities even within that. We have seen that 
                today, with the disability legislation that was set by the UK 
                Parliament having to be discussed in the context of the Scottish 
                Parliament.</P>
              <P>We all have to work together to make legislative proposals work 
                effectively. As far as we can, we will, in the review of special 
                educational needs legislation, work to ensure that the approach 
                is more seamless. However, there will continue to be different 
                acts of Parliament on these subjects on the statute book.</P>
              <P>This bill is about planning for all pupils in Scotland who have 
                a disability&#151;whether it is a physical or a mental impairment 
                and whether they need relatively minor additional support or whether 
                they have complex needs and require 24-hour care. Whatever a person's 
                disability, this bill is of importance to them.</P>

              <P>their school or nursery school. They need to be able to learn 
                in different ways, to receive extra support from school staff 
                and to be able to use information technology and computers or 
                other alternative formats in order to access information. This 
                bill is about challenging the ways in which education is delivered.</P>
              <P>It is very important that we do not forget about attitudes. It 
                does not cost anything&#151;except perhaps people's time&#151;to 
                promote positive attitudes to diversity among staff and pupils. 
                Such changes in culture may take time, but pupils will not benefit 
                from their education if they do not feel welcome in a school, 
                if they are bullied or if they are made to feel like outsiders. 
                Legislation alone will not change that. Many schools and teachers 
                are already doing good work on this and are teaching children 
                about disability as part of the curriculum. However, we have to 
                do more and we have to offer more encouragement. I believe that 
                this Parliament and this bill will play an important role in that.</P>
              <P>The mistake that has led to the pupils' records element of the 
                bill has already been referred to. It dates back to the Data Protection 
                Act&#151;of 1998, Mr Russell. I agree that it is unfortunate whenever 
                there is a legislative mistake. We are taking steps to remedy 
                the problem. We all agree that the sooner those steps can be taken 
                the better.</P>
              <P>I feel that the chamber is united on this bill. Both parts of 
                the bill are necessary and timely and I ask the Parliament to 
                support it today.</P>

                in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, on the rail link to 
                Edinburgh airport. The debate will be concluded without any question

              <P><em>Motion debated,</em></P>
              <P>That the Parliament notes that the Strategic Rail Authority's 
                10-year plan includes a study into potential improvements in rail 
                access to Scottish airports and that in Edinburgh options range 
                from a new airport station on the nearby main rail route, with 
                a shuttle into the airport, to a new tunnelled main line and station 
                under the heart of the airport; further notes that either station 
                could provide for further integration and stimulate economic activity, 
                and, in the light of the recent decision by Her Majesty's Government 
                to place Railtrack into administration which has cast considerable 
                doubt and uncertainty on the willingness of the private sector 
                to fund such investment, calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
                outline how such a link could be financed in the best interests 
                of Edinburgh and Scotland.</P>

              <P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I am glad 
                that both the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong 
                Learning and the Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and 
                Lifelong Learning are here for the debate. It is an indication 
                of the high priority that the subject is given.</P>
              <P>Edinburgh is one of the great capitals of Europe. Through its 
                international festival, it attracts visitors from all over the 
                world. As one of Europe's great cities, it makes sense that Edinburgh 
                should have an effective, high-quality rail link to its airport. 
                If I were an MSP for the West of Scotland, I would make exactly 
                the same case for Glasgow&#151;indeed that case is extremely persuasive.</P>
              <P>In today's Glasgow <em>Evening Times</em>, Dr Malcolm Reed, the 
                director general of Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive, 
                made a plea for the Glasgow link to be brought forward and Glasgow 
                City Council transport supremo, Councillor Alistair Watson, was 
                quoted as saying:</P>
              <P>&quot;I welcome support for a rail link ... a rail link to the 
                airport is essential&quot;.</P>
              <P>Tonight I speak as an unrepentant Edinburgh patriot. I lament 
                the lack of a high-quality rail link to the capital's airport, 
                especially when almost every other European centre of population 
                appears to be better served than our own. Copenhagen, Zurich, 
                Amsterdam, Barcelona and Munich all have superb public transport 
                facilities to and from their airports&#151;and so should Edinburgh.

              <P>the provision of a rail link is broadly based. The Confederation 
                of British Industry and the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce support 
                the principle. VisitScotland has said that such infrastructure 
                fits with its</P>
              <P>&quot;core concern of value for money and quality of the experience.&quot;</P>
              <P>Edinburgh is one of the fastest-growing capitals in Europe, with 
                a population approaching 500,000. The enlarged airport carries 
                almost 7 million passengers per year. The increase in passenger 
                numbers last year was not far off 10 per cent. First impressions 
                can count and for many people, Edinburgh airport is their first 
                experience of Scotland. Therefore, the airport is vital for our 
                economy, inward investment, tourism and jobs. It will be a lasting 
                memory for those who come for the first time and those who will 
                return.</P>
              <P>Recently, the airport underwent redevelopment worth more than 
                100 million. The facilities offered to passengers were expanded 
                and improved. As I mentioned, that investment has led to a steady 
                and sustained increase in passenger numbers in the past four years.</P>
              <P>The growing importance of Edinburgh and its airport must be matched 
                with the pursuit of excellence in establishing the best possible 
                rail infrastructure from the airport to the city centre. A rail 
                link would increase passenger choice and could allow a real reduction 
                in car congestion on the western perimeter of Edinburgh. Indeed, 
                a rail link could have a far greater influence on reducing traffic 
                congestion in Edinburgh than any city entry tolls.</P>
              <P>Current plans are insufficient. The west of Edinburgh guided 
                busways scheme&#151;WEBS&#151;stops short at Edinburgh Park and 
                does not offer a congestion-free alternative for access to the 
                airport or for other employers in the west of Edinburgh. The Strategic 
                Rail Authority's strategic plan promises no new funds in the short 
                to medium term. The significant effort and expense put into the 
                city of Edinburgh rapid transit scheme has ended in disappointment.</P>
              <P>In February, the Executive claimed that it was too early to say 
                how the abandonment of CERT would affect a link to the airport. 
                However, in June 1998, I received a letter from Henry McLeish 
                stating that CERT</P>
              <P>&quot;further reduces the viability of a rail link&quot;.</P>
              <P>Now that the CERT scheme will not proceed, the case for a rail 
                link to the airport is much stronger. I request that the Executive 
                should act as a catalyst to draw in the private sector, with a 
                view to solving the problem. New funding possibilities undoubtedly 
                exist.</P>

                causing an immense uplift in land value for companies, businesses, 
                owners and others around railway lines and rail stations. Speed

                value of employment and property in close proximity to the link&#151;that 
                is not to mention economies of scale. The uplift in value has 
                been enormous. The uplift in land value around the 10 stations 
                on the Jubilee line extension in London has been estimated at 
                13.5 billion, which is more than three times the capital value

              <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Enterprise, Transport 
                and Lifelong Learning, Wendy Alexander, is reported in today's 
                <em>Edinburgh Evening News</em> as saying that she regards links 
                to Edinburgh and Glasgow as a high priority. I appeal to both 
                ministers, as fair-minded people with a capacity to absorb radical, 
                new ideas, to recognise the importance to our nation of the Administration's 
                taking a lead in working with interested parties&#151;including 
                key transport users&#151;to find a way forward for Edinburgh and 
                Glasgow. That would be to the advantage of employment prospects 
                in Scotland, business competitiveness and tourist convenience 
                and would be of maximum assistance to employees in the public 
                sector and the private sector.</P>

                Scotland.</P>
              <P>16:53</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>As is customary, 
                I congratulate Lord James Douglas-Hamilton on securing the debate. 
                The issue is fundamental, not just for the city of Edinburgh and 
                the east of Scotland, but for all Scotland. Passenger statistics 
                show that 12.5 per cent of passengers at Edinburgh airport come 
                from Fife and 25 per cent of passengers come from north of the 
                Forth. Everybody is aware that Glasgow airport is&#151;unfortunately&#151;situated 
                on the wrong side of the city for many who seek to use it. Perhaps 
                by accident rather than by design, Edinburgh is becoming Scotland's 
                national airport. Cognisance must be taken of that.</P>
              <P>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton is right to say that we need less 
                sympathy and more action and that, although we have had an indication 
                of movement from the minister, we need to know when, how and by 
                whom. Investment in a rail link to the airport would not just 
                add to the airport's position as an international gateway, but 
                would help to take business from the north of England.</P>
              <P>Only 10 years ago, Stansted had a rail link built at public expense&#151;it 
                was paid for in the old British Rail days. When the link was built, 
                Stansted had </P>

              <P>fewer passengers than Edinburgh or Glasgow. Now, Stansted airport 
                almost has more passengers than Edinburgh and Glasgow airports 
                put together. That shows what can be achieved by building a rail 
                link.</P>
              <P>A rail link is fundamental to boosting the airport, but it is 
                also about infrastructure investment for the whole of Scotland. 
                As I mentioned, it is not just about Edinburgh or the east of 
                Scotland; it is about what else can be done. If we take the visionary 
                view that has been proposed by some within ScotRail and others 
                to loop the current Edinburgh to Glasgow line through Dalmeny 
                and into the Fife line, not only would there be the opportunity&#151;albeit 
                with the requirement to build a tunnel&#151;to link the airport 
                terminal to the line, there would be other knock-on effects. It 
                would prevent the perennial difficulties that ScotRail and Railtrack 
                have at the Winchburgh tunnel and the Newbridge viaduct, where 
                there is either perpetual flooding or a speed restriction. By 
                looping the line we would open up access to the airport not simply 
                from the east, but from the north, west and south. There would 
                be an add-on benefit for the existing Edinburgh to Bathgate line, 
                because if the line was looped in that way, more trains and more 
                capacity would be available for the Bathgate to Edinburgh line, 
                and the service could go from two trains an hour to four trains 
                an hour. We must consider that visionary loop.</P>
              <P>It should also be made clear that building a rail link to Edinburgh 
                airport would not necessarily be at the cost of building a rail 
                link to Glasgow airport. Both must go together. If, as a society, 
                we seek to be considerably visionary, we should build both links. 
                Building both links should not mean that we cannot have a direct 
                connection from Edinburgh airport to Glasgow airport. If a rail 
                link was built, and if the relevant steps were taken to make cross-Glasgow 
                traffic possible, it should be possible to go from Glasgow airport 
                to Edinburgh airport without requiring to change train. That would 
                benefit not just Edinburgh airport, but Glasgow airport. Indeed, 
                it could be argued that coming into Glasgow airport on an intercontinental 
                flight then going on an outbound flight, whether to Scandinavia 
                or elsewhere, from Edinburgh airport, would be no more difficult&#151;and 
                may be quicker and less hassle&#151;than going from Heathrow terminal 
                1 to Heathrow terminal 4.</P>
              <P>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton is quite correct to raise this issue, 
                but at the end of the day we need less spin and sympathy from 
                the Executive. We need a commitment to build the rail link, which 
                would be a fundamental factor not just in growing Edinburgh airport 
                and the economy of the city of Edinburgh, but in boosting the 
                economy of the whole of Scotland in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.</P>

              <P><strong>Bristow Muldoon (Livingston) (Lab): </strong>There is much that 
                I agree with in Lord James Douglas-Hamilton's motion. I congratulate 
                him on bringing the issue before the Parliament today. There was 
                also much in Kenny MacAskill's speech with which I agree. The 
                one issue in the motion on which I do not agree with Lord James 
                Douglas-Hamilton&#151;I note that he did not address it in his 
                speech&#151;is the reference to Railtrack. I suspect that that 
                reference has more to do with satisfying some of the ideologues 
                in his group&#151;such as David McLetchie, Murdo Fraser and Brian 
                Monteith, who were surrounding him when he delivered his speech&#151;than 
                with representing what Lord James really believes.</P>
              <P>The common ground is that the development of a rail link to Edinburgh 
                airport would be welcome and would assist not only the economy 
                of Edinburgh, but the economies of West Lothian and many other 
                parts of Scotland, as Lord James Douglas-Hamilton and Kenny MacAskill 
                mentioned. The link would ease congestion in and out of Edinburgh, 
                in particular around the Gyle and Maybury areas.</P>
              <P>Before I expand on that point, I will address the part of the 
                motion that Lord James did not address, and that is the question 
                of Railtrack. If Railtrack had continued to operate in the manner 
                in which it was operating, there would have been no possibility 
                of developing a rail link to Edinburgh airport unless the Government 
                had been prepared to provide a blank cheque to Railtrack. In future 
                rail debates, it would be helpful if Conservative members acknowledged 
                what a complete failure Railtrack was, whether we are talking 
                about investment to expand the industry, investment in maintenance 
                and safety, or Railtrack's operation as a financially sound organisation.</P>
              <P>I will now address the rail link. A rail link is back on the 
                agenda because of the Strategic Rail Authority, which was established 
                by the UK Labour Government, and the work that the Scottish Executive 
                is doing in partnership with the SRA to develop the proposal. 
                I give credit to the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong 
                Learning, Wendy Alexander, for the role that she has played in 
                placing the issue high up the political agenda. I am sure that 
                Lewis Macdonald, when he responds to the debate, will reiterate 
                that fact.</P>
              <P>As many members have acknowledged, the proposal would have many 
                benefits. It would reduce congestion in and around Edinburgh, 
                give an economic boost to the airport and many of the communities 
                that surround it and contribute to the Executive's environmental 
                aims by reducing reliance on private cars for travel to and from 
                Edinburgh. We must recognise&#151;as Kenny MacAskill did&#151;that

              <P>We must look beyond links with Edinburgh and consider the whole 
                of central Scotland's transport network. If I may be so bold, 
                I suggest that we should consider ensuring a rail link between 
                Livingston and the airport, as well as between Edinburgh and the 
                airport. That would ease Livingston Football Club's transport 
                arrangements for the European adventures on which I hope it will 
                embark next season.</P>
              <P>We should take full advantage of the proximity of Edinburgh airport 
                to the main Glasgow to Edinburgh rail line. Developments involving 
                that could link Edinburgh airport by rail to Fife, Glasgow, Falkirk 
                and west Lothian, as well as Edinburgh, by the construction of 
                a loop that links with the main line or by the establishment of 
                a station on the current line, which would be linked to the terminal 
                through a shuttle service similar to those that operate at other 
                airports, such as that linking Gatwick airport's terminals.</P>
              <P>I give my full and unequivocal support to the proposal to provide 
                a rail link between Edinburgh airport and the city of Edinburgh. 
                I congratulate the Executive on the work that it has done and 
                I hope that the project will come to fruition in due course.</P>

              <P><strong>Mrs Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West) (LD): </strong>I apologise 
                to my colleagues for entering the debate late.</P>
              <P>I welcome the debate and the Executive's recent announcement 
                of a feasibility study into airport links, following the publication 
                of the Strategic Rail Authority's 10-year plan. The study, led 
                by the Executive in partnership with Scottish Enterprise, BAA 
                and the SRA, will investigate options for direct rail links and 
                is due in September.</P>
              <P>That approach highlights the fact that links to Edinburgh airport 
                and to Glasgow airport are strategic matters that are of interest 
                to the whole of Scotland. Statistics show that 66 per cent of 
                passengers who leave Edinburgh airport do not travel to central 
                Edinburgh. They travel elsewhere in Scotland, which stresses the 
                city's gateway status.</P>
              <P>It is worth noting that Edinburgh airport has enjoyed a 50 per 
                cent growth in passenger numbers in the past five years. Edinburgh&#151;particularly 
                its western edge&#151;is enjoying a period of great economic growth. 
                We could be said to be victims of that success, because traffic 
                congestion and the level of car ownership have increased greatly.

                others choices between modern public transport systems. That would 
                encourage a shift from the private car.</P>
              <P>Any discussion about support for a heavy rail option is premature 
                in advance of the feasibility study, which will be published in 
                September, but we can scope out the options that should be covered. 
                I raised the matter several times with Sarah Boyack when she was 
                the minister responsible for transport and I will meet Lewis Macdonald 
                soon to discuss it and a range of transport issues that affect 
                Edinburgh. I have also discussed the issue with the City of Edinburgh 
                Council, Edinburgh airport's management, BAA and the Edinburgh 
                and Lothians Tourist Board. Everyone supports the general principle, 
                particularly as we are all keen on the continued expansion of 
                routes into Edinburgh airport and on the city's economic growth.</P>
              <P>Until recently, it was planned that the CERT light rail option 
                would have a terminus at the airport, and people's comments were 
                partly based on that plan. The fall of those proposals means that 
                other options must be considered. Several options exist, but the 
                status quo is not one of them. The motion covers two other options. 
                An underground station at the airport would be the most attractive 
                for integration into the existing network and would take passengers 
                into the heart of the airport, but it could cost up to 300 million 
                and would involve tunnelling under runways. Taking a spur from 
                the east coast main line to Turnhouse for a bus link would be 
                less expensive and is also possible. The reopening of Ratho station, 
                which was closed in the 1960s, has also been suggested. Bristow 
                Muldoon covered the loop suggestion.</P>
              <P>I am delighted that we will shortly have a new station at Edinburgh 
                Park, which is successful but highly congested. I have called 
                for ScotRail to stop some Edinburgh-Glasgow trains there, to ease 
                congestion and to serve the 15,000 people who work there and the 
                thousands who drive to Glasgow each day from the west of Edinburgh.</P>
              <P>Another option that should be examined is some kind of high-speed, 
                light-rail link to Edinburgh Park. That would form a link to the 
                new station and to the proposed west of Edinburgh guided busways, 
                or WEBS system, which has just been given 6.5 million from the 
                Executive's public transport fund.</P>
              <P>It is essential that the study examine the engineering feasibility 
                of all of those and other options as well as the financial viability 
                and the opportunity costs of any scheme. If a scheme were to be 
                funded by the Executive, the SRA or other sources, we would have 
                to be sure that it represented the best use of scarce public resources 
                in a way that improved the economic, </P>

                option. Some of the suggestions that I have heard this evening 
                need to be examined.</P>
              <P>I am sure that, having had experience of Government, Lord James 
                Douglas-Hamilton cannot expect the Executive to declare its intent 
                tonight. That brings me to my final point, which is a question 
                to Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, who has been the local MP for 
                Edinburgh West for more than two decades, in which we have had 
                18 years of Tory Government. If he is so supportive of the issue, 
                and he believes that the option is the best use of anything up 
                to 200 million of taxpayer's money, will he explain why Edinburgh 
                has no rail link to its airport and why the city has no integrated 
                transport system?</P>
              <P>17:06</P>
              <P><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>I thank Lord James 
                Douglas-Hamilton for raising such an important issue. I also want 
                to thank him on a personal level. In view of the fact that the 
                chronic pain patients could not attend a debate on a Thursday 
                evening, Lord James swapped with me. That was a gracious, consensual 
                gesture on his part, for which I thank him.</P>
              <P>In Edinburgh, and indeed in Glasgow, passengers arrive on the 
                latest jets. They see the airport strewn with other beautiful 
                jet-liners. They enter modern terminal buildings, of which we 
                are proud. Suddenly, they emerge from the terminal buildings and 
                it is as if they have left behind the jet set and find themselves 
                back in the days of the Tiger Moth set. They search for a bus 
                or they queue, very often in the rain and in very long queues, 
                for a taxi. That is utterly and completely unacceptable, given 
                that other small, regional airports in countries such as Canada 
                and Ireland are well served by rail links. Everyone sees that 
                the one essential link is a rail link and that without one we 
                do down our tourist and business trade.</P>
              <P>The subject of tonight's debate is one on which my colleague 
                Sandra White has worked hard. She would have loved to be in the 
                chamber for the debate, but could not, as she has a prior engagement.</P>
              <P>From comments that I read in this afternoon's papers, I am glad 
                that Lord James Douglas-Hamilton supports the case that is made 
                by Glasgow for a rail link. Both cities need such a link, and 
                they need it quite desperately. In Glasgow, we are trying to implement 
                the north-south crossrail link. However, that scheme is </P>

                transportation study of the late 1960s. We are tired of talking&#151;something 
                should be implemented.</P>
              <P>The Association of European Airlines study of 1997 agreed that 
                rail links should be planned when an airport reached 2 million 
                passengers and that one should be in operation by the time that 
                an airport reached 3 million passengers. Glasgow airport has 6.84 
                million passengers&#151;more than double the agreed figure, but 
                still no rail link. When Stansted airport opened in 1991 it had 
                1.1 million passengers and Glasgow airport had over 4 million 
                passengers. Over the past year or so, Stansted's passenger numbers 
                have increased by 17 per cent, whereas Glasgow airport's figures 
                have increased by only 2.2 per cent. We are shutting people out 
                of our two major cities because of a lack of modern, town-to-airport 
                transportation.</P>
              <P>The 200 million for the Edinburgh rail link is peanuts in the 
                railways business, particularly when we remember that billions, 
                not millions, were spent to extend the rail link out to Greenwich 
                so that people could go and admire that greater example of waste 
                of taxpayers' money&#151;the dome. Towards the end of construction, 
                electricians were being paid 30 an hour to get it finished. I 
                am afraid that the whole pattern shows, as usual, that the south 
                is spoilt and that the north suffers unnecessary deprivation.</P>
              <P>17:10</P>
              <P><strong>Iain Smith (North-East Fife) (LD): </strong>I congratulate Lord 
                James Douglas-Hamilton on securing the debate. It would be a little 
                churlish to follow Margaret Smith's example and wonder why he 
                did not secure the rail link when he was the minister with responsibility 
                for transport all those years ago.</P>
              <P>I am slightly surprised to find that I am the only Fife member 
                present for the debate, because the rail link has been the subject 
                of discussion in Fife for many years and would be considerably 
                important to the area. A direct rail link to the airport would 
                have incredible economic benefits for Fife.</P>
              <P>I find the absence of a station at the airport incomprehensible. 
                I cannot think of any other country in the world that would allow 
                a rail line to run past the end of a runway without building a 
                station to let people get off and get on the planes. I pass that 
                runway three or four times a week in both directions and find 
                the situation amazing. Although I sometimes feel that I could 
                touch the planes as they come down over the top of the trains, 
                still the trains will not stop and let us off to use the planes.</P>

              <P>It is absolute nonsense that, in order to get to the airport, 
                people from Fife and other parts firth of the firth have to come 
                all the way into Edinburgh and go all the way back out again. 
                Moreover, that approach is not environmentally sensible, as it 
                forces many people to drive to the airport instead of using public 
                transport. For example, in a few weeks' time, I will be travelling 
                to Dublin to represent the Parliament at a meeting of the British-Irish 
                Interparliamentary Body&#151;indeed, you will be doing the same, 
                Presiding Officer. As I will probably get an 8.50 flight, I could 
                leave my home and catch a train at Ladybank at about seven o'clock. 
                I might pass the airport at half-past seven or a quarter to eight, 
                but by the time I reach Haymarket and catch a bus back to the 
                airport, I will be too late to check in. As a result, I will have 
                to drive through&#151;or someone will have to drive me through&#151;from 
                Fife that morning in order to catch an 8.50 flight. That is absolute 
                nonsense in this day and age. Why on earth does the train not 
                simply stop at the airport to let me get off and catch my flight, 
                which I would have plenty of time to do if there were a station? 
                Environmentally, it makes more sense to have rail halts. I make 
                a very strong plea that that halt should be on the Fife line, 
                as it would benefit the east coast of Scotland, which does not 
                have such a link.</P>
              <P>Fife Regional Council called for a rail link for many years, 
                and now Fife Council is doing the same. As I said, it would have 
                strong economic benefits for us. Our growing financial sector 
                needs those links to the international business sectors, and direct 
                access to those links would greatly benefit Fife. For example, 
                the electronics industry is based in the area, but has an international 
                element that would benefit from access to those links.</P>
              <P>Furthermore, tourism is very important to the Fife economy, particularly 
                to my constituency, which is the home of golf. Many people want 
                to fly to Scotland to play golf at St Andrews, and quite rightly 
                so; however, they have to hire cars at the airport or travel into 
                Edinburgh to travel back out to Fife. The St Andrews Bay golf 
                resort and spa is a fabulous new facility that caters to the international 
                conference market. It wants to attract people from all over the 
                world to Scotland to hold their conferences. However, the lack 
                of straightforward rail transport links from Edinburgh airport 
                to St Andrews does not assist that process.</P>
              <P>Of course, we must consider other issues. It is not a simple 
                matter of building a platform at the end of the runway and saying, 
                &quot;That's our rail link&quot;. I accept that we have to bear 
                in mind issues such as the routing of the service, the possible 
                need for loops, line capacity and new signalling. However, surely 
                in this day and age we can have a rail halt at the end of a runway 
                and allow people to get to the airport.</P>

              <P><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab): </strong>I congratulate 
                Lord James Douglas-Hamilton on securing the debate. He has lobbied 
                weekly to ensure that members attended and I wanted to support 
                him. Like Margaret Smith and Iain Smith, I find that when I listen 
                to Lord James not only do I forget that he was transport minister 
                and part of the Government in Scotland, I sometimes forget that 
                he is a Tory party member. Perhaps David McLetchie will balance 
                up the Tory benches tonight and remind us of the true face of 
                the Conservative party in Scotland.</P>
              <P>I agree with Bristow Muldoon that the motion is a good one. However, 
                like other members on the Labour benches, I would disagree with 
                what it says about Railtrack. I watched the progress of the west 
                coast main line project, and as every month went by we could add 
                another billion pounds to the price tag. Something had to be done 
                to ensure that we sorted out the problem of rail investment in 
                the UK. The Government was committed to ploughing billions into 
                the railways. We needed to ensure that we got value for money. 
                I have that minor disagreement with the motion, but I strongly 
                agree with its sentiment and spirit.</P>
              <P>A mix of public and private investment is critical. I would disagree 
                with ruling out the possibility of funding from Edinburgh City 
                Council's plans for congestion charging. It is early days yet, 
                and politicians throughout Edinburgh must consider and debate 
                that when the city council introduces congestion charging. It 
                is premature to rule out such funding at this stage. We are playing 
                catch-up on railway investment in Scotland. We have moved a long 
                way from a Government that avoided investment, kept the railway 
                ticking over and invested solely in roads. When we travel around 
                the rest of Europe, we are supremely jealous because both national 
                capitals and regional areas have superb airport and railway infrastructures. 
                We have to catch up, which is why we need to ensure that this 
                project is on the list of the Government's objectives.</P>

              <P>comments. His was a bit of recycled speech&#151;we have heard 
                it previously in the chamber. However, I would agree with his 
                saying that Edinburgh airport is a driver of the Edinburgh economy. 
                The problem, as Margaret Smith said, is that without the proper 
                public transport infrastructure, we set back economic development 
                to the west of the city. We must ensure that we have high-quality 
                public transport that provides people with a real alternative 
                to taking their cars and parking them in the airport car park 
                for days on end. It is important for the economy and the environment 
                of our area.</P>
              <P>Bristow Muldoon was right that we must make possible maximum 
                access to the airport. It is tantalising that, when the railway 
                passes the airport, the line goes just past the edge of the runway. 
                Getting the right route will be critical. I ask ministers to update 
                us on the progress that they have made with the research on railway 
                access to the airport, which was commissioned by the previous 
                transport minister in Scotland. It must be about time that we 
                had the outcome of that study. I cannot remember exactly when 
                it was due, but it must be pretty soon.</P>
              <P>It is important that we do not think only about airport access. 
                We must consider the regional context: the east of Scotland and 
                the Lothians area will need a mix of light and heavy rail and 
                Edinburgh will need a package. As a constituency MSP, I strongly 
                believe that investment in Waverley and Haymarket is critical. 
                We must upgrade access to the whole railway network in the east. 
                There has already been great progress in Edinburgh, and the work 
                with the council and the Executive should be applauded. Crossrail 
                will open shortly, as will the new stations at Brunstane, Newcraighall 
                in Susan Deacon's constituency, and the Gyle. The next stage will 
                be a requirement for significant expenditure, not only by the 
                public sector&#151;there are major opportunities for the private 
                sector. From that point of view, I strongly agree with Lord James 
                Douglas-Hamilton's motion, which refers to the critical imperative 
                of having public-private partnerships to get us much-needed investment.</P>
              <P>I ask the ministers to give us a reassurance that they will prioritise 
                the airport link. If we are going to get railways moving in Scotland, 
                it will need ministerial action and the ministers' commitment 
                to develop the link as part of a wider, radical package of investment 
                in railways in the Lothians and the east of Scotland. We can see 
                the opportunities that are close to us. However, we need to ensure 
                that we get to the stage of having an agreed plan and an agreed 
                opportunity for private investors to put money into what would 
                be an exciting and radical investment, not only for the next few 
                years, but for the next couple of decades. We desperately need 
                that in the east of Scotland and I hope that the ministers will

              <P><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green): </strong>I am glad that Iain Smith 
                was in the chamber to speak up for Fife and that Dorothy-Grace 
                Elder was here to speak up for the west coast. I see no Borders 
                MSP here today, so, as a life member of the Campaign for Borders 
                Rail, I feel that I should put in a word about that issue in a 
                minute.</P>
              <P>Dorothy-Grace Elder said that 200 million was peanuts for the 
                rail system, but a huge amount could be achieved with such a sum, 
                including&#151;if the figures that I have are correct&#151;putting 
                in the Borders rail link and the Edinburgh loop. There would be 
                money left over to extend the Borders rail a little bit further 
                towards Carlisle. I remember once saying &quot;Carlisle or bust&quot; 
                in the chamber. Some money would also be left over for the Edinburgh 
                link.</P>
              <P>I have listened carefully to the debate. I am sorry that I missed 
                Lord James Douglas-Hamilton's speech. I was working in my office 
                and was unaware that the previous debate finished early. However, 
                from other members' reflections on what Lord James said, I am 
                clear&#151;I agree with Ms Sarah Boyack on this&#151;that we cannot 
                turn down on a point of principle any income stream for developing 
                our rail network. We must not forget that we built the world's 
                first big rail network. That was done entirely on private finance 
                by such rail companies as the old Great Northern Railway and the 
                London and North Eastern Railway. The railways were privately 
                run until they were nationalised.</P>
              <P>The airport links must be viewed in the context of an overall 
                rail strategy for all Scotland and not just for Edinburgh, Glasgow, 
                Aberdeen and Inverness. They must be based on economic growth 
                and on the tourism principles that have been enunciated. There 
                are huge possibilities for train tourism, if only we committed 
                ourselves to the idea of developing it.</P>
              <P>I regularly travel up to Inverness and Aberdeen by train. There 
                is one consolation for the length of the journey, which is that 
                if one travels at weekends one can go into business class for 
                1.50 and do some work. That is a pleasant experience, if one 
                can get into business class.</P>
              <P>We have such a beautiful country that there are tourism possibilities 
                through the airport rail links and through an overall development 
                of and investment in the Borders rail and the upgrading of the 
                Inverness and west Highlands lines. That development must be part 
                of a package that includes the airport links. As well as the more

              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong 
                Learning (Lewis Macdonald): </strong>I start by thanking Lord James 
                Douglas-Hamilton for raising the issue in his usual constructive 
                way. The debate has been useful. It is clear that there is broad 
                agreement across the chamber, if not on the precise detail of 
                everything in the motion, certainly on the essential objectives, 
                which I think we share.</P>
              <P>Robin Harper spoke about setting a context. The context is clearly 
                that the Executive is committed to developing an integrated transport 
                strategy that includes rail. We want a railway network that is 
                safe, accessible and larger&#151;it should serve more people than 
                it currently does. We want a railway system that supports economic 
                development, meets social needs and meets the environmental objectives 
                that we have set ourselves and those that we have agreed to under 
                the Kyoto agreement and other international agreements. Developing 
                rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports can be an important 
                part of that. That is why we, along with other stakeholders, have 
                commissioned a major study to look at what might be done at each 
                airport.</P>
              <P>That is part of a much wider process that will address the continuing 
                and anticipated growth in the demand for air transport across 
                the UK over the next 30 years. Edinburgh airport is growing faster 
                than any other UK airport, with the exception of Stansted, which 
                has been mentioned a couple of times today. In 2001, Edinburgh 
                handled more than 6 million passengers. If that growth is to be 
                sustained, effective surface access links will be required. The 
                study that we have commissioned is a central part of that process. 
                Glasgow airport is growing as well. It handles more than 7 million 
                passengers every year and remains Scotland's largest airport. 
                It is also the main airport serving the North American and leisure 
                markets.</P>
              <P>In relation to both airports, the case for the construction of 
                rail links is not only about promoting public transport and tackling 
                congestion, but part of the wider approach to air transport that

                taking in order to achieve an aviation strategy for the next 20 
                to 30 years.</P>
              <P>It is vital that access to our airports is improved to ensure 
                better accessibility to and from airports not only for passengers 
                but for employees, who can occasionally be overlooked in this 
                debate. Improved access would also promote employment opportunities 
                through the continued growth of airports, which would bring economic 
                benefits for the airport and the wider community and would reduce 
                road congestion, accidents and the environmental impacts of road 
                traffic. Those objectives are all part of our wider transport 
                priorities.</P>
              <P>That is why the consultants are undertaking a detailed economic 
                and engineering study into rail links to both airports. They will 
                examine options for linking Glasgow and Edinburgh airports to 
                the Scottish rail network and to each other. The study will establish 
                the likely demand for such links and the costs of putting rail 
                links in place. It will also include recommendations about funding 
                and procurement options.</P>
              <P>We are at a detailed and practical stage in the advancement of 
                the potential projects. Sarah Boyack asked how the plans fitted 
                in with the wider progress of study in these areas. The scoping 
                study that was undertaken at the end of 2000 produced a set of 
                proposals that have formed the basis of the current study. The 
                consultants have identified a large number of options for each 
                airport. They will consider light rail as well as heavy rail options.</P>
              <P>The consultants' final report is expected in the autumn. It will 
                examine in detail the two best options for each airport, which 
                we will measure against our five objectives for transport investment: 
                the environment; safety; economy; integration; and accessibility. 
                The report will also include the issue that was raised by Iain 
                Smith, Sarah Boyack and a number of other members about the best 
                stops on the line and the best links into local networks and the 
                national network.</P>
              <P>I know that recent press reports have suggested that the Executive 
                has already decided to express a preference for the construction 
                of a link to Edinburgh airport rather than to Glasgow airport. 
                I will take the opportunity that this debate offers me to say 
                that that is not the case. Our consultants have been asked to 
                identify preferred options for a rail link to each airport. It 
                is too early to say what will emerge from the study. I stress 
                that we have no preconceived view on what the outcome should be.</P>
              <P>The press have also speculated that we have funding in place 
                for the Edinburgh link. That is premature speculation. We have

                That part of the study will not be concluded until the middle 
                of 2002. It is too early at this stage to say what the global 
                costs are likely to be or to specify how those costs should be 
                met.</P>
              <P>The reassurance on funding at this stage is to remind members 
                that, as Bristow Muldoon said, the SRA is a key partner. It has 
                identified three major priorities within the Scottish rail network; 
                rail links to airports are one of those priorities. Indeed, last 
                month Wendy Alexander met Richard Bowker, the chairman of the 
                SRA, and agreed those priorities. As has been said, Glasgow and 
                Edinburgh airports are the two largest airports in the United 
                Kingdom that do not have such a dedicated link. The SRA recognised 
                that matter as a priority and it is clearly also a priority for 
                us.</P>
              <P>However, new rail schemes do not appear overnight, whether the 
                ones that we are discussing or others to which reference has been 
                made in the debate. A great deal of forethought and planning has 
                to go into taking forward such projects. Our consultants have 
                much to do before they can give us a final and informed view on 
                the best way forward.</P>
              <P>In response to the points that Lord James Douglas-Hamilton made, 
                it is important to say that the Executive and the SRA will take 
                a lead in the public funding aspects of the project. However, 
                we will also look to private sector partners&#151;BAA Scottish 
                Airports clearly has an interest as the owner of the airports. 
                There are also other potential private sector partners.</P>
              <P>Local government also has an interest and a role to play. The 
                City of Edinburgh Council and Renfrewshire Council, as the planning 
                authorities for the respective airports, will have a vital role 
                in the delivery of the projects. There will be a requirement for 
                parliamentary powers, for example; those will be sought by the 
                sponsors of the project rather than necessarily by Scottish ministers. 
                The railway companies, Strathclyde Passenger Transport in the 
                west of Scotland and local government have a role. We have sought 
                to engage all those stakeholders in a number of consultation workshops; 
                indeed, a number of workshops are planned over the next three 
                or four months to assess demand and to make the economic case.</P>
              <P>Although it is too early to say definitively which options will 
                be taken forward or to be specific about the likely cost and sources 
                of funding, we recognise that, as many members have said, it is 
                important that we maintain our present momentum and the drive 
                to take those projects to completion.</P>

                to the study and to come to the Parliament to obtain the parliamentary 
                powers, we could be in a position to move forward to design and 
                construction as early as 2005. We recognise that that is an ambitious 
                timetable, but it is achievable if all else falls into place, 
                as we hope it will. We will certainly play our part in taking 
                forward that timetable. I look forward to the contribution that 
                those projects can make to achieving a bigger, better and safer 
                transport network for Scotland and I look forward to the continuing 
                support of all sides in achieving that objective.</P>
