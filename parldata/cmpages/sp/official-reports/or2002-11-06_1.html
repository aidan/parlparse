are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth. The Archer 
sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that 
His arrows might go swift and far. Let your bending in the Archer's hand be for

the past hundreds of millions years since humanity began to develop its God-given 
life, we have become men and women with incredible brain power and ingenuity. 
From discovering the basic ability to create fire and so to keep warm, we have 
progressed to the stage where we are able to travel to the moon and, no doubt, 
eventually beyond that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
of the greatest gifts that humanity has been given is the gift of free will&#151;the 
ability to make decisions for right or wrong, for good or ill. The creator who

would learn that the best way for everyone to live was his way of love.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout 
all the decades, centuries and millennia, the divine bowman has sent forth living 
arrows, but in all that time only one man has been able to live the perfect life

had created him. That was the man Jesus. Because of that, the other side of human 
nature came to the fore, and he was nailed to a cross 2,000 years ago.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
we look around our world today, we cannot help but feel that many of the arrows

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David 
Steel): </strong>The main item of business this afternoon is a debate on motion S1M-3536, 
in the name of Cathy Jamieson, on flexibility and innovation in schools, and on 
two amendments to that motion. I invite members who would like to take part in 
the debate to indicate now that they would like to speak. I call Cathy Jamieson.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14:34</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Minister for Education and Young People (Cathy Jamieson): </strong>I am delighted that, 
once again, there are in the public gallery young people from a range of schools, 
some of whom I met at lunch time.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Education 
has been very much at the top of the agenda in the past few days and I am pleased 
to use our time this afternoon to allow us to debate such an important issue. 
The Parliament recognised the importance of raising standards when it approved, 
as one of its first major pieces of legislation, the Standards in Scotland's Schools 
etc Act 2000. Every child in Scotland must have the opportunity to achieve his 
or her full potential, not simply to settle for second best, or worse, often because 
of circumstances that are largely out of their control.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Education 
must raise young people's aspirations and schools must be able to develop those 
ambitions fully. A great deal of innovative and excellent work is going on in 
Scottish schools to raise overall attainment. If we are honest, however, we know 
that there is still in pupil attainment an unacceptable gap between those who 
succeed and those who do not. Let us be absolutely clear; young people in poorer 
areas do less well. Some might argue that there has always been an opportunity 
gap, but the fact that it has always existed does not make it right or natural. 
The gap is unacceptable and we must find ways in which to close it. We cannot 
blame the system, because the system is all of us&#151;teachers, local authorities 
and even politicians.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
all have a part to play in making the changes that will close that gap. They will 
be changes such as the agreement, &quot;A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century&quot;. 
We need well-trained, well-motivated and well-rewarded teachers. We need an education 
system that offers flexibility for local authorities and head teachers to innovate 
and to </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14939">14939</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">implement the best solutions for 
their areas or schools. We have already come a long way since the agreement was 
signed in January 2001.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Maureen 
Macmillan (Highlands and Islands) (Lab): </strong>I am grateful for the substantial 
sums of extra money that the Executive has committed to funding the McCrone settlement 
throughout Scotland&#151;that will make a big difference to the teaching and learning 
environment. However, the minister will be aware that there have been concerns 
expressed in the Highlands and Islands that the pattern of small schools there 
makes implementation of the McCrone recommendations challenging. When she discusses 
the broader education context with the Highland Council, will the minister be 
as flexible as possible about the way in which the council can use the funds that 
flow to it from various education spending initiatives? Has she had any discussions 
with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities about changing the funding formula?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>I am happy to reassure Maureen Macmillan. We have already made some 
changes in the way in which the national priorities action fund&#151;formerly 
the excellence fund&#151;can be used to allow more flexibility. I have discussed 
matters with COSLA and will continue those discussions to ensure that we take 
account of issues such as deprivation and rurality, as well as pupil numbers, 
in the amounts of money that go to local authorities through grant-aided expenditure. 
We will continue to work with COSLA on that. We are on track with all the McCrone 
agreement's commitments. All the targets have so far been met on time and we are 
making solid progress towards the others.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is worth noting examples of local flexibility, such as business managers in Edinburgh 
taking bureaucratic burdens from head teachers. As one head teacher put it to 
me, that allows him get on with educational matters rather than sort out broken 
windows or leaky taps. There is local flexibility in North Ayrshire, where the 
local authority and the teaching unions have agreed that departmental meetings 
can be held outside the pupil week, which means more teaching time for pupils. 
In some schools, that allows increased numbers of secondary 1 classes, which reduces 
class sizes. That is the kind of flexibility that benefits teachers and pupils 
and helps to deliver better quality education.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 
giving more time for teachers to teach and allowing them to devote more time to 
each child will bring clear benefits. That is why we have reduced to a maximum 
of 30 primary 1 to primary 3 class sizes and why we have increased the number 
of classroom assistants so that we now have a pupil to adult ratio of 15:1 or 
better.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_6"></A>Tommy

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">minister will be aware that class 
sizes will be a feature of this afternoon's debate. Has the Executive established 
an estimate of how much it would cost to reduce class sizes to 20 in the primary 
sector and the secondary school sectors?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>I will deal with that point in due course and will explain where 
the Executive sees a way forward.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
importance of classroom assistants is clear from talking to teachers at the front 
line. Teachers want more support staff and they want more adults who have expertise 
in sport, music or drama coming into schools. That is why the First Minister talked 
in his speech in Glasgow yesterday about the unique position in which we find 
ourselves, with falling school rolls and increasing numbers of teachers and other 
school staff. We need to examine the opportunities that that might give us in 
the future.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would be 
easy to resort to knee-jerk reaction or political sloganising; indeed, some people 
already have done so. We have choices and we need to know where our priorities 
lie. Let us have a debate. Should there be further class size reductions in the 
early years of primary schools? Should we extend class size reductions to the 
later years of primary schools or perhaps to the early years of secondary schools? 
We know that many pupils in many countries stand still in respect of their learning 
during the early years of secondary school. How can we best use our resources? 
Declines in school rolls will not happen uniformly throughout the country, or 
even in each local authority. Let us consider such issues more closely and develop 
real solutions that can be implemented sensibly and which can bring real benefits 
to pupils.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our approach 
must be to consider the options and ensure that we have the right research and 
the right international comparators that will allow us to reach the right decisions. 
I say to Tommy Sheridan that options will be properly costed&#151;our proposals 
will not have back-of-the-envelope calculations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
guidance on flexibility in the curriculum that was issued to directors of education 
last year was an important and ground-breaking circular. It acknowledged that 
a one-size-fits-all approach to the curriculum would not necessarily meet the 
individual needs of pupils. I will give a few brief examples of where the approach 
is working. We will support 20 innovative modern language projects over the next 
two years. The outcomes and resources from those projects will be shared nationally 
and will provide an excellent knowledge bank for all schools and local authorities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An 
exciting project that we are supporting is a partial immersion programme at Walker 
Road </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14941">14941</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Primary School in Aberdeen. That 
project allows for teaching part of the curriculum in French. One primary 3 class 
has been learning French in that way since primary 1. Parents are also learning 
French so that they can support their children. I have not had the opportunity 
to hear it for myself, but I understand that listening to the young people moving 
from broad Aberdonian to French with ease has to be heard to be believed. Perhaps 
Nicol Stephen will say something about that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Tommy 
Sheridan: </strong>Will the minister take an intervention?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>I would like to proceed&#151;I will come back to the member later.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ashcraig 
School in Glasgow has used innovation funding to provide access to French for 
pupils who have severe communications difficulties, which has helped to build 
their confidence. Another project is supported by a national grid for learning 
Scotland ICT innovation award. The awards were set up in 2000 and provide small 
grants to encourage innovative approaches in the use of information and communications 
technology in small-scale local learning and teaching projects.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thirty 
different projects have been helped so far, which cover everything from specialist 
music teaching by videoconferencing in Argyll and Bute to a homework website in 
the Scottish Borders that gives pupils e-mail access to subject specialists. Therefore, 
the Executive is whole-heartedly encouraging schools to take a flexible approach 
to learning.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have, through 
the future learning and teaching programme, acknowledged the need to support pilot 
projects that will explore the school of the future. There are 15 projects in 
the programme, of which I will mention just a few. The Highland future schools 
project has taken advantage of the two new community high schools at Ardnamurchan 
and Glenurquhart that have been built by Highland Council to pilot new ways of 
using ICT within a purpose-built school environment and, through links to the 
wider community, to increase the local skills base through home-school-community 
partnerships. What does that project mean to pupils and parents? At Ardnamurchan 
High School, it means that pupils will learn next-generation ICT skills, that 
they will have access to high-quality online teaching materials and that they 
can take home laptop computers on which to do their homework. Parents can use 
the laptops to access e-mails, electronic newsletters and school curriculum information.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Glenurquhart 
High School will also create links with the local community by offering ICT to 
the community and allowing adult learners to access </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14942">14942</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

online learning opportunities. That will give all members of the learning community 
continuous access to the school's central website portal, with linked access to 
school curriculum, subject, homework and revision sites.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Brian 
Fitzpatrick (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Lab): </strong>Is the minister prepared to 
go further than that in respect of the wider school curriculum? Does she agree 
that a key contribution to our commitment to closing the opportunity gap&#151;for 
which she will receive my whole-hearted support&#151;can be made by effective 
use of school premises? Will she join me in welcoming the £8 million investment 
that we are making after decades of underinvestment in our schools? Bishopbriggs 
High School's games hall is opening tonight and will include provision for extensive 
community use of its facilities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>I am pleased to hear about the investment that has been made and 
I wish everybody well with the new facility. It will be of great benefit to pupils 
and to the community.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
will give a few more examples of what is happening elsewhere. Glasgow City Council 
is exploring innovative ways of organising and managing its schools through the 
Glasgow learning communities project. Six learning communities have been created 
in the east end of Glasgow. They are made up of schools, pre-school centres and 
support agencies. Each cluster is managed and organised as one unit. The aims 
are: to improve the transitions between pre-school, primary school and secondary 
school; to promote social and educational inclusion; to raise standards and increase 
achievement for all pupils; to improve partnerships between pre-school, school 
and the community; and to reduce administrative burdens on teachers and schools.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
sports comprehensives project that is being run by North Lanarkshire Council is 
another example of an innovative way of working. The project is piloting inclusive 
sports comprehensives and involves three high schools in the authority. It aims 
to increase participation in sport among young people in the authority area, to 
increase attainment and achievement, and to build confidence and self-esteem among 
young people. It aims to provide an enriched curriculum through enhanced sports 
provision and opportunities and to make a contribution to the wider regeneration 
of the area.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each of those 
projects is different. Each is exploring its own vision of how schools might look, 
feel and be organised in the future. Each will be independently evaluated to ensure 
that we are able to identify their impact on learning and teaching, their impact 
on the local community and their impact on pupils and students, not only in </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14943">14943</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">terms of attainment and attendance 
but in terms of life skills and the quality of the educational experience. They 
are the kind of innovative ideas that will help every school become a centre of 
excellence.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I made it clear 
at the Edinburgh conference last week that I support the comprehensive principle, 
and Jack McConnell made it clear in his speech to head teachers yesterday that 
he supports the comprehensive principle. However, let me make it clear that I 
do not interpret a general thumbs-up&#151;as we saw in the national debate responses&#151;as 
an uncritical endorsement of the status quo. We need to raise our game in some 
areas.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Murdo Fraser 
(Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>Will Cathy Jamieson give way?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>I want to finish my point.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nobody 
should be in any doubt that we will introduce reforms to improve matters where 
that is needed. Let me make it clear what comprehensive education is and is not 
about: it is not about putting all young people through a uniform learning process; 
it is not about assuming that the needs of every child are identical; and it is 
not about the first two years of secondary schooling moving too fast for some 
and too slow for others with all, or most, pupils in a class being given the same 
materials at the same pace, regardless of their aptitude or prior attainment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Comprehensive 
education is about teachers responding to pupils' individual needs, prior attainments 
and past experiences, both when planning pupils' work in school and through parental 
involvement at home. It is about making best use of the flexibility that is already 
available to organise classes most suitably to meet the needs of the pupils.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
need also to work on keeping young people who are in the third and fourth years 
of secondary school interested in their education. That means that we must increase 
the choice of, and opportunities for, vocational education. We must make better 
links with further education and the world of work and allow young people to take 
vocational qualifications in school or in partnership with colleges. That does 
not mean young people leaving school at 14; rather, it means opening up more opportunities 
for them while maintaining the support that the wider school community offers. 
If that is what Brian Monteith means by his amendment, I will ruin his credibility 
by agreeing with him. Perhaps he will clarify that in his speech.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Murdo 
Fraser: </strong>How does the minister define a comprehensive school? Does a school 
that streams its pupils fall into the category &quot;comprehensive school&quot;?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">comprehensive principle allows various 
opportunities for people to look at the best options and to meet the individual 
needs of children and young people. We must remember that education is about much 
more than exam results. The national priorities in education reflect that clearly 
and recognise that performance should not be measured only against attainment 
in exam results.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The aim 
of the school improvement framework is to ensure that we make progress on all 
the national priorities. We must think about attitudes and life skills and about 
providing a broad understanding of the world in which we live. That should involve 
teaching understanding of different cultures and the promotion of tolerance. Education 
must meet the social and academic needs of the whole child and enable children 
to play a full and productive part in society. I know that that can sometimes 
be difficult and that a child's development is not only about academic achievement. 
It can be difficult for schools to balance the need to provide a broad education 
with the push to raise standards in attainment. The good news&#151;this is important 
when we talk about the comprehensive principle&#151;is that classroom practice 
and research over the years suggest that those goals are not mutually exclusive.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Schools 
and authorities must continue to seek improvements that will raise attainment 
and close the opportunity gap. Where they have difficulties, we will ensure that 
the skills and expertise of HM Inspectorate of Education are channelled towards 
helping them to improve and get things right. My vision is that every school should 
be a centre of excellence for learning and teaching in its own community; a centre 
of excellence in supporting pupils and reflecting their individual needs and abilities; 
a centre of excellence in terms of accommodation and facilities, and a centre 
of excellence for leadership, management and staff development that sets its own 
challenging targets for year-on-year improvements.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
are committed to developing the improvement framework for Scottish schools and 
to closing the opportunity gap. We encourage flexibility so that local needs and 
circumstances are met. We recognise and celebrate the innovative and forward-looking 
practice that can be found in Scottish education and we are determined to encourage 
local innovation and local flexibility because only parents and people on the 
front line know what is required.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
plan to make details of all future learning and teaching projects available in

He did not say. Where were they to be driven? He did not say. In what way were 
standards slipping or falling? He did not say; he produced only some vague ideas 
about the role of the inspectorate in supporting failing schools&#151;a role that 
it already has. What schools were failing? He did not say. He said that he wanted

SNP's attitude towards the issues in the motion. We supported and continue to 
support the McCrone agreement. The main problems lie in the failure of the Executive 
to honour its part of the bargain. We believe in greater flexibility in schools, 
although the national priorities approach is a very vague way in which to achieve 
that. We want children to have help with transition at all the key stages in education, 
including the transition from nursery school to primary school. The Liberals are 
apparently so concerned about that issue that they have been unable to mention 
it in the two and a half years in which there has been a Liberal Deputy Minister

a specific standard: we must raise the standard of education that has been achieved

rhetoric. Similarly, the First Minister's speech yesterday was about motherhood 
and apple pie and was full of things that everyone could sign up to. However, 
in the Government, there is confusion about supporting the comprehensive system. 
In one breath, the First Minister says that he supports the comprehensive ethos, 
but, in the next breath, he undermines the comprehensive ethos. If the comprehensive 
ethos means anything, it means mixed-ability teaching. However, the First Minister 
yesterday and the Minister for Education and Young People today argued that we 
should have flexibility so that we can have setting in schools. If that is the 
case, it is quite wrong to say that the comprehensive system remains intact.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Maureen 
Macmillan: </strong>I do not think that Mr Monteith realises what a comprehensive school 
is. Does he accept that all ways of teaching children take place in a comprehensive

mixed-ability education in various years, depending on the age of the child and 
the subject that is being taught? One size does not fit all.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14951">14951</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>As someone who 
attended a comprehensive school and who sends his children to one, I am well aware 
of what they are. I am seeking to tease out what the minister means by &quot;comprehensive&quot;. 
When we listen to speeches and read articles, it is clear that the word means 
various things to various people. If it is not about the type of teaching&#151;if 
setting and streaming are allowed&#151;we surely cannot have selection operating 
in relation to comprehensive schools. However, that is what we find in some of 
them: Plockton High School, which is a specialist music school, selects pupils 
based on musical ability for some places; Broughton High School uses an external 
panel to judge auditions for places; Douglas Academy, which is another specialist 
music school, has two auditions before a final selection is made; Knightswood 
Secondary School has auditions for places in its dance school; and Bellahouston 
Academy's school of sport has a rigorous selection process.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 
comprehensive system allows setting, streaming and selection. What sort of comprehensive 
system do we have in Scotland?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Michael 
Russell: </strong>A simple illustration might assist Mr Monteith in his confusion. 
It is highly unlikely that I would receive an offer to be educated at a sports 
academy, because my sporting prowess is probably not good enough. It is daft to 
suggest that schools that specialise in an area should not be allowed to select 
pupils who are specialists in that area. It is also daft to draw from the fact 
that they do so some sort of lesson for the rest of Scotland that is completely 
wrong.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_13"></A>Mr

Monteith: </strong>No, I must make progress. Everybody has had a chance to intervene.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
we are to have specialist schools, they must have a way of selecting the pupils 
who attend them. The Government's thinking is confused if it believes that it 
cannot have further specialist schools, such as those that are provided in England, 
because that would involve selection, which might somehow break the comprehensive 
model in Scotland. How is it possible for England to have maths colleges&#151;schools 
that specialise in maths&#151;art schools, language schools, business and enterprise 
schools and technology colleges, all of which specialise and, to an extent, select 
the pupils who are allowed to go to them, but it is somehow not possible to introduce 
such schools in Scotland?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My

not the comprehensive ethos any more. All that &quot;comprehensive&quot; can mean 
now, if it means anything at all, is simply a geographical lottery&#151;a postcode 
lottery for which school one attends.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

know that some schools perform particularly well by academic standards. We know 
that 45 per cent of the pupils in the top decile&#151;the top-performing 10 per

or more. That is to be applauded. We must welcome that and we must continue to 
try to improve on it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
we must have great concern about the lowest decile of secondary schools, in which 
only 4.1 per cent of the pupils are able to achieve three highers or more. One 
might think that that is because of those schools' localities. However, if we 
look at the schools in that section, we find great variation in the free school 
meal entitlement, which is generally accepted in education circles as a way of 
showing the depth of poverty and disadvantage in a school's area. The figure varies 
from nearly 60 per cent of the pupils in a school being entitled to free school 
meals to less than 20 per cent.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
depth of deprivation in a school area, therefore, does not necessarily mean that 
the school will have difficulty in encouraging pupils to achieve three highers 
or more. When the Conservatives came to power, more than 20 per cent of the pupils 
in the comprehensive system that we applaud so much left school with no qualifications 
after 12 years of school. That figure fell to less than 6 per cent. That is an 
achievement with which, whatever one thinks of political parties, we must be pleased.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Jackie

find that, once Labour came to power, that achievement was turned round. Last

I mean schools that reflect the fact that we need more technical training in certain

engage in the education process. If they want an academic route, that is great. 
If they want to learn skills such as joinery, carpentry, plumbing and bricklaying&#151;I

I am happy to support the Executive's motion and Mr Monteith's amendment. Indeed, 
I have abandoned my usual distant seat at the back of the chamber to come forward 
and emphasise that the Liberal Democrats collectively support the motion strongly.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
key aspect of education is expectations: the expectation that the young person 
himself or herself has, and the expectation that other people have of them. People 
fulfil expectations. If I am addressing a putt on the golf course and I think, 
&quot;My God, I'm going to miss this putt&quot;, I miss it. If a young person 
goes to a school where no one really gets on very much and nobody at school or 
at home cares very much about education, they will fail in their education. We 
have to raise expectations. Other members have said that, especially in some of 
the more deprived areas, some teachers accept lower standards than they need to. 
They face problems, but I think that they have to push children more vigorously. 
We have to help the less successful children by dedicating staff to help them, 
for example through learning support.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
minister's speech was excellent, in that it emphasised variety and experiment 
within a comprehensive system. The only way that we will find out whether ideas 
are good or bad is if we try them out. If we have a one-size-fits-all approach, 
we never find out whether we are doing things right. If different schools of different 
size in different areas go in for setting or streaming or other systems, we can 
see what works and what does not work and copy the successful aspects more vigorously.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
can develop specialist schools and schools with various strengths, but we have 
to develop a broader idea of education than is sometimes held. There is too much 
ticking of boxes and there are too many league tables for people passing exams. 
Those things are important, but it is more important that we develop good citizens 
and that schools have the right sort of atmosphere and ethos. People should feel 
comfortable there, they should get on well together, and they should make real 
progress. Their talents should be stretched, whether they are in sport, music 
or the creative arts. All that is important, in addition to getting people through

children starting formal education a little later than children in Scotland do.

from employers has helped to shape the thinking that is emerging from the Executive's 
national debate on education and the Education, Culture and Sport Committee's 
parallel inquiry on the purposes of education.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It

from Tommy Sheridan in the detail of how we should do that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is much to build on. The McCrone agreement provides a stable framework that recognises 
teachers for the professionals that they are. The minister has given a commitment

classroom assistants in every school and a commitment to deliver more has been 
made. There are record levels of investment in the school estate to ensure that

tackle social exclusion have been taken, which will ensure that no child is left

the social exclusion issue, because education has a key role to play in closing 
the opportunity gap. It is depressing that it is generally true that children

a whole. It is incumbent on us to ensure that the opportunity gap is closed and 
that we help every child to achieve their potential.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let 
us get away from using academic attainment alone to measure potential. We must 
acknowledge that although academic attainment is important, education is about 
much more. What about life skills, attitude, an understanding of society and those 
so-called soft skills that employers continually tell us are critical&#151;motivation, 
confidence and self-esteem?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
children are motivated, they learn better. If they are confident, they learn better. 
If they have self-esteem, they learn better. If they are inspired, they learn 
better. In all cases, they achieve much more. I recognise that that is not a job 
for teachers alone. We need to inspire and motivate parents, because involving 
them in their child's education will reap positive benefits.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
twin aims of promoting social inclusion and raising standards are at the heart 
of the new community schools, which are already starting to close the opportunity

created when that approach is combined with innovative devolved school management.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
devolved school management in general, I give a strong welcome to the themes that 
are associated with flexibility in the curriculum, which the First Minister and 
the Minister for Education and Young People have emphasised recently. I know that 
the teachers at John Logie Baird Primary School in Helensburgh, whom I met recently, 
support those themes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
it is the case that comprehensive education in Scotland is much valued, we need 
to do more to nurture the talents of each child; in other words, we need to provide 
individual learning for each child. Increased flexibility in the curriculum is 
necessary to enable teachers and head teachers to make decisions for their schools 
and their pupils. That will open up new opportunities. Flexibility in the curriculum 
needs to be matched by flexibility in how we measure standards and how we devolve 
the management of resources. If we intend to empower schools and pupils, that 
is the way forward.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15:35</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Fiona

than eight hours a day to provide facilities for young people. It is increasingly 
clear that that is an idea whose time has come. Recent research by MORI and the 
British Market Research Bureau on behalf of the Kids Clubs Network found that 
one in three 11 to 18-year-olds goes home from school to an empty house and one 
in four young people admits to hanging around after school with nothing to do. 
How can we turn our schools into centres where young people want to be not only

the hours of 9 to 4? I would like the Executive to give such flexibility much 
more attention.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That issue

to Audit Scotland. That £400 million could have built us another 90-odd schools,

that, in doing its utmost for pupils academically and socially, a school will 
become a paragon of excellence in the field of guidance, in police, reporter and

that school might be excellent in such a context.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some

Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>One of the most positive aspects of Jack McConnell's 
speech yesterday was that he showed that he is sometimes capable of being his 
own man and of thinking for himself instead of simply copying the Blairite agenda. 
Tony Blair told last month's Labour party conference that we need to move to the 
post-comprehensive era. That is rich coming from someone who never entered the 
comprehensive era in the first place. Tony Blair's old school, Fettes College, 
charges fees of more than £18,000 a year, which is about one and a half times 
the annual income of the average person in this country. Tony Blair does not support 
comprehensive education. He rejected it for his own children and his new Labour 
lackeys sneer at what they call bog-standard comprehensives.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
Tony Blair talks about the post-comprehensive era, he ought to be reminded of 
what the pre-comprehensive era was like, when the majority of the nation's children 
were branded as failures at the age of 11 or 12. When I went to university in 
the early 1960s, less than 5 per cent of young people in Scotland went on to post-school 
education. Now the figure is about 50 per cent, which is largely due to the introduction 
of comprehensive education based on the principle of equality of educational opportunity 
for all children, irrespective of their ability and irrespective of their parents' 
ability to pay.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Mike

state of comprehensive education. More effort must be made to improve standards

was interested in Jack McConnell's suggestion that, in order to ease pupils' transition

in secondary education, but I recall my first teaching experience&#151;indeed, 
I shall never forget it&#151;in a primary school in a deprived mining community 
in Fife. I was 19 and still a student, but there was such a desperate shortage 
of teachers at the time that students could get a job teaching during their university 
holidays. I was thrown in at the deep end with a class of about 30 children who 
ranged in age from about eight to 11 and all of whom had learning difficulties. 
To begin with, they must have taught me more than I taught then, but the experience 
probably helped me in the long run to become a better teacher.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
experience also made me realise how difficult it is to teach such children in 
classes that are far too large. Worse was to come. At one stage, I taught high 
school maths to classes of 40 or even 50. That would never be allowed in this 
day and age, and rightly so. There are now maximum class sizes, but they are not 
the optimum. Jack McConnell referred to the need for proper research. We do not 
need more research to tell us the obvious. Any experienced teacher can explain 
the advantages of reducing class sizes. I hope that the Scottish Executive will 
give much higher priority to employing more teachers in order to reduce the size 
of classes. That would be the best way in which to improve educational opportunities 
for our children and young people so that all of them are given the chance to 
reach their full potential and every school in Scotland has the chance to become 
a centre of excellence.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15:59</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr

we will not see kids turned out on the streets and assurances from Brian Monteith

then I would be more convinced that it was a good idea to leave school at 14.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We

am uneasy that any attempt to turn the clock back 35 years could lead us to repeating 
such mistakes. I wonder whether any member would honestly be happy for his or 
her child to leave school at 14. The Tories are talking about other people's children. 
Would they resist their children leaving school at 14 or encourage them? I do 
not think that they would encourage them to do so. I would therefore welcome reassurances 
on the subject before I vote for the Tory amendment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I

the phone and told him that it was a public holiday in Italy and no one could

there are meant to be new conditions for teachers concerning administration, to 
allow them to escape from bureaucracy and paperwork and actually do some teaching. 
However, while West Lothian Council has been able to afford business managers, 
Highland Council has not. There was also meant to have been a wind-down scheme 
for older teachers, but that cannot be implemented because of a lack of funding. 
Highland Council would have been able to employ 30 new probationary teachers and 
104 extra support staff under the McCrone settlement, but none of that can now 
be afforded.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Karen Gillon:

that not thought of by the Scottish Executive before it allowed the implementation

That is one of the many areas where teachers cannot even find affordable housing 
in which to live.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I remind

to £5,000&#151;a huge extra cost. If the minister needs further proof of the inequity 
and unfairness of the funding system, she will get it from the councils that I 
have mentioned and from the Western Isles Council in Stornoway.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Western 
Isles Council has 4,200 pupils spread over 12 islands. In an urban context, 4,200 
pupils would probably require five primary schools and four secondary schools&#151;nine 
schools in all. However, Western Isles Council has 40 schools. That means that 
the council must pay 40 head teachers rather than nine. The McCrone settlement 
also says that each school should have someone to look after reception duties. 
Forty people would be required in the Western Isles: who will pay for them? In 
rural areas, the funding should be based on teacher numbers, not on the population.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
ask the minister to listen to Brian Monteith's sensible proposals to encourage 
diversity in schools. He is not saying that everybody should leave school at 14. 
In the Highlands and Islands, it would be excellent if pupils older than 14 could 
spend some of their learning time at further education colleges, learning trades 
and gaining qualifications and practical experience that would help them in their 
later lives. Perhaps they might follow careers in agriculture, fish farming, forestry 
or tourism&#151;industries that are on their doorstep. Those subjects can be taught 
by the university of the Highlands and Islands, which has 13 colleges that are 
underutilised at the moment. That would help the pupils and it would help the 
UHI.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, Donald Gorrie 
referred to a man who was educated during his holidays from Eton. I believe that 
he was Osbert Sitwell, who was in any event a very brainy fellow.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16:20</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr

iniquitous. However, in East Renfrewshire the evidence is clear.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When

have local schools for local people and their success is recognised by the whole 
community.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is not 
one easy answer as to why that should be so. However, I believe that the answer 
lies in the policies implemented by the Scottish </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14976">14976</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Administration and by our Labour 
colleagues at Westminster. The answer also lies in good school buildings, such 
as in the new Mearns Primary School in Eastwood, which was opened by the First 
Minister. That school is typical of the investment that has been made and that 
continues to be made in the education infrastructure throughout Scotland&#151;public-private 
partnership or otherwise.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
answer also lies in smaller class sizes in conjunction with the success of the 
classroom assistant programme, which has reduced the adult-child ratio, freed 
up teacher time and improved discipline. The answer also lies in the huge expansion 
of nursery and after-school care, which gives young people the best start in life. 
The answer also lies, of course, in the McCrone agreement, which recognises the 
professional commitment of our teachers and has ended the damaging and pointless 
institutional hostility between teachers and Government, which was inherited from 
the Tory years.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There has 
also been a great deal of local innovation, particularly the community school 
programme. Local primary and secondary schools, health services, social work and&#151;most 
important&#151;the local community have been able to come together in the comprehensive 
spirit to achieve the best outcome for local people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
highlight the success of community schools but I draw the minister's attention 
to a particular area that could do with that attention, which is the work of speech 
and language therapists. I know that the minister is aware of the problems that 
exist in that area, but some of those could be resolved by more flexible local 
working. Speech and language therapists are currently accountable to the local 
health boards, but pupils would greatly benefit if head teachers had more control 
over the deployment of therapists. The minister might wish to pursue that issue 
with her colleagues in the health department.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
are many examples of local flexibility, but greater flexibility would be appreciated, 
particularly in my area, in the tricky subject of placing requests. The current 
system puts an enormous burden on local authorities, puts families through the 
mill and distresses large numbers of pupils out of all proportion to the number 
who actually go to a different school from the one to which they would otherwise 
go. The solution lies not with nationally framed legislation but with giving local 
authorities the powers to frame guidelines to suit local circumstances and needs.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
will conclude on the over-emphasis on assessment in an already crowded curriculum, 
which is a concern that emerged from the national debate on education and which 
is certainly a worry to parents, teachers and pupils in my area. The </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14977">14977</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">presumption that studying for eight 
standard grades is the most appropriate and best way for our young people to progress 
is clearly not true.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
point made by others and which is alluded to by the Tory amendment is that we 
need to find ways to allow pupils to take more vocational courses, but only when 
that is in their best interests. For example, the difficulty that some young people 
might have with a foreign language should not prevent them achieving their potential 
across a range of other subjects at the age of 16.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Where 
secondary schools have been practising inclusion for some time now, learning support 
teachers are having to develop materials for pupils entering S3 and S4, but they 
still run into the obstacle of how to give those pupils credit without their having

was hardly a statement with which I could disagree, but the debate has not begun

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">about it before. Members should ask 
themselves what education would look like and feel like then. What would the quality 
of education be? What concerns would we have to address? How would we construct 
our educational system without an examination system? If we did that, we might 
start to think along the right lines. However, we would still have to have examinations 
because, as has been repeated time and again, for many people, the purpose of 
education is to fit people to society. I challenge that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
Jackie Baillie talked about confidence, motivation, initiative, self-expression

Harper: </strong>In Scotland, we have 50 per cent fewer business start-ups than the 
south of England has and we have a considerably greater failure rate among those 
start-ups. Businesses tell us that what they want from school leavers are the 
qualities that Jackie Baillie listed, not pieces of paper.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
Rumbles: </strong>That is all very well and it is great to hear such radical ideas 
but, from a business perspective, how would we measure whether the kids coming 
out of school have those abilities? What sort of examination would replace all 
the ones that Robin Harper would abolish?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Robin 
Harper: </strong>The answer is simple. If every pupil were encouraged to develop their 
full potential, most of them would leave with those qualities. An examination 
would not be needed, because the abilities that they had would be perfectly apparent 
to an employer, especially if we used the system of self-evaluation and evaluation 
by teachers that we already use when pupils apply for university. I have experience 
of that from my time as a guidance teacher. An appraisal of a pupil's qualities 
needs no examination; it is pure common sense.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is 
our education system fit for the purpose of turning out young people who have 
the qualities of self-confidence and self-esteem and who are prepared to challenge 
things? That is an important aspect: will our young people be able to challenge 
the way things are or will they simply fit in with society? That question must 
be asked, as the answer is probably that we are not preparing young people in 
the best way for the outside world.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Michael

a really good look&#151;as we did in the debate&#151;at the part that music, drama 
and art can play, but we also need to consider outdoor education, forest schools 
education and environment education. If we asked all the voluntary organisations 
in Scotland that deal with young people for their favoured method of encouraging 
self-confidence and self-esteem in young people, we would find that it is to get 
them outdoors.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What has 
happened to outdoor education in Scottish education? Since we lost the economies 
of scale of regional council education authorities, it has almost completely disappeared. 
We must get it back by one means or another, even if that means knocking heads 
together in a few councils and saying, &quot;Will you please get your heads together 
and do something about this?&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let 
us have room for real flexibility and innovation. Let us say to head teachers 
that, if they want to change their timetable completely, they can. Let us say 
to them&#151;to take up the point that Ken Macintosh made&#151;that if they want 
to say to children, &quot;You can just do four or five standard grades and then 
go and do art or go to the local college&quot;, they can. The point that the Conservatives 
made, which was misinterpreted, was simply that we should allow children and young 
people to decide at 14 where and how they will be educated.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">improvement. That leads me to have 
some sympathy with points that are made in the Scottish National Party amendment, 
particularly those about the exam system and the need to reduce the burden of 
assessment on teachers&#151;the Education, Culture and Sport Committee's experience 
of the SQA bore that out&#151;and about</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;the

schools and school management.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
once again, the SNP could not help itself and had to wrap those good points in 
political rhetoric. I find myself unable to support the amendment because of the 
way in which it has been packaged.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is a real need to address the issues. I have highlighted some of them. I will 
make other specific points, which I hope the minister will be able to answer in 
his closing speech or later. The first relates to flexibility and how it applies 
to children and young people with dyslexia. Ministers will be aware of my interest 
in that subject over the past few months. Greater consideration must be given 
to how that group of individuals can be given better support to realise their 
potential and to how the flexibility that is available&#151;particularly through 
modern technology&#151;can be used to help them to do that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
second point relates to sports comprehensives. I welcome the comments that the 
minister made in her introductory remarks. During the investigation that I undertook 
for a committee report three years ago, I visited a sports college in Manchester. 
I was impressed by the way in which sport was used across the curriculum to enable 
young people to learn subjects in which they might otherwise not have been as 
interested. It was particularly heartening for me to see young boys of secondary 
2 age engaged fully in education because they were doing it through a medium in 
which they were interested.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
welcome the fact that North Lanarkshire Council has had the courage to move ahead 
with the sports comprehensives project within the comprehensive system. I hope 
that the minister will examine that example and consider how it can be used throughout 
Scotland in future.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
next point relates to teachers. We are right to say that teachers are a valuable 
asset. That is clear to me when I look back on my educational experience. The 
good teachers are the bits of that experience that I remember. They are the people 
who had an impact on me and who helped me to learn.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the agenda. We must continue to point 
out that support staff, equally, play a valuable role in the learning experience 
of our children and young people. Classroom assistants are not a substitute for 
teachers, but they are a welcome addition to the classroom setting. I know from 
experience in my constituency that they are not just responsible for wiping noses 
and checking jotters; they have been valuable assets in the classroom, and I hope 
that we will be able to support them and to develop their learning potential, 
as well as that of the children.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
fourth point is on lifelong education. Donald Gorrie, I think, made some worthy, 
nice points about the need to encapsulate such things. There is more of a need 
for greater co-ordination between local authority departments. I had the strange 
view that, following the reorganisation to single-tier local authorities, co-ordination 
between education and community education would take place. That co-ordination 
does not take place as well as it could. We need to consider how to develop further 
the role of community education in supporting learning, both before and after 
school, particularly in relation to homework. Many pupils do not live in an environment 
that means that they can go home and learn effectively.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
minister said in her opening speech that she had some sympathy with the Tory amendment. 
I, too, had some sympathy with it when I read it, but I am slightly concerned 
by the comments that Alex Johnstone and Mike Rumbles made in referring to difficult 
children. The Tory amendment is not about dealing with difficult children. We 
need to reflect on why children do not find the school environment supportive.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>In a past life, I worked with vulnerable children who were not accommodated

difficult or disadvantaged young people out of school. If that were the case, 
I would not give the amendment any support. I interpret the amendment&#151;and 
I hope that this will be clarified in Murdo Fraser's summing up&#151;as dealing

we heard some fine words from him about extending flexibility and choice. I am 
not sure exactly what he was signalling, but such a move would be extremely welcome 
on this side of the chamber. In fact, we have been calling for more flexibility 
and choice for years. If the First Minister's conversion towards Tory ideas on 
education is genuine&#151;I suspect in the teeth of opposition from the Minister 
for Education and Young People&#151;then that is welcome. Therefore, we have not 
sought to amend the motion; we have simply made an addendum.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I

Fraser: </strong>I am obliged to the minister for that clarification, and I will deal

Bright children, those with parental support and those who attend the top-performing 
comprehensives do well out of the current system, but the system fails too many 
others. I am talking in particular about those who struggle in class, those whose 
home environment is not supportive and those who are trapped in the catchment

we discussed what the term &quot;comprehensive&quot; means. The minister talked 
about the comprehensive principle and I tried to tease out from her exactly what 
that meant. The word &quot;comprehensive&quot; seems to have become a Humpty-dumpty 
word&#151;it means anything that people want it to mean. The minister says that 
it is possible for a comprehensive school with a specialisation in sports or the 
arts to select on the basis of ability. She says that it is possible for a comprehensive 
school to reject mixed-ability teaching and to have setting and streaming. If 
that is her vision of comprehensive schools, she will not encounter much opposition 
from Conservative members. However, I wonder if that is what she means.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Robin

set out our proposal in detail. We all know that our schools include some 14 and 
15-year-olds who have no interest in academic subjects. Their presence in school&#151;if 
they attend and do not add to our appalling truancy statistics&#151;can be disruptive

McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>As we have heard from a number of speakers 
this afternoon, flexibility has been and will continue to be a key aspect of the 
Scottish education system, but it has become increasingly difficult to practice 
with the raft of central Government guidelines, initiatives and targets. For schools 
to take advantage of flexibility and innovation, we suggest that there requires 
to be a simplification of the current processes&#151;a point that Karen Gillon 
conceded. There has to be a simplification of the exams system, a reduction in 
bureaucracy, the creation of clear paths and links to further education and an 
end to the overly complex and inflexible PFI initiatives to fund school buildings 
and management. I accept that Karen Gillon would not concede the latter point.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
need to implement policies that deal with the big issues in education is obvious. 
Evidence shows that child poverty is increasing, that violence and bullying in 
the classroom are rising and that the gap in educational attainment is widening. 
The minister and Jackie Baillie acknowledged the negative impact of those factors.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">education, the Scottish Executive 
should focus on the strategies that will drive up attainment across the social 
spectrum and throughout Scotland. To pick up on Tommy Sheridan's point, I was 
concerned to note that only 5 per cent of pupils in Dundee achieve five highers, 
while 58.6 per cent of pupils in East Renfrewshire achieve five highers. That 
is not equality of opportunity.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
am not sure that it was necessarily helpful for the First Minister to be reported 
as saying yesterday that slack teachers and dithering education chiefs will not 
be allowed to stand in the way of a first-class education for every Scottish child. 
That not only seems to imply that teachers are in large measure to blame for the 
current poor situation in education, which is extremely insulting, but it ignores 
the fact that the majority of teachers are hard-working and equally committed 
to the idea of excellence for everyone.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
want to mention two issues briefly. One is flexibility in language provision. 
It was good to hear the minister's example from Aberdeen, which involved very 
young children, and Duncan McNeil's rosy picture of language learning in his area, 
but that is not the norm. Previous guidance, which stated that at least one language 
other than English should be pursued through S3 and S4, was replaced with an entitlement 
to some education in a modern language from primary 6, which did not require to 
be pursued beyond S2. There are concerns that that approach to language learning 
will downgrade and create further decline in language options in schools. The 
choice in many schools is already limited to French and I accept that that is 
not appropriate for everyone. Choice and flexibility are not available to everybody 
who wants them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we acknowledge 
the importance of languages, we should strive for every Scot to be multilingual 
and should support choice in modern European, indigenous and community language 
options if they are needed. As language expert Professor Joe Lo Bianco puts it, 
&quot;Monolingualism implies self-imposed dependency,&quot; which is something 
that we must strive to end. In Ireland, promotion of its indigenous language has 
resulted in commonly held bilingualism and an increased interest in further language 
learning. In 1998, 40 per cent of Irish students took a modern language exam for 
their leaving certificate, compared with only 12 per cent of pupils in Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, 
I want to mention the situation faced by families who chose to home-educate their 
children. It could be argued that they have, in effect, rejected the one-size-fits-all 
approach and have gone for flexibility and innovation in education.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is almost a year since the Executive drafted guidance on home education. That 
guidance </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14987">14987</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

since the consultation period ended. In the meantime, MSPs are dealing with a 
number of families who are suffering harassment and persecution by local authorities 
that defend their actions by citing the guidance, even though it is only draft 
guidance. The minister has yet to intervene to alleviate what is an unacceptable 
situation for the children concerned.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
national debate and the inquiry into the purposes of education by the Education, 
Culture and Sport Committee have been mentioned. Smaller class sizes were identified 
as a key theme in the national debate and were supported by the Educational Institute 
of Scotland, the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association, the Scottish School 
Board Association, educationists, teachers, parents and pupils. The subject of 
smaller class sizes has dominated the debate. In the document giving children's 
views on education, to which Fiona McLeod referred extensively, young people mentioned 
smaller classes in three out of the 11 key bullet points. Smaller class sizes 
were one of two overwhelming messages. Given that that message came directly from 
young people, I hope that the minister will take serious note of it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Robin

he said that Scotland was near the bottom of the table, whereas the reverse is 
true: Scotland is near the top of the table. For example, in the recent Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development's programme for international student 
assessment studies of reading, maths and science, we are in the top 10 in every 
subject in comparison with 31 other OECD developed nations. Few European countries 
are ahead of us. Canada, New Zealand or Japan are often at the top&#151;but never

in the other. Perhaps the minister should read his brief a wee bit more astutely.

Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab): </strong>On a point of order. I wonder whether it would 
be of assistance if, as the convener of the Social Justice Committee, I informed 
the chamber that stage 2 of the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill 
was completed on 30 October and it was known what we would need to amend thereafter. 
Therefore, it has been possible to prepare amendments from 30 October.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The

I confirm what the convener of the Social Justice Committee said. Members had 
from 30 October until this Friday to lodge amendments, so I do not know what the 
problem is&#151;[<I>Interruption.</I>] There is plenty of time for the lodging

European science week.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
would like to say a little about the Royal Society of Chemistry, which is the 
learned society for chemical sciences and the professional body for chemical scientists 
in the UK. It has more than 46,000 members worldwide, is a major publisher and 
provider of chemical information and supports the teaching of the chemical sciences 
at all levels. It organises hundreds of chemical meetings every year and is a 
leader in communicating science to the public.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
my motion says, Scottish scientists are world beaters. The results of the 2001 
research assessment exercise confirmed that universities and higher education 
colleges in Scotland are leaders in carrying out internationally competitive research. 
In Scotland 5,666 academic staff were submitted for assessment under the exercise&#151;12 
per cent of those submitted for assessment across the United Kingdom as a whole. 
That figure is much higher than Scotland's percentage share of the population, 
which is less than 9 per cent.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
the numbers studying science at higher and degree level have been falling over 
the past few years, and that fall is especially pronounced in the chemistry and 
physics fields. Between 1993 and 2001, there was a large decrease in the number 
of pupils passing higher grade sciences. Chemistry was down from 10.8 per cent 
of the school roll to 9.2 per cent, physics was down from 10.4 per cent to 9 per 
cent, and biology was down from 7.6 per cent to 6.6 per cent.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
will refer now to science numbers in higher and further education. Answers to 
parliamentary questions have revealed the true extent of the decline in popularity 
of physics and chemistry degree courses in Scotland. It is astonishing that there 
has been a 27 per cent drop in applications to chemistry courses over the past 
five years, and a 19 per cent drop in applications to physics courses. The drop 
in acceptances is even greater, with a 30 per cent drop in chemistry and a 34 
per cent drop in physics.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scotland 
is expected to face a shortage of physics and chemistry teachers in a few years' 
time, when numbers of physics and chemistry teachers retire and new posts come 
on stream.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Kenneth 
Macintosh (Eastwood) (Lab): </strong>I do not think that my own example is a particularly 
good one. I did sixth-year chemistry, but chose instead to study history at university.

agree that we must recruit more chemistry and general science teachers? Is not 
that the most important step that we can take?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dr 
Jackson: </strong>That is exactly right. I thank Kenneth Macintosh for that intervention 
and I will go on to say more about the points that he raised.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Science 
teachers, many of whom were recruited at the same time as I was when I first went 
into teaching and are therefore of a similar age, are among the oldest group of 
teachers in our schools. That fact, combined with the falling number of applicants 
to train as teachers, is likely to result in a shortfall of teachers, especially 
experienced ones. That is a vital issue. Local councils predict that they will 
need 763 new science teachers over the next six years and 321 for physics alone.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>John 
Young (West of Scotland) (Con): </strong>In view of the considerable reductions in 
chemistry and physics and the other reductions that she has mentioned, does Sylvia 
Jackson have any comparisons with other countries in western Europe? Are there 
similar reductions in France, Germany or Holland, or do we not have figures?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dr 
Jackson: </strong>I wish that John Young had given me notice of that question. I shall 
certainly try to find out and give him that information. In fact, the Deputy Minister 
for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning, who has much greater resources 
at his disposal, might be able to answer that question.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Scottish Executive's report on the supply of teachers shows that physics has been 
listed as a priority subject for some time and that chemistry, biology and science 
are in the top 13 subjects that are identified as priorities by councils. Although 
there is currently no overall shortage of science teachers, the number of applicants 
applying to do teacher training in the sciences has fallen in recent years, especially 
in physics and chemistry.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
it would be unfair to say that the Scottish Executive is not listening or pursuing 
useful policies. Those policies include the science strategy for Scotland; the 
creation of an independent Scottish science advisory committee; an £8 million 
investment in science equipment and training for schools; developments within 
the five-to-14 science education programme; science year in Scotland; the national 
education debate; the Royal Society of Edinburgh teaching fellowship; increasing 
research funds for the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council; and, of course, 
the school building programme, which is upgrading and building many new school 
laboratories.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Trish

the sciences?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Deputy 
Presiding Officer: </strong>I suppose that Dr Jackson would like extra time to compensate 
for all the interventions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dr 
Jackson: </strong>I would like that, Presiding Officer.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
have been long campaigns to encourage more girls into the sciences, particularly 
into physics and chemistry. Those campaigns have been more at school than at university 
level. The Association for Science Education, of which I have been a member for 
too long, as I said, has dealt with such campaigns.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
science community, which includes the many science associations that I listed 
earlier, has suggested a number of measures that could improve matters. Members 
of those associations are in the gallery. First, there could be a Scottish centre 
for teaching excellence. To build on recent developments in science and teaching, 
the Scottish Executive should back the creation of a Scottish centre for science 
education. It would support continuing professional development, which is at the 
heart of the McCrone settlement, and developments in that respect, and it should 
be a partnership of all Scotland's universities and the scientific societies and 
institutes. I hope that there will be a centre in every region of Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, 
there should be incentives to recruit more science teachers. My colleague Kenneth 
Macintosh asked about those. Such incentives would help to tackle the potential 
shortage of quality science teachers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thirdly, 
there should be even more investment in school laboratories. To provide a modern 
science teaching environment, additional resources will be needed. Indeed, it 
has been calculated that £13 million should be invested each year fully to equip 
Scotland's secondary school laboratories and to keep them up to date. We desperately 
need an audit of secondary school laboratories to assess what investment is required 
and to find out whether £13 million has been invested. Improving school science 
facilities would also help to attract more pupils into the sciences. In recent 
years, a related issue has been the need to include more science in the training 
of primary teachers and the on-going professional development needs of teachers 
in primary and secondary schools.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, 
there should be a network of Scottish science centres. The Scottish Executive 
should invest in Scotland's science centres in order to secure their financial 
future, support their work on the public engagement with science, cut the cost 
of entry to the public in a similar way to the scheme for free entry to museums 
and develop their role in the formal science education network. </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col15005">15005</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The work of the Scottish Science 
Trust in supporting pupils and teachers in informal science education through 
such centres is well known. I gather that the core funding for that organisation 
is being reviewed, but it is likely to be received too late to prevent the trust's 
closure. I have spoken to the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong 
Learning rather than the deputy minister, who is here tonight, about the issue 
and look forward to a response. If that is not possible tonight, I look forward 
to one in the near future.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I

I say how pleased I am that, another year on, the Parliament has another opportunity 
to debate science issues.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
a recent newspaper article, the chair of the Scottish Science Advisory Committee 
used the example of China and outlined the lengths to which that country's leaders 
are going to encourage a strong science base. They recognise that science can 
contribute to wealth creation and they have invested heavily in scientific infrastructure. 
They are providing good opportunities for outstanding Chinese scientists to return 
to China. The implication is that Scotland needs to provide similar incentives 
to encourage the return of its own highly able graduates and postgraduates, many 
of whom work in other parts of the world.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is a constant source of amazement to me that despite coming from a parental home 
that has much more of an arts ethos, both my children are science graduates and 
one makes his living as a research scientist&#151;outwith Scotland, it has to 
be said. I could say to the minister that that is entirely because he wanted to 
take advantage of the better opportunities in Denmark to study renewable energy 
and that kind of thing, but that would be only partly true. His primary reason 
for moving was that he fell in love with a beautiful Danish girl, and they are 
very happy together. The message remains valid, however; if other countries are 
getting state-of-the-art equipment and offering higher salaries within an improved 
career structure, we must ensure that we are competitive and offer similar conditions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">science at school and to get them 
to study science at higher level and beyond. From my family experience, I know 
that it is not easy to identify exactly what prompts that interest and I expect 
that the impetus varies from student to student, so addressing the problem of 
raising the numbers will remain a difficult one.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is no doubt that we need to take action. Over the past seven years in Scotland 
there has&#151;as has been made clear&#151;been a massive reduction in the number 
of people choosing to study science, particularly at university. There are also 
concerns about the number of young people taking science at school.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
obvious encouragement, which was touched on by Sylvia Jackson, would be schools' 
having good up-to-date equipment. Schools need that to help them to make the science 
that they teach reflect the modern way that science is done. In this increasingly 
technological age, young people will not be impressed or enthused by old worn-out 
equipment and infrastructure. I appreciate the £8 million that has been allocated 
by the Executive for school equipment, infrastructure and training, but it is 
estimated that at least £50 million will be needed to bring our school laboratory 
facilities up to scratch and worthy of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. I will leave 
that thought with the minister.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
for teachers, it is critical that we are able to recruit sufficient high-quality 
staff for our science departments. It might be that having identified physics, 
chemistry and biology as priority subjects, we might need to be even more innovative 
and proactive in attracting trainee teachers to those subjects. Science is important 
to the economic, social and environmental well-being of the country. We in the 
Parliament must do all that we can to promote science's development.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:28</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Elaine

University of Aberdeen has made use of proof-of-concept funding in commercialising 
science&#151;researchers at the university are working on shark antibodies, which 
will apparently make us all much healthier&#151;and the Robert Gordon University 
does immensely important work on renewables, particularly on tidal streams. We 
also have the scientists in the marine laboratory, whose work is accepted by the 
fishing industry, however much its conclusions are hotly disputed. All those people 
carry out vital research that contributes to the well-being of Scotland's people 
and its natural environment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
want to mention the role of science and technology in the oil and gas industry. 
The development of the North sea has been underpinned by innovative solutions 
to complex problems that demand high levels of skill and expertise from scientists 
and engineers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To continue 
to supply industry and academia with the people required, it is essential that 
we enthuse young people about science and technology. As Sylvia Jackson and Irene 
McGugan said, the recent fall in the number of school and university students 
who pursue studies in science, technology and engineering is worrying and will 
undoubtedly contribute to the developing skill shortage. There are great potential 
opportunities in what we hope will be a new industry in Scotland based around 
renewables. Even more than in the oil and gas industry, the skills that are required 
for renewables will be science and technology based. It is becoming more important 
that we ensure that enough young people are attracted to science.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
lot of good work is being done in the science centres throughout Scotland. Satrosphere 
in Aberdeen introduces children to science as fun. Such centres need better and 
more secure funding. Even more important is the work of organisations such as 
the Grampian science and technology network, whose activities are being rolled 
out throughout Scotland. The programme works with primary and secondary schools 
and has been developed in conjunction with private companies such as BP. The programme 
supports primary school teachers in teaching science and technology and often 
works with the youngest pupils. At a more senior level, the scheme provides mentoring 
for advanced technology students. For example, students are linked to BP engineers 
who work offshore. The scheme has been highly successful for the schools and companies 
that are involved.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As members

shall concentrate on one of the points that she made, which registered strongly 
with me, about the lack of employment opportunities for young skilled scientists, 
especially in our rural communities. I am sure that the minister, who cut his 
political teeth in the constituency of Moray, will understand that employment 
opportunities are an important aspect of retaining and recruiting scientists. 
Paula Hedley said that it is a long way from Buckie to the central belt. She lives 
in Portknockie, which is even further from the central belt. If Paula were to 
follow a career in science, the only jobs that would come along would be in our

as legislators, we must consider how we can recruit and retain the skills of such 
people in the scientific sphere in our rural communities and our more remote areas, 
rather than just in Scotland as a whole.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over 
the many years in which I have been involved with politics, one of the issues 
that has haunted us has been the so-called brain drain from Scotland. My colleague 
Irene McGugan spoke about her son falling in love with a young Dane but also finding 
opportunities in Denmark that we could not offer at home. All the statistics that 
we have heard&#151;I will not repeat them, because those who have read Willie 
Rennie's briefings will be only too well aware of them&#151;show that science 
seems to be becoming a less attractive option for our young people; that the number 
of science recruits is falling in schools, universities and colleges and that 
the number of science teachers is falling because many of the principal teachers 
are approaching retirement age.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those 
are depressing omens for the future of the skills base in Scotland. They must 
be addressed over and above the strategy that the Scottish Executive has put before 
us and which has been endorsed by the Parliament. Additional resources will be 
required, but we must show the political will to ensure that our young people 
are not deprived of the facilities that they need to advance their careers in 
science.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:37</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr

come from a science background. During my first year at university, I studied 
chemistry, physics, botany and zoology, which also took me into brewing and other 
delightful arts that required visits to the various establishments up and down

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Edinburgh. The report of that debate 
states that it is necessary to</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;encourage 
greater uptake among young people of scientific subjects by, for example, identifying 
good role models among members of the scientific community who had been commercially 
successful.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
is an important issue for the Scottish economy. We are beginning to see good signs 
in the commercialisation of biomedical science, which was mentioned earlier. That 
is essential. Another point to emerge from that debate is one that I have raised 
with ministers over the three years of the Parliament. The report states:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Cross-disciplinary 
research should be encouraged: in its present form the Research Assessment Exercise 
could be an obstacle to such collaboration.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is an even greater obstacle&#151;I had a good dialogue with Wendy Alexander about 
this&#151;when one is not allowed to mix the Government funding for higher education 
research with money from an industrial company. That is nonsense, because the 
two feed off each other. Clearly we must attack that issue.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Elaine 
Thomson referred to Satrosphere in Aberdeen and there are other places, such as 
Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh and Sensation in Dundee. It is important that we engage 
and enthuse young people at an early age. I remember David Bellamy and Magnus 
Pyke, who gave tremendously exciting theatrical performances on television that 
made science come alive. We need more enthusiasm and good advocates, but we must 
start children early.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Basic 
science can be taught in nursery and primary schools and does not require a huge 
degree of input because it excites children to find out how the world works, what 
reactions are and how things operate. It is important that we get people to become 
investigative at a younger age&#151;that point applies to all education but particularly 
to subjects that lead on to science.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
am sure that Alex Neil and others will refer to the entrepreneurial advantage 
that we have in Scotland and its value to the economy. Commercialisation is essential, 
but&#151;to quote the five Es at members&#151;the most important thing is that 
early on we must engage, excite and enthuse, as Irene McGugan said, and then we 
must educate and encourage.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:41</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Alex

of course.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col15011">15011</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will concentrate on two aspects 
that go together: the commercialisation of research, and science education. I 
will refer back to the report that was published by the Enterprise and Lifelong 
Learning Committee about this time last year on university research and teaching.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Four 
things need to be done if we are serious about commercialisation. First, we need 
to overhaul the research assessment exercise in the way that David Davidson mentioned 
and make it much simpler. The current system is crazy. For example, an academic 
who published four articles in prestigious journals would get the maximum brownie 
points through the RAE. However, if he or she took out a patent, they would get 
few brownie points. If they set up a spin-out company, they would get no brownie 
points whatever.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things 
should be the other way round. The situation is particularly ridiculous because 
many of our foreign industrial competitors would use the four articles in the 
prestigious journals to get the intellectual property required for them to patent 
a product and would get all the commercial benefit from that. Therefore, a total 
overhaul of the RAE is required.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, 
we need to learn from the University of Cambridge model of encouraging the commercialisation 
of its academics' research. The tight funding of Scottish universities means that 
they are totally reliant on what is essentially marginal revenue from the sale 
of intellectual property and patents that result from research. However, the University 
of Cambridge makes no claim to any of its academics' research work. They retain 
the rights over it. Therefore, they have access to the intellectual property rights, 
the patent rights and so on. The spin-out rate around Cambridge has exploded because 
of that, creating new wealth and jobs on an unprecedented scale. In addition, 
those people to whom the university gave a chance are voluntarily donating to 
the university through endowments and all the rest of it. We need to consider 
doing a deal with our universities to repeat the Cambridge model.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
third point is that the Executive's budget, under the heading of enterprise and 
lifelong learning, rightly sets a long-term target of getting the level of business 
spend on research and development up to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development average. We currently spend 0.53 per cent of our gross domestic 
product on business research and development. To get to the OECD average, that 
figure needs to rise to 1.54 per cent. That means an additional spend, year on 
year, of £750 million on business research and development. We have to try to 
get to that level if we are to remain a modern, industrial and competitive nation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To

Jackson on securing the debate. For the benefit of our welcome guests in the gallery, 
I point out that these 5 o'clock debates were recently described as being rather 
similar to tutorials. I commend that description to our guests as it nicely brings 
out the thoughtful style in which we conduct these debates.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
excellent points have been made on the issue of getting young people to study 
science at school and university. However, what does a first-class honours graduate 
who is deciding what to do next and who turns to the job advertisements in the 
back pages of the <I>New Scientist</I> discover? That the money on offer is rubbish. 
If someone is offered the choice of going into academia as a research chemist 
or joining the Charlotte Square mafia of fund managers, it is clear which way 
they will go if filthy lucre is what appeals to them&#151;although I admit that 
there is a small possibility that what is happening in the stock market might 
alter that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want to fly 
a kite for a moment. I might be wrong, but I think that there is an impression 
that, if someone joins a British company as a chemist&#151;or any other sort of 
science graduate&#151;in 10 or 20 years' time, they might still be a chemist. 
The career progression from newly employed scientist to board member is not always 
evident. I am prepared to be shot down on that point, but it is worth considering. 
We must remember that there is a nasty snobbery about arts degrees being better 
than science degrees. I need that career progression to be explained to me.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
an example of the problems that can be caused by the impression that I am talking 
about, I will mention my son, who got good highers in science but, for many reasons, 
decided that science was not the way forward and has chosen to read economics 
at the University of Edinburgh next year. That might link back to what was said 
during this afternoon's debate on education.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
couple of weeks ago, I and some other members attended a good get-together that 
was organised by the Foundation for Science and Technology. The subject was, more 
or less, &quot;Whither science in Scotland?&quot; and much good stuff was said.

the by, our colleges of veterinary science, such as the Royal (Dick) School of 
Veterinary Studies&#151;the Dick vet&#151;in Edinburgh, require students to have 
five As, including as many sciences as possible. The courses are oversubscribed 
by a ratio of 8:1. What an appalling waste of talent it is that seven out of eight 
or eight out of nine young people who made up their minds to do veterinary medicine 
were not encouraged along the way by the school careers service to think about 
having some other scientific career in their back pocket, because veterinary science 
is not the only career and entry to it is so competitive. There is a discontinuity 
in the way in which we encourage young people along scientific pathways.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
the debate on education this afternoon, we talked about flexibility. The Executive 
should investigate the ways in which schools generally get students out of school 
into engineering projects. Safety&#151;hard hats and so on&#151;gets in the way 
of such activities. However, that kind of hands-on experience is important. I 
am thinking not only about the provision of equipment in school, but about getting 
pupils out of school. We must do everything that we can through the careers service 
to upgrade science as a career.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:54</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Brian

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is noticeable that, if a university 
course is given an appropriate label, folk will be attracted to it. Nowadays, 
not only are medicine and veterinary science oversubscribed, but forensic science 
is, too. The attraction exists because forensic science is portrayed on television 
as an exciting, sexy profession. Having spent a large part of my life as a forensic 
scientist, dealing with forensic toxicology, I am not sure whether I recognise 
what is on television. However, forensic science excited me. It was not a deadly 
dull, dreary drudge of a job, but I do not know how we can convey that to young 
people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no doubt 
that we are producing science graduates of quality and that the future of industry 
and of the economy will rely on them. We are no longer going to be the screwdriver 
economy; we must drive up standards and attract much better quality jobs. We have 
attracted developments in biotechnology industries in particular, for which we 
need graduates. It is noticeable that the uptake in biological sciences reflects 
that need, although there has been a small decline even in that field, if not 
the severe decline that has taken place in physics and engineering.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
issue is not just the financial rewards, although they are important. People need 
job satisfaction and intellectual stimulation; they need to feel that they are 
doing something of worth to society. That is what is required to attract young 
people to become the scientists and engineers that our society needs.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
do not have an instant answer to the problem. We should certainly focus on the 
kinds of courses that I have mentioned and, regardless of whether they are given 
the necessary veneer to attract an oversubscription of scientists&#151;not that 
many courses achieve that&#151;we should try to make the professions more attractive

secondary schools in my constituency that have not yet been replaced or refurbished.

with inappropriate and outdated facilities. It is not an exaggeration to say that

half of our researchers work in departments that produce internationally competitive 
research. We now have 19 departments that have achieved the highest rating in 
research, which is around double the figure for the previous assessment exercise.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Alex 
Neil: </strong>I accept all the figures that the minister has just given and they are 
to be celebrated. One area in which we are way behind is our share of defence 
research expenditure, for which there is a huge budget. Although I would not wish 
some aspects of defence research to come to Scotland, will the minister give an 
undertaking that he will talk to the Ministry of Defence and the appropriate agencies 
about increasing Scotland's share of defence research?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis 
Macdonald: </strong>No. I have tried to indicate today that the higher education sector 
in Scotland is perfectly capable of making its own case and it does not require 
any special treatment in its relations with the Ministry of Defence, or anybody 
else, because of the excellence that has been </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col15019">15019</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">achieved. Alex Neil might have ambitions 
for our universities to enter other areas of research, but I think that we should 
build on the excellence that is already in place.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
are many good stories to tell, but we have heard tonight from Sylvia Jackson and 
others about the concerns that interest in science and technology in schools and 
universities might be on the wane. We acknowledge the importance of those indicators. 
That is why our science strategy, which was published in August last year, committed 
the Executive to ensuring that enough people study science to meet the needs of 
our country. More broadly, we see science and skills as the main drivers of the 
modern knowledge economy. For that reason we are concerned about any decline in 
interest in those subjects within the education system.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
UK-wide Roberts report investigated those concerns and concluded that significant 
issues were at stake. We will certainly wish to address those. The question was 
asked about comparators outside Scotland. The Roberts report considered that the 
problems in Scotland were fewer because of the higher participation rates in post-school 
education compared with those south of the border. There is encouragement in that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is encouragement in the fact that half of all children leaving school with highers 
have achieved at least one science higher and a quarter of all children have achieved 
at least two. It remains the case that, after English and Mathematics, the most 
popular individual subjects include a number of science subjects. The situation 
with technological studies is less happy at standard grade, but at higher level 
the situation has remained fairly steady.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is a mixed picture in higher education. As has been said in recent years, students 
have been taking pure physics and chemistry in smaller numbers. At the same time, 
the number of students who are taking biological studies and information technology 
courses has been on the increase. Many students now take a mixture of disciplines 
and so comparisons over time have become difficult. It is worth noting that between 
2000 and 2001, the most recent year for which figures are available, the number 
of students who were accepted to take up science and engineering courses increased 
by 4 per cent to a current total of more than 9,000.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
I acknowledge that there are issues and concerns to be addressed, I do not believe 
that we are facing an insoluble crisis in the study of science. I acknowledge 
that there will be areas of both growth and loss.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>John 
Young: </strong>I am a non-scientist and a non-physicist, so the minister must excuse 
my </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col15020">15020</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ignorance. China was mentioned earlier. 
I am sure that that was correct, but one cannot compare China with western Europe, 
for obvious reasons. Are the various qualifications that one can obtain in such 
subjects in this country recognised in most west European countries? In other 
words, are such qualifications interchangeable?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis 
Macdonald: </strong>I can see that John Young is following a European project this 
evening. I will be happy to respond in writing to his earlier query to Sylvia 
Jackson and to his latest query about recognition of qualifications. That will 
give him the full picture.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
acknowledge that science will play an important part in contributing to our economic 
future, both in a European context and in a global context. We seek growth in 
areas of science that are strategically and economically important, as well as 
in those areas that are fashionable. That is why the independent science advisory 
committee that we have recently established will give us advice on those issues.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
have been working on a range of initiatives to promote science in schools. As 
has been mentioned, we have injected additional funding of £8 million into the 
school science infrastructure and have provided £1 billion of additional funding 
for school infrastructure in general. We have established the improving science 
education five-to-14 project, which is a major programme that has been designed 
to improve the image of science education in Scottish schools. In March, we will 
hold a major conference on science education over the next 20 years, to stimulate 
innovative thinking on the teaching of science. We must lift the teaching of science 
and make it more relevant to young people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
attitudes of young people are influenced by many pressures and by many role models. 
Many people in the gallery would acknowledge that scientists have an important 
role to play in projecting a positive image of science. Tackling public perceptions 
of science can be a long process that requires patience. The scientific community, 
above all, can work with Government in seeking to achieve that outcome.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 
science strategy sets out a firm statement of intent on the importance of science 
within our wider strategies. We will continue to take every opportunity to assist 
the universities in getting out the good stories on science and in celebrating 
their achievements and aspirations. The science strategy played an important role 
in shaping the spending review, which was set out only a few weeks ago. We will 
increase investment in science and research in universities by nearly 20 per cent 
during the next three years. That represents an increase of £45 million.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col15021">15021</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sylvia Jackson and others made specific 
suggestions, to which I wish to respond. We are aware of the proposals for a national 
centre of excellence in science teaching that have been introduced south of the 
border. Although there are no plans for such a centre in Scotland, we recognise 
the issues that the Roberts report identified. We are working with the Wellcome 
Trust on various ways in which those issues could be addressed. The science advisory 
committee will advise us on that and on other issues, such as continuous professional 
development for science teachers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
have made the recruitment of physics teachers a priority for education colleges, 
which has resulted in an increased take-up. If the need arises to do the same 
in other areas of science teaching, we will take the necessary action.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Science 
centres were mentioned. As Sylvia Jackson knows, we have occasionally provided 
short-term funding to address specific problems with science centres. We will 
develop our future policy on where science centres fit into our overall strategy 
in the context of the on-going joint review with UK ministers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Margaret 
Ewing referred to Paula Hedley's experience. The promotion of science and technology 
will work only if the rising generation becomes confident of gaining well-paid 
and well-supported jobs in which to use scientific skills.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is an issue about the relative lack of research and development in industry in 
Scotland. We acknowledge that, in many respects, we lag behind. We need Government 
action to tackle the situation and we need a push from the science base, through 
the commercialisation of scientific research.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
assure Alex Neil that significant energy and dynamism are being applied to introducing 
proposals for intermediate technology institutes. We consider them a vital part 
of commercialisation and of making industry provide role models, as well as scientists. 
The Government will provide a push in that direction. I agree that it is important 
to proceed with the institutes quickly, but it is also important to get them right, 
which we will seek to do.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Brian 
Adam: </strong>The centres of excellence, which are about to become intermediate technology 
institutes, have been in gestation for three years. Will the minister give members 
an idea of when we will see the institutes?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>The minister is four minutes over his allotted time.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis

activity is being undertaken in the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council. 
At Scottish Enterprise, the ITIs are an example of how we can achieve commercialisation.

that matter. That will present us with a major opportunity to ensure a better 
strategic fit between the research base and our economic future.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
welcome the debate and the motion. I assure Parliament that we will continue to
