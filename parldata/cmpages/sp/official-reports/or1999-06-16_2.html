<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):</strong>
The next item of business is a statement by the First Minister on the Executive's
legislative proposals. The First Minister will take questions at the end
of his statement for about 20 minutes, during which there should be no
interventions. Following those questions, we will move on to a debate on
the Executive's proposals. It might help the chamber if I say that those
who wish to ask questions should press their buttons during the statement.
Those who wish to speak in the debate should wait until the question period
is over.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">09:35</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister (Donald Dewar): </strong>With
your leave, Mr Presiding Officer, I would like to make a statement on the
Executive's first legislative programme.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have travelled a long road to get here.
There have been significant milestones on the way from the constitutional
convention to the reality of this, Scotland's Parliament. The driving force
has been the Labour Government that was elected in 1997; a Government that
put Scotland's Parliament at the forefront of its legislative programme
and that kept faith with the people. Today, we reach another milestone.
For the first time, a programme of legislation for Scotland will be laid
before a democratically elected Parliament in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are a young Parliament. We have not
yet taken up our formal powers. Much of our talk to date has been, of necessity,
about how we work as a Parliament as much as about what we do as a Parliament.
People ask when the Parliament will begin to make a difference. Today,
we begin to answer that question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a minute, I shall say more about the
bills that we shall introduce, but as a parliamentarian and as someone
who serves in this Parliament, I want first to say something about our
law-making powers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Let us not underestimate the scope and
range of powers available to this Parliament. There will be exceptional
and limited circumstances in which it is sensible and proper that the Westminster
Parliament legislates in devolved areas of responsibility, but that can
happen only with the consent of this Parliament-consent specifically given
after due process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Day in, day out, it is here that the law
of the land will be shaped and laid down. This Parliament is in charge
of a wide sweep of domestic policy, which will touch on the lives of every
man, woman and child in the land. This is fundamental, radical change.
This is, in every sense, a Parliament.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With that power
comes responsibilities. We shall pass laws, not because we are here and
must look busy, and not because someone grabs a microphone, or a megaphone,
and says that something-anything-must be done. We shall act for and in
the name of the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Already we can see one way in which the
Parliament can make a difference. Under the old dispensation, we could
reasonably expect to get one major piece of Scottish legislation through
Westminster in a year, but today I will be giving the Parliament details
of eight bills that will address matters of pressing importance to the
people of Scotland in ways that meet their concerns and needs-Scottish
solutions for Scottish problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I emphasise that that is just the start;
much more will follow over the lifetime of the Parliament. We are here
to keep promises; we will be watched closely and be judged on the way in
which we go about our business. There will inevitably be vigorous debate-so
there should be-but that debate should be of serious intent; it should
be aimed at improving, not wrecking. Legislation must be necessary and
well prepared. Our consideration must be thorough, open and accessible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need to understand what that means.
A balance must be struck between the understandable call for quick results
and the promise of genuine dialogue, proper scrutiny, and public and parliamentary
involvement. That balance will be a matter of fine judgment. Members must
understand-and must relay that understanding to those who watch our business-that
proper scrutiny takes time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is expected of us is sensible politics.
We have, through the cross-party deliberations of the consultative steering
group, created structures that will encourage consultation and necessary
scrutiny, but the smartest systems will not make a cheap debate a rich
debate-that is our challenge.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to say a word on partnership. When
I accepted the Parliament's nomination as First Minister, I said that I
would work with those who would work with me. The evidence of that is before
the Parliament. We present this legislative programme as a partnership
that is committed to stable and responsible government. In a democracy,
parties can and should work together where circumstances demand. This partnership
is built on common objectives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The eight bills that I will set out today
are the first return on that partnership. Let the test of what we do be
the end product. We are working together to deliver a programme of government
that will deliver for the people of Scotland; it is on that programme that
we should be judged. Our&nbsp;</font></td>

in a prosperous Scotland-a Scotland that is a vigorous and thriving part
of the global economy and in which all have the opportunity to fulfil their
potential.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must celebrate our unique cultural and
natural heritage. We must tackle the problems of transport and the environment.
We must build strong and stable communities in a Scotland where every family
can raise children in safety and decency, where affordable housing is within
the reach of all, where communities are not overshadowed by the fear of
crime and where communities, rural and urban, are valued. We must build
an enterprise economy, making the best use of our talents and encouraging
creativity and innovation. We must build a healthy nation, making our health
service among the best in Europe. Above all, at the edge of the 21<sup>st</sup>
century, we must build a world-class education system, unlocking opportunities
for all our children. By any standards, ours is a formidable agenda.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As a Parliament, we cannot accept a Scotland
where 4,000 children leave school each year without formal qualifications,
where heart disease and cancer have given us a mortality rate among the
worst in Europe, where one third of Scottish households have below half
the average UK income and where one quarter of our housing stock suffers
from dampness or condensation. We can use the powers of government-the
spending decisions, the policy initiatives and the power to connect, persuade,
cajole, encourage, preach and lead-to change that. We can, and we shall.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We shall work with the people as well as
for them. We shall work with local government, other public agencies, the
private and voluntary sectors and the communities of Scotland. We shall
do so with new energy and new commitment. We want to make this Parliament
what it can be-the democratic crucible in which we can test our ideas,
seek new inspiration and stand to account on our record. Where necessary,
we will invite the Parliament to use its law-making powers to change Scotland
for the better.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I now come to our first legislative programme.
The Victorian chancellor, George Goschen, was a touch dim but he was the
author of the Goschen formula-father of Barnett, as some members will know.
When he first entered Parliament, he wrote to the then Prime Minister,
Lord Palmerston, requesting details of the Government's legislative programme
for the coming session. The great man replied:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"There is nothing to be done."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For years, indeed for generations, land
reform has been an issue of fundamental concern in our rural communities
and far beyond. It is an issue that has languished for want of the political
will required to achieve change.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There has been wide-ranging enthusiasm
for the proposals developed by the land reform policy group. The measures
that are proposed pose no threat to good landowners, but they will make
for a better balance between the private and public interest. They are
a central element of our partnership's commitment to enhance rural life.
We will therefore introduce a bill for land reform.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our legislation will give new hope to,
and create new opportunities for, those who have lived and laboured on
the land for generations. Communities will have the right to buy, as and
when the land comes on to the market. We will also legislate to create
a right of responsible access to the land for recreation and for the passage
of ramblers, climbers and those who simply pass through. Who could imagine
such a land reform bill passing unscathed through the massed ranks of the
House of Lords? This is a Scottish solution to a distinct Scottish problem
and is now the responsibility of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will introduce a bill to abolish the
feudal system of land tenure. The arcane rights of feudal superiors will
be abolished; feudal superiors will no longer be able arbitrarily to enforce
conditions on property and land use in which they have no defensible interest.
Appropriate steps will be taken to ensure the survival of conditions that
are necessary to maintain common facilities and to protect the amenity
of property. The legislation will put a final stop to the abuses of the
feudal system. It is a Scottish solution for a distinct Scottish need and
is now the responsibility of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will introduce a bill to allow the creation
of national parks in Scotland. Scotland's natural heritage is unique. We
need to manage that natural heritage in a sustainable way, protecting it
while recognising the rights of those who live and work in the countryside.
National parks should be part of that policy. This will be enabling legislation.
We intend that the first national park should be based on Loch Lomond and
the Trossachs. Again, this is a Scottish solution to a distinct Scottish
need and is now the responsibility of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will introduce a bill to maintain high
standards in local government. I emphasise that local government is the
foundation of our democracy and that its role is central to the good government
of Scotland. We made it clear in the partnership document that we were
committed to modernising government at all levels. As a first&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">step, we will,
as promised, introduce a bill on ethical standards in local government
to establish a Scottish standards commission and a code of conduct for
local government. The aim is to enhance the reputation of local government
and to ensure a commitment to the highest standards. It is a Scottish solution
to a distinct Scottish need and is now the responsibility of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will introduce an incapable adults bill.
Our aim is to protect the rights and interests of those people who, for
whatever reason, are incapable of managing their own affairs. Up to 100,000
people at any one time in Scotland will benefit from this legislation.
There is strong support for the modernisation of the law in this area.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We recognise that issues of real importance
and great sensitivity are involved. There will be particular concerns and
a need for detailed discussion on the medical aspects of the consultation
document. We do not plan to legislate on advance directives-sometimes known
as living wills-on withholding and withdrawing treatment from incapable
patients or on non-therapeutic research. We will hold further consultations
and, in finalising the draft bill, we will also listen with care to the
views of the scrutiny committee and give weight to the outcome of its soundings
of Scottish opinion. That is a Scottish solution to a distinct Scottish
need and is now the responsibility of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will introduce a bill to address Scotland's
many and diverse transport challenges. We need to tackle the environmental
problems and unreliable journey times that are caused by congestion. We
need to generate the resources required to deliver a transport system that
will be fit for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. We need local solutions to
local problems, within a coherent strategic framework.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our bill will establish a framework to
enable, where sensible, road-user charging and to allow local authorities,
where appropriate, to introduce a levy on workplace parking. Our bill will
modernise the regulatory framework for buses, giving local authorities
the ability to work for improvement through quality partnerships. It is
a Scottish solution to a distinct Scottish need and is now the responsibility
of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will introduce a bill on financial procedures
and auditing. I make it clear that the bill will not authorise expenditure;
separate legislation will do that. The bill will essentially be a technical
measure about the machinery of this Parliament, but it will be important.
It will go to the heart of the relationship between the Parliament and
the Executive, putting in place the framework for the Parliament's scrutiny
of the Executive's proposals, particularly on the allocation of public
expenditure. This Parliament will not be one where decisions of&nbsp;</font></td>

significance pass unnoticed and unchallenged.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The bill will set out the rules under which
expenditure may be undertaken and the rules for dealing with the income
that is received by the Executive. It will also put in place systems of
audit and accountability, which will be designed to ensure that the Parliament
can confirm that its financial resources have been spent in the way that
was intended and to the best possible effect. It is a Scottish solution
to a distinct Scottish need and is now the responsibility of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will introduce an education bill. Education,
as I have said, is our number one priority; it will be the priority in
our legislative programme. Our bill will lay a duty on local authorities
to raise standards and to tackle the problems of underperforming schools.
It will confirm local control of education within a national framework.
It will include provisions to meet our promises on self-governing schools
and pre-school education. This bill-one of the first of the new Parliament-will
underwrite our commitment to raising educational standards in Scotland.
It will be a Scottish solution to a distinct Scottish need and is now the
responsibility of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This legislative programme responds to
the needs of the people of Scotland. It speaks for people in rural communities
who have long been held back by an inequitable system of land ownership;
for people in rural and urban communities who have been put upon by the
antiquated burdens of feudalism; for people who live in, and those who
enjoy, our areas of outstanding natural heritage; for carers who look after
those people who can no longer look after themselves; for everyone who
wants local government to operate to the highest standards; for everyone
in our cities who is frustrated by traffic jams and everyone in rural areas
who is frustrated by the lack of public transport; for everyone who wants
this Parliament to manage our financial resources rigorously and efficiently;
for everyone who has an interest in the education of our children; and
for everyone who wants those children to leave school able and ready to
make a full contribution to our society. I commend our legislative programme
to this Parliament. [<i>Applause.</i>]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Which of the eight
bills that he outlined will lead to the creation of jobs in Scotland and
how many jobs does he expect to be created?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister:</strong> I am sure that
Mr Neil, who takes an interest in such matters, will broadly welcome the
unemployment situation in Scotland. As he knows, we have the lowest unemployment
benefit claimant count since-I think-1977. Thanks to Scotland's excellent
record of attracting inward investment and the growing number of indigenous
firms, many more jobs have been created than have been lost in the past
two years. That is a strong base on which to build and it should be welcomed
by everyone.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Alex Neil will also know, we are increasing
public spending substantially. Our legislation depends on that investment.
With that spending will come substantial growth in the construction industry
and in a number of public sector employment areas. We have talked about
the creation of 20,000 jobs in the next two or three years. Our legislation-part
of which involves the process of improving standards in education and the
creation of national parks-will have employment spin-offs, which will be
important in terms of social policy. I look forward to co-operating with
other parties to ensure that we get those measures through and receive
the rewards in employment and in the other areas that are built into our
programme.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>The First Minister did not mention the horrendous problem of the misuse
of drugs in Scotland. During the election campaign, the issue was in every
party's manifesto and on everyone's mind. Will he comment on the misuse
of drugs?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister:</strong> Mr Gallie is
inviting me to make another speech if he wants me to comment on drug abuse
in Scotland. I say this not in a pernickety or personal way, but it is
important to distinguish between what we can do administratively and what
would require statutory provision. We are talking today about matters that
need to be dealt with by statutory provision.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the features of Labour's election
campaign was the promise of a drugs enforcement agency, which would be
taken out of the present structure of the Scottish crime squad and which
would mean a doubling in the number of policemen who work in that field.
In addition, we will double the strength of successful drug squads in every
force. That does not need legislation, but I will not allow that important
commitment to slip. We will want to tackle problems in consultation with
the relevant committee. The Justice and Home Affairs Committee will be
set up shortly and will have its say on the issue of drug misuse. We may
also want to introduce legislation, particularly on confiscation laws.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The list that I
have announced is not exhaustive; it is a starting line-up-if I may use
a sporting analogy-from which we will move on. A variety of Government
departments will have to tackle the problem of drug misuse and we will
discuss the structure that will allow us to do that. The Government is
determined to mount a cross-cutting exercise, as it is called in the jargon
of the trade, with considerably more energy and efficiency than has previously
been possible. I can safely predict that drugs will be one area of attack.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>Which of the eight bills would not have been presented by a Labour
Government were it not for the negotiations with the Liberal Democrats
in the partnership agreement? In other words, which of the eight bills
did the Liberal Democrats exact in their vigorous negotiations with Labour?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>Mr Wilson probably
thought out that question very carefully. I think that it falls into the
category of trick questions and I have no difficulty in avoiding the elephant
trap-if I may mix my metaphors. This is not a case of comparing Liberal
Democrat to Labour. The reason for the partnership was that, when we started
talking, we discovered that, in broad terms, there was an identity of aim
in many important policy areas-we had shared objectives. All the bills
fall into that category. I do not regard one of the bills as Labour or
another as Liberal Democrat. Members of the SNP may think in terms of faction
all the time, but we all think of these bills as Government and Administration
bills. We do not need to strike off the bills for one side or another;
we do not see the matter in terms of sides at all.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr John McAllion (Dundee East) (Lab):
</strong>I thought that I was listening very carefully to the First Minister's
brilliant speech-indeed, I was marking down the bills one by one as he
referred to them. However, unlike Mr Neil and Mr Wilson, I counted only
seven bills. Perhaps, at my age, I am starting to drop off in the middle
of listening to things. Will the First Minister confirm that the programme
contains a housing bill, because many people in Scotland have looked to
the Parliament to deliver such a very necessary bill?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>At the age of
14, I got what was called lower arithmetic-no one here will remember that-to
the astonishment of the entire school. I then gave up counting. Fortunately,
I retain the skill-I hope-as I am sure John McAllion does.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The legislative programme that I have announced
represents a starting line-up. There is no specific bill for housing in
the starting line-up, but I look forward to those in the Administration
who will be involved in housing matters pushing on with proper consultation.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All members will recognise that we must
have bills that we can progress immediately. Equally important bills will
have to come in the second wave. An obvious example of that will be local
government legislation to follow the McIntosh report, which will be published
on 22 June. As soon as we have consulted on that, I am certain that we
will want to legislate on an agreed basis-although I say that with no super
confidence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP): </strong>I
am pleased that Mr McAllion raised the issue of the number of bills because
I too counted seven. I am not sure whether Mr Dewar's response included
an additional bill: I counted two land bills, a local government bill,
an incapable adults bill, a transport bill, a financial procedures bill
and an education bill. One of the two land bills will deal with national
parks. Will he explain again, for the benefit of humble souls like me,
the number of bills?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In relation to the bills that I am clear
about, does the First Minister agree that those bills have to set specific
targets in relation to the priority concerns of the Parliament? Whether
it is included in the local government bill or in the finance bill, I hope
that he will include targets on poverty, and I ask him to respond to this
point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Dewar said that one in four families
in Scotland live in homes that are, frankly, uninhabitable in many respects,
and that one in three families or households live on less than half the
average annual income in Scotland. As he will be aware, in Glasgow alone
38 per cent of the kids were in receipt of free school meals in 1997; by
1999, that figure had risen to 43 per cent. [M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>:
"Ask a question."] What is the specific target on tackling poverty in cities
throughout Scotland? As a Glasgow member, I will raise the situation in
Glasgow. Will specific targets be set within an agreed time scale to raise
the standard of living of the citizens of Scotland?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My second point on poverty is that there
was no mention of pensioners in the bills that Mr Dewar set out. As he
will be aware, over a quarter of our pensioners live in poverty. Will specific

think that simplistic targets can be set in these matters. What must be
done-and I use the same phrase as I used about drugs-is to attack on all
fronts. The minister who deals with social inclusion has specific responsibility
for co-ordinating that attack. I assure Mr Sheridan that action will be
taken on the social justice front, but I want to involve this Parliament
in that action and I hope that the social inclusion committee and the affected

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">first question.
It is a perfectly fair question to ask, but the trouble is that there is
no simple answer to it. He will have noticed that, in my statement, I referred
to the fact that consultation and scrutiny take time; and I have no doubt
that, at some point in the next few months, I-or my Administration-will
be under attack because it is taking so long to deliver the bills. On the
other hand, if we did not have proper consultation, we would be very properly
under attack for betraying the spirit of the consultative steering group.
Therefore, a balance has to be struck. Obviously, I do not want to suffocate
the proper process of legislation with endless talk, but I want to listen
and learn from people's views. Like everyone else, I have to get such a
balance right and the committees, especially those scrutinising areas of
policy, will also have a duty to get that balance right. I hope we will
do that if we talk sensibly to each other.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is no template for these bills. Bills
change very much in their complexity and I do not think that a simple answer
can be given to the question. Before we rise, Sam Galbraith, in his role
as education minister, will make a statement about how he intends to handle
education legislation. That statement will probably be an interesting example
of early thinking on this issue and it may help people who are considering
the problems that it will deal with.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As for Mr Raffan's second question, the
Loch Lomond national park is clearly our first priority. A consortium of
local authorities has existed for some time now and the former Scottish
Office-still the Scottish Office for a little while-has, if I remember
rightly, put up 80 per cent of the money for the exercise. Everything is
well prepared and ready. I am interested in considering the Cairngorms
for national park status, but we will have to investigate recommendations
about structures and variations from the Cairngorms Partnership under Ian
Grant's chairmanship. As a result, I would not like to put a time scale
on that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nicola Sturgeon (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>My
question relates to the answer that the First Minister has just given.
This morning, I heard on the radio that there will be an innovative consultation
process prior to the publication of the education bill. The First Minister

will give details of the bill before we rise. Will the First Minister provide
any general or specific details about the consultation process?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to be difficult, but I have said that before we rise-which means in the

to consult and to hear from a shifting number of outside interests. We

of child casualties? What is the First Minister's view on that particular
road safety proposal?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister:</strong> We can certainly
express views on the matter, but I suspect that the road traffic laws,
which are uniform across the country, are a matter for Westminster. If
he so wishes, Lord Douglas-I am sorry, Lord Selkirk, I always get those

are eight because the land reform, feudalism and national parks bills are

habits can die hard.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">None the less, the facts are that in the
first vote for the Scots Parliament the Labour party achieved 39 per cent
of the vote, which was not one of its best performances; in the second
vote it achieved 34 per cent, the lowest Labour vote in Scotland since
1931; and last Thursday, it achieved 29 per cent, the lowest Labour vote
in Scotland since 1918. Most Governments have a honeymoon period; this
seems to be a reverse honeymoon period. At this rate of progress-a loss
of 2 per cent a week-the Labour party will have zero before Christmas.
It is reasonable to try to discover if that was the reason for the First
Minister's tetchy mood.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister also argued that the
press was not giving this Parliament a fair crack of the whip. The initial
coverage of the Parliament and its proceedings was, I think, very favourable.
Last week's coverage was much less favourable. The First Minister spoke
about the importance of consultation and scrutiny: perhaps if we have fewer
disreputable attempts to interfere with the Opposition's ability to do
its job, the Parliament will be able to endear itself to the Scottish people.
The nature of last week's debates was determined by Mr McConnell's attempts
to undermine the Opposition.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The eight bills and the 2,405 words that
the First Minister gave us-another advantage of having an advance copy-could
not disguise the lack of ambition in this first legislative programme of
this first Scots Parliament for 300 years. It was a low-key first statement;
I think that many people in Scotland were looking for a bit more.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to turn first to the areas that
we welcome. I welcome the hoped-for end of feudalism and feudal inhibitions
in Scotland. It is a comment on Westminster control of Scottish affairs
that, after 300 years of the union, feudal inhibitions still affect many
people. As many members will know, that is not just a matter for the Highlands
and Islands; it is a matter that affects people the length and breadth
of the country. Many of us who have been Westminster MPs have found it
impossible to explain to constituents why they should be subjected to injustice,
not just from the traditional landlords but in particular from people who
have been called the "raiders of the lost titles", people&nbsp;</font></td>

feudal inhibitions at low prices and have then rigorously used them to
extract substantial sums of money from ordinary people throughout Scotland.
I can assure the First Minister that the Scottish National party will co-operate
fully in bringing about the end, we hope, of feudalism in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We also welcome the appearance of land
reform on the parliamentary agenda. Across the parties, except the Conservatives,
there is an enthusiasm for this Parliament to tackle some of the Scottish
land questions. I know that today the First Minister was just listing the
bills and not giving us the full details. None the less, when we examine
those matters, we must answer the questions of how to facilitate the desirable
process of allowing communities to purchase the land on which they work
and live, and of what happens if a bad landlord is unwilling to sell. We
must also answer the questions of what procedures we have to involve communities
in improving estates, and of what procedures we have to improve consultation
and involvement in the estates beyond merely facilitating purchase, which
I suspect will affect only a minority of people on the land in Scotland.
Those are issues that we will want to have pursued in an area of legislation
that we broadly welcome.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also welcome the manner in which the
First Minister introduced the incapable adults bill and his intention to
legislate in that direction. The First Minister will be aware that this
is an enormously sensitive matter, and he has listed some of the areas
that cause great concern in many parts of Scottish society. It is an issue
that must be handled extremely carefully and with great sensitivity and
an area in which, as Mr Dewar rightly says, the parliamentary committee
system can come into its own in taking on board some of the legitimate
concerns that people in Scotland have about those matters.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the fact that we will have a
process of financial scrutiny and audit and I look forward to Mr McConnell
unveiling some of the secrecy that has previously surrounded Scottish Office
accounting. I also look forward to those matters being brought before this
Parliament so that some of the issues from the election campaign that were
left unresolved can be identified. I have a file of the Deputy First Minister's
quotations about the reality of public funding and public expenditure in
Scotland. Until 6 May Mr Wallace felt that public services in Scotland
were inadequately funded. I look forward to examination of Mr McConnell's

to accept the First Minister's interpretation of Scottish public finance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">substantial concerns.
Most reasonable people would say that there is a case for congestion charges
being levied in cities, with the proviso that the public transport infrastructure
is in place before the charges are introduced. The Scottish people currently
suffer from the highest petrol and diesel charges in Europe despite the
fact that Scotland is a major oil and gas producer. The First Minister
and the Labour party will have to explain to them what exactly the environmental
case is for, for example, introducing tolls on the M8. If, indeed, this
is contained in the bill, I would like to know the proposed level of charges
for Scotland's motorways. Does the charge start at &pound;1 and move upwards,
or will it initially be a Skye bridge toll? I see that the First Minister
is shaking his head so I think that the pound has it in terms of the initial
toll.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The environmental case for charging on
motorways is very frail indeed. The initial impact of that would be to
divert traffic to less suitable roads. How on earth can that be considered
an environmental initiative? After Scotland's experience of road tolls
on the Skye bridge, that will be a matter about which the Government will
have considerable explaining to do.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When we consider a transport bill, would
not it be better to start to look at areas such as the fifth and sixth
freedoms in terms of air freight? The Parliament being able to move in
that area could start to have a large stimulating effect on the Scottish
economy. A number of studies indicate both the danger to Scotland unless
those freedoms are achieved and the opportunity created for the Scottish
economy if that innovative move in transport policy is made.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also have concerns about the local government
code of conduct. That is not because I do not support it. I think that
everyone would support a code of conduct for local government. However,
we have heard all this before. I seem to remember that, before the 1995
local elections, Mr McConnell proposed and had signed a code of conduct
for Labour party councillors in Scotland. Many of us would like a move
towards proportional representation in local government in a local government

I do not want to anticipate. We all know from the consultation document
that it will look in particular at internal structures, the committee system

otherwise, and at electoral systems. For me to announce a bill on electoral
reform today, without having seen the McIntosh report and without any consultation
on it, would provide a proper foundation for a charge of overburdening
arrogance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>The First Minister could
have indicated that the recommendations of the McIntosh commission would
be taken into account in the local government bill, instead of saying only
that there would be a code of conduct for councillors-the Labour party
has tried that before, but any reasonable assessment would conclude that
it had not solved the underlying problem. If the First Minister is now
saying that the local government bill may well take into account the McIntosh
recommendations, that would mean that there would be a second bill. If
that is the case, it seems that the counting of the land legislation as
three bills is going to be repeated for local government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am concerned also about the education
aspects of the proposed legislative programme. People do not object to
raising standards in education-no reasonable person could-but merely setting
an obligation on local authorities to raise standards does not meet the
task in hand. Many of us feel that the change in direction that is needed
in Scottish education is a substantial move away from the consistent vilification
of the teaching profession that has happened under education ministers
in Scotland over the past 10 years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister </strong><i>indicated
disagreement.</i></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>I hoped that the departure
of Helen Liddell from the post of education minister would herald a new
era in the relationship between the Scottish Administration and the teaching
profession, so I was concerned to read on 28 May that Mr Galbraith said
that teachers must not be allowed to "wreck the project" of schools reform.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why should it be assumed that the teaching
profession in Scotland would want to wreck the reform of Scottish education?
The task for a new education minister is surely to motivate, mobilise and
inspire the teaching profession, taking it with him in pursuit of his objectives,
rather than to belittle and demobilise the profession, as took place first
under Michael Forsyth, was abandoned for a time under James Douglas-Hamilton
and resumed under the tenure of Helen Liddell. I think that teachers in
Scotland want to feel that they are part of the process and are regarded
as one of the great assets of Scottish education, rather than as one of
its liabilities, as this Administration has done, thereby continuing the
work of the Conservative party.</font></td>

that is Mr Salmond's position.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>In the election campaign,
the position of the Scottish National party, the Conservative party and
the Liberal Democrat party was to lift immediately the beef-on-the-bone
ban. That remains the Scottish National party's position.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>Against medical advice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_11"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond:
</strong>Medical advice on those matters is well known and has been well discussed.
We retain that position even if other people have had a remarkable change
in view over the past few weeks. We will, I hope, debate this issue at
some length in the immediate future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to address the issues that I feel
should have been discussed in this ministerial statement. A few seconds
ago, I read the quotations from the Liberal Democrat manifesto. There were
quotations by members of the Labour party during the election campaign
on the privatisation of key public services. I believe that the Scots Parliament,
after argument and debate, could reach some consensus as to whether the
private finance initiative was the best method of investing in public services
in Scotland, or whether, as the evidence overwhelmingly indicates, it posed
severe dangers in terms of cost, ownership control and the reversion of
public assets to the private sector. I would have liked investment in public
services against the privatisation of public services to have been included
in this legislative programme.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Alex Neil asked the First Minister about
jobs and investment. The First Minister replied that the Government's expenditure
programme was the area where jobs and investment would be secured. As I
have pointed out, during the election campaign it was shown that the claimed
increases in Government expenditure in Scotland were mythical.</font></td>

</strong><i>indicated disagreement.</i></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>The First Minister shakes
his head again. Those were the words of the Deputy First Minister during
the election campaign. The Deputy First Minister may have been convinced
by the Government's programme, but most of us believe that there is a lack
of public investment in Scotland and I would have liked investment in public
services to have been included as part of this Administration's programme.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How will we achieve the objectives that
were set out by the First Minister in terms of jobs, investment and prosperity,
and in terms of increases in income, employment and output in Scotland?
Nothing in this legislative programme touches those commanding heights
of the Scottish economy. How will we gain the comparative and competitive
advantage that most members would like? How will we deliver those advantages
for Scotland and secure the prosperity of our people? The legislative programme
is silent on jobs, enterprise and the economy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have a minister who deals with social
inclusion, but within this programme there is no ambition to tackle poverty
and social exclusion in Scotland. Where is the bill that gathers those
areas together to be presented, presumably, by the minister who bears that
name? Where are the measures to ensure a fair distribution of the wealth
of Scotland, measures to ensure that that wealth touches all our people,
not just some of them? In terms of public services, of the lack of detail
in how the Scottish economy is to be moved forward and of how we will eliminate
poverty in Scotland, this legislative programme is silent on key areas
of the Scottish economy and life.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister said that he was looking
at Westminster to legislate seldom, and only with permission, in the areas
for which this Parliament has responsibility. The First Minister's response
to James Douglas-Hamilton's question about speed limits in Scotland gave
the game away: even on devolved subjects the Westminster writ still runs
in Scotland. On the vital areas of the economy, of public services, and
of eliminating poverty in Scotland this Administration is in a straitjacket,
because key aspects of those areas are retained at Westminster.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister expresses the hope that
Westminster will not intrude into Scots legislation. He has some friends
in the Westminster Government at the moment, but that will not be the position
for all time. There is nothing in the Scotland Act 1998 to prevent a Westminster
Government, if it so chooses, from legislating on or countermanding what
is in that act. That applies to devolved areas, never mind the areas which
are of most concern to the people of Scotland.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I
welcome this opportunity to debate the Scottish Executive's legislative
proposals for this first session. Like Mr Salmond, I thank the First Minister-who
will return to the chamber shortly-for supplying a copy of his statement
in advance. It is a courtesy that I trust he will not regret at the end
of my remarks.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I stated last week in the debate on
the consultative steering group report, the Scottish Conservatives intend
to provide a principled Opposition in this Parliament. We will support
proposals from the Scottish Executive that are in line with our own principles
and policies and vigorously oppose those that are not.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was happy to agree with the First Minister
last week that, in certain devolved areas such as food standards, legislation
should continue to be enacted on a United Kingdom basis when there is a
need for common standards in order to sustain our single UK market-subject
to the important proviso that this Parliament should have the opportunity
to debate and approve such legislation. We are a unionist party, and we
will always support policies that strengthen our partnership with the rest
of the UK.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Today, the First Minister spoke of the
Executive's priorities for Scotland. I note that he launched off with land
reform as his flagship. Frankly, I doubt his priorities will impress the
rural communities he claims to value so much-I find it strange that, when
our farmers are facing their worst crisis ever, available time, resources
and energy are to be spent not on alleviating that crisis, but on land
reform measures that I fear could damage our already fragile rural economy
and discourage investment in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In much the same vein, I have reservations
about the proposals for national parks. We had a very useful debate last
week on Dr Jackson's motion on the proposals for Loch Lomond and the Trossachs.
Members who were present will have noted the reservations that were expressed
about national parks, the potential difficulties that they may pose to
the development of local economies and how they may result in the overloading
of areas-as happens in the lake district-which could damage our environment
and the needs of conservation, which we all support. This issue needs careful
handling, and we must get away from the idea that national parks in themselves
are a good thing.</font></td>

Mr Canavan have his microphone switched on please.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>Surely Mr McLetchie
is being a bit churlish. I would have thought that the Conservative party
warmly welcomes any legislation to improve access to the countryside, especially
bearing it in mind that, yesterday, Mr McLetchie's party leader appointed
an English MP called Dominic Grieve as the Tory party's spokesperson for
Scotland. Mr Grieve is apparently boasting about the fact that he has been
allowed to roam all over the Scottish Highlands, despite the fact that
he is descended from a family of sheep stealers and cattle rustlers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>I must have a discussion
with Mr Grieve about his ancestry. Of course, most Conservatives are thought
to be descended from the sort of people to whom Dennis Canavan refers-like
many curses, that has become a badge that we, as Tories, now wear with
pride.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Legislating for access is a dangerous concept.
In our opinion, access should be arranged by consent, as that is the best
way of balancing the interests of those who wish to use the countryside
for leisure and those for whom it is the base for important economic activity.
I question whether prescription or diktat by ministers is the correct way
in which to sustain our fragile rural environment. That is our position
and we are happy to debate it further.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>Can Mr McLetchie clarify
the Conservative party's position on national parks? Is it for or against
the concept? When he was a minister at the Scottish Office, Lord James
launched an initiative on national parks and was in favour of the concept;
I pay tribute to him for that. Do Mr McLetchie's comments mark a change
in party policy?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>We did not introduce
the concept of national parks and the issue requires further examination.
We must get away from the notion that national parks are a good thing in
themselves, and must examine what they mean for the local economy, the
local environment and the people who have to live and work in them. The
whole national parks concept raises serious issues of management and funding,
which were exemplified in last week's debate on Dr Jackson's motion. At
this stage, I want merely to issue a caveat. The Government cannot expect
the rest of us to give wholehearted approval to its proposals&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Can
Dr Jackson's microphone be switched on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Jackson: </strong>Does Mr McLetchie agree
that the issues that he-quite rightly-raises, and that were taken on board
in last week's debate, will be addressed during the interim period preceding
the implementation of the legislation, which has, in fact, already begun?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>That may well happen.
It is important that the interim period should be used to examine those
issues and to shape the legislation. I wanted simply to make the point
at the outset that we should not be carried away by the idea that it is
necessarily a good thing that the tag of national park should be applied
to a particular area of the country. All parties have much to contribute
to this debate, and we should not get hung up on particular tags.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Like the First Minister, whom I welcome
back to the chamber, we want a flourishing enterprise economy in Scotland;
indeed, we invented the concept when the Labour party was back in the stone
age. Unfortunately, the Labour party has no idea about how to create such
an economy, as the transport bill outlined in the Executive's programme
amply demonstrates. An enterprise economy requires low taxation. That is
why we are totally opposed to enabling the introduction of city-entry taxes,
road tolls and parking taxes. During the election campaign, we warned that
Labour intended to penalise the family motorist and hurt the competitiveness
of our businesses, heaping tolls and taxes on the fuel taxes and excise
duties that have been the feature of Gordon Brown's three budgets to date,
and of which there are undoubtedly more to come.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have been proved right. The Labour party
wants roads for the rich. We want roads for the people, whose taxes have
already paid for them and who continue to pay for them every time they
go to the petrol pump to fill up their car or go to the post office to
renew their tax disc.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>Can Mr McLetchie confirm
that my memory is correct? I seem to remember voting five times against
the fuel price escalator introduced by the Conservative Government in the
House of Commons.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>Mr Salmond's memory

campaign, our objections are now twofold: first, the increases imposed
by the Labour Government are higher than those&nbsp;</font></td>

supported the escalator concept; secondly-this is the key issue-when we
get to the top of the escalator, we get off the escalator. We are now getting
off the escalator, whereas the Labour party wishes to continue upwards
and upwards. It is determined, with the proposals outlined in its transport
bill, to put further tolls and taxes on motorists and businesses. I thought
that, during the election campaign, I was crystal clear on that point on
many occasions, but I am happy to reinforce it now. The truth is that Labour,
supported by the Liberal Democrats in their coalition Government, is continuing
its UK policy of introducing taxes by the back door in Scotland. We will
oppose the Government's every attempt to impose new stealth taxes on Scots.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the financial procedures and auditing
bill is intended, as it apparently is, to facilitate the control of public
spending-at least in principle, if not in practice-it is welcome. Members
may recall that, last week, Mr McConnell, the Minister for Finance, claimed
that there was no mention of financial prudence in our manifesto. He obviously
did not read very much of it. If he had, he would have seen that the first
commitment in it was to</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"no new or higher taxes on Scots".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As a prominent advocate of new Labour double-speak,
Mr McConnell clearly has trouble with plain English, so I will spell it
out again for him. A commitment to oppose additional taxation of any kind
means, by definition, that we must live within our means and control public
spending in Scotland. We will be happy to support the prudent use of public
finances under the Executive's management and I am happy to reassure Mr
McConnell-our new iron chancellor-on that point. If Mr McConnell is really
concerned about public spending in Scotland, he should-as I have said before-examine
the cost of this bloated Government and the soaring costs of the Scottish
Parliament building project at Holyrood.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive's aspiration to raise education
standards is, of course, laudable and welcome. Where its proposals build
on the policies the Conservatives introduced in government, we will support
them. However, imposing on councils a statutory duty to raise standards
will, in itself, make not one whit of difference. Why do we need a law
to state what should be a blindingly obvious responsibility? If our preponderantly
Labour councils have failed in that responsibility, is it not time-as we
said in our manifesto-for some real devolution in education through transferring
the management of our schools to local communities?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Choice of nursery education for the parents
of pre-school children is missing from the Government's proposals. We firmly

to their, and their children's, needs and does not force them to accept
the diktat of their local council.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Talking of councils, I come to another
feature of the legislative programme. Any reform of local government must
aim to restore public confidence in our local authorities, which is sadly
lacking. Let us face it: the Executive's ethical standards bill is no more
and no less than a damning indictment of the unacceptable face of Scottish
Labour in local councils. The Labour party created what the First Minister
called the "distinct Scottish need" that requires the attention of the
Parliament-attention to cleaning out their own middens.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are aspects of the Government's proposals
that we welcome. In particular, I welcome the two important measures of
law reform: on land tenure and in relation to incapable adults. I believe
that in both areas modernisation of the law will be welcomed and widely
supported in the Parliament. I cannot help but note, however, in relation
to land tenure reform, that some of the greatest abusers of the feudal
system are Labour councils who exploit their position as feudal superiors
to extract consent payments from their citizens for home extensions and
alterations for which they as councils have already given building warrants
and planning permission. In Edinburgh alone, the Labour-run council extracts
from citizens more than &pound;40,000 a year in this way. Legislative time
could be saved if such invidious practices were not sustained by Labour
in local government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In relation to the incapable adults bill,
I welcome reform of the law in relation to financial management and welfare
of the incapacitated. It is an area with which I am well acquainted from
my professional life as a solicitor. I think it is right, as Mr Salmond
suggested, to exclude the contentious section 5 proposals at this stage
so that the practical reforms that I believe will enjoy all-party support
can proceed, and other proposals, such as living wills and consent to treatment,
which raise major moral and ethical issues, can be more fully examined.
Those issues are in any event more appropriate for a member's bill than
for an Executive bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I should clarify
the situation, in case I misled unintentionally. We intend to include in
the bill the general authority to treat an incapacitated patient if the
treatment is in the interest of the patient, because the law is unclear
on that matter. We will also address the case for therapeutic research
that deals with the disease the patient is suffering from. We agree that
the other matters to which Mr McLetchie refers should not be in the bill
at this stage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that clarification.</font></td>

that, as a party with policies based on principles, we will advocate policies
that we believe to be right-unlike, I fear, the Executive, which bases
its policies on the findings of focus groups' or its junior partners for
whom principles are bargaining chips to be traded for a place at the top

serious aspect of the proposals is that they contain the first of many

when we are considering the provision of services; what we need now is
a programme of practical change. We must develop a range of services that

it is definitely more widespread in areas of high unemployment and poor
housing, where there is a lack of opportunity for young people and those
who are in poor health-in other words, people who are socially excluded.
We must include them in, not out. The programme of change must therefore
be part of our social inclusion agenda. We must find a way to strip drug
dealers of their assets and put that money into drug education, the prevention
of misuse and rehabilitation in the areas where they were dealing. We must
let the people see that the dealer is off the street and that they are
getting something in their community. If that means passing legislation

we are now getting down to proper parliamentary business. I am sure that
each and every one of us was asked at some point during the election campaign,

problem." If, four years down the road, we go out again to fight an election
and another headline describes a six-year-old boy saying to a teacher,
"Take this piece of heroin, it is killing my mother," that will be an indictment
not only of society but of each and every one of us here. We have the power

rightly-that many of the problems of our education system are the fault
of the national policymakers, not of the teachers who, on so many occasions

opportunity to embrace genuine partnership and I look forward to Sam Galbraith's
statement on the details of the consultation process. There must be an
open and rigorous consultation exercise, involving all the partners in
education-local authorities, teachers, employers and, of course, parents,

of our children. Who knows? Perhaps the consultation process will even

of Scottish education, of which there are many, and tackle its fundamental
weaknesses. Its aim must be to improve the educational experience of every
single child in every single school in Scotland. In child care and pre-five
education, that means introducing regulations to ensure not just the quantity
of places available, but the quality of the care and education that our
youngest children receive. In schools, we must bring forward proposals
to reduce the administrative burden on teachers and allow them to do what

In fact, I would go so far as to say that such a move is essential if local

is the obligation of everybody in society to work to raise standards in

years, however, the education system has been starved of essential resources.
I hope that the education bill addresses the issue of resources. Before
the election, the SNP outlined a variety of proposals to inject much-needed
resources into our education system, and I hope that some of those ideas
will be included in the education bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that there will be proposals to
reduce class sizes, not just in the early years of education, but from
primary 1 to the second year of secondary school. I hope that there will
be a Government commitment to work with teachers in the Scottish Joint
Negotiating Committee to bring about that reduction in class sizes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Investment in books and learning materials
is absolutely essential, as is investment in language teachers and special
needs teachers in primary schools. I hope that during this debate we will
hear some indication of how many extra modern language teachers and special
needs teachers will be employed in the course of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This Executive-this Parliament-has the
opportunity over the next four years to do what Westminster, under Labour
and Tory Governments, has failed to do, that is, to get it right for Scottish
education, to get it right with teachers, with parents and with local authorities,
and to get it right for Scotland's children. I hope that the Executive
seizes that opportunity, and that as a result there are radical and necessary
reforms in Scottish education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to support, but the other parts cause concern.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I agree with some of the earlier comments
about the determination of priorities and the consequent gaps in the programme.
The First Minister, in his preliminary remarks, said that people ask when
this Parliament will make a difference. He also said, in defining the Parliament's
role, that we are here to keep promises.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the most alarming gaps in the programme
relates to drugs abuse in Scotland. I endorse what Mr Gallie and Mrs Godman
have already said, and I am grateful to Mrs Godman for an accurate outline
of the extent of the problem. The Deputy First Minister, Mr Wallace, has
some sympathy for the problem. During the election campaign, he and I met
in connection with the problem of drugs abuse in Scotland. I think that
he and I would agree that the people we met-the youngsters we encountered,
and the people who work with addicts and victims-were a deserving and meritorious
group.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If I heard one comment recurring throughout
the election campaign, it was that drugs abuse in Scotland is one of the
major issues that perplexes, worries and alarms people. I am concerned
that there is a silence about that in the legislative programme. Another
recurring theme that I heard-as did the Deputy First Minister-was that
all those who are trying to work at grass-roots level with the horrendous
consequences of addiction and abuse are apprehensive about the lack of
coherence, cohesion and a definitive Scottish programme to deal with the
problem. During the election campaign, the Conservatives submitted that
the issue was one of beckoning opportunity for this Parliament. We can
look at the problem, take it on board, and spearhead a Scottish initiative
through a minister or a parliamentary committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is regrettable that the coalition Government
has been unable to produce anything of comfort to the people of Scotland.
They are desperately and acutely aware of the problem and they seek urgent
reassurance. I hope that, notwithstanding the silence on drugs abuse in
the legislative programme, it might be possible for the Executive to devise
a means of bringing this problem to the fore, and in so doing to reassure
the people of Scotland that this Parliament is concerned not about minutiae
or technical detail or other aspects of bureaucratic tedium, but about
the profound issues that are ravaging the communities of our country.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am equally alarmed about the omission
from the programme regarding enterprise and business. It is a matter of
concern that there is no specific encouragement for the business community.

Sturgeon said about education, however, words may be one thing, but what
are the substantive components of policy and legislative intent that will
bring bricks and mortar to that proposal?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the transport bill, there is silence
on the need to address the desperate concerns of the business community
about inadequate transport links. If one speaks to business communities
in all parts of Scotland, one finds concern about congestion in a road
structure that is unable to cope with the needs of business and commerce
and concern that the ability of those areas to attract investment-inward
or otherwise-is being deeply prejudiced.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am concerned that apparently that is
not perceived by the Government as a matter of any importance. What about
reassurance on business rates? What about succour for the small business
community? I come from that background, and I know that running a small
business is a matter of daily, indeed hourly, challenge and preoccupation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It would be helpful if the Government could
reassure the business community that the matter of business rates has not
been lost sight of, and if the Government could emphasise that it recognises
the importance of preserving stability of business rates. If it does not,
business communities in Scotland have real cause for concern.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In relation to training, the new deal-which
I think we all acknowledge was Labour's English solution to a Scottish
problem-has not been a success. It can hardly be classed as a success when
more than 60 per cent of those involved do not end up in full-time jobs
and when the cost of success is huge for those who do.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am concerned that that problem has not
been addressed. It is known to exist; one cannot speak to the business
communities or the business agencies and not hear that there is deep concern
about the efficacy and the workability of the new deal. I should have thought
that this was an ideal opportunity for the Parliament, within the Government's
legislative programme, to look at that and to determine a better structure
for people in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I, too, welcome the attention to the technical
detail of feudal reform, which most people recognise is long overdue. However,
it might not be universally recognised that there is a useful aspect of
feudal law: the current relationship between what is technically known
as the superior and the vassal allows the superior a preservation of amenity
conditions, as well as private expense and immediacy of enforcement action.
I am pleased that the Government acknowledges that and is prepared to try
to support and retain it. That&nbsp;</font></td>

Lomond and Trossachs area.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the burning issues at Loch Lomond
is the abuse of activity on the water extent, which has been going on for

given to the need for proper management of activity on the water surface.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

article in a recent edition of a Glasgow newspaper, Duncan Hamilton presented
the SNP with a terrible dilemma. If the SNP does not condemn his ill-informed,
inaccurate and prejudiced comments, we can conclude only that it endorses
arrogant, reactionary and elitist politics; imagine the reaction if he
had made those comments about black people. I have written today to Mr

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nicola Sturgeon </strong><i>rose-</i></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Curran: </strong>I wonder how much money
was made from Mr Hamilton's utterances. In this Parliament, it is time
to insist on mature behaviour and good manners. We should be driven by
our commitment to the communities that we are here to represent, their
needs and the measures that need to be put in place to address them, not
by the conventions of a debating chamber.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the legislative programme that Donald
Dewar outlined, I argue that the most significant thread is social justice,
not only because it addresses the needs of the people in my constituency
of Glasgow Baillieston, but because it provides a vision and a direction
for Scotland as a whole. Donald Dewar talked about stable communities.
We do not need a raft of legislation to work towards such communities;
we need a strategy for social inclusion that recognises the fact that poverty,
lack of work, lack of educational achievement, lack of personal esteem
and other key indicators are interconnected and reinforce one another.
Unless we deliver an overall approach, those problems seem insurmountable.
If we do not address the deep-seated problems of exclusion and poverty,
we will fail not only communities such as Easterhouse, which I am here
to represent, but Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Will Ms Curran
go through the legislative programme, in a way that the First Minister
failed to do, and highlight the items of proposed legislation that will
tackle the problems of poverty and social exclusion in Scotland?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Curran: </strong>Nicola should bear with
me; the problem with all these interventions is that members sometimes
cannot follow the logic of a speech. I made it clear that we do not need
a raft of legislation, and I will go on to talk about the committees. We
need to consider the Government's overall strategy. This is the first time
that I have spoken in this debate and I am here to speak on those issues;
that is what I will do.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Tory years, thankfully, have gone.

by the Government. We must be clear, as we attempt to deal with such problems
in this Parliament, that progress will not be easy. Our job is to ensure
that we put some meaning behind the buzz words.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Within the committee structure, as has
already been suggested, we need to consider measurements and targets across
a range of services. We need to be proactive rather than reactive. We need
to ensure that economic stability is linked to programmes of social advancement.
The challenge of the 21<sup>st</sup> century is to ensure that everyone
who can contributes to, and shares in, economic progress. We must recognise
that ability, enterprise and energy are not respecters of class and geography;
everyone, irrespective of background, gender, race, disability or sexuality,
should have the means to contribute and to realise their potential.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Exclusion is at its most absolute when
people's lives and those of their children are governed by abuse, fear
and terror. John Orr, the chief constable of Strathclyde police, found
in research that a woman is hit 35 times before she makes her first report
to the police. If there is one thing that the Parliament can do-and I hope
very much that it will, despite the misogyny that we have seen recently-it
is to put funding for women's aid on a secure and appropriate footing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must intervene at the earliest possible
stage to alter the life chances of children and young people. To Mr Hamilton
in particular, I say that members of Mothers Against Drugs, in my constituency,
may not have the slickest of university debating skills, but they speak
with a passion and a precision about drugs that anyone can understand.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must liberate the communities that are
trapped in a vicious circle of despair and crime. Nicola Sturgeon should
note that programmes that the Executive will deliver, such as new community
schools, early intervention schemes, expanded child care provision, family
centres and alternatives to exclusion are the key steps in rebuilding and
regenerating our communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I particularly welcome the signal that
was given by the Executive in creating a Minister for Communities. Too
often, communities such as Easterhouse are seen as the problem; in my experience,
they are the solution. Let us work hand in hand with those communities
to bring about change. Through consultation and dialogue, we can create
solutions and legitimise answers-not with the arrogance of the privileged
elite in the SNP, but as partners in a new and radical Scotland. Above
all, if we have the will, we can create a new form of government. We can

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The causes of social exclusion are many:
poverty and deprivation; unemployment; low incomes; poor housing; broken

is with social exclusion as a result of discrimination. In particular,
I want the practices of institutions and individuals that prevent disabled
people and people from ethnic minorities from playing their full part in
society to be eradicated. That will not be easy; it involves changing society's
attitude to the way in which we treat each other as citizens.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must make everyone realise that we have
a duty to be tolerant and respectful of one another's differences. Intolerance
is rife in Scotland. We have to challenge that, and I am confident that
in its proposals the Executive has given the Parliament enough scope to
allow us to make a good start in tackling the problem. It is the responsibility
of each of us in the chamber to monitor the progress that is made towards
social inclusion. We have to identify and implement effective anti-discrimination
strategies in all areas of legislation, where appropriate. Disabled people
and ethnic minorities in Scotland deserve no less.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will give an illustration of the difficult
task that we face. On Sunday night, I was at a gathering of a group within
the Asian community. The guest speaker was Mr Salmond and I hope that he
will concur with what I am about to say. While social exclusion is often
seen as a euphemism for poverty, the number of Mercedes-Benz, BMWs and
Daimlers in the hotel's car park gave no outward sign that this was a gathering
of the socially excluded, if poverty were to be used as the criterion.
However, as one speaker after another talked of their fears and concerns
about their community in the wake of a series of racially motivated attacks,
especially in the west of Scotland and including the death of Imran Khan,
the sense of exclusion felt by the Asians in the room became tangible to
the rest of us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Regardless of their financial status, the
members of the Asian community who were present on Sunday night clearly
believed themselves to be shut out from the rest of society. Parliament
must focus on the needs of vulnerable groups that feel ostracised. We must
always promote social inclusion and work to prevent social exclusion from
happening in the first place. I am confident that this legislative programme
will allow us to do that.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>I will not give way at
the moment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister came back with a bland
answer. I have in my hand a document produced by the Parliament's information
centre two days ago. It states categorically that, based on the International
Labour Organisation measurement, there are 187,000 unemployed people in
Scotland. According to the document, the forecast is that unemployment
will go up. Nothing in the First Minister's statement will do anything
to arrest the projected increase in unemployment or to reduce the figure
of 187,000.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Similarly, the creation of social exclusion
ministries and units is not the answer to the problem of deep-seated poverty
in our society. Let us consider the facts. On the accepted measure that
a poor household receives less than half the average national wage or income,
some 1.2 million people in Scotland live in poor households-25 per cent
of the population. Furthermore, 34 per cent of all children in Scotland
and 41 per cent of children under five live in poverty, as do 29 per cent
of our pensioners.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nothing in the legislative programme will
fundamentally alter those figures. I bet my bottom dollar or euro-whatever
the case will be-that in a year's time, after we have passed, or not passed,
all eight bills in the programme, those figures will remain the same. After
the bills are passed, 1.2 million people will still be living in poverty
in Scotland, one third of our children will still be living in poverty
and 187,000 people will still be on the dole in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the first page of the First Minister's
statement, he rightly says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"People ask when the Parliament will begin
to make a difference."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is no doubt that a number of the
proposed bills are welcome, as Mr Salmond and others have said. However,
the bills tinker at the edges; they do not address the fundamental problems
of unemployment and poverty in our society.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In particular, we should not underestimate
the impact of unemployment, which is a root cause of poverty in our society.
When a person is unemployed, their personality is destroyed. When a large
number of people are unemployed for a long time, communities are destroyed.
Unemployment leads to poor achievement in education and to a higher incidence
of ill health. Unemployment is a cancer in our society and many of the
other problems that we face will not&nbsp;</font></td>

we tackle unemployment at its roots. There is nothing in the First Minister's
statement about that-the word poverty does not even appear in the 2,000
or so words in the statement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I say three things to Labour members. First,
they should look again at the legislative programme and give us a programme
that will tackle the roots of unemployment and poverty. Secondly, they
should recognise the limitations of devolution and demand the powers and
resources from Westminster to tackle those problems. Thirdly, they should
raise their ambitions for the Scottish people. We do not want this Parliament
to sit for four years only for there still to be grinding unemployment
and grinding poverty of the kind that we have at present. Success and the
difference that we will make will be measured in terms of whether we create
new jobs for the unemployed and whether we lift our people out of poverty.
If we fail to do that, we will have failed the Scottish people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

have been very much worse?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>We should enter the single

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am glad that Mr Salmond has returned
to his place, as he, too, has not answered the question about the contradiction
in SNP economic policy. Perhaps he can quietly do some policy making over
the next hour or two, as the SNP did-pretty quickly-before the election,
when it came up with expenditure and tax plans overnight. We are familiar

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We know the speed with which the SNP can
make policy; indeed, it can do so overnight with extraordinary rapidity.
However, such policy fails to stand up to scrutiny, as we saw during the
election campaign, when it completely disintegrated. I am happy to give
way to Mr Swinney, who is still the SNP's vice-chairman, or deputy leader,
or finance spokesman-one never knows what will happen next-if he can explain
this fundamental contradiction in the SNP's economic policy. Is the SNP
prepared to let the European Central Bank set interest rates for Scotland,
despite the fact that the party continually attacks the Bank of England
for doing so?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>I am grateful to Mr

between the positions of the coalition parties on the single currency?

I raised the serious point of pre-legislative scrutiny with the First Minister
during questions on his statement. As the Parliament settles down, I hope
that we will have time for such scrutiny, unlike at Westminster. It is
important that concepts behind legislation are first put in green paper
discussion form to be closely examined by the relevant committee. I am
sure that the Conservative party in Scotland will agree with that, as that
process would enable us to avoid such unfortunate measures as the poll

We are going to put extra taxes on car users, so at the same time we must
improve public transport. An integrated transport system is a great phrase,
but we have yet to see much evidence of it. We must invest far more in
public transport and we must do so soon. It is also crucial that we take
freight off the road and put it on to rail. In this country, we have only
700 freight-loading points, whereas France and Germany have 15,000 between

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Karen Whitefield (Airdrie and Shotts)
(Lab): </strong>I welcome today's announcement of the Government's forthcoming
legislative programme. I am especially pleased that it includes provision
for an incapable adults bill. Recent comments in other places may have
led some to believe that there is a need for a bill for incapable MSPs.
That, however, is a debate for another day-a day when Mr Hamilton is present.
It is important that we recognise the potential that an incapable adults
bill has for improving lives in Scotland. I am pleased that the Government
has made the introduction of such a bill a priority in its first term in
office, as the issue is important for many people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would like to make some important points
about the current situation, the inadequacies of existing legislation,
and the real difference that this bill could make to individual lives.
Some members may be aware that much of the legislation relating to decisions
on the welfare of adults with mental incapacity was made by the previous
Scottish Parliament in 1585. Existing Scots law relating to mental incapacity
is fragmented, unclear and archaic. Sadly, it has disadvantaged more than
100,000 Scots, people who are unable to make decisions for themselves because
they suffer from a mental incapacity caused by dementia, a head injury,
a learning disability or severe mental illness. Those Scots have been let
down by existing legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Being diagnosed as suffering from a mental
incapacity greatly restricts people's life. Things that each one of us
in this chamber takes for granted are no longer possible. Such people no
longer have the right to decide where they will live; they are unable to
influence decisions about the medical treatment they require; they are
not allowed to make a will; and they cannot even sign to collect the bus
pass that they are entitled to.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Carers are also disadvantaged, because
they have no legal right to make decisions about the care arrangements
for the person they care for. Even when the carer is the husband or wife
of the person with the mental incapacity, he or she cannot manage the person's
financial affairs, unless granted the power of attorney before the person
became incapacitated.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Existing legislation fails my constituents
in Airdrie and Shotts-as it fails all Scots-who become incapacitated. It
also fails their carers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Karen Whitefield: </strong>I thank Mr Wallace

adults in my constituency, who have been to see me over the past few weeks

let down the people of Airdrie and Shotts and of Scotland. There is a real
need for a modern and comprehensive framework for the law governing the
management of property, the financial affairs and the welfare of adults
who are incapable of making decisions about those matters.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am committed to making this Parliament
work, because I believe that its policies have the potential to make a
real difference to the lives of the people I represent. The incapable adults
bill will do just that. At present, if a man develops dementia and he and
his wife have a joint bank account, their account will be frozen. His wife
will not be allowed to access their money, even to pay household bills.
She will not be allowed to continue to manage their finances, even though
she may have done so for all their married life. In future, banks will
be allowed to set up simple procedures that will give access to reasonable
sums of money.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I met a constituent last week who told
me of his concerns about his wife's dementia and his concern that the doctors

Today, he will be pleased to learn that in future there will be a legal
obligation on doctors to consult him fully about medical decisions related
to his wife's care.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those are real problems affecting real
people every day in Scotland. I welcome the introduction of this bill.

Government give us a clear outline of where it stands on health?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Too many concerns to mention in this Parliament
today have already been raised with me, as health spokesman for the Scottish
Conservatives. An urgent concern, however, is the issue of blocked beds.
There are 1,600 to 1,700 blocked beds each week in the national health
service at a cost of about &pound;30 million. Will the Government look
at the relationship between social work services and the NHS? Our manifesto
made a clear commitment to serve the elderly and the most vulnerable people
in our society, to give them seamless transfer of care and to give them
the care of their choice. There should also be a level playing field between
privately run residential homes and council-run homes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

common reason for admission of 14-year-olds to in-patient and day care

suggests finding a method of using money from asset confiscation to fund
a national drugs strategy and to give families the support that they need
when they have a drug user in the family. Support, treatment, rehabilitation
and advice are sadly lacking in Scotland and I would ask the Executive
to consider those issues.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>I have lodged a motion,
which I hope will gain support from all parties, on that specific point
of the need for more resources for drug treatment, aftercare and rehabilitation.
Of the &pound;1.4 billion United Kingdom budget to tackle drug abuse, three
quarters is spent on the courts and detection. We need to redress the balance

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the subject of waiting lists, the message
that I have been given by medical practitioners is that we should stop
treating headline figures and interfering with professional clinical judgment
by dealing with minor cases so as to reduce waiting lists, while major
operations must wait.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The British Medical Association has already
flagged up the issue of junior doctors to us. It is regrettable that the
Government has decided to block the reduction of hours and that we are
now, for the first time in Scotland in many years, facing industrial action
by committed professionals in the health service. I am pleased that the
Minister for Health and Community Care said yesterday that she was seeking
an early meeting with junior doctors.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Much has been said today about social inclusion.
As a representative of the Highlands and Islands, I am concerned, as I
am sure many other members from the Highlands are, that one indicator for
allocating national health service resources is the deprivation index.
One of the criteria for that index is car ownership, which assumes that
car owners have some wealth. In&nbsp;</font></td>

Islands, a car is not a luxury, but a necessity. Indeed, the costs of owning
and using a car and high fuel prices cause deprivation in other parts of
the household budget. I therefore ask the Minister for Communities to address
the deprivation index when she considers NHS resources for rural areas,
the criteria for which should be quite different from those for urban areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Turning to public health, I am pleased
that our poor record of chronic heart disease has been mentioned, but it
undoubtedly needs to be addressed by the Executive. I also ask ministers
to consider more support and education for families of cardiac patients.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last week, I was told that we had become
a nation of spectator rather than participative sportsmen. This week, I
heard on the news that Kenny Dalglish has had to go to Bulgaria to find
new football players. Why is he not going to Dundee, Aberdeen, Glasgow
and Edinburgh?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>Who knows?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>Standards of sport
and access to sport in schools are issues that must be raised. I am sure
that Mr McConnell will share that view.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, like others, I am concerned, as
a parent and as a consumer, about academic research. Members will probably
agree with me that there is a crying need for credible and accurate advice
and information. For more than 30 years, women have worried about the side
effects of the pill and have been told that it is okay, then that it is
not. Last year, they were told that it is okay. Is it, or will there be
another piece of research next week that says that there are dangers?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another major concern for people in Scotland
is the measles, mumps and rubella injection. Instead of professors trying
to score points against one another, week after week, we need full, credible
and accurate advice. I cannot leave out BSE, and Dr Simpson has already
made a point about the beef-on-the-bone ban. The Prime Minister tells us
that genetically modified foods are all right, but why do we not believe
that? There are major concerns on GM foods and I ask the Government to
give us some leadership and guidance about them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My final point is on national parks and
I would like to endorse what David McLetchie said. Along with other members
in the Highlands and Islands, I attended consultative meetings about national
parks throughout Strathspey and Badenoch. At the end of a three-hour meeting,
we came away with more questions than answers. It is wrong for someone
to say, "It is a national park and so we will vote for it," because there
are so many types of national parks. I welcome debate that will arise from
that issue.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>I
would like to address the business of today's debate-the legislative programme
and the eight bills that are mentioned in it. We have heard fine words
and passion about the need to tackle poverty, injustice and discrimination.
We must recognise that the people who elected us want us to address those
issues through action, not fine words. That is why one of the greatest
criticisms of today's statement is its lack of provision on housing, social
justice, poverty and anti-discrimination.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister spoke about Scotland's
solutions to Scotland's problems and the need to address pressing priorities.
Scotland's housing is a pressing priority and a housing bill is a glaring
omission from today's statement. It is with deep disappointment that I
address that point. Only yesterday, Frank McAveety and I spoke at a conference
at which the Parliament's role in housing was discussed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is potential for great consensus
on some aspects of housing. The Executive's failure to introduce early
legislation to allow that to happen is a missed opportunity. Certain issues,
such as a single secure tenancy, the strategic role of local government
in housing matters and better management of tenements where there is a
mix of landlord and home ownership, could have offered this Parliament
a great opportunity to start making a difference early on. The Executive
has missed that opportunity and housing is obviously not one of its legislative
priorities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The biggest omission is any attempt to
address homelessness or to consider extending statutory responsibilities
across tenure and the definition of who is homeless. Members who travel
from Waverley station up the News Steps every day will see some of the
problems of homelessness, and there is an early failure by this Government
to address those problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was pleased to hear the First Minister
talk about social justice, as I think that that is the terminology we should
be using. The term social inclusion perhaps allows the Parliament to avoid
some of the issues that should be addressed. Michael McMahon was right:
we are talking about poverty and the consequent discrimination, inequalities
and lack of opportunities. Those are the issues that we should be addressing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A third of our children live in poverty.
If we start talking about them as being socially excluded from birth, we
are automatically distancing ourselves from them. This Parliament should
make children and issues of poverty central priorities. I want us to talk
in the language of social justice and poverty, not in the new Labour speak
of exclusion or inclusion, depending on which side of the border&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a hint that the driver for change
in social justice may come from the committee structure. I hope that there
will be strong consultation. I for one would ensure that our party drove
forward the issues of tackling poverty and social injustice. I hope that
consultation will mean being prepared to listen and to accept some points,
whether people like them or not.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SNP is on record as opposing mass stock
transfer, but if consultation shows that that is not what is desired, I
hope that the committee structure will acknowledge that and take it on
board.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have heard much in recent months about
step-by-step progress, but it is with sadness that I say that we have not
seen even an attempt to crawl on these issues. We have heard fine words
and passion, but there is no action and there are no bills to address the

this Parliament marches on the issues of poverty, homelessness and injustice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Paul Martin (Glasgow Springburn) (Lab):
</strong>I understand that a number of SNP members, particularly Kenny Gibson,
have been awaiting my contribution to the Scottish Parliament. Some members
will be forgiven for being somewhat overawed by the so-called calibre in
the SNP ranks. For example, Duncan Hamilton is the fearless world debating
champion from Bearsden. I have stayed in Springburn all my life and I have
never known a fearless fighting champion from Bearsden, so we have already
learned something in this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The proposed legislation sets down foundations
for the future. Donald Dewar is right in saying that it has been a long
road and one from which we cannot be diverted. My constituents will welcome
transport legislation. Gone are the days of bus companies being able to
cherry-pick profitable routes. People want us to make a difference in transport
matters. I look forward to that and to local authorities having a dominant
role in ensuring that the legislation is delivered.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

not accept underperformance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>I will address the issues of national parks and roads. I have no constituency
interest or concern in the Loch Lomond and Trossachs area, but it is an
area that I know well, as I know many of the popular areas of Scotland
that hillwalkers, climbers and other users of the countryside frequent,
and I am well aware of the difficulties that exist as a result.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In many of our most scenic areas there
is severe erosion on the hillsides. There are also difficulties created
by traffic in the glens, problems caused by erratic parking, difficulties
created by litter, and disturbance to wildlife and to local people. I am
therefore happy that, at an early stage, this Parliament is considering
the action that should be taken. My concern is the concern that Mr McLetchie
enunciated this morning, that the national park formula may not necessarily
be the entire answer. The inevitable consequence of the national park approach
is that it will draw more people in. We have to recognise that that may
accentuate the problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> Can
Dr Jackson's microphone be switched on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: </strong>I want to remind
the member of last week's debate, in which we talked about the importance
of placing the national park development at Loch Lomond and the Trossachs
in the context of the more holistic rural strategy that is being pursued
by Stirling Council and the other two councils that are involved in the
project. The development is not being viewed in isolation. We also emphasised
the need to balance the environmental issues with social and economic development
and accepted that many questions still remain to be addressed. Only this
morning we said that an interim committee, which has already been established,
will examine those very issues.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

issues were raised in last week's debate, which was very constructive and
sensible, and that it was clear that Dr Jackson and the Minister for Transport
and the Environment are willing to consider them. However, there are real
resource issues that have not been discussed and they were not touched
on in the First Minister's statement. Setting up a series of national parks
has funding implications-they require car parks, toilets, staffing and
rangers. I want to lay this down as a marker to ministers: if resources
are to be made available, where will they come from, who will control them
and who will administer them? What will the relationship be between parks
authorities and local councils on matters such as planning regulations?
We have not said no to national parks, but we will maintain a critical
and questioning attitude until we know precisely what is proposed and how
it will be implemented. We will play a constructive part in attempting
to refine and shape the legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

many of the areas involved fairly well and have never encountered difficulty
obtaining access to hills and open moorland. Generally speaking, hillwalkers
have been relatively happy with voluntary access codes. I will watch the
Executive's proposals with interest, as I would be concerned if access
proposals threw up difficulties for farming and other rural businesses
on actively farmed land. We must be careful to protect the genuine economic
interests of those who live on the land in fragile and isolated communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If Dr Jackson still has a point to make,
I will give way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Jackson: </strong>I wanted to make the
point that in last week's debate on Mr McLeish's motion we talked about
democratic accountability. I hope that, in the spirit of this new Parliament,
it will not be about our finding answers to questions; we would like everybody
to come on board when doing that. That is our focus.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Tosh: </strong>I accept that, but it is
the financial question that particularly concerns me. That, I am afraid,
means control of the public purse, which involves the Government. On that,

of its intentions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This morning, the Government has given

In many parts of our country, it is completing our strategic roads network.
Mr Dewar is giving me a look that indicates that his mood now is not much
better than that with which Mr Salmond credited him this morning, but two
years ago the UK Government came into office with a commitment to a strategic
roads review. That review has run for two years without coming to any conclusion.
Mr Neil asked the Executive a written question about road improvement and
received a response that revealed that ministers will be "taking stock".
There is no sign of when the Government will address the issue of strategic
roads.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This morning, on my strategic journey along
the A89-the A8 and M8 were blocked by an accident-I heard on the radio
that the director of the Confederation of British Industry in Scotland
is critically worried about the fact that our economy is uncompetitive
and that we do not have the opportunity to create the jobs or pursue the
economic development we need because there are so many gaps in our motorway
network that remain to be plugged. Members would be delighted to hear ministers
state clearly when they will make announcements and decisions on the issue.
I fear that the spirit of what we have been told and of the green paper
is that the Government will not do anything until its transport act is
in place and the committees have discussed all the issues. There are more
pressing problems that we should be tackling more urgently.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I referred to my alternative route to Edinburgh
this morning, along the A89 through the constituencies of Airdrie and Shotts,
Linlithgow and Livingston. It raises an obvious point: the danger of motorway
tolls is that we will not collect money or improve the environment, but
simply displace traffic. Many motorways can be ducked by taking alternative
routes. My fear is that motorway tolls will have no beneficial effect.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Who are the people who drive into cities
whom we are now going to tax to generate extra funding? By and large, they
are not people bent on achieving some anti-social purpose, but people who
need cities, who come to work in them and who undertake the hassle, ordeal,
loss of time and inconvenience of driving through them to get to their
places of employment. I wonder whether we should be penalising such people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Edinburgh has many surrounding areas where
wages are low and unemployment is rising. In the Borders, for example,
unemployment is not being offset by an increase in new jobs-as Mr Dewar
suggested this morning. Many people in the Borders have little option but
to come to Edinburgh to look for work. Once the Government's scheme is
up and running, presumably they will be faced either with increased parking
charges in the city or&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green): </strong>Does
Mr Tosh concede that building new roads-as was proved in London in the
case of the M25-simply creates more traffic? That is a fundamental environmental
perception. Study after study has shown that building more roads does not
cut traffic; it creates more traffic. All that happens is that the same
trouble is encountered further down the line.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, does Mr Tosh concede that improvements
in rail services to the Borders, for example as a result of opening up
the old railway line to Galashiels, would solve the problem in a much better
way than building more roads through the Borders?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Tosh: </strong>I take that point entirely.
If a rail scheme were introduced there, it would meet many of the concerns
of the area. I am sure that Borders people will be interested to examine
the partnership agreement and see how successfully the Liberal Democrats
implanted a rail strategy in their agreement with Labour-they did not.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On traffic generation, I do not know whether
Parkinson's law provides the answer in Scotland. We need to examine household
formation, the changing age structure and the female population's changing
participation in road use. We should view car ownership as related to long-term
social trends. Let us face it: we are nearly all drivers. We drive to work
and for leisure; we drive because it enriches our lives and because it
opens up activities which we could not participate in otherwise. Drivers
should not be seen as the enemy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My concern about charging motorists for
using existing roads is that they already pay very heavy taxes to use them.
They are paying for them already. They are paying for their maintenance.
That money is nowhere near being reinvested in roads. I am not suggesting
for a moment that we concrete over the whole country and build motorway
after motorway, but many members from local authority backgrounds and others
are acutely aware that councils have repeatedly approached successive Governments
and pointed to detailed, accurate and logically presented studies that
say that the key to economic development in many peripheral areas is the
provision of a good transport infrastructure.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a crying need in much of the country:
