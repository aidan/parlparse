reflection the Rev Johnston McKay, of the religious affairs department of the 
BBC.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Rev Johnston 
McKay (Editorial Consultant, Religious Broadcasting, BBC Scotland):</strong> A 
Scottish postgraduate student at Brown University in New York wrote just after 
11 September last year:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Everyone 
in the city has a World Trade Centre story, and everyone you talk to tells you 
their story, or the story of their friends. By degrees of separation you hear 
so many narratives, spread across the city, and it doesn't matter any more whose 
they are. It was one friend's wedding anniversary. Another friend was on the subway 
when it happened, going to Brooklyn, and probably underneath the World Trade Centre 
moments before it was hit.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She 
goes on to list many more stories.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some 
of the stories about 11 September were too painful for some of us to bear, even 
two thousand miles and a split second on television away. The stories of messages 
of love sent by mobile phone from the doomed aircraft were the ones that some 
of us stopped listening to, not because they were too powerful, but because they 
were too personal and too poignant.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
journalist Aaron Hicklin, looking back on 11 September, said in a television programme 
that what happened changed the way that New York perceived itself. He said:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Before 
September 11<SUP>th</SUP> there were lots of divisions and subdivisions. There 
were people who thought you needed a passport to go into Queen's. After September 
11th only one thing mattered: were you here or were you not here on September 
11th.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were all 
there.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the glimpses 
of hope that has emerged from the events of exactly a year ago is that because 
we were all there, and because we all have our accounts of where we were when 
we heard the news, 11 September has become our story. It is the story of Scotland's 
being linked in real and imaginative compassion with New York.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">people around the world can become 
for us all a glimpse of hope, because anything that creates&#151;for however brief 
a time&#151;unity in this fragmented world, and that can provide, however imaginatively, 
a symbol of compassion in what is so often a callous world, is a gesture of defiance 
against the wild anger that led to 11 September.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It

John McAllion (Dundee East) (Lab): </strong>On a point of order, Presiding Officer. 
I gave you prior notice of my point of order in relation to your decision not 
to select the amendment that was lodged in my name and which was signed by seven 
other back benchers from four different political parties. Given the level of 
support for that amendment and the fact that you have chosen an amendment that 
deals with the same topic&#151;a potential attack against Iraq&#151;but from a 
distinct perspective that many of us could not support, do you accept that you 
could be denying members of the Scottish Parliament a free vote and the opportunity 
to vote in accordance with their consciences on one of the most important issues 
that face Scotland today? Will you reconsider your decision and allow the Parliament 
to vote on my amendment at the end of business today?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dennis 
Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>Further to that point of order, Presiding Officer.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>The debate is heavily over-subscribed, so all time 
spent on points of order takes time from the debate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dennis 
Canavan: </strong>Sir David, you have not selected John McAllion's amendment despite 
the fact that it has the declared support of twice as many members as John Swinney's 
amendment, which has been selected. I ask you please to reconsider that decision, 
which will deprive the Parliament of the opportunity to have a democratic vote 
in principle for or against war in Iraq. If you are unwilling to change your decision 
on this occasion, please consider giving members the opportunity for such a democratic 
vote in the near future, so that the people of America can know what the people 
of Scotland's representatives think.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_5"></A>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>I thank John McAllion for giving me notice of his 
point of order. That enables me to draw the attention of members to the ruling 
that I gave on 16 November 2000 on the procedure for selecting amendments. I draw 
that to members' attention so that they can study it; I will not read it all out 
again.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the first point, 
I say that because John McAllion's amendment was supported by members of different 
parties, that automatically made me inclined to call it. I assure the chamber 
that I do not believe that amendments should be totally in the control of the 
party business managers. However, I have to think very carefully about the content 
of amendments and the purpose of the debate. There are many members in the </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13522">13522</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">chamber who think that neither amendment 
should be called and there are others who think that both amendments should be 
called. I understand both points of view.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have given the matter careful thought and there is a dividing line&#151;admittedly 
a thin one&#151;between the two amendments and I have decided to select Mr Swinney's 
amendment and not Mr McAllion's. I am afraid that that is a responsibility that 
is placed on me. I will ensure that representatives of those who signed John McAllion's 
amendment will be called to speak in the debate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, 
the debate is heavily oversubscribed and members of every party are going to be 
disappointed that they cannot be called. I suggest, therefore, that we begin the 
debate and that members study my previous ruling in the <I>Official Report</I>.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13523">13523</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Scotland's 
Links with the USA</STRONG></FONT></P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel): </STRONG>We turn now to the debate on motion 
S1M-3368 in the name of Jim Wallace, on Scotland's links with the USA, and one 
amendment to that motion.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14:37</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_7"></A>The 
Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice (Mr Jim Wallace): </strong>We are 
all mindful that today's debate on Scotland's links with the United States of 
America is taking place on the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the 
World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington DC, and of the deaths 
of those who were aboard the hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
behalf of the Scottish Executive, I reiterate the profound sense of shock and 
sorrow that was felt in Scotland when our American friends and colleagues were 
struck by that appalling tragedy. Today's debate is an opportunity to underline 
once more the solidarity that the Parliament and the Executive feel with the United 
States, as we look back together on the events of one year ago.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
believe that the debate is also an opportunity to look forward. There is much 
comfort and hope for the future for the United States and Scotland to draw from 
the ever-strengthening links between our two countries. It is in that spirit that 
we debate today's motion, which asks:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That 
the Parliament notes the educational, historical, cultural and economic links 
between Scotland and the USA and wishes to see these developed and enhanced to 
the mutual benefit of both countries.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
the Executive's view, today of all days is not an appropriate occasion on which 
to debate the foreign policy and military issues that are alluded to in the amendment 
that was lodged by the leader of the Scottish National Party. Of course, I acknowledge 
that the issue of Iraq is of widespread concern across all parties and all communities 
in Scotland. Indeed, Mr Swinney could have chosen that issue for debate in his 
party's allocated time tomorrow.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
the issue of potential military action is reserved to Westminster, it is not something 
on which there should be a formal Executive position. Accordingly, although I 
endorse wholly the position of my party leader at Westminster, I am not prepared 
today to dignify the amendment with an affirmative vote.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13524">13524</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, I want to concentrate on the 
motion that commemorates the tragedy of last year's events by focusing on the 
growing range of links between Scotland and the United States, and on the mutual 
benefits that we firmly believe those links bring to both of our countries. The 
United States has always been of special importance to Scots&#151;our links stretch 
back over centuries and encompass a flow of ideas and people that has helped both 
our countries to grow and prosper. The vibrant exchange of people, science, technology, 
research, commerce and the arts between our two countries continues to this day.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
remember today the tragedy that befell New York and we recall that that great 
city has many strong links with Scotland. It was there that many of our ancestors 
first set eyes on the new land of their dreams; a land that welcomed them and 
where many prospered. The strength and resilience that has been shown by New York 
city over the past year has once again shown us in Scotland, and the whole world, 
that we thrive best when we work together and look out and care for each other. 
Indeed, New York's recovery is testament to the fact that we are stronger together.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 
new Parliament and the new constitutional arrangements under devolution offer 
Scotland a unique opportunity not only to work harder to improve the lives of 
Scots at home, but to be more proactive in international links. It is because 
of our strong links with the United States that the Executive took the important 
step last year of establishing a new post of first secretary for Scottish affairs 
in the British embassy in Washington DC, to promote Scotland in the United States, 
to build links with US organisations and individuals, to advance our priority 
goals together, and to open up opportunities for us to learn from the wealth of 
talent and experience that America has to offer. In establishing the US post it 
was important that it be based in the British embassy, which provides us with 
direct access to US-wide resources and support through working closely with the 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the network of consulates throughout the United 
States.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Scottish affairs 
office has an important role in driving forward the Executive's strategy to develop 
business, commercial, educational and cultural links with the United States. It 
has already established links with US academic, business and cultural organisations, 
as well as with a wide range of American-Scottish groups. It works closely with 
Scottish Enterprise, particularly on the globalScot initiative. It is working 
with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC and with Scottish Executive 
colleagues to implement plans to showcase Scottish culture at next year's Smithsonian 
Folklife Festival. That two-week festival takes place on America's back lawn, 
the </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13525">13525</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">National Mall in Washington DC, and 
affords an ideal opportunity to project Scottish culture.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
in Scotland are fortunate to enjoy a unique degree of recognition in the USA. 
That is, of course, partly because of past emigration of our people&#151;25 million 
Americans currently identify themselves as having Scottish heritage. Think of 
our contribution to US history. Witness the Scottish origins of many of the founding 
fathers. Think of the Scottish intellectuals, for example James Witherspoon at 
Princeton, who helped to create some of American's most prestigious universities. 
Think of engineering and scientific innovations that are represented by, for example, 
Alexander Graham Bell, and think of great industrialists and philanthropists, 
such as Andrew Carnegie. Those links continue today, which is only right for a 
country that produces one of the highest proportions of graduates of any region 
in Europe. To take one example, the e-bridge between the University of Edinburgh 
and the University of Connecticut at Stamford provides a means by which academics 
on both sides of the Atlantic can collaborate to push back the boundaries of research 
and innovation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is precisely 
because of Scotland's strengths in education and science that our strategy for 
engagement in the USA over the next 12-18 months will have science, technology 
and education as its major focus. We are already working with states in the United 
States that are recognised as centres of excellence in those areas. Massachusetts, 
for example, has strong Scottish links and unparalleled educational and scientific 
communities. Illinois also has many business and cultural links with Scotland. 
We will continue to pursue those links and others.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of 
course, we are not forgetting that we possess in Scotland some of the most recognised 
national symbols of any country in the world, such as tartan, our whisky, our 
landscape and our golf courses, which are renowned magnets for international tourism, 
not least from the US. We will not ignore our traditional strengths of golf, whisky 
and tourism, all of which have a part to play in projecting Scotland in America, 
but we will also promote and celebrate the contemporary strengths of Scotland, 
which are the key to our future economic well-being; Scottish universities, Scottish 
science and technology, and Scottish financial acumen. Through working with the 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office and our partner agencies, such as VisitScotland 
and the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, the Executive is conscious 
of the substantial reservoir of good will that exists towards us in the US.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
the time that remains to me, I will highlight our law enforcement, education and 
cultural links with </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13526">13526</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">America. In his winding-up speech, 
my colleague Iain Gray, the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning 
will describe links in business, higher education and transport.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scotland 
and the United States felt together at Lockerbie the devastation that is wrought 
by international terrorism. Because of the threats that are posed by international 
terrorism&#151;threats that we saw carried out so tragically on 11 September 2001&#151;we 
must join forces across international borders and be committed to increased and 
more effective cross-border co-operation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
police and ministerial level we have fostered excellent links with law enforcement 
agencies in the United States. Scottish police forces and the Scottish Drug Enforcement 
Agency co-operate closely with their US counterparts on operational matters. Scottish 
officers benefit from training opportunities that are provided by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation and other US organisations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
his visit to New York for tartan day this spring, the First Minister received 
a briefing from the US Drug Enforcement Administration. As a direct follow-up 
to contacts that were made then, senior representatives from the United States' 
DEA will attend a special meeting of the Scottish drug enforcement forum at the 
Scottish Police College later this month to deliver a series of presentations 
covering emerging world drug trends and joint working arrangements in the US. 
The forum will enable a full and valuable exchange of views and expertise between 
the central players in drug enforcement here and in America. That sharing of knowledge 
and expertise will help Scottish law enforcement agencies to build on their own 
progress and successes in tackling the drugs threat.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
good example of law enforcement links with the US was a recent conference that 
was hosted by the Scottish Police College for the FBI national executive institute. 
The institute is an important educational programme that is designed to meet the 
needs of the chief executive officers of the 200 largest law enforcement agencies 
of the United States, and their international colleagues. Since the institute's 
formation in 1976, more than 600 police executives have graduated from it. On 
this occasion, UK participants included the chief constable of Strathclyde police. 
Such international networks are an important means of learning from each other. 
It is widely recognised that organised crime is increasingly becoming a global 
problem, so we must have the fullest international co-operation. I am pleased 
that Scotland hosted that event and I warmly welcome the American involvement.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Educational 
links with the US are already well established throughout the country and at all

pen-pals and school visits in primary schools, to video making and videoconferencing, 
to sports scholarships, student exchanges and gap years in and after secondary 
school, to student teacher placements and teacher exchanges in the years to follow. 
This year, the British Council has arranged, through its Fulbright UK/US teacher 
exchange scheme, eight whole-year teacher exchanges, three more for a shorter 
period and two reciprocal head-teacher work shadows. In addition, two local authorities 
in Scotland have long-established teacher exchange links with Michigan and Chicago. 
Such exchanges offer an ideal opportunity for professionals to learn about the 
educational approaches and policies of the other country and to establish lasting 
friendships and working links, which benefit schools, towns, authorities and cohorts 
of pupils. The personal, social and professional gains are self-evident.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Special 
factors often underpin such links. For example, Aberdeen City Council's education 
department is pursuing links with all the towns in the USA that bear the name 
of Aberdeen, and Hamilton District Youth Theatre in Scotland has a link with the 
Encore Summer Theater for Youth in Hamilton, Ohio. East Lothian has the John Muir 
awards and is linked with Yosemite in California. Dunbar Primary School has links 
with Yosemite Valley School. Lockerbie Academy has links with Syracuse University 
in New York state that arose from the tragedy of the Lockerbie bombing, and Operation 
Friendship in Lockerbie is partnered with Operation Friendship in Indianapolis.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
notable success that is based on an idea from Georgia, USA has been Achievers 
International. That is a school based import-export programme in which schools 
trade products with partner schools around the globe, setting up companies and 
seeking sponsorship from local businesses and local enterprise companies. Some 
60 Scottish schools are currently involved, linking with 20 states throughout 
the USA.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The eleventh of 
September has had an impact&#151;we hope that it is temporary&#151;on some of 
those links, yet the Scottish Executive's international education conference, 
which is being held on 11 September, just as it was last year, emphasises that 
international understanding is founded on personal links and the growth of awareness 
among young people and that with such links, we can help such understanding to 
grow and flourish from an early age. We welcome particularly at this time the 
strength of our educational links with the US.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
mentioned the work that we are doing on the promotion of Scottish culture with 
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. The annual Smithsonian Folklife Festival 
is one of the highlights of the </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13528">13528</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">American summer season. More than 
1 million people from throughout the USA visited the festival last year. The Scottish 
Executive was therefore delighted to accept an invitation from the Smithsonian 
Institution for Scotland to participate in the July 2003 event. That will be a 
unique opportunity to showcase the best in Scottish culture and to present fully 
the vibrant and exciting traditional culture that informs and stimulates our contemporary 
culture.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The strength of 
Scottish-American historical links and the degree of interest in the connections 
between Scottish and US contemporary culture and heritage were apparent at the 
events that were organised for the biggest and best-ever tartan day celebrations 
earlier this year. Our involvement in the Smithsonian festival will allow us to 
add to our many friends in the USA who cherish and enjoy Scotland's rich cultural 
traditions. We look forward to working with the Smithsonian Institution and our 
Scottish partners to make that a truly memorable event of which Scotland can be 
proud.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We stand by our 
American friends in remembering the dreadful events of a year ago and we admire 
the resilience that the United States has shown. That resilience of the human 
spirit was reflected today both at the Lauriston fire station, where a memorial 
plaque to the serving fire officers and others who gave their lives was unveiled, 
and at the service at St Giles cathedral. In his time for reflection address, 
Johnston McKay talked about that resilience of the human spirit in the poignant 
and personal phone calls that were made by people on the planes who knew that 
they were going to die.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
the end of last year, members received a set of poems by pupils from Williamwood 
High School in Clarkston, reflecting their reactions to the events of 11 September 
2001. One of those poems, by Sean Donnachie in form 1, brings out the very human 
side of that day and the personal resilience that was shown.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;On

is the thoughts that are captured in that poem that many of us will be reflecting 
on in the course of today. We take the opportunity that the debate provides to 
reflect, but also to look forward to deepening and broadening our ties with America 
over the coming months and years. It can be difficult to turn our thoughts to 
the future as we remember the tragic events of the recent past, but I believe 
that by strengthening our links with the United States we not only show solidarity 
with the American people, but we play our part in rebuilding international confidence

we tried, as friends of the American people, to offer our sympathy and support. 
We do so again today to reiterate the common values and bonds that we share with 
the people of the United States.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those

following centuries. Present estimates suggest that between 9 million and 24 million 
Americans claim Scots descent. Those may be ambitious or, perhaps, exaggerated 
numbers, but one gets a flavour of their reality here at home. Last year, along 
with Duncan Hamilton, I visited the genealogy centre at Northton on the island 
of Harris. On a map of the United States, the curators of the centre had carefully 
plotted the destinations of thousands of emigrants from the Western Isles. The 
map is an intensely congested picture of changing lives and new hopes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those 
and other Scots emigrants have helped to shape the American way of life&#151;a 
culture of optimism and innovation, with a firm and unyielding belief in the great 
principles of freedom, justice and democracy. Among those many Scots, there are 
famous people who have contributed handsomely to the rich tapestry that is now 
the United States. Andrew Carnegie, John Muir and Alexander Graham Bell, to name 
but three, have made astonishing and varied contributions to life in the United 
States.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, we have 
contributed far more than talent and people. Scotland, and ideas that have been 
forged in Scotland, have helped to create the very fabric of the United States. 
Frances Wright&#151;a Scot who settled in America in 1824&#151;dedicated her life 
to the abolition of slavery, universal education and equal rights for women. In 
1828, she delivered an independence day address in which she defined the United 
States as</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;the palladium 
of human liberty&#151;the favoured scene of human improvement.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks 
to the efforts of Scots Americans, there is now a new day of national celebration 
in the US&#151;tartan day. I have had the privilege of attending the tartan day 
celebrations in Washington and New York three times. Amid the splendour of Capitol 
Hill and collection of tartans assembled from around the country, one of the great 
themes that emerges from the Americans who participate is a deep appreciation 
that Scotland's political history has informed their political development. The 
1320 declaration of Arbroath is commonly viewed as having inspired the American 
declaration of independence. John Witherspoon&#151;to whom the Deputy First Minister 
referred&#151;was born in Beith and was one of nine Scots who signed the declaration 
of independence. He trained the leadership of the US&#151;one president, one vice-president, 
12 state governors, 56 state legislators and 33 judges, including three Supreme 
Court judges. Earlier this year, George Reid reminded the Parliament that Witherspoon 
brought the ideas of the Scottish enlightenment to those young revolutionary minds. 
Such ideas were based on social cohesion and </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13531">13531</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

of the outstanding success and influence of Scots who have settled in America 
has been attributed to the fundamental belief in the value of education. To this 
day, Americans celebrate the contribution of Scots to the education of their young 
men and women. Between 1726 and 1837, Presbyterians founded some 65 academies&#151;or 
log colleges&#151;in North America. The historian Tom Devine noted that in the 
later 18<SUP>th</SUP> century, almost all the colonial medical profession in North 
America were Scots or Scots trained.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Educational 
links between our two countries have continued to flourish. The University of 
Glasgow was the first university in the UK to open an office in the heartland 
of silicon valley. From the enlightenment to the development of technology that 
was undreamt of even a few years ago, educational links between the US and Scotland 
have run deep. Every year, universities throughout Scotland are enriched by the 
contribution of students from North America, who bring with them much more than 
academic excellence. The advent of superbowl parties in student flats is a recent 
example of cross-cultural exchange.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Diehards 
may shudder, but in recent years, Hampden Park and Murrayfield have not just been 
the national stadiums for football and rugby. The hallowed turf has also played 
host to American gridiron. For those who understand the game, the Scottish Claymores 
have been one of the leading American football teams in Europe.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is virtually no country on earth that is untouched by US cultural influence. From 
&quot;Dallas&quot; through &quot;Dynasty&quot; to &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;The 
West Wing&quot;, American creativity has been enjoyed by millions of Scots. That 
creativity, which is evident in films, television and elsewhere, is not just a 
testament to US talent&#151;it is a reminder of the great entrepreneurial spirit 
that is so redolent of America. That spirit is fuelled by what is sometimes called 
the American way&#151;the belief that, no matter how humble an individual's background, 
there should be no barriers to individual achievement. Scots have flourished in 
that economic culture.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century, Scots led the way in the development of shipbuilding 
on the east coast of America and contributed massively to the expansion of the 
railways. The contemporary economic links between our two countries support many 
thousands of jobs. In Scotland, we are grateful that the people of America have 
the good sense to value the water of life. Whisky exports are worth hundreds of 
millions of pounds to distilleries in Scotland. However, not only the whisky industry 
benefits from American tastes. Last year, Scottish exports to the US were worth

important export market.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout 
the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, Scotland benefited from US inward investment. US 
investment was vital in establishing silicon glen and global names such as IBM 
and Honeywell found a base in Scotland. Currently, the nature of inward investment 
is changing. The way forward is to capitalise on Scotland's strengths, the education 
and ingenuity of our people and the academic excellence of our universities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
traffic is by no means all one way. Scottish companies with global ambitions have 
sought investment opportunities in the United States. We must encourage Scottish 
firms to grasp such opportunities. When the Scottish North American Business Council 
was launched three years ago, Philip Lader, then US ambassador to the UK, said:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We 
Americans have much to learn from the innovators of Scotland.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such 
remarks show the valuable reputation that we have abroad for innovation and honesty 
in business. We must build on that reputation to help us through difficult times.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those 
historic, educational, cultural and economic links have created strong bonds between 
our two countries. Those are bonds that we have cherished in creating and we are 
determined that they will endure. Those bonds have been strengthened out of tragedy 
and the shared sense of grief and revulsion that all of us felt one year ago. 
Three Scots were killed in the World Trade Center and the hearts of millions were 
touched. We felt helpless, but that did not prevent the people of Scotland from 
trying to help. A Glasgow policeman told his two children, aged nine and 11, that 
he was raising money for families of victims and they decided to make their own 
contribution. They sold their toys for &#163;173 to boost the value of the fund.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stories 
such as that one show the reality of the close friendship between our two countries, 
but with that close friendship comes a right and a duty to say what we think a 
friend needs to hear. In our personal lives we give advice to friends that they 
may not want to hear, but which we think they need to hear. So too, in our national 
life, we offer advice to our friends that we believe they should hear. In that 
spirit, we offer these views.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

it. Those who challenge it must be dealt with severely, on the basis of evidence

usually pay the highest price when military action is unleashed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those 
of us who express misgivings about unilateral military strikes have no illusions

be undertaken only in accordance with international law. A large majority of people 
in Scotland appear to be opposed to a military offensive. It is right that the

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">us to reflect on our special relationship 
with America, which is bound by links that have been close and enduring since 
Scots left these shores to carve a new life in that new country. When the appalling 
events of 11 September last year unfolded, and that savage barbarism was visited 
on innocent people, we felt with particular keenness the outrage, horror, bewilderment 
and dismay that was experienced all over the world.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those 
of us who were at St Giles cathedral earlier today drew comfort from the service

reflections and to look ahead. Members certainly drew comfort from Johnston McKay's 
words in the chamber earlier. That is why it is timely and fitting that we should 
remember those black and horrific events in the Parliament today. It is also timely 
and fitting that we in Scotland should reassure our friends that, as we reflect 
on our memory, we also reflect on our friendship with America and look to the 
future, mindful of the positive virtues and attributes of our friendship.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">September 
11 of last year is a date that is marked indelibly in the annals of history. It 
is unique for the most horrendous reasons, but it is also a catalyst for going 
forward positively. That is why I say with regret that the amendment to the Executive 
motion that has been lodged by the Scottish National Party seems to me to be in 
poor taste. The amendment is inappropriate to the debate and to the Parliament. 
The motion was an opportunity for the Parliament to demonstrate unanimity of sentiment 
and support for an old friend. It is unfortunate that the SNP has chosen to diminish 
that opportunity. If the SNP insisted on raising matters outwith the motion, it 
would have been sensitive for it to do so in its own debating time tomorrow, without 
intruding on this debate. It is my pleasure, on behalf of the Conservatives, to 
speak to and to support the motion.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
remember my first encounter with Americans. When I was a little girl, my father 
brought home two American sailors&#151;naval officers, I presume&#151;from the 
Polaris base on the Clyde. It was interesting for two reasons. First, my father 
was not in the habit of bringing home sailors. Secondly, when the two officers 
removed their naval caps, they revealed to my astonishment that their hair was 
cut short across the tops of their heads&#151;to accommodate their caps, as I 
thought. Without realising that it was a crew cut, I assumed that America must 
be a very cold place where everybody had to have their hair shaved off to accommodate 
appropriate headgear. I also remember their geniality and warmth, which was obvious 
even to a small child. That is a hallmark of Americans. Certainly, the physical 
presence of Americans in Scotland&#151;perhaps most notably </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13536">13536</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">during the second world war and at 
the naval base on the Clyde&#151;has been a tangible demonstration of the empathy 
that exists between our two countries.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
empathy is not surprising, however, given the strong Scottish influence that there 
has been on America. James Wilson, who was born in St Andrews and settled in Philadelphia, 
and Dr John Witherspoon, of whom mention has been made and who was also born in 
Scotland, were signatories of the declaration of independence. A further seven 
signatories were directly or indirectly descended from Scots. That got the States 
off to a good start. Another Scot, Alexander Hamilton, proposed the American national 
banking system and is now depicted on the American $10 bill. Thirty-five United 
States Supreme Court justices have been Scots, and numerous locations in America 
have been nostalgically named after places that Scottish immigrants left behind. 
There are eight Aberdeens, seven Glasgows and&#151;here is a statistic to conjure 
with&#151;eight Edinburghs. No fewer than 11 United States Presidents have been 
of Scots ancestry and one of them&#151;Woodrow Wilson&#151;said:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Every 
line of strength in American history is a line coloured with Scottish blood.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Small 
wonder that, with that pedigree and those influences, there is a special historical 
and genealogical bond between our two countries.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
enduring closeness continues in a physical form today. I am delighted that Liane 
Dorsey, from the United States Consulate General, is with us today. She has taken 
an enthusiastic interest in the Parliament since 1999&#151;an interest that has 
been obvious to all members&#151;and her presence here is very welcome. Another 
prominent American in Scotland, who is also a lady&#151;I still distinguish ladies 
from women&#151;is Susan Rice, the chief executive of Lloyds TSB Scotland. She 
is prominent in Scottish public life and has taken a keen interest in Scottish 
affairs. We are pleased that, after Alexander Hamilton explained banking to America, 
the United States has been able to send Susan Rice back over here to check that 
we are still on top of the game.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Besides 
those historical, cultural and personal links between our countries, there are 
some important business aspects. Figures for 2000-01 show that approximately 12 
per cent of Scotland's exports go to the United States at a value of around &#163;2.5 
billion a year. Visitors from the USA represent the largest source of overseas 
tourism in Scotland, accounting for &#163;189 million&#151;24 per cent of expenditure 
by foreign tourists in this country. There are also roughly 287 American companies 
in Scotland. Naturally, the events of last year influenced the confidence of Americans 
in air travel, and that has been visible in Scotland. </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13537">13537</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We hope that renewed confidence will 
emerge, so that we can welcome more Americans to our country.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
those business links indicate, there is mutual opportunity to be developed. America 
has a remarkable entrepreneurial aptitude and a willingness to tackle things. 
Theodore Roosevelt said:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Do 
what you can, with what you have, where you are.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scots 
adopt the same practical approach. Recently, Susan Rice said to me:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There 
is a similarity of mindset. People in the US are brought up to believe that anyone 
can achieve anything they want. Common man makes good. In Scotland, people eschew 
airs and graces and make a place for anyone who has merit.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
agree with her. However, I think that the Scots would concede that we seem to 
lack the confidence that is so obvious in the enterprise of America, where there 
are examples for us to follow.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
should look at that unashamed, unabashed entrepreneurial attitude and emulate 
it over here. We should borrow from that confident, irrepressible energy. We should 
admire a political climate that nurtures and facilitates enterprise and does not 
seek to obstruct it. We should copy a model that says that business breeds business.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
am told that at the BIO 2002 conference in Toronto earlier this year, Lord Sainsbury, 
on behalf of the United Kingdom, indicated that research spending in the UK would 
increase by 5 to 7 per cent per annum. A delegate from the audience intimated 
that the National Institutes of Health in the USA would increase research funding 
by 10 to 15 per cent per annum and double the budget in five years.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
is our vision? What about our transport links? What about our physical connections 
with America? There must be improved transatlantic air travel. If we are to develop 
the marvellous opportunities that exist for both countries, we must find a way 
of physically manifesting them to enable that mobility of travel for holiday and 
business purposes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Parliament has certainly facilitated contact with the United States and tartan 
day is an obvious example of that. It has also led to parliamentary visits with 
reference to trade, research and development potential. Indeed, the Deputy First 
Minister referred to the Scottish affairs office. We applaud those initiatives, 
which are fruitful and worth while. We would like to see those links improved.

was a bit like being in an old cathedral, feeling the history and the past generations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An 
exhibition has also taken place at Ellis Island that shows the extent of immigration 
from the Highlands and Islands. We should never forget that when Scottish landowners 
displaced our people, America accepted them. It would be romanticising events 
to say that they were accepted with open arms. That was not always the case, and 
from my time visiting Ellis Island I became aware of the tragedy that some of 
them faced, with families being split up or not being able to make the journey. 
That is detailed by the people who were affected.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
in Scotland have close links to America through our shared heritage. Those who 
went to America became Americans but have always retained their links to Scotland 
and their Scottish heritage. Millions of Americans claim to have Scottish roots. 
The growth of the internet allows those people to have direct access to documents 
relating to their family history. That enables them to forge links with the places 
that their families came from. They are able to visit places that their ancestors 
left and make contact with family members who are still in Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
Scotland, there are plans to construct a hilltop memorial to victims of the clearances 
in Helmsdale and to develop a research centre. I hope that VisitScotland will 
be mindful of that project in its marketing campaigns. They should also be mindful 
of directing visitors to Croick church, where those cleared off the land etched 
their messages on the church windows as they sheltered outside.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
not only the Highlands have links to America. Such links are found across Scotland 
and I am sure that members will take the opportunity today to outline their local 
links.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Annabel Goldie 
said, there are many places in America that are named after Scottish cities. Time 
after time, the names Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow appear. Our cities were 
built around trade and much of that was with America, resulting in the forging 
of historical links.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

to come over and investigate their family history and see Scotland as it is today:

Apart from our heritage and beautiful scenery, we have world-class golf courses, 
such as St Andrews&#151;indeed, the Americans say that the hole number 1 at Machrihanish 
is the best hole number 1 in the world. We also have the Edinburgh festival, which 
draws visitors from all over the world.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
other sectors too, the ties with America are important. Oil companies that are 
based in the States have provided and continue to provide jobs in the North sea. 
Those jobs are important to people throughout Scotland and are especially important 
to the city of Aberdeen, where many companies have set up UK headquarters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
Inverness, an American-owned company, Inverness Medical, provides more than 1,000 
jobs&#151;one of the largest private companies in the area. It works with local 
health agencies to provide much-needed research and development in diabetes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
is not the only health-related link that we have with the USA; there are many 
more, such as the &#163;100,000 fellowship to study cancer services in both countries. 
That joint working will identify new ideas and methods of care which will benefit 
both countries. We must do all that we can to strengthen such economic ties, encourage 
more companies to set up bases in Scotland and also learn from their experience.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
American people are proud of their Scottish roots and have established tartan 
day to celebrate them. In this Parliament, we have supported those events by having 
debates and sending delegations. It is a wonderful sight to see thousands of pipers 
marching and playing in the streets of New York. Tartan day provides an important 
focus on Scotland, giving us a stage not only for our culture, but for our industry. 
The USA is one of our biggest export markets and we need to ensure that it grows.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
can learn much from the people of New York about how we can live side by side 
with people of different cultures and religions. The city's population is so diverse 
that visitors from any country feel at home. We can learn much from their acceptance 
of immigrants and our football supporters could learn a lot from the Rangers supporter

at an Education, Culture and Sport Committee event in New Lanark. Cathy Peattie 
received a call on her mobile from her daughter outside our hotel and we all rushed 
in to watch the television.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New 
Lanark was an appropriate place&#151;if any place can be called that&#151;to start 
to reflect on a different world. In contrast to what we saw that day, New Lanark 
is founded on vision and hope. It was there that Robert Owen, in his new year's 
day address to the inhabitants, in 1816, wrote:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
know that society may be formed so as to exist without crime, without poverty, 
with health greatly improved, with little, if any misery, and with intelligence 
and happiness increased a hundredfold; and no obstacle whatsoever intervenes at 
this moment except ignorance to prevent such a state of society from becoming 
universal&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Robert 
Owen tried to put into practice those utopian ideals and that utopian vision in 
New Lanark, but we should also recall that he tried to build a utopian community 
in America at New Harmony. The state in which New Harmony is situated is built 
on a utopian ideal. Indeed, all the states of the United States of America are 
built on a utopian ideal.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
tragedy of 11 September showed us how far we are from utopia. To be far from utopia 
means feeling the pain and hurt of being a human being. We felt&#151;and we still 
feel&#151;the pain and hurt of the entire American people. Every member has friends 
in the United States. All of us spoke to them by phone or e-mailed them in the 
hours and days after the events. We are duty-bound as friends as well as human

pain of the Iraqi people. We should not be afraid of saying in the Parliament 
of all places that we want to create a utopia for them and for us, even if it 
is the hardest of tasks. We can do so only by underpinning that with the rule 
of law&#151;Robert Owen knew that. We can do so only if we all accept that we 
cannot run off as individuals or individual states to follow individual causes

the grieving families who have been left behind in New York, Scotland and elsewhere. 
In a wonderful piece in <I>The Guardian</I> today, the historian, Simon Schama, 
describes in terms that would break the hardest of hearts the bereaved British 
families who attended a church in New York less than two weeks after 11 September. 
In my constituency, there is a grieving family who lost their son on 11 September 
in New York. It would be wrong for anyone in the Parliament to argue that the 
hearts of every member do not go out to the people of America and to those who

perpetrated against the American people on that day.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Equally, 
we must remember that those who died on 11 September believed that they were living 
in a democracy. Those who survived them still hold that faith in democracy. In 
democracies, the right to freedom of speech and to unfettered debate in representative 
institutions is sacrosanct, particularly during the difficult times, when democracies 
are under attack and on difficult days such as today.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
do not accept the arguments of those who say that, on a day such as today, it 
is somehow indecent or in poor taste, or shows a lack of respect, to debate what 
the consequences, the implications and the lessons of 11 September might be. The 
entire world is debating those issues. To limit in any way open and democratic 
debate in the Parliament is to hand the perpetrators of the attacks on 11 September 
a very small victory, which they do not deserve and which we should not give them. 
I am encouraged that the SNP's amendment has allowed us to have a debate about 
Iraq on a day such as today, although I cannot support it, because it sanctions 
a war against Iraq in circumstances that I cannot support.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
I listened to the radio this morning, I heard a New Yorker describe the atmosphere 
in New York today as quiet, subdued and personal but also watchful of those American 
politicians who might seek to use today to exploit that atmosphere for their own 
purposes. The New Yorker said that, in his view, many people in New York did not 
want what happened to them to be used as an excuse to perpetrate on third world 
countries outrages on an even larger scale that would murder even more innocent 
men, women and children. We have seen that happen already in Afghanistan and it 
may well happen in Iraq if Parliaments such as the Scottish Parliament do not 
come out to express their views forcefully. That is why it is right that we debate 
what might happen to Iraq in the weeks and months ahead.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
Iraq, we find exactly the same sort of working men, women and children as would 
have been found in New York on that terrible day. It will do nothing to console 
those who lost their loved ones or to honour the memory of those who gave their 
lives if those Iraqis are killed in a devastating war that only the likes of the 
United States can launch against a third world country. We do not have television 
pictures of the suffering in Afghanistan and we would not get television pictures

those dreadful events, there is much talk of war&#151;war against the tyrant Saddam 
Hussein. After 11 September, the allies went to war against al-Qa'ida and the 
Taliban in Afghanistan. Now there is talk of war to achieve a regime change in 
Baghdad. We have a duty to articulate the concerns and fears of our constituents 
and to advise the powers that be. War cannot be anything other than an action 
of last resort. We cannot continue in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century to use the methods 
of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> and 20<SUP>th</SUP> centuries. Clausewitz said that war 
is simply the achievement of foreign policy by other means. Talk of war to achieve 
a change in regime sounds Clausewitzian to me.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
we want to combat terrorism, we need to strike not only at the terrorists but 
at the causes of terrorism. Whether we understand it or not, terrorism is the 
result of despair and a feeling of hopelessness. The root of the problem of terrorism 
emanating from the middle east is the complete failure to tackle the Arab-Israeli 
problem. Terrorism will never be defeated until the cause or causes of the problem 
are resolved. A just settlement in the middle east is necessary before the current 
level of terrorism can be effectively eradicated.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13551">13551</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

flawed, particularly in the middle east. Of course, we must condemn the monster 
Saddam Hussein and his evil, despotic regime. However, I fear that an invasion

been buried under the rubble of their homes, but not Osama bin Laden. Similarly,

will not be those of Saddam Hussein or his associates because, like Osama bin

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(SNP): </strong>For just 
a minute, I want to take Parliament to the heart of Dixie: to Alabama, which shares 
with us the saltire as its flag; to the state capital Montgomery, which was built 
by Abercrombies, Grahams, McBrydes and McQueens; and to the middle of Montgomery, 
where stands the Tullibody Fine Arts Center. I want to honour a Scot from Tullibody, 
William Burns Paterson, who, in the aftermath of the greatest catastrophe America 
ever experienced&#151;the civil war, with hundreds of thousands dead and wounded&#151;worked 
unceasingly in that society for justice, reconciliation and peace. He is virtually 
unknown here, but to millions of African-Americans he is a hero.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paterson 
was born in 1850. When he left Tullibody for the United States, he took with him 
the priceless gift of the Scottish emigrant&#151;though the son of a landless 
labourer, he was literate. In the United States, there were 4 million American 
ex-slaves, who were newly liberated but penniless. Some of them asked Paterson 
to help them to read and write, and he did so, teaching first in ditches, then 
in a shack and then in a permanent building, which he called, using the terminology 
of the time, the Tullibody Academy for Negroes. That body was to grow into Alabama 
State University, which was the progenitor of universal education for African-Americans. 
Paterson was its founder and he served as its president for 37 years.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paterson 
said that education is liberation. It is the key to understanding the enemy. However, 
the forces of reaction and violence struck back. His school was burned down. He 
rebuilt it. His grant was withdrawn. He worked unpaid. The wise said, &quot;Leave 
it to Washington,&quot; but he replied that on issues of conscience and humanity 
a man must speak where he stands. A scarecrow was put in the yard of the university 
and attached to it was a message to the &quot;Scotch nigger teacher&quot; telling 
him to go home to Scotland. When the Ku Klux Klan came next morning, they found 
Paterson in his rocking chair on the porch with, behind the curtains as they twitched, 
15 ex-Confederate sharpshooters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, 
Alabama State University, with 5,000 students, is a major centre of educational 
excellence that still turns out African-American teachers and scholars in significant 
numbers and is still loyal to Paterson's principles. It was in Tullibody hall&#151;in 
Paterson hall&#151;that students and academics planned the Montgomery boycott. 
When Rosa Parks sat down on a white seat, black America rose up, the civil rights 
movement started and segregation was ended.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
a speech to students, Martin Luther King paid tribute to Paterson's fundamental

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Martin Luther King questioned whether 
violence could ever be justified and whether war could be justified. He said&#151;in 
language that was strikingly similar to that used by the Church of Scotland this 
week&#151;that it could be, if four tests were met: first, that evil existed; 
secondly, that every remedy had been explored and put aside; thirdly, that violence 
had a higher moral sanction; and fourthly, that any action must not make a bad 
situation worse.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In &quot;A 
Knock at Midnight&quot;&#151;a sermon to the students&#151;Martin Luther King 
took up Paterson's theme and said:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Isn't

like us to remember a little about some of the famous Scots who helped us to shape 
our combined history. Some of those connections find their origins in the kingdom 
of Fife. In the nearest main town to the constituency that I represent, Dunfermline 
Opera House once stood. In 1955, the opera house was closed; it was eventually 
demolished and shipped to America, where it was rebuilt in Sarasota&#151;a town 
that was founded by Scots. In the 1880s, Scots who were looking for a new start 
boarded steamer ships and set sail for Sarasota. It is believed that John Hamilton 
Gillespie, a Scottish aristocrat, lawyer and member of the Queen's bodyguard for 
Scotland, built America's first golf course in Sarasota.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
October, the convener of Fife Council will lead a delegation to Sarasota. I, too, 
will visit Sarasota on holiday in October and I pledge to do what I can, as a 
keen visitor of many years' standing, to support our links in America. Robert 
Lockhart, another emigrant Scot, laid out a course at Yonkers, north of New York 
city, in the following year. The subsequent club, the first in the USA, was named 
the St Andrews Golf Club in 1888.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
1828 and 1829, women's education in America received a considerable impetus from 
the teachings of Frances Wright. Born in Scotland in 1795, well schooled and a 
friend of Lafayette and many free thinkers, Miss Wright helped to co-edit a newspaper 
in New Harmony on the Indiana frontier and later her own paper, the <I>Free Enquirer</I>, 
in New York. Miss Wright was a radical champion of equal rights for women. Andrew 
Carnegie, born in Dunfermline in 1835, emigrated with his family to Alleghany 
City, Pennsylvania in 1848. He worked in a cotton factory, then as a telegraph 
clerk, becoming a superintendent in 1859.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Different

an accumulated history and we often think about things in a similar fashion. However, 
we are different places and the differences are sometimes more real than apparent.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is not by accident that the United Kingdom and the United States share a special

in all sorts of ways and the people have a lot to offer. On the whole, they are 
very genuine and warm.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
although there is much to be admired in America, we should not confuse our friendship 
with the American people with our ability genuinely to dispute some of the policy 
positions of the American Administration. When we remember the people in the twin 
towers and consider why there is terrorism in the world today, we must relate 
that not only to what has happened in the past but to what might happen in the 
future. It is relevant to the debate that we discuss the Iraqi situation, because 
it is about the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States 
as well as between the different nations that make up the United Nations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
SNP is not a pacifist party. We clearly gave our backing to the international 
community in its campaign against Saddam Hussein in 1990. We share the horror 
of what Saddam represents to the Iraqi people and to other people within that 
area, but that in itself is no justification for unilateral action that could 
destroy the lives of many innocent Iraqi people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
must bear in mind the substantive points that Mike Rumbles made in his speech 
about the fact that we must deal not only with the effects of terrorism, but with 
the root cause of terrorism. I could think of nothing better designed to create 
more Osama bin Ladens in this world than if we go into Iraq and bomb the place 
to smithereens. That would create enormous resentment, not only in Iraq. Besides 
the inhumanity of doing that to innocent men, women and children, such actions 
would have a fundamental and immediate effect throughout the middle east and rest 
of the world. When we consider possible military action of the kind that is being 
contemplated by the United States, possibly in alliance with the UK and the state 
of Israel, we must also examine the potential consequences of any such action.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whether 
the objective is to change the regime or to get rid of weapons of mass destruction, 
there are different ways to skin the cat. If we skin the cat the wrong way, we 
could create a bloodbath in the middle east and a much more dangerous world in 
the future for ourselves, our children and our children's children. I therefore 
believe that it is right in a debate such as this, which is about our relationship 
with the United States, that we say to our friends in America and to the many 
politicians on the right and left of American politics who are opposed to unilateral 
action against Iraq that we share their misgivings and doubts and that we call 
on the Administration of America not to make the world an even more dangerous 
place by taking reckless action against the state of Iraq.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13560">13560</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>I am grateful to Brian Fitzpatrick 
for reminding the chamber why we came here today. We came to spare a thought for 
the terrible happenings to innocent people on 11 September last year. My elder 
daughter got married on 22 September last year and because of the tragedy and 
disruption of world affairs, there were many empty seats at the table at the wedding 
feast. That brought home to us, on a personal level, how deeply the tragedy must 
have hit so many families.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
share a lot with the United States, whether it is through close family links or 
co-operation in many areas. We share mutual support at times of need and have 
done so for some time. We share the ideals of freedom and democracy, opportunity 
and aspiration, and social responsibility.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All 
members have connections with people in the US. Many of my neighbours in Aberdeenshire 
are American citizens who came to work in the oil industry, which is vital to 
the well-being and prosperity of the north-east. Although those people have kept 
their culture, they have integrated amazingly well. They tolerate our inadequacies 
and we put up with their little foibles&#151;we are friends. Our children play 
together and go to school and university together. We exchange a lot and we should 
be proud of that relationship.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
are many connections with the United States in the fields of technology and academia. 
My background is in the pharmaceutical industry, in which there is great integration. 
The Parliament must try to promote even better linkages, not only for tourism, 
although that is important. In 2001, there were 3 million US-used bed nights in 
Scotland. That figure does not cover business tourism.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
debate is about more than our relationship with the US. I am grateful to be given 
the opportunity to speak in it. My one comment about Iraq is that I am disappointed 
that General Schwarzkopf was denied the chance of removing Saddam Hussein. Terrorism 
must not be tolerated in any form. The United States of America and its people 
of all ethnic roots are in our minds today, as we remember the horrors of last 
year. The greatest memorial to those who died or were bereaved is for life to 
go on as normal. To allow terrorism to rule our lives is to give up on democracy.

close relationship with the USA benefits my constituency. I will also mention 
the SNP amendment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A couple 
of hundred yards from my constituency office in Dalkeith is Dalkeith House, which 
is known locally as Dalkeith palace. The house, which is owned by the Duke of 
Buccleuch, has for 15 years served as a base for about 100 students and staff 
from the University of Wisconsin. The Wisconsin in Scotland programme offers students 
the opportunity to fulfil their course requirements in a setting that is far removed 
from Wisconsin. During their 15-week spell in Scotland, students learn much about 
Scottish history, politics and culture through lectures, field trips and internships. 
I take this opportunity to welcome Alex Brust, who is in the public gallery and 
who is an intern with me from the University of Wisconsin.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
University of Wisconsin also runs the summer in Scotland programme, which brings 
more American students to Midlothian. The programme uses Newbattle Abbey College, 
which is Scotland's only residential college for adult learners. Students are 
encouraged to participate in volunteer work and to give something back to the 
town that hosts them. I want to put on record the contribution that the staff 
and students of the University of Wisconsin make to Dalkeith and to Midlothian.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
world-leading bioscience institutions in my constituency also benefit from a close 
working relationship with American partners. Researchers in Scotland and the USA 
have much to learn from one another. In February, the Scottish Executive funded 
a &#163;6 million collaboration between the University of Edinburgh and Stanford University 
in California. I welcome that development. Further such partnerships between the 
US and Scotland can only benefit the Scottish economy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is with some grief that I turn to the SNP amendment. The nationalists, under John 
Swinney, have once again shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the 
public mood. On a day when we should be expressing sympathy, support and solidarity 
with the American people, the SNP has once again resorted to political posturing 
by raising an issue that is properly a matter for the UK Parliament at Westminster.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Every 
year in April, the SNP journeys to the USA to seek American support for its over-romanticised 
policy of independence; yet it has come here to launch an insensitive attack on 
the USA on today of all days. That is a hypocritical and tawdry tactic, which 
does the SNP no credit whatever. To American citizens who are in the public gallery&#151;and

way. I assure them that the opinions that are being expressed by SNP members do 
not reflect the views of ordinary Scots, but are merely desperate measures from 
an increasingly desperate party. I urge Parliament to ignore the nationalist nonsense 
that we have heard and to reject the SNP amendment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
ask Parliament to stand by our American friends on this special date and to continue

Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West) (LD): </strong>It is a privilege to speak in this 
debate, in which we are remembering the events of 11 September last year. Those 
events affected not only the 3,000 people who died but the thousands of others 
who have been left to mourn&#151;indeed, the entire world is mourning in one way 
or another. The World Trade Center was a microcosm of the entire planet, as Brian 
Fitzpatrick summed up very well.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
is also a chance to remember and to strengthen the ties between our countries. 
We have a shared history; an approximation to a shared language; a shared belief 
in democracy; a shared character of innovation, good humour and hard work; and 
an overwhelming belief in the rights of the common man and woman. John Swinney, 
not surprisingly, referred to the declaration of Arbroath and the American declaration 
of independence, which was modelled on it. Half the signatories of the declaration 
of independence were Scots. There, at the very heart of American democracy, lies 
the political heritage of this country. Annabel Goldie also reminded us that 11 
American Presidents claimed Scots heritage, alongside 20 million of their countrymen 
and women.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earlier this 
year, I was privileged to represent the Scottish Parliament at tartan day in New 
York and Washington. Everyone whom we met in New York had a story to tell. Everyone 
knew someone who had been at the twin towers&#151;at dinner, I sat next to somebody 
whose daughter's boyfriend had been killed that day&#151;or had seen the events 
for themselves.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are 
three points that I will remember from my trip. Although it was important to meet 
politicians, captains of industry and American academics, it is three moments 
that were spent with ordinary Americans that will stay with me for the rest of 
my life.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marching along 
Sixth Avenue with 8,000 pipers, I saw the pipes that had played such a big part 
in the lives of New Yorkers over the previous weeks. </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13563">13563</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pipes that they had heard playing 
laments were, on that day, playing with pride in our common heritage. It was touching 
to hear ordinary New Yorkers shouting out to us from the sidewalk, &quot;Thank 
you. Thank you.&quot; It was unbelievable. In Washington, at Arlington, where 
we laid wreaths at the memorial cairn to those other victims of terrorism, the 
victims of Lockerbie, all of us were touched when we met the American families 
of those who had died in the skies above Scotland. One family decided to bury 
their daughter here, and ever since have felt that they are coming home when they 
visit her grave, which is tended by local people from Lockerbie.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, 
along with Liane Dorsey, the American consul, Sylvia Jackson and I went to ground 
zero. Sometimes it is difficult to find the right words. I have never found a 
more silent place on the planet than ground zero. It was an incredible silence, 
and all the images that we had shared on our television screens came back to me 
as I stood there. When I read the messages that had been left by children and 
others&#151;I left a little lapel pin badge on behalf of the three of us, as it 
was the only thing that we had to leave&#151;it all seemed totally pointless.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nonetheless, 
in the midst of terrible evil we can remember some good things. We can remember 
the heroic acts of the firefighters, the policemen and policewomen of New York 
and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey whom Tommy Sheridan talked about. 
We can remember that in the midst of all that there was heroism and people reminding 
each other that they loved one another. In the face of hate people could remember 
that the most powerful thing in the world is that love.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
can remember that good will ultimately triumph over evil. However, good does not 
triumph by stooping to the same level as evil. As a former Scottish organiser 
for the United Nations Association, I believe that the democracy in which we believe 
and the fight against terrorism will be strengthened by America and our country 
working through the United Nations to build again a coalition for action that 
will be worthy not only of the memory of those who died in New York, Washington 
and Pennsylvania, but of those who might yet die in Iraq.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Woodrow

we now have a Scottish affairs office in the British embassy in Washington and 
that through events such as tartan day Parliament and the people of Scotland will

old enough do. Now there is a new event in our minds. The horrors of 11 September

McKay asked earlier, &quot;Where were you?&quot; I can remember well. We were

happen, but it did.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Has 
there been an awakening since then? Johnston McKay suggested that there would 
be hope for change. What change has happened over recent years? Perhaps if we 
go back to the era of d&eacute;tente and the collapse of the Berlin wall, we find 
a situation from which great changes were expected to come. Perhaps from what 
happened last year on this date we can expect better attitudes to prevail in the 
world. Perhaps that is the message that we should take from such a debate. We 
must seek a goal that has been long avoided, which is to achieve peace throughout 
the world. It will be a long hard struggle. We have struggled for years and there 
are many miles to go, but perhaps we will get there one day.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
have no problem in giving full support to the motion. I could equally have accepted 
John Swinney's amendment, up to the point where it refers to the mutual benefit

on the leftist wing of his party who wanted to bring in a discussion on Iraq on 
this occasion. That was misplaced.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However,

ill-informed. Members do not yet have all the facts. When the matter is debated

that members will be able to enlighten people in this country. There is perhaps 
nothing more important than a decision to send our young men off to war, with 
the result that families will be bereaved. There has to be a good reason to do 
so and that reason must be properly presented by the Government.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As

of 11 September in relation to Iraq.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
have been a number of great speeches on the subject of the educational links between 
our countries and I want to spend some time reflecting on the impact of the Scottish 
enlightenment in that regard. Yesterday I read, in Professor Arthur Herman's book 
on the Scottish enlightenment, that there are more descendants of Highland clans 
in the USA than there are in Scotland. That is a good starting point for thinking 
about the free flow of traffic between our countries.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
other speakers have said, Adam Smith and David Hume had an enormous influence 
on American thinking and the American constitution through the impact that their 
work had on people such as Thomas Jefferson. Ted Cowan, the professor of Scottish 
history at the University of Glasgow, talks about the &quot;Mac-ocracy&quot;&#151;a 
typical Ted Cowan phrase, in that it is ghastly but gets its point across. The 
idea behind the word is that so many Scots went to America that they were able 
to take it over and mould it in a dynamic way. Ted Cowan quotes another historian, 
Bernard Aspinwall, as saying that the Scots acted as</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;the 
shock troops of modernisation&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and 
goes on to say that they were the battalions who would help to transform an agrarian 
community into a mighty industrial power. Those lovely words adequately describe 
the position of Scots in America.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
role of the Presbyterian church in the United States has been enormous. It is 
worth remembering that, between 1726 and 1837, Presbyterians founded some 65 academies 
or log colleges in America. In doing so, they left a long-term mark on that country.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George 
Reid made an excellent speech, to which I assume Phil Gallie was only half listening. 
I thought that it carried a powerful but subtle message. Perhaps it was the subtlety 
that fooled Phil Gallie. The speech was a case study, but it had strong resonance 
for the here and now and for the international situation. Perhaps Phil Gallie 
should reflect on that resonance.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On

an imported Scottish celebration&#151;of the Americans' heritage.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Between 
9 million and 22 million people in America claim to be of Scots descent. Those 
figures have been quoted already. I did a lecture tour with Alex Salmond, who, 
as members know, has a fairly good conceit of himself. At the first lecture that 
he gave, he was given the information that there were 9 million of Scots descent 
in America. By the last lecture that he gave, it was 22 million and Alex was taking 
all the credit. Perhaps that was the most successful lecture tour in history. 
The proportion of Scots Americans is certainly enormous. The point of all the 
background in history and culture is that when we celebrate the rich history of 
America, we in part celebrate ourselves.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
11 September, there has been a great deal of talk about where everybody was when 
they heard the news and the fact that the American people are still grieving for 
their loss and loved ones. That is a raw emotion. We remember the 3,043 people 
who died, 100 of whom were UK citizens. As Brian Fitzpatrick was right to remind 
us, people from 70 different countries&#151;Scots included&#151;died in that tragedy. 
Thirteen hundred children were orphaned on a single morning.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
is why the amendment in John Swinney's name starts off by recognising the strength,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;dignity 
and courage shown by the people of the United States of America in the aftermath&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyone 
who has followed the coverage of 11 September one year on can do nothing but reflect 
on the courage of the Americans. They dealt with that enormous, almost unimaginable, 
tragedy with huge dignity. It is right that Scotland's national Parliament acknowledge 
that today.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are faced 
with the question of whether we should discuss the war. Annabel Goldie's comments 
and latterly Rhona Brankin's comments, not the SNP amendment, were inappropriate 
and in poor taste. There is a suggestion that it is somehow inappropriate to discuss 
the war on 11 September. Members should ask themselves what people in America 
are discussing today. They are remembering, but they are also anxious about the 
future and discussing their country's involvement in the international community.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is right that we express our voice in the Parliament. If the Executive is to represent 
the Parliament in continual negotiations and discussions with the UK Government&#151;which, 
sadly, is still responsible for our international policy&#151;it is right that 
the Executive know what people in Scotland think. That is why we were elected.

the challenge head on and not to duck it. We are here to reflect the mood of the 
people, not what we wish the constitutional set-up to be.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
ask members to reflect that the one thing that separates us from the dictatorship 
that we might be moving to overthrow is that we believe in democracy, discussion 
and debate and it does not. To lose sight of that is perhaps to have lost already 
the putative war.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A number 
of suggestions have been made on the international coalition that are only worth 
batting to the side. We should not confuse the call for restraint and to work 
through the United Nations with a dilution of support for the war on terror. It 
is not. Consider the position of Chancellor Schr&ouml;der, who said:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Consultation 
among grown-up nations has to mean not just consultation about the how and the 
when, but also about the whether. It is the duty of good friends and allies to 
speak clearly to Washington as Americans speak clearly to others.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is a lot of sense in that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members 
should not imagine that we are being in any way anti-American. I quote former 
American President Jimmy Carter:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We 
cannot ignore the development of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, but 
a unilateral war with Iraq is not the answer. There is an urgent need for U.N. 
action to force unrestricted inspections in Iraq. But ... this has become less 
likely as we alienate our necessary allies.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other 
world leaders are urging caution too. I do not have time to go through exactly 
what they say, but I will list them: Nelson Mandela, President Chirac, the Russian 
Prime Minister, President Mubarak, the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. They are 
all urging restraint. They are all asking that the United States go through the 
UN Security Council. That is the way forward&#151;it is the absolute requirement. 
Would it not be a bitter irony if, in our attempts to overthrow a dictatorial 
regime, we were to end up doing so undemocratically?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16:50</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The

against a regime that held life in contempt. Those matters are of the greatest 
import&#151;we all hold strong views about them. However, this afternoon we should 
address the subject matter of the motion.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scotland 
was getting to grips with the impact of globalisation on a small, open economy 
such as ours when the 11 September attacks happened. Our approach to the economy 
was born from a recognition that we had to focus on growing our own businesses, 
developing our own skills and fostering global connections. Overnight, all that 
work became even more relevant, as, like all other countries across the world, 
we realised the profundity of the global economic links that exist today.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is no doubt that Scotland has suffered from the economic after-effects of 11 September. 
Perhaps tourism has been most obviously affected, but other industries, such as 
the technology sectors, have also had to cope with post-11 September uncertainty 
and the consequent serious global slow-down. As we address that situation, one 
of the factors in our favour is the depth of our historical, cultural, philosophical, 
business and economic links with the United States. As Rhoda Grant and Annabel 
Goldie&#151;among other speakers&#151;said, we must work to expand those connections.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scottish 
Development International offices in the USA build on those links and have an 
extensive reach from north to south and from coast to coast. Our California office 
is the hub of our activities on the west coast in the high-tech electronics and 
venture capital sectors. On the east coast, our Virginia and Stamford offices 
have helped to forge links with many leading academics and entrepreneurs, particularly 
in the biotechnology and financial services fields.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of 
course, John Swinney was right when he said that we should not forget that inward 
investment has been a major feature of Scotland's economic links with the USA 
in the past 20 years. Despite the fact that the proportion of inward investment 
jobs created by US-based firms has dropped from 48 per cent to 33 per cent over 
the past 10 years&#151;that drop may not be as big as we sometimes imagine it 
to be&#151;I am in no doubt that it will continue to be important to engage with 
major inward investors, not least because they have much to teach us about best 
practice in research, innovation and productivity.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
also have productive links in the main US centres of California and New England, 
whose investors are interested in backing specialist fields that sometimes find 
it difficult to get support from within Scotland. Several leading Scottish </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13570">13570</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">companies, such as Compound Semiconductor 
Technologies, Photonic Materials, Kamelian, Kymata and Cyclacel have already benefited 
from recent US investment. By developing such links further, we will allow Scottish 
academics and business people to benefit from a vast body of expertise in the 
process of funding and commercialising innovation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
Scots have crossed the Atlantic and built successful lives and careers in the 
USA. There are far too many to mention, although the debate has featured some 
examples, from Alexander Hamilton, in banking, to Andrew Carnegie. Those connections 
are as alive today as they ever were. Scottish Enterprise's globalScot network 
recognises the need to unlock the potential of today's equivalents of Carnegie 
and Hamilton in order to help Scotland survive and thrive in the global economy. 
The globalScot network already has 400 founding members, more than half of which 
are based in the USA. Those senior individuals are willing to help us to open 
doors abroad for Scottish business and, by sharing their experience, they are 
willing to help us to develop home-grown expertise, for example by offering positive 
role models to Scottish schoolchildren.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several 
members have commented on the fact that Scots have traditionally demonstrated 
what they can do after going to America. We must bring back that enterprising 
entrepreneurial approach. We must repatriate it and apply it here in Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
members have mentioned that some of the strongest links between Scotland and the 
US are in education, particularly in higher education. It is well known that the 
American higher education system was modelled on Scotland's&#151;it shares a pattern 
of initial breadth followed by later specialisation. The link is not merely historical. 
Students from the USA form the largest group of overseas students in Scotland. 
Rhona Brankin provided examples from Midlothian. They study at all levels, from 
undergraduate to postgraduate, and often stay on, as teachers and researchers, 
to enrich our university faculties. The growing number of American students who 
come to study in Scotland&#151;the figure now stands at more than 1,500 per year&#151;represent 
a transatlantic link that we should cherish.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among 
those students, we welcome a small number of Marshall scholars. The Marshall scholarship 
scheme, which will celebrate its 50<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary next year, commemorates 
the humane ideals of the European recovery programme in the aftermath of the second 
world war&#151;the Marshall plan. The scheme provides the finances for a small 
number of high-ability young Americans to study for a degree in the United Kingdom.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What

academic community is truly international. Benjamin Franklin, no less, was a founder 
member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. That transatlantic link remains strong&#151;next 
month, the RSE will host a lecture on Hugh Miller's influence on transatlantic 
environmental awareness.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
are countless examples of connections in teaching and research between Scottish 
universities and their US counterparts. The link between the University of Edinburgh 
and Stanford University has been mentioned. The Edinburgh-Stanford link is a five-year 
collaborative programme, which is worth &#163;6 million. It aims to establish Scotland 
as a global leader in the commercial development of language technology and to 
boost our reputation as a centre for research and design.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
are many other ways, from the long-standing to the very new, in which our academic 
community reaches across the Atlantic. I want to focus on just one of them, the 
Colin McArthur postgraduate scholarship at the University of Glasgow. The award, 
which has been provided as a lasting tribute to a Glasgow graduate, Colin McArthur, 
who died in the events of September 11, has been supported by his widow, his friends 
and his colleagues, as well as by alumni and friends of the university. It will 
enable a student who lost a parent or guardian in the tragic events to attend 
the university to study any chosen discipline. The university hopes that, in time, 
enough will be raised to endow the scholarship in perpetuity and it seeks, eventually, 
to extend the terms to cover any US student.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of 
course the tragic events of last September dented the confidence of the US. That 
was reflected in transport links&#151;people stopped travelling for a while. Those 
links are important to us and a strong recovery is taking place. We want to encourage 
the development of our air links with the US. The re-establishment of the link 
between New York and Glasgow in 1998 has proved an undoubted success. Direct access 
to the US and to the Newark hub of Continental Airlines provides a wealth of opportunities 
to travel throughout the Americas. American Airlines also provides scheduled links 
to the US and there are charter links to Florida. Such links are important, because 
people mediate our connections, whether they are business, family, academic, cultural 
or sporting connections.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
was at the World Trade Center, as part of a holiday, a few weeks before 11 September

that&#151;we see ourselves reflected back because there is so much of Scotland 
across the Atlantic. Like all reflections, the image is not always identical. 
Sometimes we may like what we see and at other times we may not be so fond of 
what we see, but we cannot escape the reflection of ourselves.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Similarly, 
we cannot escape the impact of moments in time such as 9/11. All kinds of previous 
history, actions, decisions and politics converge from all directions on such 
a moment. All kinds of potential consequences flow from it. However, in the moment 
itself, and when we talk about where we were, the world stops. Our heart stops 
too at the tragedy and suffering and heroism, which were above and beyond all 
normal days. 9/11 was like that. We can analyse the roots of the moment; we can, 
and should, debate what should happen next or now; but we should also pause in 
all sincerity to mark apart the moment itself. That is what today is for.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At

visited Orkney during the summer recess and returned with pages of notes about 
the ferry issue. It seemed more appropriate to raise the issues in a members' 
business debate than by writing screeds of letters to the minister. There has 
been much speculation over the new ferry contract. I hope that members will appreciate 
from my careful use of &quot;alleged&quot; and &quot;I understand&quot; that the

did not mention the movement of livestock. That seems to underpin the problems 
that we face today. I further understand that NorthLink Orkney and Shetland Ferries

because of the cassette system coming into operation. Lairage was promptly dismantled.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">contract ends this month, the Scottish 
Executive has had to hire two boats. One is coming from Australia and the other 
from South Africa&#151;again at considerable cost to the public purse&#151;to 
maintain consistency in the transportation of livestock. Bearing animal welfare 
considerations in mind, have all other routes been considered fully, especially 
given the existence of the new abattoir facilities at Dornoch and the new regulations 
on the transportation of animals? Orkney farmers and businesses seemed to like 
the previous Orcargo system to Invergordon. I would like to be assured that all 
the options have been explored.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
new piers at Scrabster, Stromness and Kirkwall are well behind schedule and, apparently, 
well above their original budget. May we have a clear statement about those costs, 
as well as about the cost of the linkspan from Invergordon, which has been taken 
to Stromness as a temporary measure?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
company with the subsidy for the northern isles ferries will be NorthLink yet, 
in the middle of all this change, we have a new shipping company representing 
the interests of Shetland&#151;Norse Island Ferries Ltd&#151;including main contractors 
such as Jim Brackenridge (Transport) Ltd, Gulf Oil Ltd, Shetland Transport Ltd 
and Northwards Ltd. Those developments, alongside the progress of Smyril Line, 
which is partly owned by Shetland Islands Council, provide excellent opportunities 
for Shetland, but Orkney tends to be left out of the equation. NorthLink has a 
subsidy of &#163;11.5 million while Pentland Ferries Ltd and Norse Island Ferries have 
no subsidy. Both those independent operators are carrying substantial volumes 
of traffic.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has been 
suggested that subsidy should be based on the amount that each operator carries. 
Retrospective payment of subsidy seems to respect customer choice and reward the 
operator that is providing the lifeline service. Farmers, businesses and passengers 
have said that they would like to choose which ferry to use. They say that companies 
should earn their subsidy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NorthLink 
is slashing its freight rates now that Norse Island Ferries is in operation. Given 
that its business case was based on original costings, will the minister tell 
us the effect on NorthLink of a decrease in revenue? Can it continue to provide 
the promised service? Will NorthLink continue to cut charges to price other operators 
out and then rest back on the subsidy? That question has been raised with me and 
I would appreciate an answer from the minister.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have also been told, today, that the new Norse Island Ferries is undermining confidence 
among people in Orkney now that Shetland has decided to go it alone. There is 
a feeling that Orkney will get the crumbs from the table. A Sunday-only </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13579">13579</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

livestock, with any spare capacity being used for Orcadian cargo, is hardly the 
way forward. I am sure that the constituency member for Shetland will enlighten 
the Parliament about the new service. I am pleased to see that both Tavish Scott 
and Jim Wallace are here.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, 
the new service leaves the profitability of the Orkney-Aberdeen route in doubt, 
as it depends on Shetland through traffic. The Norse Island Ferries service may 
lead to financial problems for NorthLink or, it has been suggested, a massive 
increase in Orkney fares. We must also ask why Orkney Marts has to pay off a &#163;4.3 
million loan for the new cassettes when that is a lifeline service.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
the midst of all the public money for hired boats, high subsidies and massive, 
multimillion pound investments into piers and linkspans, we have Andrew Banks, 
a farmer from St Margaret's Hope in Orkney, who bought a 30-year-old CalMac ferry, 
dredged the sea, built two piers and now runs the service from Gills Bay, near 
John O'Groats to Orkney, which is cheaper than the subsidised route and takes 
only one hour. I can testify to the quality of that service, as I used it during 
the summer. I understand that Andrew Banks has applied for the livestock subsidy, 
but has not yet received a response from the Scottish Executive.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
was also given the figures for Pentland Ferries. From April to November last year, 
the passenger numbers were 45,000 with more than 16,000 vehicles. Both those figures 
were exceeded by August 2002, with a massive increase in tourism business for 
Orkney. This week, Mr Banks purchased a second vessel, the Claymore. The Claymore 
has the same capacity as the Pentalina B and will operate freight and livestock 
between Caithness and Orkney every day of the week. That is all without a penny 
from the public purse.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
are many issues at stake. I will mention one more&#151;a topic on which we could 
spend a whole debate. P&amp;O employees understood that Transfer of Undertakings 
(Protection of Employment) Regulations would apply to their change of employment. 
I now understand that NorthLink is stating that P&amp;O workers will be taken 
on as new employees and that their previous service and conditions will not be 
taken into account. I would like clarification from the minister on that point.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
understand that the Transport and the Environment Committee is looking into the 
ferry services. Will the minister ensure that all parties get round the table 
in talks to ensure proper consultation and communication about the changes? Will

Jim Wallace (Orkney) (LD): </strong>I congratulate Mary Scanlon on securing the 
debate. I have represented the northern isles in a parliamentary capacity for 
the best part of 20 years and I think that I can say that most issues come back 
to transport&#151;the affordability, reliability and frequency of the transport 
services, not least the lifeline ferry services.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
I first became an MP in 1983, we did not have new boats. We are now going to have 
new boats. There was one sailing a day for most of the year between Orkney and 
the Scottish mainland. When I suggested that, even during the school holidays, 
that could be increased to two sailings, I was told that I did not understand 
the economics of the case. Now we will have far more frequent services. Also, 
we now have services linking Orkney and Shetland, which did not exist in 1983.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having 
seen the new vessels at the Akers yard, having been on the Hjaltlond just before 
it set out on its sea trials and having seen the Hamnavoe and Hrossay under construction, 
I believe that the quality of vessels coming into the service are a major step 
forward in standards.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mary 
Scanlon has identified several concerns. I know that the minister will welcome 
the opportunity to clarify several points. There is much discussion around the 
subject because there is a major change to something with which we have been familiar 
for many years. It is inevitable that there will be concern in the air. One of 
the obvious concerns relates to livestock and the entry of Norse Island Ferries. 
That has caused uncertainty and some delay in placing the orders for the cassettes. 
Once they have seen the system in operation, even the sceptics about cassettes 
believe that it is a system for the future that will secure high animal welfare 
standards.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main concern 
is that although there will be welcome contingency arrangements&#151;indeed, additional 
boats are brought on every year for the peak livestock movements&#151;there might 
be a gap. There is concern about what will happen after that contingency period 
and before the cassettes are in place. I would welcome any assurance that the 
minister can give. I am sure that he will recognise that the sooner the cassettes 
are in operation, the more confident people will feel, especially when they can 
see the system working.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mary

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Andrew Banks. Following representations 
from Andrew Banks, I have written to the minister, as he knows, about tariff rebate 
subsidy&#151;TRS&#151;for that service. As has happened for many years, the application 
will be given as proper and fair a consideration as any other. It is not a right: 
there are criteria. The issue of TRS for that service will be approached in that 
spirit.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of my constituents 
who sail into Scrabster have been saying that they have not seen much happening. 
The project has been slow. Everyone knew that the project would have to happen: 
even if P&amp;O had won the contract, there was a need for improvements at Scrabster 
harbour. I share Mary Scanlon's view that we do not want to trade questions of 
blame or who is responsible. Perhaps the minister could reassure us about what 
is expected to happen at Scrabster. It is clear that it will not be in a position 
to receive the new vessel when it comes into service. Perhaps the minister could 
tell us what the time scales are and what is likely to happen to maintain that 
important Pentland firth crossing between Stromness and Scrabster.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
next point is about staff transfer. I fully understand that is not for the Government 
to determine whether TUPE applies. It is a matter for the courts. My understanding 
was confirmed as recently as last week in a letter from Bill Davidson of NorthLink. 
Although TUPE does not apply, NorthLink will take on the existing mariners under 
their existing terms and conditions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
I find frustrating&#151;I believe that the minister shares my frustration&#151;is 
that we can get a legal determination of the situation only when the staff transfer 
takes place. I welcome the fact that the minister has raised the matter with the 
appropriate minister at Westminster, because employment legislation is a reserved 
matter. The situation is unsatisfactory. With the tender for the Caledonian MacBrayne 
routes coming down the track, we would welcome some clarification of what the 
minister has been trying to achieve.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
this is the first speech that I have made from the back benches, I will not abuse 
the time. I just emphasise the point that the issue is critical. We are talking 
about lifeline services&#151;and so much of the social and economic life of the 
islands depends on those services being secured well into the future.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:17</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dr

island we could get to and I have been in love with them ever since. I visited 
all of them many times, except for Papa Stour, which I never managed to get to. 
I think the weather prevented it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have probably visited every company, most schools and every social organisation 
over the decades that I have been going to the islands. The people of Orkney and 
Shetland are very innovative. They sometimes have a difficult climate&#151;they 
say that Orkney can have four seasons in a day&#151;but the people are full of 
enterprise and there are many business start-ups. One can only admire the people 
and say that they deserve a lifeline service that suits them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
seems to have been suggested that NorthLink has, wisely, been trying to boost 
the tourist side of its business. However, the tariff structure seems to be a 
bit biased against the island resident. I cannot accept that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everyone 
knows about my envy of Norway because it has its own Government. Norway also had 
two policies when it started considering the northern part of the Arctic circle. 
Those policies worked very well. They were road equivalent tariffs and equalised 
freights. I admire and envy the Norwegians for those two policies, because they 
were successful in doubling their northern population in the area up to the Arctic 
circle in 50 years, which speaks for itself.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
cannot add much to what Mary Scanlon said, because her speech was an exhaustive 
survey of all the problems that I have seen when I have gone to the northern isles. 
The residents of both sets of islands are worried by the uncertainty. NorthLink 
itself admits to uncertainty about the running costs, which throws uncertainty 
over all the economic, agricultural, social and cultural activities of the islands. 
It also throws uncertainty over sporting activities, which are developing well. 
As Mary Scanlon said, there is uncertainty about the P&amp;O workers' terms. Although 
Jim Wallace's comments are welcome, there is still a worry. I hope that the minister 
will clear up some of the issues at the end of the debate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:21</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Maureen

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">reporter to the Transport and the 
Environment Committee on the future of the Clyde and Hebridean ferry services, 
I have been interested to explore the experiences in the northern isles with the 
NorthLink contract as a point of comparison with the CalMac tender.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
the past year I have been to Orkney three times and to Shetland twice, and the 
major issue that people raise&#151;no matter whether one is connected with the 
Transport and the Environment Committee&#151;is anxiety about ferry services. 
It is right that MSPs should take time to debate the matter, because there is 
a great deal of anxiety about the transfer of ferry services on 1 October. There 
are concerns about the long-term viability of the NorthLink service, and there 
is uncertainty surrounding the application of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection 
of Employment) Regulations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, 
I have examined the service that is envisaged, and it will be much better than 
the current service. Jim Wallace is right to say that only when the service is 
going will we know how good it is. However, it looks like fares will be cheaper 
and that the superb new ships will be faster. We cannot discount those positives.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
I was in Orkney and Shetland, I found that the councils, the enterprise companies 
and the tourist boards were excited about what the new ferries could deliver if 
everything went well. On the other hand, farmers, hauliers and industries such 
as aquaculture had serious concerns about the way in which NorthLink was handling 
the transfer and whether it could deliver for them. It is reasonable to expect 
those sectors, which rely for their livelihoods on the continuation of the ferry 
links, to be anxious not be left high and dry with a worse service on 1 October. 
They did not get a sympathetic hearing from NorthLink, so it is essential that 
NorthLink try to mend fences with those sectors in Orkney and Shetland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
am seriously concerned that with competition from Norse Island Ferries and the 
introduction of a second ferry by Pentland Ferries, the economic sustainability 
of NorthLink could come into question. I am particularly disappointed that a rival 
freight service has been set up in Shetland as a result of dissatisfaction with 
NorthLink. That could have been avoided with proper discussions and negotiations. 
However, the reality is that NorthLink and the Executive now need to double their 
efforts to run a viable service in the long term, because if that is not possible, 
the people who will lose out will be the islanders.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
ferry services are lifeline services. I am sure that farmers, hauliers and others 
do not want to be left in a position in which they have to rely on a private monopoly 
and on cherry-picked routes, in the same way that the community of Dunoon is </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13584">13584</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">worried about the possibility of 
a private monopoly crossing the Clyde. Inevitably, that would lead to the need 
for either huge additional subsidies on unprofitable routes or for massive increases 
in fares for the people of the northern isles. That cannot be allowed to happen.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Concerns 
are being expressed about TUPE. NorthLink has said that TUPE regulations do not 
by law apply to staff, which concerns the work force. The question that the National 
Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers posed hits the nail 
on the head&#151;is it right that workers will be able to test whether they are 
protected by TUPE or whether they should have been made redundant only after the 
transfer has taken place?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
appreciate that, as the Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong 
Learning told the Transport and the Environment Committee only today in another 
context, the only way in which to judge whether TUPE applies is through the courts, 
but that leaves workers in a potentially difficult situation. I appreciate that 
Westminster would be required to legislate, but I urge the minister to continue 
his efforts to make representations about the issue to his Westminster colleagues.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
understand that the pier at Scrabster will not be ready in time for the new vessel 
and that the Hamnavoe ferry could lie idle until the pier is ready. I hope that 
the Executive will do everything that it can to ensure that progress is made and 
that the new ferry is fully operational as soon as possible. Then, we will see 
the benefit to the islanders.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
hope that, with a change of personnel at the top of NorthLink, relations between 
the company and communities in Orkney and Shetland will improve. Serious questions 
remain about the long-term viability of the service and about the TUPE regulations. 
I hope that the minister will address them in his response.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:26</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr

Bute, with a Liberal MSP and a Liberal MP, losing its lifeline ferry services? 
It is because a combination of blanket European directives and the coalition Government's 
policies are driving down the level of ferry services in Scotland, which is disastrous 
for the outlying communities that depend on them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Great 
concern has been expressed about NorthLink ever since the partnership was envisaged. 
My main experience of it has been through the concerns of farmers and the National 
Farmers Union about how livestock will be transported from Orkney and Shetland. 
Shetland and Orkney are highly dependent on cattle and sheep farming, and only 
the best transport will enable the island farmers to produce quality in order 
to achieve a profit and to survive. There has been enough trouble with foot-and-mouth 
disease, and the Orkney farmers lost their vital cattle-marketing link through 
Invergordon last year.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
first blow occurred when, without public consultation, livestock was banned from 
passenger-carrying ships. The cassette system was proposed, in which animals are 
loaded in tiers into containers where they await transfer to ships. A similar 
system in the early 1970s ran into trouble because such a double-decker carriage 
adversely affects a ship's sea-going properties. Only two ships that were built 
for that system remain, and one&#151;the Hascosay&#151;is being refitted to take 
the new cassettes. We are told that the system will be ready by 1 October, but 
so far, not one production model has been finished.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
will happen if the Hascosay breaks down? Where is the replacement vessel that 
will take cassettes? Orkney auction marts are worried and farmers are very worried, 
but that is unsurprising when livestock was overlooked in the original so-called 
lifeline subsidised contract that was given to NorthLink. That appears to be a 
public-private partnership that will result in an inferior service to Shetland 
and Orkney. How can Orkney, with a Liberal Deputy First Minister, and Shetland, 
with an ex-minister as its MSP, find their services </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13586">13586</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

problem is that NorthLink's Orkney-Aberdeen viability relies heavily on through

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a court of law or industrial tribunal. 
That is unfortunate and there is no question about that, but that position will 
at least work out.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am 
more concerned about the current members of P&amp;O Scottish Ferries staff who 
will simply not have a job on 1 October. I cannot conceive of any circumstances 
in which they should not receive redundancy payments from P&amp;O, as their employer. 
They are not transferring to another employer and they will be redundant, so I 
believe that redundancy payments should apply to them. I hope that, in winding 
up, the minister will be able to inform the Parliament that this is the position, 
that he will support the calls that Jim Wallace and I have made for that position 
to be upheld, and that P&amp;O will pay due redundancy to workers who are in that 
situation. P&amp;O still refuses to confirm that those workers are due redundancy. 
That is nonsense&#151;there is no transfer, so the payment of redundancy money 
must be upheld.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My second 
point relates to livestock. Livestock boats are not new, if I may say so gently 
to Mary Scanlon. Livestock boats have been servicing Orkney and Shetland for many 
years during the peak shipping season&#151;September, October and November. It 
is not a new phenomenon. The ships are not a lifeline only for cars and passengers 
but also for livestock. In relation to her work as reporter to the Transport and 
the Environment Committee, I would like to tell Maureen Macmillan that I was pleased 
to note that the original draft tender mentioned livestock. I hope that in the 
tendering exercise in five years' time, those matters will be dealt with appropriately 
again. It is a source of some disappointment that that point was not retained 
in the draft specification.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
number of other members have made pertinent points about TRS. In delivering a 
reliable, affordable and regular service for exporting and importing livestock 
to the northern isles, it is extremely important that the TRS system is available 
to the two new companies&#151;Andrew Banks's company and Norse Island Ferries&#151;in 
circumstances where they comply with the appropriate regulations. I welcomed the 
minister's confirmation to the Transport and the Environment Committee earlier 
this summer that that would indeed be the case, and I hope that he will confirm 
that again today. I hope that he will also confirm that it will be his objective 
in handling the TRS applications.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
wind up, I look forward to attending the naming ceremony for the Hjaltlond in 
Lerwick on Saturday and to shaking hands vigorously with NorthLink's management 
and congratulating it on introducing the first new ferry to service the northern 
isles for 50 years. That is no mean achievement and the minister and the Executive 
should take due credit for it. There will be a </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13588">13588</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">welcome step change in the quality, 
safety and comfort of the service for islanders. I welcome that step change, but 
details need to be clarified. We hope that the minister will clarify one or two 
important points that have been made in this brief debate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:35</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP): </strong>I thank Tavish Scott for 
his good wishes for my health. I have just about recovered from Up Helly Aa. I 
could just about have managed with Winnie Ewing&#151;although partying with her 
is always difficult&#151;but to take her and four Orkney councillors was beyond 
me. I was nearly a hospital case.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have a number of brief questions, some of which have been covered. Constituents 
have raised directly with me a number of issues and I would like clarification 
on them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a fear 
that passengers will need to make up the estimated overall drop in income, as 
a result of the potential loss of freight, through an increase in fares. I understand 
that fares for next year have been fixed, but will the minister clarify what will 
happen thereafter? There is a real fear that fares will increase. If the tender 
has been won by an operation, 50 per cent of which, I assume, is Caledonian MacBrayne, 
will the minister have any opportunity to reflect on the tender specifications 
on the CalMac routes in the CalMac tender, where there is a minimum service requirement 
and a maximum fare requirement? If that is possible in that tender document, will 
the minister, as a 50 per cent owner in the other part, tell us whether the same 
would be possible in this situation?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
reiterate what Tavish Scott said about the urgency of the situation in respect 
of staff. We are talking about many shore-based staff who will not be retained&#151;I 
understand that they will be out of work in two weeks' time. Therefore, the matter 
must be resolved urgently. Anything that the minister can do to hasten such resolution 
would be appreciated.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
whether TUPE applies to those who are transferring, I return to a previous question. 
If the First Minister is the sole shareholder of CalMac and it is 50 per cent 
of the consortium that has won the tender, would it be worth exploring the avenue 
that I mentioned? I do not know the answer to that&#151;I merely pose the question. 
Perhaps the Deputy First Minister has not tried to influence the First Minister. 
If he has not, perhaps he should consider doing so in a back-bench role. The other 
question that has emerged is: what will happen to the service status of those 
who are transferring? Will they be credited with full service status? Any light 
that the minister can shed on that </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13589">13589</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">matter would be greatly appreciated.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
will stop there, as I have asked the minister at least 10 questions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:38</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning (Lewis Macdonald): 
</strong>I thank Mary Scanlon for providing an opportunity to debate such an important 
subject and all members who have contributed to the debate for the constructive 
way in which they have done so.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reliable 
and affordable ferry links to the mainland are critical to Orkney and Shetland 
and the Executive is committed to safeguarding such lifeline services to Scotland's 
island communities. We are determined to ensure that we safeguard such services 
in a way that is affordable to users and the taxpayer, while recognising the vital 
importance to the islands of ferry connections and services.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
are required by European Commission rules to tender public subsidy contracts&#151;including 
the northern isles ferry contract&#151;every five years. A couple of members have 
mentioned that we are currently preparing to tender ferry services in the Clyde 
and Hebridean isles. Tendering for the imminent northern isles contract started 
in 1998. The tender is for passengers and accompanied cars only, on the same basis 
as the existing contract with P&amp;O Scottish Ferries. As before, we were bound 
to accept the lowest bid that met the service specification and, on that basis, 
NorthLink's bid succeeded. It has been mentioned that it is bringing in three 
new, larger vessels that are built to the latest safety standards, more frequent 
services and substantially lower fares.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, 
I would like to address the issue of livestock. It is worth noting that livestock 
are outside the subsidy contract. That is not something new nor is it something 
that we have invented; it has been inherited and was operated under previous Governments 
when active competition for livestock carriage was perhaps greater than it was 
in 1998-99, when we drew up the current contract.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
will correct a couple of factual inaccuracies. The livestock vessels that have 
been chartered this year to meet the immediate needs this season have been chartered 
by P&amp;O, not by the Scottish Executive. P&amp;O has done that every year for 
a number of years, so there is nothing new about it. It is not the case that the 
demolition of layerage at Aberdeen was a pointless exercise. That had to happen 
to allow work to begin on the new terminals required for the new and larger vessels 
that will be used.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
of the major concerns has been the future </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13590">13590</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">of the livestock shipments. Members 
have all recognised the importance of livestock to the islands' economies. The 
worry has been about the position after 31 October, when the P&amp;O service will 
end. My understanding is that NorthLink now plans to carry livestock in livestock 
transporters that have higher sides than the standard general livestock transportation 
and so which are more suitable for the larger Orkney cattle. That provision of 
livestock transporters will meet the need in the immediate period following 31 
October. There is a good deal of confidence that cassettes will be on stream and 
will arrive soon thereafter.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
has been described, there has been considerable uncertainty about those proposals, 
but I now understand that Orkney Auction Mart, which is the main facilitator in 
providing the cassettes for use on NorthLink vessels, or other vessels, will place 
its orders shortly. The time from placing the orders to delivery of the cassettes 
should be in the order of 16 weeks, so they will be in place well before next 
year's peak livestock season.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
also understand that NorthLink is actively considering buying some single-deck 
cassettes, as well as double-deck ones, and will, if necessary, carry those on 
its passenger and vehicle ferries. I think that that will allay any remaining 
concerns.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members have 
mentioned that other carriers may wish to apply for tariff rebate subsidy. That 
subsidy can be made available to any operator who satisfies the key requirements 
of the scheme. All applications are considered on that basis and there will be 
a level playing field.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Likewise, 
freight lies outside the current contract. As we know, last week Norse Island 
Ferries started a roll-on, roll-of freight service from Shetland that is in competition 
with P&amp;O and ultimately will be in competition with NorthLink, when it takes 
over the service at the end of the month. It is for the companies in question 
to resolve their commercial interests in meeting that competition. It is for NorthLink 
to meet that competition as a commercial company; it is not subsidised for the 
provision of freight. It has to satisfy us, by providing an annual account and 
annual performance indicators, that it is not using the subsidy that we provide 
for passengers and accompanied cars to subsidise its freight carriage. Therefore, 
it is a matter that NorthLink will have to deal with in the usual way.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of 
course, it is no surprise that NorthLink is concerned about competition; any commercial 
company would be. NorthLink looks to make a profit from its freight carriage and 
it is for it to do that by providing a competitive service. We do not regard competition 
for freight as a bad thing and it is not new. If competition has the effect of

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">providing a better service for customers 
in due course, that will be welcome in the islands.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
number of questions have been raised about harbours. Responsibility for harbour 
developments rests with the harbour authorities. They have responsibility for 
bringing forward the necessary works on time. There have been delays, which in 
the case of Scrabster will go beyond 1 October. That is to be regretted. It is 
for Scrabster Harbour Trust and its contractors to resolve the problem. In the 
meantime, until NorthLink's vessel, the Hamnavoe, which will serve that route, 
is ready, I understand that a charter arrangement is in place with CalMac. We 
will work actively with them and with other interested parties, after the Hamnavoe 
is available, to ensure that that lifeline service continues to ply the route 
between Stromness and Scrabster. I hope that members will be reassured that it 
is our commitment to do that. We will work with all interested parties to ensure 
that that is done.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
transfer of undertakings is a critical issue. There is a particular legal difficulty 
relating to TUPE. The system was inherited from a previous Government and, in 
the case of the northern isles, has been shown to be unsatisfactory in two respects. 
First, it is not clear until the point of transfer whether TUPE applies to particular 
members of staff. Secondly, the incoming operator gave guarantees from an early 
stage to seafarers, but not to shore staff. That has operated to the disadvantage 
of shore staff.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col13592">13592</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I understand that P&amp;O intends 
to pay a loyalty bonus to staff who stay with them until 30 September and who 
have not been offered a job by NorthLink or one of its contractors that has terms 
and conditions that are substantially equivalent to those that they enjoy at present. 
The bonus, which is equivalent to 13 weeks' pay, means that no one will leave 
the company without either a job in the successor operator or a significant cash 
sum. I welcome that, although I realise that it does not address the whole issue, 
which is why I raised the matter with my colleagues at Westminster, as members 
have acknowledged. We do not want a situation to arise again in which people face 
uncertainty late in the day.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
transfer of the ferry contract to NorthLink has been a complex process, but it 
will be the single biggest improvement in ferry services for the northern isles 
in 50 years. There will be three new vessels, more sailings, new harbours and 
terminal facilities and lower fares. P&amp;O Scottish Ferries has served the northern 
isles well over the years and I am sure that many islanders will want to pay tribute 
to the company. I am also sure that many islanders will look forward to the step 
change in provision that will take place in the northern isles in a few weeks' 
time.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Meeting closed
