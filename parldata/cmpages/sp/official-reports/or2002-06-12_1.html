                to present my member's bill to the Scottish Parliament for stage 
                1 approval. The University of St Andrews (Postgraduate Medical 
                Degrees) Bill is a small bill with the specific objective of enabling 
                the University of St Andrews to award postgraduate research degrees 
                in medicine.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The University of St 
                Andrews is now in its 592<SUP>nd</SUP> year. It is Scotland's 
                oldest university and one of the world's oldest universities. 
                It has a long and distinguished academic record in both teaching 
                and research, not just in the classical subjects, such as history 
                of art, but in the sciences. The school of biology, which includes 
                the medical sciences department, recently achieved the highest 
                grading for its research and is at the cutting edge in many fields.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prior to 1966, the 
                University of St Andrews, which included Queen's College, Dundee, 
                was renowned for its achievements in medical and applied science. 
                Following the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966, which established 
                Dundee University, St Andrews University was no longer entitled 
                to award degrees in medicine. The clinical part of the medical 
                degrees that St Andrews awarded was transferred to Dundee, although 
                St Andrews continued to provide a pre-clinical degree in medical 
                sciences, which gives an entry to the clinical element. That is 
                now provided in conjunction with the University of Manchester.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite no longer being 
                able to offer a qualifying degree in medicine, the University 
                of St Andrews has retained an interest in the teaching of and 
                research into medical sciences. However, as a consequence of the 
                1966 act, the university has been prevented from awarding postgraduate 
                medical degrees, in particular the medical postgraduate degree 
                of medicinae doctor or MD. The university feels that that restricts 
                its ability to attract candidates for postgraduate research in 
                medical sciences, as other, non-medical postgraduate degrees are 
                less attractive to qualified medical practitioners, in terms of 
                the qualification received and of the length, time and methods 
                of study employed.</font></P>

            <TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The university first 
                approached me about the matter in 1999, when I was Deputy Minister 
                for Parliament, through someone whom you might know, Presiding 
                Officer&#151;Professor Michael Steel. I established that primary 
                legislation would be needed to amend the 1996 act so that the 
                university could award the MD. That required an appropriate legislative 
                vehicle, but at the time no suitable Executive bill was anticipated.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following my retirement 
                from ministerial responsibilities, I was again approached by Professor 
                Steel. That was last year. I decided that it might be appropriate 
                to explore the option of a member's bill. I pay tribute at this 
                point to the Scottish Parliament non-Executive bills unit for 
                assisting me to make a proposal for the bill and to introduce 
                the bill with the explanatory notes and policy memorandum that 
                go with it. The bill is very short, but members should not underestimate 
                the amount of work that NEBU has to put into bills even of that 
                short length. I am extremely grateful to the unit for all its 
                help.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bill's purpose 
                is simple. Its substantive section is divided into two subsections. 
                Section 1(1) qualifies the provisions of the Universities (Scotland) 
                Act 1966, which abolished the right of the University of St Andrews 
                to hold qualifying examinations and award degrees in medicine. 
                The bill amends the 1966 act in such a way as to allow the university 
                to hold examinations and award degrees for research in medicine. 
                Subsection (2) makes it clear that that applies only to those 
                who are already qualified as medical practitioners.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bill in no way 
                entitles the university to award qualifying degrees in medicine 
                again. The bill also does not specify that the degree must be 
                an MD, although that is the degree that the university wishes 
                to introduce, as the power to grant a particular degree and establish 
                a new degree course lies with the university court on the recommendation 
                of the university's senatus academicus. The bill gives the university 
                the power to grant that particular type of degree qualification.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The university has 
                consulted the four medical schools in Scotland and the University 
                of Manchester on its proposals to re-establish the MD and has 
                received no objections from those institutions. I am grateful 
                to the Scottish Executive, which has also indicated that it sees 
                no reason not to support the bill.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I thank the convener 
                and members of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee 
                for their co-operation in taking stage 1 evidence so expeditiously 
                and for their support for the general principles of the bill.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bill is small, 
                but it should not be seen as irrelevant or unimportant. It is

                wider community in Fife. I am sure that the availability of the 
                MD course at St Andrews will help to attract to Fife highly qualified 
                medical practitioners who wish to undertake a research-based postgraduate 
                course while working in hospitals and communities in Fife. I know 
                that the national health service in Fife welcomes the proposal. 
                That is why so many colleagues across Mid Scotland and Fife&#151;the

                the bill we are still dealing with one of Scotland's ancient universities&#151;not 
                Aberdeen, but St Andrews.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Mr Smith explained, 
                the bill would allow the University of St Andrews to award research 
                degrees in medicine to candidates who are already qualified medical 
                practitioners. As the member made clear, the bill would not give 
                St Andrews the power to offer qualifying exams. Regulation of 
                the health professions, including those regulated by the Medical 
                Act 1983, is a reserved power under the Scotland Act 1998, so 
                any proposal for the introduction of a qualifying examination 
                would have to be considered by the Westminster Parliament.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The University of St 
                Andrews is not seeking the power to reinstate qualifications for 
                admission to a career as a medical practitioner. The university 
                offers degrees in medical sciences, which are valued and important 
                stand-alone qualifications from a distinguished university with 
                a track record of excellence that dates back 600 years. Those 
                degrees double as qualifications for entry to the clinical part 
                of a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery&#151;or MB ChB&#151;programme 
                at other universities. It is clear that for many students the 
                experience of three or four years at St Andrews, followed by three 
                years at an urban university to complete a degree in medicine, 
                is an attractive option.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The university already 
                offers postgraduate qualifications in medical science, but it 
                believes that the opportunity to study for a postgraduate medical

                in medicine is rather chequered. In 1668, the university rejected 
                the establishment of a chair in medicine&#151;I notice that the

                the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. That image is unfair. I was up there 
                two months ago and went on a guided tour with the principal, Dr

                new centre for biomolecular sciences. The university's research 
                record in biomedicine and bioengineering shows that it is a first-class

                on from Mr Neil's speech. The only thing that is ancient about 
                the University of St Andrews is its long history. Those of us 
                who represent the university know, just as anyone who is acquainted 
                with it knows, that it is very much in the present century. Two 
                years ago, the university organised an excellent familiarisation 
                visit for regional and constituency members, during which we saw 
                the commercial application of much of the research that was being 
                carried out at the university. The university's research is at 
                the cutting edge in many fields.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I share the university's

                wish for the degree to have a positive effect on the local area. 
                As those of us who know Fife NHS Board well are aware, the board 
                faces a problem in that it does not have a teaching hospital and 
                is pulled between two health boards that do: Lothian NHS Board 
                and Tayside NHS Board. I hope that there will now be an opportunity 
                for local medical practitioners and consultants within the Fife 
                NHS Board area to carry out medical research and work for the

                established in 1411. Over the centuries, it has contributed significantly 
                to Scotland and the rest of the world. The postgraduate degree 
                course will give qualified medical practitioners the opportunity

                who choose not to undertake the alternative PhD course, which

                for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Mike Watson): </strong>I welcome 
                the opportunity to recognise sport's valuable contribution to 
                improving the quality of life for everyone in Scotland. I want 
                to highlight the important work that is under way to update sport 
                21, our national strategy for sport, to inform and guide the way 
                forward in developing sport in Scotland.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Government in Scotland 
                is firmly committed to the ethos of sport for all. It is essential 
                that we provide more opportunities for more people to be more 
                active more often. As I said, sport 21 is the national strategy 
                for sport and we are carrying forward its threefold vision of 
                widening opportunities, identifying and nurturing potential and 
                achieving excellence.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When sport 21 was introduced 
                in 1998, it set four key challenges. The first challenge concerned 
                local strategic planning for sport. So far, sports and recreation 
                plans have been introduced by 14 local authorities and are in 
                preparation by a further four. Sportscotland and the Executive 
                will continue to encourage local authorities to develop sports 
                strategies as recommended in sport 21.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second challenge 
                was to establish a physical activity task force to bring together 
                all the relevant agencies at national and local level. The task 
                force was to agree a shared agenda for joint action to develop 
                Scotland as a nation of participants who pursue active lifestyles. 
                The report of that task force was published last Thursday.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the launch, my colleague 
                Malcolm Chisholm announced the appointment of Mary Allison as 
                Scotland's first physical activity co-ordinator. Mary Allison 
                will help the task force to produce the final version of the strategy, 
                which is currently out for consultation. She will also help to 
                co-ordinate the work of the Government and its partners so that 
                we can meet the 20-year targets that have been set for improvements 
                in physical activity.</font></P>

                brings a range of positive health benefits.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The task force proposes 
                the target that 50 per cent of those over the age of 16 and 80 
                per cent of those aged 16 and under should meet the minimum recommended 
                levels of physical activity by 2022. That seems a long way off, 
                but if we are to achieve that target, we will require average 
                increases of 1 per cent a year across the population.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sport is by no means 
                the only way of being physically active, but it is an important 
                way because it is, or should be, a thoroughly enjoyable experience 
                and because of the other benefits that it gives to individuals 
                and to communities.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An annual survey has 
                shown that, among children and young people, participation in 
                sport is higher than might be believed. In the eight to 15 age 
                group, 44 per cent participate four or more times a week in a 
                sporting activity. As most youngsters take part at least occasionally 
                in sport, the clear challenge is to encourage an increase in the 
                frequency and intensity of most young people's exposure to sport 
                and to ensure that they maintain that involvement into adult life.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third challenge 
                that was set by sport 21 was the establishment of the Scottish 
                Institute of Sport, which was launched in 1998 and has recently 
                moved to a new base in Stirling. The institute is supplemented 
                by a network of six area institutes across Scotland. Nearly all 
                of Scotland's 32 local authorities are involved in the various 
                consortia that run those area institutes. That is a good example 
                of the partnership working that we are trying to increase across 
                local authorities, health authorities and education institutions.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modernising sports 
                governing bodies was the fourth key challenge. Through financial 
                assistance, we are encouraging as much of that modernisation throughout 
                Scotland as is possible.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After four years of 
                sport 21, we can say that there is good progress on those four 
                challenges. No one suggests that there is anything other than 
                a lot more work to be done, but progress has certainly been made.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the aspects 
                of developing sport 21 is human resources. For example, volunteers 
                make an important contribution to the well-being of Scotland and 
                its people. A significant proportion of volunteering is sports-related. 
                Without that effort, little amateur sport would exist. That effort 
                makes a major contribution to our social inclusion agenda. Sports 
                volunteers help to build strong and active communities and they 
                help to improve the quality of all our lives. The Scottish Executive

                in April 2003. The review will build on the work done over the 
                past four years. It is not about reinventing the wheel or reconsidering 
                what must be done. That has been established and the review will 
                develop the strategy.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sport helps to foster 
                a sense of belonging. It builds self-esteem, particularly in young 
                people, develops confidence and brings people together. The importance 
                of sport in diverting young people from a potential life of crime 
                or involvement with drugs is clear. That forms an important part 
                of the thinking behind the strategy.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All the benefits of 
                sport should be available to everyone, regardless of gender, age, 
                background or personal circumstances. That is why, of the three 
                visions of sport 21, we place the highest priority on widening 
                opportunities and increasing participation in sport. We are determined 
                to close the opportunity gap by giving more people the opportunity 
                to be more active more often. In doing so, we must build into 
                the strategy the fact that different factors govern the participation 
                of women&#151;particularly women with young children&#151;in sport.</font></P>

                ensure that young people can participate in sport? Does he acknowledge 
                that people with a disability have the chance to participate in 
                a wide range of sports at the Badaguish centre, which offers the

                the work that is going on. I have yet to visit the Badaguish centre 
                but I hope to have the opportunity of doing so. Inclusivity is 
                important. People with disabilities who want to make the most 
                of their ability to participate in sport should certainly have 
                every encouragement. Such participation should be made as easy

                The more rural areas certainly have difficulties. In our considerations

                school sport co-ordinators in secondary schools, we are mindful

                Women's football is one of the fastest growing sports in Scotland 
                and one of the schools participating in one of the age-group finals 
                was the Nicolson Institute in Stornoway. The institute's participation

                We hope that almost 300 schools in more than two thirds of local 
                authorities will participate in that initiative. I want to extend 
                it to the maximum. I have no doubt about the benefits of that

                the facilities that we provide across the sporting spectrum are 
                affordable and accessible to meet the needs of users and potential 
                users. The report &quot;The Ticking Time Bomb&quot;, which was 
                published last year, showed how much investment is necessary to 
                refurbish our swimming pools over the next 20 years&#151;it amounts 
                to about &#163;500 million. That gives members an idea of the scale 
                of the task that we face. Sportscotland is carrying out an audit 
                of other sports facilities in Scotland so that by spring 2003 
                we will have an up-to-date assessment of the condition and investment 
                requirements of our stock.</font></P>

                issue. We must invest wisely to ensure that we get the best value

                provision that is sustainable, not just in the medium term but 
                in the longer term, for the generations to follow. We need to 
                maximise the use of those facilities and ensure that school-based 
                facilities become community facilities.</font></P>

                still and we are well aware that we must press on. That is why 
                we are undertaking the general review of sport 21. It is essential 
                that the national strategy is constantly moving so that it remains

                of schools had good programmes for physical education. Research 
                from the University of Strathclyde shows that the average amount 
                of time that is set aside for physical education in secondary 
                schools is now less than it was 10 years ago, with 43 per cent 
                of schools providing no PE for secondary 5 and secondary 6. Even 
                worse, facilities are being sold off for commercial gain, sacrificing 
                the health of students. One in seven secondary schools no longer 
                has any access to grass playing fields, which leads to concerns 
                about whether current procedures for protecting open space and

                plan or to which there are lots of objections. However, in a recent

                on their own, such as cycling. The option of participating at 
                different skill levels must be available, so that nobody feels 
                excluded or disillusioned. It is also important to note the lack

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Monteith: 
                </strong>I will in a moment, but first I will develop my argument.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important for 
                us to recognise that parents offer a wealth of talent. Parents 
                are often qualified in coaching and training certain sports; often 
                they are more qualified than the teachers. I thank teachers for 
                their work and effort, but they take extra-curricular work because 
                they enjoy it&#151;teachers like to see the benefits that PE brings 
                to their pupils and they enjoy being involved in sport. However, 
                the wealth of talent that parents could bring to schools is often 
                not being tapped.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ms MacDonald: 
                </strong>There is no difficulty in recruiting PE teachers. The 
                University of Edinburgh, which offers the only graduate PE course, 
                regularly takes a complement of 100 students and the course is 
                heavily oversubscribed. Between 95 and 100 per cent of the students 
                stick with the course, which is a much higher percentage than 
                for any other discipline. As I said, there is no difficulty in 
                recruiting PE teachers, but the Government is reluctant to pay 
                them.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Monteith: 
                </strong>Forgive me if I seemed to misrepresent the position. 
                I meant recruitment in the sense of parents being brought forward 
                to become involved in schools. I am sure that that is an area 
                on which we agree.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know of a number 
                of parents who hold Scottish Football Association certificates, 
                who could have coached children, but the schools do not call on 
                them to do so. Those parents could be lending a hand in providing 
                additional help to sports in schools.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is also worth raising 
                the issue of indoor facilities. It is clear to anyone who is involved 
                in team sports that our climate, with its dark winters, limits 
                what can be done to engage children in team sports outdoors. When 
                the nights are drawing in, it is difficult to coach young children 
                in team sports in muddy playing fields, other than by drilling 
                them. Therefore, teams go to church halls and school halls, but 
                those halls have been designed for nothing bigger than a badminton 
                court. In such surroundings, it is difficult for coaches to instil 
                a degree of proficiency or enjoyment. It is often the case that 
                one half of the class has to sit out the training while the other 
                half is taking part. It is important that we ask the planning 
                team to examine issues such as the provision of indoor facilities.</font></P>

                between the performance of its national football team and ours 
                is quite noticeable. The provision of large indoor facilities 
                has allowed Norway to provide a better level of skilled coaching 
                than is available in Scotland. I am not saying that that argument

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must challenge current 
                conventions. For example, I hope that the planning team will challenge 
                the assumption that certain sports should be held only at certain 
                times of the year. It is absurd to involve children, either at 
                school or in clubs, in sports for which the weather is not suitable. 
                People might well prefer to play football in winter, but the convention 
                that young people should learn about sport in muddy fields is 
                counterproductive. It is no wonder that they want to stay in and 
                play with their computers or be couch potatoes. We must challenge 
                the convention that national sports organisations should set the

                sport of any sort? Indeed, I was one of those children: I was 
                the last to be picked for the football team and so on. In a way, 
                such a problem will never be addressed by the term &quot;sport&quot;.

                </strong>I happily concur with Mr Stone's point. I was about to 
                say that physical education should not be limited just to sport. 
                In fact, in previous speeches, I have outlined the particular 
                importance of dance in schools. We must ensure that dance, particularly 
                traditional dance, is encouraged in Scottish schools and that 
                it plays a greater role in physical education. I hope that that

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Monteith: 
                </strong>I happily recognise the contribution made by women's 
                football and note how often girls and women outperform boys and 
                men in national and international competitive tournaments. In 
                fact, the sport is such a success that my son complains about 
                finding it harder to get on to the pitch at Livingston Football 
                Club because the ladies' football team uses the facilities so 
                much. As such problems are caused by success, perhaps we should 
                welcome them.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I must move on to the 
                kernel of my amendment. Although we support the Executive and 
                the creation of the task force and the planning team, we believe 
                that more has to be done. By lodging our amendment, we simply 
                want more meat to be put on the bones. We should be setting ourselves 
                the goal of having a full-time equivalent PE teacher in every 
                primary and secondary school. As Mr Rumbles might not be clear 
                about what I mean, I should make it clear that schools that have 
                only one or two teachers and a small number of pupils will not 
                have a full-time PE teacher. However, we are looking for full-time 
                equivalents to ensure that such schools have access to PE teachers 
                who can share their work load with other schools and thereby give 
                the same amount of time to those schools as they would give to 
                a school with 30 pupils in each class. A school with 420 pupils 
                can easily employ a full-time PE teacher, whereas a school with 
                42 cannot.</font></P>

                by &quot;full-time equivalent&quot;. I think that our suggestion 
                is quite practical. However, even if he does not accept the wording 
                of my amendment, he should not let that stop him supporting it. 
                I have made what we want quite clear: we want to ensure not only 
                that we have fine words, people sitting on committees and initiatives 
                and strategies, but that we get results.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must have far more

                not only enjoy a certain level of sport and activity but take 
                it further and improve themselves, their school and community. 
                That aim is worthy of support, which is why we have lodged the

                (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD): </strong>I, too, welcome 
                the debate. Last week in the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, 
                as in previous weeks, we discussed Tommy Sheridan's School Meals 
                (Scotland) Bill, which has raised the profile of nutritional standards 
                in schools. On Monday, I was at a meeting of the PE teachers network 
                to discuss the report of the physical activity task force, which 
                stressed the importance of physical activity for the health of 
                the nation. It was a super discussion.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Incidentally, Winnie 
                Ewing told us that she was a champion swimmer. The leader of the

                he was in primary 4, and that he too was a swimming medallist 
                in Scottish championships&#151;you learn something every day.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was much discussion 
                of the nature of PE provision and sport in schools. The teachers 
                talked about how to make things better. They talked about class 
                sizes, teacher training and time&#151;issues that relate to their 
                professional preparation for the job. They talked about PE having 
                lost its whole-school application, perhaps because of certificate 
                examinations, which seem to some administrators to take the place 
                of core PE for all. Displacement was an important issue that was 
                talked about.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Winnie Ewing talked 
                about the discomfort of not having a shower. The PE teachers talked 
                about how the atmosphere could be changed if there were individual 
                showers instead of communal showers. Some youngsters do not like 
                that side of physical activity, as Jamie Stone said.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important that 
                people engage in regular physical activity. Today, we are discussing 
                a lifelong lesson to establish a healthy lifestyle. It is not 
                just about youngsters. There is nothing more important than improving 
                the quality of life of our nation, as the motion states. We can 
                see that participation in sport raises the quality of life of 
                individuals in terms of fitness, self-esteem and social engagement. 
                It represents the embodiment of values and, as the task force 
                report makes clear, it has continuing benefits for future health.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Similarly, the availability 
                of sporting opportunities and participation in them raise the 
                quality of life in neighbourhoods and communities, as Mike Watson 
                said. We all recognise that youngsters who take part in sport 
                and games are engaged in an activity that is potentially satisfying 
                and fulfilling, and which diverts them from aimless, sometimes 
                destructive, and otherwise socially unacceptable activity. The 
                Executive programme, which includes sport 21 and the other things 
                that Mike Watson mentioned, makes that a high priority. We welcome 
                that.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sport can also help 
                to nurture a sense of place, a shared identity and civic pride 
                in communities and neighbourhoods. Peebles Rugby Club has been 
                successful this year in gaining promotion to division 1. That 
                made the place feel better. I hope next week to be able to help 
                Gala Fairydean Football Club to be accepted into the Scottish 
                Football League, which will give an extra boost to a place with 
                an already great sense of community. That is important for communities.</font></P>

                can be wildly overdone, but it is a powerful influence in drawing 
                people together. If sport and physical activity are so important,

                I take issue with the Tories' amendment. It is too simplistic

                grasp. One full-time equivalent would incur the same staffing 
                cost as one teacher. Brian Monteith is talking about putting one 
                PE teacher into every little primary school in Scotland, but that 
                would be woefully impracticable. The secret is to ensure that

                </strong>I hate to take issue with Rhona Brankin on this, as she 
                put much good work into what preceded the physical activity task 
                force's report. However, she is wrong to imply that we can do 
                without specialist PE teachers, especially in primary schools. 
                Perhaps I can also help to get Brian Monteith off the hook on 
                which he has impaled himself. I think that he is referring to 
                the peripatetic primary school PE specialists who visit perhaps 
                three to five schools in the course of a week.</font></P>

                </strong>I do not disagree that there is a role for PE teachers 
                in primary schools. What I am saying is that we need far more 
                physical activity than one or two sessions a week with a PE teacher. 
                Children in primary schools as well as in secondary schools need 
                much more regular physical activity than that. When I was a primary 
                school teacher, I took my class out running every day. Youngsters 
                must have physical activity almost every day. Saying that PE teachers 
                can deliver that is simply not addressing the question. Whole-school 
                approaches must be developed.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I recognise and welcome

                and we must be able to measure schools' success in improving the 
                physical activity of our youngsters. That must be an integral

                boys and girls. That disparity continues up to the age of about 
                35. As men and women get older, their level of physical activity 
                decreases, and there are huge disparities between the levels of

                the physical activity task force into the debate. As far as I

                our strategic thinking. Hard questions must be addressed because 
                we seek an outcome, which we thought might be delivered through 
                the health service budget, but which we are asking the education 
                budget to deliver&#151;a fitter, healthier community. The question 
                is whether that has resource implications.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have had argy-bargy 
                about whether PE teachers are needed in primary schools and whether 
                there are a sufficient number of PE teachers in secondary schools. 
                As far as I am concerned, we do not have sufficient numbers. For 
                example, there are only 10 PE specialists in primary schools in 
                the city of Glasgow. This is the most unfit nation with the most 
                unfit industrial capital&#151;or former industrial capital&#151;in 
                Europe. The children in Glasgow schools are not staring at a healthy, 
                fit future; it will be an expensive future for the small number

                so on that Scottish teachers were excellent generalists. They 
                are, but they are now burdened with a huge amount of administrative

                Primary teachers who, like Rhona Brankin, took their pupils out 
                running every day were thin on the ground. Even if primary teachers 
                wanted to do that now, they could not, because of the amount of

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the Parliament 
                met in Glasgow in 2000, we debated whether Mr Mike Tyson should 
                be allowed entry to Britain in order to fight in Scotland. If 
                I remember correctly, that fight eventually lasted only a few 
                seconds. During that debate, the argument was advanced that, if 
                Mr Mike Tyson had had a British passport, he would not have been 
                allowed into the United States after committing the crime of rape. 
                We were asked whether it was appropriate for him to receive entry 
                into Britain when others who had committed rape would not. It 
                would be fair to say that the Home Secretary took the view that 
                Mr Mike Tyson had paid his debt to society by completion of the 
                sentence for that crime.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the course of 
                the debate, I expressed my view that Mr Mike Tyson was not as 
                great a boxer as our Mr Lennox Lewis, who had been totally underestimated 
                and was a good ambassador for boxing. Mr Lennox Lewis is a man

                contains three visions, one of which is to do with achieving and 
                sustaining world-class performances in sport. The sportsman about 
                who I am talking has achieved that. I am stressing the fact that 
                he is a role model. Just as sportsmen should be condemned when 
                they are not role models, they should be congratulated when they 
                are. I believe that he is a fine ambassador for this country and

                the Lennox Lewis college in Hackney, which is for disadvantaged 
                young persons. In recognition of that, he received an honorary

                behind him, but to form some wonderful friendships that stood

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy Peattie 
                (Falkirk East) (Lab): </strong>Widespread sporting activity is 
                clearly important to the health and fitness of the population. 
                It can improve quality of life and can reduce the social costs 
                of poor health. It has many other benefits beyond that. Team sports 
                involve social interaction and a co-operative effort; people work 
                together and learn lessons that can be transferred into other 
                spheres of activity.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sport is also an area 
                where people can contribute to social well-being through volunteering, 
                training youngsters and organising and helping to stage events. 
                Sport has diverse economic benefits, ranging from a healthier 
                work force to sport's enormous commercial potential.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The debate is not about 
                creating spectators; it is about participation and how we encourage 
                people to make the purchase of sports goods more than just a fashion 
                statement. An analysis of data on sports participation gives cause 
                for real concern. Overall participation rates are lower than is 
                desirable if we are to have a healthy population.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Organisations such 
                as Engender argue that women are particularly disengaged from 
                sports activity. That starts in childhood. Among children and 
                young people, a quarter of boys and a third of girls do not achieve 
                the minimum recommended level of physical activity. Gender differences 
                are negligible among pre-school children, but grow throughout 
                school years. As Rhona Brankin said, differences also exist between 
                the genders as people get older. Two thirds of 15-year-old girls 
                do not get enough exercise&#151;nearly twice the proportion that 
                applies to boys. We must develop imaginative ways to encourage 
                boys&#151;and girls even more so&#151;to get involved in sport 
                at school and to stay involved in it as adults.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is ironic that although 
                girls will not get involved in sport at school, as soon as they 
                leave school and start working they join aerobics classes and 
                get involved in keep fit and so on. We need to find ways in which 
                to ensure that girls can participate in sport and feel comfortable 
                with it. On a point that was made by Winnie Ewing, it is all right 
                to pooh-pooh the need for a shower, but young girls of a particular 
                age need to feel comfortable and they need to feel that they are 
                listened to, which would ensure that they can participate in sport

                have disabilities and those from ethnic minorities find it difficult 
                to participate in sport. The recent film, &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;, 
                illustrates the obstacles to participating in sport that are faced 
                by youngsters from ethnic minorities.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sport 21 was established 
                to tackle the deep-seated inertia of our population. Several projects 
                have been aimed at addressing that, with encouraging results. 
                Sportscotland, for example, has run the active primary schools 
                programme to address the issue, which is a major one for social 
                inclusion partnerships.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must recognise the 
                important work that is done by local authorities, which run sports 
                centres, encourage people to participate in sports and try out 
                new areas of sport. I think that they are key players in the delivery 
                of sport. We can also learn a lot from elsewhere; there are good 
                examples of progress in Wales.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have the report 
                of the physical activity task force, which advocates a range of 
                measures and covers the review of the physical education curriculum 
                in schools. We need to evaluate imaginatively how children engage 
                in physical activity in schools, be it dance, PE or whatever&#151;although 
                I am not so sure about boxing. We need to encourage children to 
                participate in physical activity.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We need to examine

                in sports&#151;we need to address the reasons why girls do not 
                want to participate in sport. We need to make sport relevant to 
                parents and we need to influence them as gender role models for 
                their children.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I agree with Margo 
                MacDonald that it is important that parents understand the rules 
                and that they are able to be involved in sport. Many football 
                clubs and other sports clubs are run by parents, who are keen 
                for their children to participate in sport. We need to plant a 
                seed for the future. Children who are involved in sport are more 
                likely to enjoy and take part in sport as adults.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am pleased that the

                facilities such as child care, and that sports co-ordinators have 
                brought benefits to children. I look forward to implementation 
                of the recommendations of the physical activity task force and

                debate could be led by the Minister for Health and Community Care. 
                Often we ignore the long-term problems that can arise in a society 
                because of lack of physical activity among younger and older people. 
                It is important that we take every opportunity to educate all 
                members of our society about the potential health benefits of 
                physical exercise.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some 20 per cent of 
                younger people in Scotland are overweight. That illustrates the 
                potential problems that we are storing up for the future in cardiovascular 
                disorders, diabetes and high blood pressure. If we do not adopt 
                a longer-term strategy to tackle those problems, they will return 
                to haunt us.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Margo MacDonald noted 
                that a lack of physical exercise has a health cost for individuals 
                and a financial cost for society. It is important that, where 
                possible, we encourage young people to participate in regular 
                physical activity. In doing so, we must tackle the barriers that 
                prevent individuals from participating in such activities. The 
                physical activity task force report cites 13 reasons that people 
                commonly give for not participating in physical activity. Those 
                reasons range from lack of money, being too old and having no 
                one to go with to being put off by the weather. The last reason&#151;point 
                12&#151;I found rather disappointing. If we in Scotland depend 
                on good weather to encourage people to become involved in physical 
                activity, very few people will participate.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must ensure that 
                people are aware of the benefits that can be gained from physical 
                activity. In her speech, Cathy Peattie talked about the need to 
                ensure that physical activity provision is as inclusive as possible. 
                We must ensure that all members of our society are able to participate 
                in physical activity equally and fairly. Provision for disabled 
                people at sports centres is often limited to a ramp leading to 
                the door. It is necessary to ensure that staff are educated and 
                that they able to work with disabled people, so that disabled 
                people can participate in the activities that interest them. Fergus 
                Ewing referred to the Badaguish centre, which specialises in providing 
                outdoor activities to young disabled people. We must also ensure 
                that staff are aware of the religious and cultural sensitivities&#151;for 
                example, relating to dress&#151;of people from ethnic minority 
                groups.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">appear to tackle the 
                issue of outdoor education. One of the many sad legacies of the 
                Thatcher Government was the systematic closure of local authority 
                outdoor centres, which were set up in the 1950s and 1960s to ensure 
                that all young people had an opportunity to participate in outdoor 
                activities. Because there is now a shortage of such facilities, 
                it is very difficult for people from deprived communities to participate 
                in activities in which they might be skilled. I hope that, in 
                trying to increase the level of physical activity by young people 
                and others, the minister will ensure that our education system 
                provides young people with an opportunity to participate in outdoor 
                activities.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If, for example, someone 
                is studying standard grade or higher geography, there is nothing 
                better for them than going on a day's walk somewhere such as Glencoe 
                to study glacial features, which will give them practical experience 
                of the academic subject that they study in the classroom. I hope 
                that we can consider the issue holistically. Excellent centres 
                such as Glenmore lodge, which I visited recently with the cross-party 
                sports group, were set up specifically to give young deprived 
                people the opportunity, which every young person should have, 
                to walk in the mountains of Scotland. I discovered that it has 
                become very difficult for young people from deprived communities 
                to participate, because local authorities are not providing that 
                service. I hope that at the end of the process, we will ensure 
                that young people are given the unique opportunity to appreciate 
                the natural beauty of Scotland.</font></P>

                I draw members' attention to the far north, which is my part of 
                the world. Mention was made of covered indoor facilities; counties

                difficult and is not really worth going into, but it is associated 
                with council spend. Let us leave it at that. The net result is 
                that towns in Ross-shire, such as Dingwall, Fortrose and Invergordon, 
                which have populations of 4,000 to 6,000, have leisure centres,

                Martin Bowie (Projects Director for Regional Sports Centres) stated:

                between a thematic and geographic social inclusion partnership, 
                we have difficulty in getting the right rules in place to proceed

                (Falkirk West): </strong>Last Wednesday, I dropped in on a conference 
                that was organised by sportscotland as part of the review of sport 
                21. I hoped to hear some new ideas on how to increase participation 
                in sport and on how to improve our rather mediocre performance 
                in international events. To be frank, I was disappointed.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the keynote 
                speakers devoted almost his entire speech to singing the praises 
                of the private finance initiative and public-private partnerships. 
                Surely it is not the job of sportscotland to promote a funding 
                mechanism that is so controversial that even the Accounts Commission 
                for Scotland is questioning it because it does not provide best 
                value for money.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other keynote speaker 
                was an adviser to the Parliament's Education, Culture and Sport 
                Committee. Nothing in her speech convinced me that the committee 
                is giving adequate priority to sport in its current inquiry into 
                the purposes of education. Unfortunately, no member of the committee 
                was present to persuade me otherwise. Indeed, I did not see another 
                MSP at the afternoon session that I attended, although I understand 
                that the Deputy Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport opened 
                the morning session. The Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament 
                must give sport a higher profile. It is no wonder that there is 
                lethargy and inactivity at grass-roots level if there is lethargy 
                and inactivity at the top.</font></P>

                every week in Scotland more than 40 people die of heart disease 
                because they are too inactive. The problems start in early life

                a Parliament and the Parliament elected ministers to do the business. 
                Urgent ministerial action is needed, particularly from the Minister

                order to get other teachers involved in school sports. Many teachers 
                opted out at the time of the dispute in the 1980s, but surely 
                the McCrone settlement provides an opportunity for a fresh start

                did not qualify for it. As Cathy Peattie said, it is absolutely 
                essential for health reasons that we encourage our young people 
                to become players rather than mere spectators. Instead of simply 
                watching our neighbours, such as England and Ireland, go on to 
                greater things, we should adopt that approach which, in the longer

                age, physical fitness was not an option but a necessity. From 
                the age of eight, I had to get on my bike every morning and cycle 
                the three miles to school. When I got there, an interesting game 
                would be going on in the playground: a perpetual game of three 
                and in. We had one set of goals, which at our school was made 
                not from jerseys but from two particularly well fashioned rubbish 
                bins. That game would sometimes start as early as 8 o'clock in 
                the morning and would continue through the morning break and lunch 
                time. Some of us would even stay back in the evenings to participate 
                a little while longer before going home. That kind of physical 
                activity underpinned a great deal of the sport that went on at

                by some of the lady members because, when my daughter left primary 
                school and went to the secondary school, she was no longer welcome 
                to play football at a genuinely competitive level. The girls were 
                simply not accepted at that level. The resulting resentment that 
                she experienced had a significant impact on her and has perhaps 
                shaped her character to this day. However, the amount of physical 
                activity that took place in schools in those days was largely 
                due to necessity.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must also remember 
                the need for role models, to which Dennis Canavan and Lord James 
                Douglas-Hamilton referred. Young people want to compete in sport 
                because they wish to model themselves on someone who has had success. 
                In Scotland, we are beginning to suffer from the law of diminishing 
                returns, because, without models of success, young people will 
                not have an interest in sport.</font></P>

                role models play, I think that he is really talking about football, 
                which is what most members have done. Talking only about football 
                militates against an appreciation of all sports. Rather than tune 
                in to the football programmes that masquerade as sports programmes, 
                people should listen to John Beattie's programme on a Saturday

                only a few years ago. Alan Wells won an Olympic gold medal in 
                the 100 metres race. We had boxing success at both amateur and 
                professional level in Scotland. A whole generation of young people 
                treated those figures as role models, but that motivation has 
                dried up because of the lack of success.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The debate is important 
                because time and again in the chamber we have discussed Scotland's

                exercise people get these days is pressing the accelerator or 
                clutch in their cars or walking down their local high street to

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Young people have been 
                mentioned in the debate several times. It is important to catch 
                people when they are young to try to encourage them to adopt a 
                healthy lifestyle. That means getting them to play more sport 
                and to participate in physical exercise when they are young. The 
                shortage of PE teachers&#151;mentioned eloquently by Margo MacDonald 
                and other members&#151;is crucial. Rhona Brankin says that other 
                teachers can fulfil the PE function and, although that is true

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1998, there were 
                52 full-time specialist teachers in Aberdeenshire, a number of

                so the situation has become a lot worse. In Aberdeenshire, there 
                are only eight full-time equivalent PE teachers for 158 schools 
                and 20,500 pupils. Those eight PE teachers are delivering only

                we must take a whole-school approach to sport? Does he recognise 
                that although one school might have access to a PE specialist 
                and another school might not, the pupils in the second school

                Rhona Brankin is right to suggest that many issues are involved. 
                However, in this litigious age, other teachers are terrified about 
                getting involved in all the sports in their schools. They would 
                rather have a trained specialist&#151;in case anything goes wrong 
                or to ensure that nothing goes wrong in the first place.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Schools often do not

                a gym, the half-hour PE period has been cut to 20 minutes.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the Parliament 
                was in Aberdeen, I had a members' business debate on drug misuse 
                in Grampian. Drug figures from throughout the country show that 
                it is mainly young people who turn to substance misuse. Why do 
                they do that? They tell me that it is because their communities 
                have no facilities. They want sports facilities. They say that 
                education to get them off drugs is very useful but that what they 
                really want is other facilities to let them fill their time. However, 
                there is a shortage of sports facilities. We should be trying 
                to get those kids to participate in sport and not to participate 
                in substance misuse. Especially in rural areas, the lack of facilities 
                is a huge issue.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We should have a formula. 
                We would not allow communities to be without health facilities 
                or police stations so, similarly, we should work out a formula 
                to prevent communities from being without sports facilities. Areas 
                with populations above a certain level should have access to affordable 
                sports facilities. Not only would that address Scotland's health 
                problems, it would allow people to be much more active.</font></P>

                Denmark is a small country&#151;it is the same size as Scotland. 
                However, it has many things that we do not have&#151;and not only 
                its own Government. It has many sports facilities as well. The 
                papers are saying that the reason why they have done so well in 
                the world cup is that they have excellent sports facilities. Footballers 
                in this country have been contrasting our sports facilities with 
                those in Denmark. Sweden, Ireland and Denmark&#151;all north European

                the &quot;Taste of Grampian&quot; food festival on Saturday. He 
                told me that many other people who are coming through the same 
                squash club, at Westhill outside Aberdeen, could be among the 
                top players in the world. However, they get no support. Peter 
                Nicol is from Westhill in Aberdeenshire, but he represents England 
                in the squash world championships because, south of the border, 
                all the support services, such as physiotherapy and hotel accommodation, 
                are laid on for him. We need more Peter Nicols. He should be doing 
                a fantastic job for Scotland, although recently he has been doing

                attitudes. I want to give some examples from the west of Scotland 
                and Glasgow in particular that demonstrate that. The women in 
                sport initiative has undoubtedly been one of the most successful 
                programmes supported by the Government. Cathy Peattie commented 
                on the policy and the importance of targeting those who may not 
                have the opportunity to take up sport or who face obstacles. Training 
                sessions for marathons and 10km runs, ladies nights at the pool 
                and gym and jogging networks have all helped women to exercise 
                without feeling embarrassed. This year was the 10<SUP>th</SUP> 
                anniversary of the Glasgow women's 10k and 9,000 women took part. 
                Two years ago, when my wife took part in the annual 5k in aid

                and others who would benefit are prescribed exercise rather than

                That programme points to the necessity of considering the resourcing 
                of sport. The national health service is expected to bear the 
                burden of that programme and often it is the private facilities

                for the sport and leisure industry, is looking to become a new

                that development. However, there are issues to be tackled here.

                important of all is the support that we can give the voluntary

                jaws of victory, but I believe that the ethos of sport for all,

                money that would otherwise be wasted on jails, for example, and 
                money that is dedicated to the health service and put it into

                create good social animals. For various reasons, many of our fellow 
                citizens are not good social animals. One of the highlights of 
                my youth, which was probably a sheltered upbringing, was the first 
                time that I went to the braw lads gathering with the Edinburgh

                they know that, if they let go of the rope, the chap below them 
                is in big trouble or if the chap above them lets go of the rope, 
                they are in big trouble. That is serious, character-building activity.

                the facilities in which characters will be built. Hutchison Vale

                Council to release land to allow the football club to cater for 
                more than 200 kids in that area of the town. Local authorities 
                do not have the required resources for such initiatives. Ministers

                participation in sports should be widened. Several members have 
                referred to the problems of ill health. Despite increasing affluence, 
                ill health in the population is increasing. As several members 
                have said, Scotland has serious problems with heart disease, cancer 
                and stroke, which could be countered in some cases by exercise. 
                Furthermore, the level of obesity is growing among young people. 
                We must examine ways of countering those problems, if for no other 
                reason than to reduce the burden on the NHS that is a result of 
                those health problems. That is why we want to encourage participation

                the Soviet Union and East Germany cleaned up Olympic medals, while 
                people in their home countries suffered under evil socialist regimes. 
                Meanwhile, we in the free world did not win as many medals, but

                less than a priority. One example is the Education, Culture and 
                Sport Committee's report on sport in schools. The report was published 
                in October 2000, yet the Executive's response was not received 
                until April 2002. The report drew conclusions and made recommendations 
                that deserved action and response a great deal sooner than that. 
                They were valid then and they are valid today.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report's headline 
                conclusion was that there is a need to improve the participation 
                of young people in sport while they are at school. The report 
                recognised that sport can play a major role in improving the health, 
                motivation and achievement of young people across the social spectrum. 
                The report called for greater emphasis on using sport as a vehicle 
                for health and for academic improvement. Those are exactly the 
                sort of things that we have discussed today, almost two years 
                later.</font></P>

                of school sport co-ordinators. It is good that some input is going 
                into schools again, even if it is a poor replacement for a system 
                that was in place 20 years ago. That system was allowed to disappear, 
                largely because of pressure on local authority funding. I stress 
                that the school sport co-ordinators should involve all relevant 
                partner organisations in the community, as that will lead to optimum 
                effectiveness.</font></P>

                There are concerns that, due to limited national direction and 
                a lack of coming together of experiences, the co-ordinators' training 
                has been inefficient and ineffective. That has led to a hotch-potch

                the previous minister's decision to establish a school sport alliance. 
                If that is the case, perhaps the deputy minister will set out 
                the reasons for that decision in her summing up. I also note the 
                proposed ministerial review of PE and that the make-up of the 
                group will be announced in the next few weeks. I understand that 
                the group will examine ways of continuing to raise the profile 
                of PE and that it might also examine the issue of numbers in PE 
                classes, which would be useful. I ask the minister to confirm 
                whether the review will include school sport.</font></P>

                been mentioned, if fairly briefly. Although we have had debates 
                about the value of learning that skill, we know that many community 
                swimming pools have closed down in recent years because of high 
                maintenance costs. Moreover, even some of the new schools that 
                are being built at the moment, such as those in Glasgow, do not 
                have swimming pools. As a result, swimming might soon be dropped 
                from the curriculum. We want swimming lessons to be provided to 
                all pupils to ensure that they can all swim a minimum of 25m by 
                standard 1.</font></P>

                to reject our amendment, because it is important that we make 
                clear the intention to embrace co-ordination, joint working and 
                joint funding, to improve access by reason of geography or funding, 
                and in all ways to ensure that groups that are too often socially 
                excluded have such access. We must all push for any initiative 
                that improves the provision of sport in schools and the community 
                to ensure that future generations include physical activity in 
                their lives from childhood to adulthood.</font></P>

                cup at the moment, Wimbledon coming up and the Commonwealth games 
                at the end of next month, the subject is very much in people's 
                minds, even though there are different degrees of Scottish interest 
                in those competitions. At this point, I should perhaps congratulate 
                those teams from the British isles that have progressed to the 
                next round of the world cup. My only plea is that, if the team 
                supported by Kenny Macintosh wins, we do not have to see the winning 
                goal for the next 40 years. That said, it might knock replays 
                of the other goal off the box.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Tories made much 
                play of excellence. It is important to celebrate that quality 
                and indeed the competitions that I have mentioned provide role 
                models in that respect. Success is not just about bringing together 
                communities and nations; it is also inspirational. For example, 
                when Wimbledon is on, we see children out with tennis racquets; 
                when marathons are on, we see people running in the streets. The 
                other day, I was even pleasantly surprised to discover my eldest 
                son, who has not been physically active, playing football. As 
                several members have pointed out, we have to capitalise on people's 
                interest in watching sport and convert it into a desire to participate 
                in sport and physical recreation.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Margo MacDonald did 
                not like the way in which we had framed the motion and asked whether 
                we were serious. Actually, we are deadly serious. Unless we use 
                these methods to improve Scotland's health, we will continue to 
                be the sick man of Europe and to build up a huge health bill through 
                trying to make people well again. Some of our efforts must be 
                directed at preventing people from getting ill in the first place 
                and at enabling people to live to a healthy old age. If people 
                are to live longer, they should do so in good health. That is 
                to everyone's benefit.</font></P>

                the seriousness of the objectives that are outlined in the sports 
                strategy and the physical activity task force strategy. However, 
                the issue comes back to resources. We have to put our money where 
                our mouth is. Will the Executive put more money into recruiting 
                more PE teachers, sport co-ordinators and PE advisers? Will it

                about sport 21, which is not being reviewed just because somebody 
                feels like having another review. Sport 21 is a strategy that 
                was designed to expire in 2003. Now we want to find out how we 
                can build on it and refine it to create a policy that will take 
                us forward in the five to 10 years beyond 2003. I strongly encourage 
                the MSPs who have contributed forcibly to this debate to get involved 
                in that debate. Dennis Canavan was disappointed by what he saw 
                last week. If that is the case, he should get in there and say 
                what he thinks should be done, because the opportunity is available. 
                I do not want a glossy Executive document on the Executive's policy 
                for sport. That is not the intention&#151;it is Scotland's policy

                the chamber that my colleague Michael Matheson was too modest 
                to mention that he is a member of a mountain rescue team. Does 
                the minister acknowledge the key role that mountain rescue teams 
                play, not only in evacuating casualties safely from the hills, 
                but in teaching safe practice in outdoor activities, in particular 
                in our hills, in teaching young children in lectures and by other 
                means, and all the other work that they do&#151;on a volunteer 
                basis&#151;and which they cherish?</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In discussing the review 
                of sport 21, we also have to make links. Mention was made, for 
                example, of the national debate on education. That affords a crucial 
                opportunity for people to make points about the importance of 
                physical recreation and the contribution that sport can make to 
                pupils' learning. I encourage all partners to get involved in 
                that consultation process, and in the consultation on the draft 
                strategy of the physical activity task force. The review of sport 
                21 can be a success only if all our partners are involved. That 
                means involving local authorities and encouraging them to find 
                ways to include physical activity in their community plans.</font></P>

                there was an appreciation that there were also personal benefits 
                in terms of health and fitness. People identified those benefits 
                as more important than even the community benefits, such as regeneration 
                and crime reduction. It is important that the benefits of building

                factors were evident in the survey. I am not sure whether the 
                sample was large enough to be representative, but it appears that 
                rural communities value sport more than do urban communities. 
                That is interesting, in the light of what Jamie Stone said. I 
                will digress, and say that of the new funding for physical activity 
                from the New Opportunities Fund, more than &#163;53 million is for 
                facilities. I urge local authorities to examine how they use that

                that limits their physical activity or the work that they can 
                do. The demographic change must be taken into account when we

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a growth in 
                sports activities that fit into short time spans. Those sports 
                sometimes require changing facilities that are more accessible 
                to people for shorter periods. We need more home-based activities 
                and opportunities for sports in which families can participate 
                together.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Higher education is 
                a major influence on participation in sport, because students 
                have increased access to a range of affordable sports activities. 
                That could be good news for the levels of participation in physical 
                activity by women, because there has been an increase in the number 
                of women who attend higher education. We must consider the points 
                of transition, because we know that physical activity tends to 
                fall away during transition from school to jobs or into the community.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The key in the longer 
                term is to encourage children and young people who are at school 
                to participate in sport and to develop a lifelong habit of physical 
                exercise. That is essential to our nation. At present, the physical 
                activity of the average person peaks at the age of nine and then 
                deteriorates. As many members have said, that deterioration is 
                particularly fast in young girls. That is sometimes because young 
                girls do not like competitive team sports and might prefer activities 
                such as dance, as Brian Monteith pointed out. Some women want 
                to take part in team sports&#151;women's football is, I think, 
                the fastest-growing sport in the world&#151;but we must consider 
                activities that are more attractive to young women, such as aerobics 
                and equestrian activities.</font></P>

                of fireworks being used as weapons. Some of those fireworks are 
                bombs by another name. For example, the Black Cat firework, which 
                weighs 21lb, has a greater velocity than many mortar bombs. The 
                advice is that it should not be detonated within 80ft of a structure.</font></P>

                The ease with which such weapons are sold under the guise of fireworks 
                and their availability to anyone, including children, must be 
                reviewed at the earliest opportunity.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am raising the issue 
                in our Parliament in response to many complaints and concerns 
                from constituents and community groups in my area and throughout 
                Scotland about the misuse of fireworks. I put on record my thanks 
                to the SSPCA for its support and valuable research on the problems 
                that are caused by the irresponsible use of fireworks.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clearly, the misuse 
                of fireworks causes huge distress to thousands of people. Last 
                year, 89 people were injured by fireworks and had to have hospital 
                treatment for those injuries. Thousands more are inconvenienced 
                and disturbed by fireworks being let off in their street.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also know of the 
                effect of fireworks on domestic and wild animals. The SSPCA's 
                research shows that, last year, 8,000 animals received veterinary 
                treatment for firework-related injuries. The research also shows 
                that 100 per cent of community councils that had received complaints 
                about fireworks reported incidents of fear and anxiety in animals, 
                that 28 per cent of them reported injury of pets and that 40 per 
                cent of them reported attacks on animals.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The firework problem 
                is getting worse. Over recent years, the SSPCA has received an 
                upsurge in letter and phone complaints. It seems that 2001 was 
                a watershed, as there was a significant increase in the use and 
                abuse of fireworks last year. The traditional firework season 
                gets longer and longer and fireworks can now be bought all year 
                round.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The current legislation 
                on fireworks is not working. Fireworks are regularly sold to people 
                under 18, despite the fact that that is against the law. The voluntary 
                code of practice for the sale of fireworks is frequently ignored. 
                It is supposed to restrict the sale of fireworks to the three 
                weeks before 5 November or to other festival times. However, the 
                SSPCA today purchased three rockets called War of the Worlds&#151;12 
                June does not strike me as a particularly well-known festival 
                day, unless one is an English football fan. I heard of a firework 
                outlet that had four times the permitted amount of fireworks in 
                stock. The fireworks were removed but the shop was back in business 
                the next day because the local authority lacked the appropriate 
                powers.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The public want something 
                to be done about fireworks now, as the recent SSPCA survey confirms&#151;98 
                per cent of those asked said that they supported tighter restrictions 
                on the sale and use of fireworks. Scotland's councils also want

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What can be done? I 
                know that some people support a complete ban on fireworks, but 
                I think that that would be difficult to enforce and would lead 
                to a black market in illegal fireworks. It would be more effective 
                to encourage a more responsible use of legal fireworks with a 
                more effective range of controls over use and supply. No one wants 
                to be a party-pooper. Fireworks that are properly handled&#151;preferably 
                at an organised display&#151;can be good fun. However, I believe 
                that the Scottish Executive should, as a minimum, review the powers 
                available to local authorities in respect of vendor licensing.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That proposal is supported 
                by a number of Scotland's councils and I am pleased that it has 
                also drawn the support of the police organisations in their submission 
                to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities fireworks task 
                group. The submission calls for the tightening up of the legislation 
                governing sales, retailers, possession and premises. Specifically, 
                it states that there has to be stringent vetting of sellers to 
                ensure that those applying for a certificate are of good character. 
                It also states that more cognisance needs to be taken of previous 
                convictions for related offences by persons applying for a certificate 
                and that applicants for a certificate should be required to show 
                need before being granted a certificate. At present, there are 
                no controls over the number of retail outlets that sell fireworks 
                in an area. In Paisley, for example, there are 62 certificates 
                in force, which seems rather excessive to me.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A vendor licensing 
                scheme could do all that and could be introduced through an amendment 
                to section 44 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. If 
                we wait for Westminster to do something, we could wait for ever. 
                Time and again, private members' bills to address the problem 
                have been introduced at Westminster. Two more private members' 
                bills are scheduled to have their second readings at the end of 
                the month. However, because of their low place on the list, they 
                are unlikely to be dealt with.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I welcome the establishment 
                of the COSLA fireworks task group and I hope that, when it reports 
                in October, it will back the idea of a licensing scheme for vendors 
                and put its weight behind persuading the Scottish Executive to 
                press ahead in implementing such a scheme.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sale of fireworks 
                is covered by consumer protection legislation, which is a reserved

                of public feeling on the noise and nuisance caused by fireworks, 
                which affect all UK citizens, and I understand that discussions 
                with enforcement authorities and the industry are on-going at 
                a UK level. That is to be welcomed.</font></P>

                and assesses the nature of fireworks problems across the country. 
                The SSPCA, the fire service and the police are all participants 
                in the group. Tomorrow, a representative of the fireworks industry 
                will give a presentation to the group. As Shona Robison said, 
                the group will report back&#151;on 22 August, I believe&#151;and

                It could drive the problem underground, which would be detrimental. 
                In any case, fireworks can be bought over the internet or from 
                abroad. The question is more about keeping tighter controls.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under the British Pyrotechnists 
                Association's voluntary code, fireworks should be sold only in 
                the three weeks before 5 November. Although that code has some 
                effect, it is not working across the board. Most of the complaints 
                that I receive about fireworks concern incidents that have taken 
                place outwith November, and certainly late into the night.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I thank the SSPCA for 
                its briefing. The statistic that, in 2001, 8,000 animals required

                unacceptable. We have a duty to support all our citizens and domestic 
                and wild animals. With the best will in the world, our ability 
                to reduce firework abuse lies in our ability to control their

                birthday present. By that I mean that my father used to set them 
                off in the garden. It took me until I was about nine years old

                is indisputably getting worse. The voluntary code is simply not 
                working. Shona Robison mentioned the proposal for a licensing 
                scheme, which could ensure tighter restrictions on sales. There 
                has to be a greater restriction on what vendors can do. The idea

                Warlords, Midnight Thunders and Superblitzknall rockets. In our 
                day, we just had Catherine wheels and rockets. The new names suggest 
                the extent to which the power of fireworks has increased; as their

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Fireworks are 
                getting more powerful and are often used as weapons.&quot;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shona Robison made 
                the same point. There have been reports of telephone boxes being 
                blown up and people's windows being blasted by rockets that youngsters 
                have fired. Today, a member of the SSPCA managed to obtain three 
                such rockets, which we displayed outside the chamber. As Tricia 
                Marwick said, it is clear that the voluntary code is not working.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reports confirm that 
                the most vulnerable, particularly the elderly, are at greatest 
                risk. The cross-party animal welfare group is also concerned by 
                the effect of noise from fireworks on animals. The SSPCA survey 
                of vets indicates that, in 2001, 8,000 animals received treatment 
                because of fireworks. As Shona Robison said, 2001 seems to have 
                been a particularly bad year. Thirty-three per cent of the vets 
                who responded to the survey reported serious cases, ranging from

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no doubt that 
                there is popular support for greater regulation. A number of petitions

                Roy, but I gather that the Dundee Labour party is also drawing 
                up a petition. John McAllion may want to speak about that.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do we need to 
                do? Frank Roy suggests that we restrict the sale of fireworks

                shops and that we ensure that fireworks displays are run by licensed 
                operators. However, those are UK proposals and may take some time 
                to implement. What else can we do? The cross-party animal welfare 
                group wrote to Melanie Johnson, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary 
                of State for Competition, Consumers and Markets, to ask her whether 
                fireworks could be removed from the Explosives Act 1875. She replied:</font></P>

                the safe manufacture and storage of fireworks are health and safety 
                matters which are reserved to Westminster and are the responsibility 
                of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Even if the requirements 
                controlling these areas were to be removed from the Explosives 
                Act, any replacement regulations would remain reserved matters.&quot;</font></P>

                should control such legislation in Scotland. I do not know whether 
                I am allowed to say that, but I will say it anyway. Seventy per 
                cent of community councils have received complaints about fireworks. 
                Twenty-four per cent reported injury to humans and 20 per cent 
                reported attacks on humans. The SSPCA veterinary survey mentioned

                that are imported from Asia are a problem. HM Customs and Excise 
                have said repeatedly that there are not enough officers to control 
                and investigate traffic of such fireworks. Local authorities tend 
                to take little or no action on complaints and the police have 
                so many additional problems that they tend to downgrade problems 
                with fireworks.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sylvia Jackson mentioned 
                the Explosives Act 1875, which is totally out of date and should 
                be reviewed tomorrow or next week. To let it drag on as it has 
                done would be ridiculous. In east Renfrewshire fireworks tend 
                to start at the end of August and go on until the end of January. 
                Last year in Mike Watson's constituency of Glasgow Cathcart hooligans 
                set fire with fireworks to garages between two inhabited tenement 
                blocks. They then ambushed the fire officers by firing rockets 
                at them. It was also reported that on the same night hooligans 
                fired rockets at suburban trains. Members can imagine the possible

                and that is what many complaints are about. We need greater control. 
                I would like to hear from the minister what information we have

                the way in which shopkeepers promote fireworks in the elongated 
                period in the run-up to Guy Fawkes night. We can buy fireworks 
                for a small sum of money in comparison with what we would have 
                paid 10 or 15 years ago. We are not necessarily talking about 
                local shopkeepers, but major public limited companies that sell 
                fireworks for extreme profit. We should consider the way in which 
                they control the sale of those items.</font></P>

                ban on the sale of fireworks. We should ensure that there is maximum 
                investment in providing local displays in a controlled environment. 
                We should ensure that the companies that sell fireworks, such 
                as Asda and other major outlets, invest in local displays some 
                of the profits that they make from the sale of fireworks. Perhaps 
                they could invest in fireworks displays if we go down the road

                Pilton in west Edinburgh pursued the matter vigorously with me. 
                The group is still pursuing the matter, and Margaret Smith and 
                the local MP, John Barrett, are still trying to help it. The group

                from the top of tower blocks on to the people below and through 
                the windows of neighbouring tower blocks, causing great fear and

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Previous speakers have 
                covered the point that the issue of fireworks is mainly reserved. 
                However, we can try to take certain steps in Scotland. We should 
                also explore the possibility of a reverse Sewel motion: whether 
                there is a way in which we could co-operate with Westminster and 
                bring together in the same bill areas that are under our powers 
                and those that are under Westminster's powers.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Personally, I support 
                the proposal for much tighter regulation. It is reasonable for 
                people to have well-run local firework parties, but perhaps an 
                arrangement could be established through which they had to register 
                their party with the police or the council, simply in order to 
                say that they were having one. We need to stop the casual misuse 
                of fireworks by young people, which terrifies humans and animals.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fireworks have become 
                much noisier. In my youth, they sparkled nicely, but now there 
                are big bangs, even in the official fireworks display that is 
                held at the end of the Edinburgh international festival, during 
                which the fireworks are very loud indeed. Loud fireworks terrify 
                people and animals, whereas, on the whole, nice sparkly things 
                do not. We have to regulate the parties at which fireworks are 
                used, and we should enforce much more rigorously the regulations 
                on the sale of fireworks, as retailers should not be able to sell 
                them to young people. It should be an offence, in my view, for 
                an adult to buy fireworks in order to pass them on to young people.</font></P>

                (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Like all the previous speakers, 
                I have been lobbied hard by local groups, such as the Newhouse 
                Residents Association and the East Kilbride crime prevention panel&#151;which 
                was quite vociferous on the issue&#151;on the sale of fireworks. 
                Sale of fireworks is a big issue for individuals and groups. It 
                is not just about high spirits, misguided youngsters and incidents 
                that take place around bonfire night. Shona Robison alluded to 
                the fact that fireworks can also be used in a deliberate and sustained

                although there is a view that we should lobby Westminster for 
                such powers. We cannot wait for Westminster to act. Two private 
                member's bills are going through Westminster but, because of timing, 
                they are unlikely to come to fruition. However, we can take the 
                action that is suggested in Shona Robison's motion; we can review 
                the powers that are available to local authorities in respect 
                of vendor licensing.</font></P>

                Scottish Retail Consortium's view that the current powers of enforcement 
                are sufficient and merely require better policing. It is absolutely 
                ridiculous that a premises licence costs only &#163;12 per annum. It 
                is also ridiculous that councils cannot refuse to issue a certificate 
                and, as Shona Robison said, are generally powerless to act in 
                cases of overstocking. Overstocking can create a huge problem, 
                although this country has not experienced anything as serious 
                as what has been experienced in other countries. In Peru for example, 
                which I visited last year, special shops are set up for people 
                who make and sell fireworks that are used in a big celebration 
                in Peru. Just after I came back, one of those shops blew up. Hundreds 
                of people in down-town central Lima were killed or injured simply 
                because fireworks are totally unregulated. That is an example 
                of what can happen when things go badly wrong.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conclusion, fireworks 
                are a public safety issue, which the Parliament can address in 
                some measure. I ask the minister to consider seriously the terms 
                of Shona Robison's motion.</font></P>

                (Dundee East) (Lab): </strong>I congratulate Shona Robison on 
                securing this important debate, which I hope will make a valuable 
                contribution to the growing country-wide campaign for the introduction 
                of tighter regulation of sale and use of fireworks. That campaign 
                is run not only by groups such as the SSPCA, local authorities 
                and community councils, but by political parties throughout the

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">take the cards with 
                them to Westminster and continue their campaign down there. The 
                first of the four options was that only licensed displays of fireworks 
                would be permitted and no private sale or private use would be 
                allowed. Of the more than 600 people who responded, 84 per cent 
                went for that option. The second option, which was for tighter 
                licensing of the sale and use of fireworks, was thought to be 
                the best option by 12 per cent of the people. The third option 
                was for a public inquiry on fireworks, but only 2 per cent went 
                for that. Only 1 per cent wanted no change and opted for the status 
                quo. Although that survey looked only at a small section of the 
                population in Dundee, it gives an indication of the way that the 
                wind is blowing as regards public opinion in that city.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am not sure what 
                Paul Martin meant when he said that he was in favour of an outright 
                ban&#151;nobody has supported that. Allowing only licensed displays 
                would still allow fireworks to be used for the public's enjoyment. 
                That is important because fireworks are used not only on Guy Fawkes 
                day, but for the Chinese new year, which is celebrated by a significant 
                community in Scotland. The Chinese new year celebrations are almost 
                dependent on the use of fireworks. We cannot outlaw the enjoyment 
                that the Chinese community gets from those traditional fireworks 
                displays. Similarly, many of our councils promote fireworks displays. 
                During Dundee's octocentenary, the council organised a massive 
                fireworks display on the Tay bridge, which was very good. Edinburgh's 
                Hogmanay, which is meant to be one of the ways in which Scotland 
                sells itself, is dependent on fireworks displays. Nobody wants 
                to ban fireworks displays altogether. The question is how we control 
                fireworks displays in the future.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like Tricia Marwick&#151;although 
                I do not know how old she is&#151;I can remember the days back 
                in the 1950s, when the use and sale of fireworks was almost exclusively 
                private and personal. Families would gather round the back court 
                where there would be a small bonfire and the fireworks were always 
                used under adult supervision. If there were big civic displays 
                in those days, word of them did not get to working class areas 
                such as Springburn&#151;although they probably were not for us 
                anyway.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back in those days, 
                an important factor was that the local shops were part of the 
                local community. Our local shop was called Duncan's shop. He knew 
                everybody in the community and would not dare to sell fireworks 
                to children who were under age or were not authorised to have 
                them. Nowadays, that is not the case. As Shona Robison said, there 
                are now completely new kinds of fireworks, which shopkeepers are 
                prepared to sell illegally to under-age people. If they have stock 
                left over after Guy Fawkes day, they sell the fireworks </font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Deputy 
                Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning (Lewis 
                Macdonald): </strong>I congratulate Shona Robison on securing 
                the debate. Scottish ministers are aware of and acknowledge the 
                concerns about inappropriate use of fireworks.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of those concerns 
                are expressed in letters that we receive from members of the Scottish 
                Parliament and from members of the public. The effect on animals 
                is a recurring theme in that correspondence. Therefore, I am not 
                surprised that the SSPCA has found that most people who called 
                it about the effect on animals support tighter controls over use 
                of fireworks.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sale and supply 
                of fireworks is the core of the issue. As has been said, that 
                is a consumer protection matter and is therefore reserved to the 
                UK Government, which ensures a uniform approach throughout Great 
                Britain. Consequently, the Department of Trade and Industry receives 
                even more correspondence than we do. However, the Scottish Executive 
                still plays a role.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members are aware that 
                the last comprehensive review of controls on fireworks by central 
                Government was undertaken in 1996. It concluded that a total ban 
                on fireworks for private use would be unworkable and that it would 
                lead to a black market in fireworks and to uncontrolled production 
                and sale of home-made devices, which might be more dangerous than 
                some of those that have been described today.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We all recognise the 
                role of fireworks in family and cultural celebrations. I understand 
                Paul Martin's view and it is worth re-emphasising that all fireworks 
                must comply with BS 71124. Part 2 of that standard was updated 
                in 1998 to acknowledge some of the changes in the market. The 
                introduction of the Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997 aimed 
                to improve the safety of fireworks that are supplied to the public, 
                and to reduce and control the levels of disturbance and noise. 
                Since 1997, there have been new controls on the kinds of large 
                and powerful fireworks that can be sold to the general public 
                and there has been a prohibition on the sale of all fireworks 
                above a small size to anyone under the age of 18. Where there

                The supply to the general public of any large fireworks, such 
                as aerial shells and maroons, should be reported.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A number of other pieces 
                of legislation&#151;including Scottish legislation&#151;are relevant. 
                Section 1 of the Protection of Animals (Scotland) Act 1912 makes 
                it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to any domestic or 
                captive animal. It has been mentioned that several thousand animals 
                have suffered; it is clear that they would be covered by that 
                legislation. The penalty on conviction of such an offence is a 
                fine of up to &#163;5,000, imprisonment for up to six months, or both. 
                Enforcement of that section rests with trading standards officers, 
                the police and the SSPCA.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>John Young:</strong> 
                Has the minister received any information from trading standards 
                officers on anyone's being convicted and receiving the maximum 
                penalty of &#163;5,000?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> 
                That is a very good question. I will investigate the conviction 
                rate and write to Mr Young with the information. The point is 
                that the opportunity for enforcement exists. In our view, it should 
                be used.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Environmental Protection 
                Act 1990 provides measures that can be taken to deal with the 
                disturbance that is caused by noise. Environmental health officers 
                should judge whether enforcement action is necessary. The Explosives 
                Act 1875 has been referred to as governing legislation. Again, 
                fines of up to &#163;5,000 can be imposed on people who let off fireworks 
                in a public place.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> 
                I have listened to the minister's list of potential penalties 
                but, in reality, nobody has been convicted or fined. It is all 
                very well to say that environmental health officers are responsible 
                for dealing with noise, but the bombs go off, the people who are 
                responsible disappear and there is no way that the legislation 
                can be enforced.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> 
                I acknowledge the difficulties of enforcement, but it is important 
                that the powers that exist be used. This debate gives us the opportunity 
                to encourage those who are responsible for enforcing the legislation 
                to use their powers.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me move on to discuss 
                areas of change. It is important to note that under the Explosives 
                Act 1875, retailers must be registered with local authorities 
                in order to store fireworks. As Shona Robison and others said, 
                there is no current requirement that those retailers should be 
                of good character in order to be registered. The Health and Safety 
                Executive has reviewed the application of the 1875 act in that 
                regard. One suggestion is the introduction of a requirement that

                closed only a few days ago. I hope that Scottish councils will 
                have taken the opportunity to make their views known in response 
                to that.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a voluntary 
                code and several speakers have mentioned the fact that the code 
                is not observed to the degree that we all wish. The DTI has asked 
                the industry to examine levels of compliance and the overall effectiveness 
                of the agreement. We support that approach.</font></P>

                </strong>The minister referred to the role of local authorities. 
                The view of Fife Council on the operation of firework regulation 
                is that the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, which is currently 
                under review, allows licensing arrangements to be introduced for 
                certain activities. Fife Council's view is that that act could 
                be amended to address the specific issue in Scotland and that 
                a ban on the sale of fireworks, except for licensed or organised 
                displays, might be possible under the legislation. Will the minister 
                comment on that?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis Macdonald:

                of air bombs as soon as stocks are used up. I hope that air bombs 
                will no longer be available for public sale or be used by the 
                end of the year. More must be done and that is the message that

                to address the remaining problems. There are a significant number 
                of legislative areas and policies that impact on the sale and 
                use of fireworks. We need to consider what can be done to improve 
                their enforcement and effectiveness. There is a mixture of reserved 
                and devolved measures and local authority trading standards and 
                environmental health officers already have a range of powers at 
                their disposal, as do the police. We need to consider what better

                include fireworks. However, section 44 of the act provides ministers
