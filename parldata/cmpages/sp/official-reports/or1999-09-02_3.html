that the process will not end with the production of that document. To
be of any use, the strategy will need to be revisited regularly and updated
when necessary.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It may be helpful if I take this opportunity
to outline those areas on which we wish to focus particular attention.
As I have said, the process is to be as inclusive and far-reaching as possible.
We will certainly look at what have traditionally been considered to be
the arts. We will also want to look at architecture, the built heritage,
education, social inclusion, creative industries and the links that can
be built up between those different areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In all that, our duty is to sustain quality
and achievement and to ensure that everyone who wishes to participate in
the arts is able to do so. Accessibility in the widest possible sense is
the key to any future strategy. We want to ensure that those people who
wish to participate in the arts in any way have an opportunity to do so
and do not feel excluded.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have a great wealth in our museums,
galleries, libraries and built heritage. We have a rich and diverse built
heritage of ancient monuments, archaeological sites, landscapes, historic
buildings and townscapes, all of which provide an important, enriching,
authentic and tangible record of the peoples of Scotland. The built heritage
provides a sense of place and community throughout Scotland, in both urban
and rural areas. It makes a major contribution to the sense of national
identity that we all possess. Indeed, many of our cultural institutions
are located in buildings of historical or architectural distinction.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our stock of castles, great houses, abbeys
and historic towns and villages is one of the principal reasons why tourists
come to Scotland. There is thus a major economic as well as an intrinsic
cultural value to our built heritage. There are also strong arguments,
rooted in the principle of sustainability, for the retention and, where
appropriate, reuse of our historic buildings.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must strive for excellence in our new
buildings, because they will be our monuments to future generations-our
young people must be proud of them in times to come. That is why we made
a commitment in the "Partnership for Scotland" agreement to develop a first-ever
national policy on architecture for Scotland. Since we made that commitment,
we have been preparing a framework document as the first step in the development
of such a policy. The document will be published on 20 September and will
set out the Government's views on the benefits of good architecture. It
will also describe the potential role of Government in the promotion of
policy and outline a framework for action. The&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">purpose of the
document will be to raise awareness of the importance of good building
design and to stimulate debate on the many issues that are involved in
the making of good architecture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scotland is a nation at the cutting edge
of technology, which, too, has links with culture. The value of the creative
economy to Scotland is estimated at &pound;5.3 billion and 91,000 jobs.
However, there is potential for further growth and I am confident that
the national cultural strategy can assist in further developing employment
in the sector.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The market for culture is highly competitive
and we must consider ways in which Scotland can promote and market its
culture. We must use the opportunities that are offered by new technology,
such as the internet and CD-ROMs, and by software design and development
to raise the international awareness of our intellectual and cultural products.
The Scottish cultural resources network, which I opened a few years ago,
is a wonderful example of what can be achieved in that area.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are an old and proud nation with an
opportunity to build a new and even greater future. We should put in place
a sound framework for the future of our culture. The consultation process
that we are engaged in is the first step in designing a national strategy
for the future development of Scotland's culture. We are giving all Scotland's
people a chance to participate. We need to do that, and we need to do it
now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I move,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That the Parliament agrees that culture,
in all its diversity, has a central role in shaping a sense of community
and civic pride in the new Scotland, and a contribution to make to its
prosperity, health and cohesion; welcomes the Executive's proposals to
develop a national cultural strategy for all of Scotland's people, and
endorses the far-reaching consultation process on which Scottish Ministers
have embarked.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Michael Russell to open for the Scottish National party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome this debate. The opportunity
to discuss cultural matters is an example of why there should be an effective
Parliament in Scotland. I have never been a member of the Westminster Parliament
but, as I am sure the minister will confirm, the discussion of Scottish
culture could never be central to the work of Westminster-that is not a
criticism-although it can be central to our work.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I give a broad
welcome to the Government's proposal, as culture is a subject on which
there could be bipartisan support. I hope that that will develop. However,
I am critical of this motion and lodged an amendment, which, unfortunately,
was not called for debate. One of the difficulties I found in trying to
amend the motion was its anodyne nature. Another difficulty was the reference-buried
in the middle-to the national cultural strategy. There are many areas of
cultural policy in which the Scottish National party would want to work
with the Administration, but the national cultural strategy presents difficulties,
on which I will concentrate today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Government's document is stylistically
attractive but, as we will discover during this debate, lacking in substance.
It opens with a quotation from the partnership agreement document, which
the Government seems to believe is a work of art-it is certainly a work
of fiction. It says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We believe that arts and culture have
a central role in shaping a sense of community and civic pride in the new
Scotland."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">None of us would have any difficulty in
endorsing that. We believe that arts and culture are central to our lives.
Another quotation in this document, however, is even more accurate. It
is from A L Kennedy, speaking in the Poets' Parliament. She says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I think Scottish writing has contributed
to the moves that set up a Scottish parliament, but it did that by being
non-aligned and anarchic and critical and all the things it is and I hope
will remain".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The important nature of cultural activity
of all sorts is that it should be anarchic, critical, non-aligned and exciting.
Anybody who has been in Edinburgh in recent weeks will have found that
even this douce city, which can be grey in the heart of winter, has its
existence touched, transformed, shaken and enlightened by the intense application
of the arts-even if some weeks ago the First Minister called some of the
performances "fair hellish".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is an enormous range of activity
apart from the festival: the fringe, the television festival, the film
festival, the book festival and a range of other activities. An early step
that the minister might take would be to persuade the festival authorities
that it is fundamentally daft to have a festival continuing without a fringe
and that the festival period should be intensified, not diluted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Creativity and culture should touch our
national life. It should touch everyone because everyone can be transformed,
shaken, enlightened and excited by creativity and everyone is creative.
The real question in a cultural policy, therefore-and I do not want to
talk about strategy-is what a Government can do to make that happen. What

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the Government's
proper role? Its proper role is to encourage and support excellence, diversity,
creativity and inclusion-those are all things that a Government must aim
for. How is that to be done? It is to be done by consultation, discussion
and financial support.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The question we have to ask of this strategy
is: will it achieve its aims? I have to say that-at the moment, with the
jury out-I, like many people, have severe doubts. The strategy is off to
a bad start, because the right way of starting the search for the answer
to those questions would have been to consult the other parties in the
Parliament before the document was published.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For example, I am worried about the composition
of the focus group-and about focus groups in the arts. I am sure that many
of the people are well qualified, but the group does not seem to be particularly
inclusive. If there had been an attempt to consult the other parties, we
might have agreed on how we could contribute to the process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So here is the document, fully formed.
Indeed, the document is almost ironic, because although it contains Scottish
Office prose, it also contains the most wonderful pearls-not written by
the Scottish Office, of course. One of those pearls is this superb quote
from Hugh MacDiarmid:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"He canna Scotland see wha yet</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Canna see the Infinite".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is not the slightest sign of the
infinite in this document-it is all far too definite already. We have to
have a strategy to get a strategy. The strategy should be to discuss how
the Government takes a proper role in the arts, and that is not being done.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many issues are not even mentioned in the
document. There is hardly any reference to education, language and local
input, and only one word on broadcasting. I can imagine the embarrassment
of the Administration and why it may want to avoid talking about broadcasting.
The BBC regards itself as one of the biggest, most important cultural organisations
in Scotland-it cannot be excluded. Broadcasting has to be included.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is nothing on sport, strangely enough.
Many people would argue that to treat sport as a separate subject is daft.
Sport is one of the biggest influences on our lives. We should not be dividing
those influences; we should be looking at being inclusive as we go forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The worst thing about this document is
that, by its very existence, a national cultural strategy will exclude
people-it is a sort of five-year plan for the arts. We need an approach
that includes people. Before we go ahead, I would like some&nbsp;</font></td>

to that problem.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive will come up with a plan
next year, and no doubt there will be many words about consultation. No
doubt the Executive will tell us that people are responding only when the
consultation periods are over, and things of that nature. The reality is
that the strategy is going to exclude people. It is also going to use a
methodology that says nothing about anarchy and the need to have diversity
of opinion. Unfortunately, it is going to be a new Labour approach to cultural
strategy, and that is the last thing that Scotland needs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are many good things happening in
Scotland across the spectrum of culture, the arts and the built heritage.
I have called for a review of the Scottish Arts Council-which Sam Galbraith
has refused-not because I do not think that good things are happening in
the Arts Council. Many good things are happening: crafts, traditional music
and excellence in support for publishing. There is a wonderful new scheme
for novels. Books such as "The Voice of the Bard", by Tim Neat with Dr
John MacInnes-I have a copy here-were published in the past few days with
the support of the Arts Council. There are excellent things happening,
but the structure puts people off applying and is unnecessarily bureaucratic.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scottish Screen is doing great work. Its
presentation to the Education, Culture and Sport Committee last week was
excellent. Many artists are achieving things in Scotland. We want to find
a proper way of supporting them, opening what they do to others and infecting
others with a sense of creative purpose. We do not want to define a national
strategy that can be set on a shelf and which-by definition-will exclude.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome this debate because there is
a way forward. The way forward would have been to have had a proper consultation
before the document was published. Although that has not been done, there
is still time for the Executive to consult the other parties to establish
whether we can come to a common mind on encouraging Scottish culture. Would
that not be a great achievement? We could encourage people to be touched,
opened up and changed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is certainly the purpose of the Scottish
Parliament-no matter whether it is devolved or, as I hope it will be, independent.
Change in Scotland can be achieved to give people new life and new hope
but, reading this document, I fear terribly that that is not the direction
in which we are going. We are closing things down and that is not what
should happen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

warmth and life in this document, I would be more confident that the strategy
on which the Executive has set out will be successful. The Executive does
not have to rush ahead; it could stop and think again. If it rushes ahead
now, it will not produce the laughter, warmth and life that Scotland can

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On first impressions, there seems little
with which to disagree in the Scottish Executive's motion. To paraphrase
Ben Wallace's words yesterday, I am in favour of culture. It is understandable
that the Scottish Executive should seek to have a strategy for culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, the motion contains a fundamental
flaw in that it appears to have been drafted on the premise that culture
is a finite entity and a commodity that can be planned, shaped and organised
by the Government. That might not be the intention of the motion; we will
wait to find out what happens when the cultural strategy is published.
Culture is the product of our nation's artistic, political and economic
history, and of the spontaneous and independent contributions of talented
individuals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As that august Scottish historian, Michael
Fry, said, culture is not something conjured up by an official statement

will keep it alive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The role of the Scottish Executive should
be to preserve and promote our historical record and artistic achievements,
and to foster an open society in which new contributions can be made without
requiring political endorsement. A cultural strategy might be required
by the Government, but only in the same way as the best incomes policy
is no incomes policy. The Government should try to encourage excellence,
to nurture and enable, but it should do so at arm's length. It should not
seek to create or endorse culture so that it becomes official.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The last decades of old Scotland before
the union of crowns in 1603 lent an enduring shape to national culture.
John Knox's cultural revolution, which is known to us as the reformation,
stressed that people should be taught to read the bible for themselves.
That generated a literate population, which was better educated than any
other in Europe and gave Scots a fascination with the problems of good
and evil-with the dual nature of man. It produced a highly intellectual-not
elitist-culture: a democratic intellect that is still alive in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. That culture was truly popular; it took deep root and flourishes
to this day.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The strength of our culture then was proved
by the fact that it did not need a state to support it. It was not a disaster
when the king and his court, who had been the main sponsors of artistic
works, moved to London in 1603, nor was our culture damaged when Scotland
entered into union with England in 1707-quite the reverse. In 1707 the
greatest days of Scottish culture lay in the future. As the lives of ordinary
Scots were enriched by the union and the empire, so was their culture enriched.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scottish culture has never been dictated
by an elite or by the policy of the state, nor should it be. Scottish culture
has always been what the Scottish people say it will be. If Scottish culture
is to remain true to its traditions, we should continue to keep the state
at arm's length.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Politicians and bureaucrats can foretell
the future of our culture no more than they can predict anything else.
The present flourishing condition of the Scottish novel, theatre and films
owes nothing to political interference. Politicians in Scotland have more
often tried to ban artistic innovation than to encourage it, and I know
that some members of the Conservative party have tried to do that, too.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>Indeed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>Yes, indeed. Such conformity

strategy could lead to a concept of official art, as happened in the defunct
Soviet Union. Continual debate about our culture, something that was impossible
in the east European soviet states, is what is required. To borrow from
Trotsky, culture is permanent revolution.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should debate the poor understanding
of Scottish and British history by today's schoolchildren. It is a sad
fact that many children do not know who Robert the Bruce was, or indeed
David Livingstone, and that they know of William Wallace only through a
Hollywood version of the truth.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should debate the concept of excellence,
as John Tusa did during the international festival of the arts, but I notice
that excellence is not mentioned in the cultural strategy document.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should also debate the need for a national
theatre. Although I notice that Kenny Gibson is not here, I mention for
his benefit that I have worked for the Royal Lyceum Theatre Company and
for the Tron Theatre.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have national companies for dance, for
opera and for music, but we have no national theatre. Our regional theatres
manage very well on significantly less funding than is available to theatre
companies in Nottingham, Leeds, Sheffield and other English cities. Indeed,
it could be argued that regional producing theatres in Scotland would be
better to seek funds from an English arts council. A national Scottish
theatre company, created as an addition to our existing producing companies,
would showcase our finest talents and provide a vital export when touring
abroad.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have no doubt that many members enjoyed
some theatre during the international festival of the arts. How many of
them realised that the actors, many of them well-known names, in official
productions such as "The Speculator", were earning about &pound;5 an hour?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The talent is here but the money is not,
and that is why many actors gravitate towards London. A national theatre
could help to change that. It would encourage excellence and have many
positive spin-offs, not least for our infant film industry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Debate is necessary, as are clear guidelines
for how the Government and its agencies will work in the cultural field.
We will support a cultural strategy that preserves and promotes our historical
past and encourages debate about the future. However, the Government can
no more pick winners than it can put the Bay City Rollers back at the top
of the charts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

way in which Parliament should handle culture. Many people argued for the
appointment of a minister for culture and for a national cultural strategy.
I am pleased that the Parliament is making progress. It has delivered a
minister for culture and is now undertaking a consultation exercise on
a cultural strategy. I stress that we are still at the consultation stage,
and have not yet defined the strategy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Culture is much misunderstood. The word
is frequently used as an alternative for the arts and it is often thought
of as a minority interest of the urban middle classes. In fact, when she
heard that there was to be a debate on culture, one member-who is not here
now-said that she was not interested in culture. That is unfortunate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The proposed nationwide consultation on
a national cultural strategy gives us an opportunity to emphasise that
culture is much more than a minority interest.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Everyone has some form of exposure to culture,
at very least the culture of their own community and its history. Culture
interprets and illuminates a community's experiences; at a national level,
it expresses Scotland's history and environment. Indeed, it has often been
asserted that the Scottish cultural identity played a major part in bringing
about the conditions that created the Scottish Parliament. At the moment,
some members of the press might think that that is a bad thing, but I think
that culture played an important part in bringing our Parliament about.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Edinburgh international festival. The play is along the lines of "The Steamie"
and is about the experiences of women working as darners in the town's
textile industry in the 1950s. Apart from being a very funny and excellent
performance by ordinary, local people-by talented people who sing and act
as amateurs and who enjoy it-it demonstrated for me two important aspects
of culture. First, it enabled members of the community to celebrate their
own culture-their traditions and history. Secondly, it allowed me, as an
outsider, to experience and understand better the experiences of that community.
Those are two important facets of culture. That is why promoting and widening
access to culture is so important.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Engaging in cultural activity helps us
to understand each other and ourselves better. It improves our self-esteem
and our tolerance and appreciation of the different cultures of others.
That is why cultural activity must be part of the strategic objectives
of the Parliament; the minister mentioned its connection with health, lifelong
learning, social inclusion, tourism and enterprise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive is to be congratulated on
starting the consultation process so early in the life of the Parliament.
A few weeks ago I was very pleased to hear on the radio the minister for
culture giving her commitment that the consultation process would be thorough
and extensive and would stretch all the way from Ullapool to Dumfries.
I know that people in Dumfries are already looking forward to engaging
in that consultation process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scotland has many traditions, cultures
and participants. The national agencies, local authorities-which are extremely
important in the cultural scene-and the voluntary sector all play important
roles in the provision of cultural opportunity. Scotland's culture is one
of our greatest assets in attracting visitors, but it is much more than
that: valuing and understanding our culture in all its diversity allows
us to understand where we come from. Once we have done that, culture might
also help us to determine where we wish to go.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

response to the recommendation with a plan of action that is properly resourced.
That is essential. It is crucial that running through the strategy is a
thread that recognises the importance of allowing Scottish culture to develop
as opposed to dictating that development.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many people outwith the Parliament are
sceptical about the document. Last night, I spoke to my colleague, Sandy
Stronach, who is a great champion of Doric in the north-east of Scotland
and who helps to organise the Doric festival, which is coming up in a short
time. He looked at the document and said that he thought that, as usual,
more effort had gone into the design than into its content.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is no wonder that people such as Sandy
Stronach are so sceptical when they see the membership of the focus group.
"Representative" was not the word that Sandy used to describe it. That
is no wonder when we consider the diverse cultural traditions throughout
Scotland and then consider the focus group.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the centre of any approach to Scottish
culture must be a recognition of the unquantifiable contribution of many
thousands of groups and agencies around the country. They are the people
in the front line, the people who develop Scottish culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The document is called "Celebrating Scotland".
In celebrating Scotland, we have to remember to celebrate the whole of
Scotland. We need a bottom-up process, not a top-down process. That means
channelling support and funding to the many groups around the country,
and that is where we can help to develop Scottish culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the document, I would like to have seen
more recognition of the role of local authorities. Local authorities are
usually left to pick up the tab to help organisations that are trying to
develop Scottish culture by teaching all of us about it and by involving
us in it. The local authorities are strapped for cash and, in turn, many
of the groups that they help to fund are strapped for cash. We must remember
that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Local authorities and agencies create many
diverse cultural initiatives. The recent opening of Dundee Contemporary
Arts-a world-class and award-winning facility-is an example of the achievement
of a local objective. Yet only 65 miles up the road, in the city of Aberdeen,
we see the Aberdeen Arts Centre going round cap in hand to oil companies
and local businesses, trying to get cash to survive. That arts centre is
an important facility and venue in Aberdeen, and it is important that central
Government should step in to help such organisations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

agencies play a key role is in film production. Over&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">recent years we
have seen a complete lack of support from successive Governments for Scotland's
film-producing community. As a result, many local authorities and agencies
have stepped in to fill the gap, creating, for example, film commissions.
Much of Scotland now has such commissions; there are especially successful
ones in Glasgow, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Islands, as well as two
or three in other areas. New film initiatives are being developed in, for
example, Tayside and Lanarkshire. Central Government has played absolutely
no role in achieving those ends. Scottish Screen has assisted but it has
been unable to give any direct financial assistance because it is strapped
for cash as well. That is where central Government could come into play.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The film commissions provide training for
script-writers, film-makers and so on, but they also provide an economic
benefit for the local communities, which can promote themselves as film
locations. In "Mission: Impossible"-and I am talking about the film starring
Tom Cruise, not the Labour candidate's task in the Hamilton South by-election-the
scene on top of the train was filmed in Dumfriesshire. Two weeks' shooting
put &pound;100,000 into the local economy, and that came about because
of the local film initiative. That is the way in which central Government
can step in and help local authorities and agencies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important that the message from the
new Scottish Executive is not the message that we were getting from Downing
Street in previous years. Its cultural icons are things such as the millennium
dome. Hundreds of millions of pounds could have gone into sustaining many
of our local cultural organisations instead of London's dome. I welcome
the opportunity today perhaps to hear the minister condemn the millennium
dome and say that the Executive will put money into Scottish organisations
from now on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the art but, as they say, "Masel, ah cannae actually draw." I remember
when I was at school, painting what I thought was a wonderful picture of
a storm at sea, and the teacher coming up to me and saying that he was
going to distemper his living room at the weekend and perhaps it would

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to talk
about what I see as the link between the cultural strategy and the social
inclusion agenda. I can think of the women from Easterhouse who write poetry
about what it is like to live there, to be unemployed and to suffer poverty
and ill health. Their efforts are partly funded by City of Glasgow Council.
When we read poems written by drug addicts, recovering addicts and their
families, we feel what they are going through. I can think of a project
funded by Inverclyde Council, for teenagers who are referred by the courts
because they are first offenders. They write, produce and act in plays
that address local issues such as drugs, unemployment and domestic violence.
Those enthusiastic and talented young people are supported by their families
and by their peer group, who turn up, applaud and shout with great gusto
when they see their pals on the stage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This morning, we debated the changes in
the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. I worked for a long time in a psychiatric
unit, where the patients were encouraged to write, draw and act whenever
possible. It was a moving experience to read poetry written by patients
who were trying to gain an insight into the horrors and agonies of being
mentally ill. We must encourage the gamut of arts in schools and local
communities. There is a wealth of talent out there, which lies mostly untapped.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the minister said, the cultural strategy
should be for everyone. We should not only encourage community talent in
continuing such events as the successful Edinburgh fringe festival, but
encourage people to support community arts. The cultural strategy for Scotland
is not only about national galleries, large productions and shows; it is
about giving local people and communities the opportunity to express their
feelings and aspirations through the arts. I was delighted to hear the
minister's commitment to social inclusion in the strategy. That is important,
because that is what the issue is about.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of the film industry to Scotland. As a vital part of our culture, that
industry has tremendous potential to shape the country's economic and social
development. Films such as "Braveheart", "Rob Roy" and "Loch Ness" have
given a boost to tourism in Scotland, while other films such as "Chariots

were important in giving expression to Scotland's&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some of Scotland's film-makers have also
received recognition for outstanding films such as "Mrs Brown", "Shallow
Grave", "Trainspotting", "My Name Is Joe" and "Ratcatcher", which recently
won a prize at the Edinburgh film festival. Edinburgh now hosts film premieres
that might previously have gone elsewhere. Furthermore, the recent promotion
of "Gregory's Two Girls" by the charismatic Bill Forsyth gives further
evidence of the imagination and the undoubted creativity in the Scottish
film industry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Just now, the film and television industry
employs 4,000 people in Scotland and the national lottery's support for
film-making and the creation of Channel 4's office in Glasgow should lead
to more job opportunities. The activities of Scottish Screen, which was
set up by the previous Administration, play a huge role and now cover the
whole range of film and television culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is essential to enhance the visual arts
to give greater stature to Scotland's culture. Scotland has the capacity
to play a leading role in the film industry and commitment from ministers
will make that a reality. As the Minister for Finance is providing &pound;80
million extra for education, I ask ministers to use part of that funding
to increase Scottish Screen's grant, which would enable that organisation
not just to produce an innovative development programme, but to assist
with educational projects.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will-if I may-reveal a secret of the
past. During the previous Westminster Government, one of the women engaged
in providing hospitality in Bute House took it very much in her stride
when she had to welcome former Presidents Gorbachev and Mitterrand, but
when she heard that Mel Gibson of "Braveheart" might be coming, there was
almost uncontrollable excitement. I suspect that that might have been the
representative reaction of many Scots. Not only do films made in Scotland
create employment, encourage tourism and provide recreation, enjoyment
and entertainment, they give a higher profile to Scotland's way of life.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I call on ministers to give Scottish Screen
and the Scottish film industry all their support, which it strongly deserves.
It is an excellent opportunity for our country to grasp and I hope that

document is a celebration and an appreciative comment on Scottish culture.
It is a kind of mission statement and it has a mission statement's strengths
and weaknesses. It lays out positive aspirations for a national strategy
and sets out a basis for consultation. This is a consultation document,
although the title may suggest that it is the strategy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would like to give Ms Brankin and Mr
Galbraith one piece of advice. Someone said that this was a closed document,
but I think that it is almost too open-ended and might be difficult to
respond to. I remember that when the McIntosh commission sought people's
opinions it asked questions. I understand this document, but I do not quite
know what I am being asked and think that a framework of questions would
help.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The place of government in the arts is
something that we must be careful of. It should be at arms' length. Its
place is not to direct the arts, but to create a climate in which the arts
can flourish and artists can put down roots.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We want to ensure that the strategy is
inclusive. It needs to be geographically inclusive, covering the Borders
to the Highlands and the Shetland islands. It must embrace the widest possible
range of cultural activities. In scale, it should encompass great orchestras,
town bands, ballet dancing and line dancing. The strategy must not be elitist,
but it must protect minority interests as, in essence, many of the arts
will appeal only to minority interests and a majority decision might swamp
good quality things.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should not be talking only of high culture.
As Trish Godman said, the strategy must be socially inclusive. As she spoke,
I thought of an occasion about a fortnight ago when I went to Galashiels
to launch the publication of a book, "New Horizons", by a mental health
charity. It contained touching and moving poetry. Life-enhancing art was
put into the book with good backing and something was produced which raised
the self-confidence and self-esteem of people who needed that help.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How do we foster talent when we find it?
I do not know the answer to that and am only saying that it is a question
to consider. When we get a talented musician or actress, we must try to
ensure that a promising career is not cut off because of lack of funds
or opportunity. We should give them the opportunity to foster their talent
in Scotland in order for them to be able to practise it beyond, if that
is what they wish.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The national strategy should start in schools
and village halls and reach up to national institutions, such as the National
Library and Scottish Ballet. I hope, like Brian Montieth, that a national

I come from a local authority background and I am proud of the way in which

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>The one issue that slightly concerns me about this debate is that there
has been little or no discussion about practitioners of the arts or artists.
There has been an awful lot of talk about meaningful, to-be-desired initiatives
and consultations, yet no mention of the Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph
and Theatre Union, Equity, the Musicians' Union or of our individual artists.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For nine years, I was an elected official
of Equity and during those years-which were principally years of Conservative
Governments, although there was one period of a real Labour Government
in early 1979-we never had an opportunity to develop our cultural strategy.
The Scottish committee of Equity was determined that there should be such
a strategy for Scotland, which would be committed to the development of
the three national performing arts companies-ballet, opera and the national
theatre.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will give members a few bits of background
information about the people we are talking about but paying no attention
to. The average earnings of an artistic worker in Scotland in any year
is &pound;8,500 and most are unemployed for 22 weeks in any year. All artistic
workers have extreme difficulties with the Inland Revenue and the Benefits
Agency. I make a plea to the Executive: that it addresses the issues of
our artists and the artistic community on the reserved areas of benefits,
income tax and other taxation matters. The Executive should take a leaf
out of the Irish book, as Ireland has been extremely successful over the
past 20 to 30 years.</font></td>

make up 5 per cent of this country's industry. I am perplexed Sam's figure
of 91,000 full-time jobs as, according to Scottish Enterprise's creative
industry team, in July 1999 there were 70,000 full-time jobs. I assume
that the team has not conducted a new study since then. There were only
64,310 jobs in food and drink; and there used to be 41,000 in textiles-until

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The arts are vital to this country and,
more important, people employed in the arts live and work in Scotland,
although we do not give them the opportunity to work as often as they wish.
For example, in 1997 131 contracts were issued to members of Equity, of
whom there are just over 1,600 in Scotland, by Scottish producing companies,
repertory theatres and touring companies. In 1998, 213 contracts were issued.
This morning, I was told that Equity expects around about the same figure
for this year, because the Scottish Arts Council, under its current regime,
spends an enormous amount of money on consultation, management and bureaucracy,
but little or nothing on the production of theatre works.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I shall quote from this year's annual report

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"too many companies are cutting back on
the number and size of productions. Although there seems to be plenty of
lottery money to improve buildings and facilities, there is standstill
or less money to run these companies, and the first things to be cut seem
to be productions and actors' wages."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The report goes on to say:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

My interests in this debate are registered in the proper place.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I compliment Mike Russell on the excellent
and eloquent way in which he expressed his concerns. There is an art form
that is capable of touching and transforming and enlightening us. It is
anarchic and critical and non-aligned. I am, of course, talking about theatre,
but in particular about travelling theatre companies, which bridge the
gap between professional theatre and the community that Elaine Murray mentioned.
Travelling theatre takes professional acting into the community.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Lloyd Quinan pointed out, the total
number of actors employed in Scotland has fallen by 50 per cent during
the past two years-since the Labour Government was elected. How has it
happened? How is the problem addressed by the document that is before us?
There has been a positive efflorescence of administrative posts in the
publicly subsidised sector. I refute what Brian Monteith said when he suggested
that the arts do not need subsidising. He seemed to be giving a historical
perspective to show that the arts survived without subsidy in the past.
That is completely incorrect. We would not have much of the music and much
of the theatre that we have today-our Mozart and our Beethoven-without
the private and public subsidies available in previous centuries.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am not convinced of the wisdom of going
all-out for a national theatre now. I am speaking for a more diverse form
of theatrical excellence in Scotland. I plead with the Executive and with
all those involved in this debate to support all kinds of theatre in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">festival that has
taken place in Scotland since Glasgow became the European city of culture
in 1990. I am delighted, having had that experience of working closely
with architects, designers and the community to mount that festival, that
for the first time it is envisaged that there will be an architectural
strategy for Scotland, as part of a broader cultural strategy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Architecture is crucial to the regeneration
process of a city such as Glasgow and its surrounding area. The city's
architecture and its regeneration fit together. What can be achieved by
bringing them together can affect tourism and housing, can support the
economy, and can upgrade and secure the environment. Architecture has a
series of clear and concrete payoffs. Above all, architecture stands at
the intersection between people and their daily lives, and the key artefacts
of living. By looking at architecture and design in a new way we can make
substantial changes in the way in which people see themselves and their
past, and in which they look to their future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scotland in general, but Glasgow in particular,
has a unique architectural heritage. Its tremendous Victorian buildings
are superb, and unrivalled anywhere else in the world. Glasgow also has
a vibrant present. The Crown Street regeneration project, and the architectural
expo of homes for the future which Glasgow 1999 is putting on, are transforming
historically disadvantaged and run-down parts of the city. That is helping
us to create a glorious future for Glasgow. The inner city must be made
more attractive if people are to be drawn back into it. One of the keystones
that I would like to see emerging from this strategy as far as architecture
is concerned, and culture more generally, is that it should build on existing
achievements. There are many things in Scotland that we do tremendously
well. Let us build on these and reinforce them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One thing in the 1999 programme that I
am particularly delighted about is the level of community participation,
which has been central. It was a key part of the bid and is one of the
key reasons why Glasgow won the accolade of city of architecture and design.
It has also been a key element of the delivery: &pound;500,000 has been
spent on local, community-based projects; four major community festivals
are being run in Glasgow; five major projects have upgraded urban spaces
in disadvantaged areas. There will also be a conference on dementia and
design at the beginning of October, focusing on the particular needs of
that disadvantaged group in society. One of the things that has been crucial
to the festival is a strong educational programme, which will influence
the curriculum of every primary school in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

huge sign on the gasometer. It is, I think, a beautiful sign-it is very
well done. It depicts the gallus nature of Glasgow. If we look on the other

That is also an emblem for Glasgow, for what can be done to recreate and
reincarnate disadvantaged parts of the city.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The festival has been a celebration of
architecture and design. One tremendously exciting thing about it has been
the degree of attention that we have had from people elsewhere in the United
Kingdom, Europe and around the world. People have come to Glasgow and seen
it in a different way. They have seen its existing architecture and the
tremendous exhibitions which we have brought to Glasgow. They have seen
the process that we are engaged in of transforming Glasgow and leading
it into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. More than 500,000 visitors have come
to the exhibitions; the hotels are full and hoteliers are falling over
themselves to build new hotels; the Glasgow collection has helped 58 designers
and 35 manufacturers, who have won 15 awards in the process, offering hope
for the future of Glasgow's economy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The key achievement of 1999 has been the
Lighthouse, where Rhona Brankin will launch the Executive's architectural
strategy later this month. I hope the consultation process that follows
the "Celebrating Scotland" document will involve more than practitioners:
it must involve them, but must also involve the users of architecture and
design, as the users of other forms of culture are involved.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Above all, we need to involve people in
their own communities taking control of their own lives. Culture, architecture
and design must be a component of that. Let us get away from the idea of
culture and architecture being done by somebody else-by professionals in
a glass or concrete box. Let people be involved and dictate what they want,
and we will carry forward the cultural strategy for Scotland successfully,

It is the way in which we live our lives in our communities, and the traditions
and activities that underpin those communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As we are all giving examples from our
diaries, I will let members into what I was doing on Saturday. I attended
an agricultural show in Moffat, in Dumfriesshire, where local people were
displaying their sheep, cattle, horses and hens. A home industry section
displayed baking, knitting and home painting-not the politically correct
items that are often trotted out these days. There was also the usual home
craftwork.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The level of support at that event, and
at shows across Scotland this summer, is a great tribute to people in farming
communities. The number of entries have generally been up and the standard
has never been higher, despite the appalling crisis which people face in
the sheep and dairy industries.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This weekend, there is another show in
the tiny village of Bentpath, in Eskdale, where people will come from miles
around for terrier racing and fell running, although I will be participating
in neither. Smaller shows are happening in one-room village halls throughout
Scotland, yet no real reference is made to them in this document. Nevertheless,
that is the culture of Scotland that I recognise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the document, Hugh MacDiarmid is quoted-a
famous Langholm man, and Dr Murray has already alluded to Langholm. We
must recognise that in the town of Langholm the most important cultural
event is the annual common riding. That is the case in many border communities.
The medium that carries culture throughout Scotland's diverse communities
is not always-unfortunately for Michael Fry-<i>The Herald</i>. It is much
more likely to be the <i>Annandale Herald</i>. In Langholm, it is the wonderful
<i>Eskdale and Liddlesdale Advertiser</i>. Try as Elaine Murray and I might
to be on the front page, we are invariable outdone by the activities of
the local drama group or the rugby club. We must be absolutely clear that
we value such activities as part of our culture. As Iain Gray referred
yesterday to the fact that health underpins so many aspects of our life,
so culture is interwoven as well. The end of sheep farming on our hills
would not just be a personal and economic tragedy; it would undermine Scotland's
rich and diverse culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many people in rural communities throughout
Scotland have a genuine fear that this Government is not concerned about
their culture and way of life. I do not think that this document goes any
way to allay those fears, but I hope sincerely that the consultation process
will. The Government must promote more understanding between town and country
areas. We must foster that understanding of different cultures, different
ways of doing things, and-dare I say it-different pastimes. We must have

I misread Rhona Brankin's introduction, and thought that he had been on
her focus group, but as he had been dead for 203 years I do not think that
Robert Burns could have contributed to that. Burns is one of Scotland's
pre-eminent assets. England does not have a Shakespeare day, but tourists
visit Stratford-upon-Avon and spend money in that area to a degree that
people in Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway could only envy. Let us not
only put Burns at the heart of our culture in Scotland, but build on the
economic potential that that could bring to the south-west of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to frame an amendment. I agree. I do not think that he had much opposition
to what was being said in the document. He tried hard, but I give him five
and a half out of 10. I take issue with Brian Monteith in no uncertain
terms. I did not like the tone of his remarks at all. I regard them as
extremely dangerous in any civilised society. The state certainly has a
role in the arts, as does local government. It was rightly pointed out
by Robin Harper-who is not present now-that Beethoven and the rest would
not have been successful without public and private patronage. I warn members
against Mr Monteith's philosophy. It was Hermann Goering who said,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"When I hear the word culture I reach for
my revolver".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Let us not go down that laissez-faire,

that, because it is late in the day, he was not thinking about what he
was saying.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Other members have referred to the importance

I am keenly aware of the differences. Mike will know from his visit to

how different Durness is from Thurso, how different that is from Dingwall,
from Banchory, from Lochaber or wherever. As we go forward with the strategy

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan (Linlithgow) (Lab):
</strong>All of us agree that Scotland has a distinct and rich cultural identity.
At this stage in Scotland's political development and as we approach the
new millennium it is apt for us to take a look at our cultural strategy.
In answer to the points that Mike Russell made, I do not see this as a
static document but as a tool to show where Scotland's culture is and to
give pointers to how it could or should be developed in the future. There
was discussion prior to the establishment of a Scottish Parliament on how
culture should be represented. The fact that a cabinet minister and a junior
minister have responsibility for it shows the commitment of the Executive.
The fact that the Parliament has established the Education, Culture and
Sport Committee shows how we value our culture and recognise the importance
that education can play in taking it forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would like to concentrate on the mechanisms
of developing our culture and on education and the Scottish Arts Council
in particular. Education very clearly provides a means for arts to be introduced
to or further developed in young people's lives. I am not suggesting that
teachers and schools will be the only influence. I recognise the importance
of community influence. For many young people who live with disadvantage,
schools can provide opportunity and enlightenment. It is for that reason
that I have some concerns about the way in which some schools that have
found their budgets ever decreasing have tried to drop arts and sports
from the curriculum. I believe that as a Parliament we should be making
it very clear to the education profession that the appreciation and practice
of the arts has so many benefits for the learning process that they should
not be so easily lost.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In my constituency, Linlithgow, a number
of children and young people attend West Lothian Youth Theatre, a very
productive and enthusiastic company. I doubt that all of them will follow
in the footsteps of Ewan McGregor or Sean Connery-I do not doubt their
skills, but the opportunity might not be there-but they are, through taking
part, learning confidence, teamwork and the ability to think beyond the
more obvious premise. Those are very important life skills and should be
part of a fully rounded education.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My concern is about
people's access to the arts and culture, which brings me to the role of
the Scottish Arts Council. Each year it makes project funds available through
a wide range of schemes to individual artists and to arts organisations
throughout Scotland. The SAC has also assumed responsibility for distributing
a share of the National Lottery funds for the benefit of the arts in Scotland.
The National Lottery Act 1998 requires the SAC to produce a strategy explaining
its priorities for distributing those funds. I raise that point because
the role of the SAC is to emphasise the importance of resources being made
available to all areas of the arts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SAC's report "Scottish Arts in the
21<sup>st</sup> Century" highlights the need to get rid of unnecessary
distinctions between so-called high arts and popular culture, between the
amateur and the professional and between art forms that celebrate diversity
and those that create false barriers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

up, please.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>I do not want to suggest
that the arts and culture can be furthered only by injections of large
sums of money. Practically, we have to acknowledge that the moneys that
are available have to be used for the widest possible access.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In conclusion, a cultural strategy for
Scotland should belong to all the people of Scotland. Access to the arts
and our heritage can be assisted by education and by adequate and sensitive
funding.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Cathy Peattie (Falkirk East) (Lab):
</strong>I welcome this strategy. As Mike Russell said, it is right that there
should be more consultation. This document is a stepping stone. It is a
start. I would have been shouting at the top of my voice if it were a thick
document telling us how the arts should be delivered in Scotland, but that
is not what it is about; it is about starting the debate and getting people
together to look for a way forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am sure that people will not be surprised
to learn that I am particularly interested in traditional music. Do not
worry: I will not sing, I will speak. It is important that we examine traditional
music, and not just singing, but story telling. Music is performed in Scotland
that tells the story of our family histories. History and culture in Scotland
are handed down in our music. In farmland areas, fishing villages and the
inner cities, a host of songs tell us what life was like for the people
who sang and wrote them. Traditional music is important, and perhaps on
another day I will sing some of the songs to you all.</font></td>

is an important part of our heritage. Any cultural strategy should nurture
and support communities' participation in that music, because traditional
music is handed down by our grannies, our grandpas, our aunties, our uncles

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important that we recognise artists
and those who entertain, but it is important also that the strategy recognises
the people of Scotland. Ours is a people's culture and not something that
is imported. We recognise the importance of an international culture, but
let us dwell on the importance of the people's culture and those who perform.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Community is important in Scotland. It
plays a vital role in education and in encouraging people to develop their
skills and to feel pride in their language. I was pleased to see reference
in the document to the Scots language. I hope that we see an end to the
chastisement of bairns for using their Scots language-the language they
learn in the playground, in their communities and in their homes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Local authorities play a vital role in
delivering the arts and working with arts organisations, and I hope that
the culture policy will take that into consideration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I urge the minister to ensure that the
consultation meetings are not for the great and the good to talk about
nice arts in Scotland. The meetings must take place around the country,
allowing people to participate. The minister must ensure that the structure
of the consultation makes participation easier, so that people can come
along and think, "Somebody listened to what I had to say and the way I
said it. My voice is important." If we can achieve that, we will have something
to be proud of. Mary said that the strategy will grow and change; that
it is about confidence and about celebrating Scottish culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I agree with Jamie Stone that Scotland
has a rich tapestry of regional and sub-regional cultures. Those are expressed
through music and verse, through literature and especially through language.
Many regional tongues have a structure and a traditional use spanning back
over the centuries. My family roots are mostly in the north-east, with
a little smattering of border blood.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I wish to make a plea for the Doric, which
has been already been mentioned today. I know Sandy Stronach well and appreciate
the work that he does. The Doric tongue is spoken daily by many in the
north-east, especially in the rural areas. As a boy in Aberdeenshire, I
spoke two languages: Scots English and Doric. If I had not done so, I would
have been isolated from the community. There are distinct differences in
Aberdeenshire in the Doric. There is a range from Kincardine up through
Deeside and Donside. As for Buchan, I am sure that Mr Salmond will remember
the learning curve required when he first stood there as a candidate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Doric is a rich and expressive language.
Every member can talk about expressions of style and accents from their
areas. People talk about the differences in the dialect between different
villages. We have to remember those differences, which carry over into
music and verse. We think of the bothy ballads of the north-east, fiddle
music and accordion music-every one of us can think of something that we
remember from our youth, that may be suppressed today or not encouraged
enough.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should expand the cultural diversity
at community level in schools and homes and encourage children to be proud
of their local culture. When they have confidence in their local culture
they can take on board other regional cultures and take part in cultural
exchanges. That will make Scotland an even richer place. If Scotland is
nothing else, it is the most magnificent hotch-potch of culture in a small
landmass, which people find easy to visit and regularly come back to. I
think that we will all agree on that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

but the Executive could have taken the opportunity to give tangible commitments
to some aspects of arts and culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive has professed its credentials
in joined-up government. In culture policy, that must mean a clear set
of objectives to ensure that arts policy engages with education. "Celebrating
Scotland" gives no real explanation of how the Government sees Scottish
culture being promoted in schools. I suggest that there might be some good
ideas in the as yet unpublished report on Scottish culture and the curriculum,

question on Scots, which would make planning and provision possible. "Celebrating
Scotland" gives not the slightest indication that the Executive is committed
to making progress on this or any other issue relating to the Scots language.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The key to the future of the arts is the
economy. For the strategy to be effective, we need to create a suitable
financial climate. This is a question of investment, not subsidy, because
the arts create more wealth than they consume. The Government and, by implication,
the Scottish Arts Council should not continue to dictate terms purely because
of the strength of their funding role. We need a radical rethink of the
funding situation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive talks a great deal about
community, and I suggest that it would be better if the balance of financial
power were shifted in favour of local authorities, which are more responsive
to and supportive of distinctive local initiatives. There are some good
examples of local authority support for grass-roots projects in which value
to the community is given as much priority as pure profit.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although we are all agreed that local authorities
are best equipped to promote such initiatives, the problem at the moment
is that funding is difficult to source. Since the reorganisation of local
government, there is no longer a duty on councils to ensure adequate provision
of facilities or cultural activities for the inhabitants of their areas,
although councils were given a new power to give grants towards the expenses
of any organisation providing cultural activities. The Government-imposed
cut has, of course, led to a sharp decline in the expansion of this aspect
of Scotland's culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need a better structure for the investment
of public money in the arts and we need to encourage private investment.
Why not encourage the arts community itself to take the lead in such developments?
Creativity now has a value. Artists should be encouraged to develop their
entrepreneurial streak, capitalise on the interest that exists and seek
commercial support. Links between chambers of commerce and arts groups
have proved successful in Europe and there are all sorts of ways in which
arts groups can engage with business. One such project exists on the Royal
Mile. Dom has brought together under one roof a range of artists, sculptors,
poets and scholars. By creating its own core finance through the provision
of services relevant to the commercial sector, it manages to support less
lucrative aspects of its work while retaining its creative independence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scottish Parliament can help to create
a climate of partnership between the arts and business to promote self-sufficiency.

need to be supportive. Nothing in this paper indicates that the Executive
has any of the ambition that was shown by the Irish Government in providing
state allowances and tax breaks to outstanding artists, musicians and writers.
How wonderful it would be for Scotland to pioneer such innovations and
for Governments across Europe to take note.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want briefly to mention some major elements
of the Scottish cultural scene. Traditional music is very wide-ranging.
The Scottish Parliament has a role to play in supporting the f&egrave;isean
movement, for example. However, it is not enough to support musicians;
we need to make an effort to retain the ancillary jobs that are supported
by the music industry. Despite the success of our bands and the achievements
of some small recording companies, the critical mass of permanent jobs
in the popular music market, for example-production, sales and recording-is
located outside Scotland. Music industry investment needs to return to
Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Crafts workers need a special mention.
There is no support system for individual craftsmen and craftswomen. We
need to promote the quality of our design production and encourage people
to come to Scotland to buy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The construction of the new Parliament
building is a tremendous opportunity to make sure that a high profile is
given to the skills of Scottish crafts workers. The European Parliament
has a scheme to ensure that artists from all European countries are commissioned
to provide artwork for display in the public areas of the Parliament building.
Michael Russell has commended the scheme to the Holyrood project team,
which has agreed to examine it. We must also ensure that as many as possible
of the commissions for the internal decoration and fittings of the Scottish
Parliament go to Scottish designers and artists and that Holyrood becomes
an exemplar of Scottish design and achievement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The role of Government is to support the
arts and to allow them to evolve, not to impose a strategy whose effect
will be to limit and inhibit creativity.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Minister for Culture and
Sport (Rhona Brankin): </strong>I will deal with points that were raised in
today's debate, starting with those of Mr Russell. I thank Cathy Peattie
for voicing some of my concerns about Mr Russell's speech. He does not
seem to have grasped that the Government's document is small because we
hope to involve people in a consultation process about what the national
cultural strategy should be. The document does not comprise the national

it will wait and see but I had hoped that it would contribute to the process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will be inclusive. I thought that Mr
Galbraith explained that well. We have said that the document is meant
for all the people of Scotland. I would welcome it if those who have expressed
concern about inclusiveness would suggest ways in which we can best consult.
We want to consult community arts groups and people in remote areas. In
reply to those who have sought assurances that rural Scotland will be involved,
I give categorical assurances-as one who lived in rural Scotland for 25
years-that that will happen. We have been asked to go to Thurso, we will
go to the national M&ograve;d in Fort William to consult our Gaelic-speaking
colleagues and we will go to all parts of Scotland. That is central to
the consultation process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although Mr Russell claimed not to think
much of the document, it was interesting that half his speech was made
up of quotes from it. One of the reasons why the line by A L Kennedy, which
he quoted, appeared in the document was that we thought that it was marvellous.
Of course artists have to be involved in the process. If Mr Russell knows
artists who feel excluded from the process, we would like him to get in
touch with us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Russell spoke about sport. We already
have a national strategy for sport, which is detailed in the document "Sport
21: Nothing Left to Chance". Sport plays a vital role in our culture and
we need to examine how culture and sport can link together-I know that
our shinty-playing colleagues will contribute to the consultation process.
However, there was no point in initiating another massive consultation
on sport when that document had already been produced.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will deal with Mr Monteith next. He appears
not to think that Government should be concerned with culture but that
is because he misunderstands the role of Government in culture. We agree
that decisions on funding should be at arm's length but we disagree with
the free-market approach to culture of Mr Monteith and Mr Fry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Sam said, we have a healthy creative
industries sector worth &pound;5.3 billion, which creates 91,000 jobs in
Scotland. That is important, and Government has a key role in supporting
culture and our creative industries.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I agree with James Douglas-Hamilton about
the importance of the film industry in Scotland. We are putting an extra
&pound;1.8 million into Scottish Screen over the next three years. Recent
tax breaks mean that the production costs of British films of up to &pound;50
million can be written off in the first year. Film is a vital sector and
we are committed to promoting and supporting it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

partners in delivering social inclusion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I come now to Lloyd Quinan's comments.
We are happy to talk to the producers, and Lloyd talks about the unions
that are involved. Yes, I will be holding meetings with those unions-it
is important that we speak to them. The best way of supporting artists
is to support the creative industries. That is where we will be creating
jobs, which will be a key plank of any cultural strategy. However, practitioners
are important and we must never lose sight of the fact that a national
cultural strategy is for the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

projects. Members know the people at home and in their communities, and
should get out and talk to them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I ask people in the media to do that as
well. They should tell people about our consultation document and encourage
them to tell their friends and families about it. Above all, the media

responses to the Scottish Executive. With the help of all members and all
