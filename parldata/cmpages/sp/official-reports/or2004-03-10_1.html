          <P ALIGN="CENTER">[THE DEPUTY PRESIDING OFFICER<em> opened the meeting 
            at 14:30</em>]</P>
          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Time for Reflection</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Murray Tosh): </strong>Our 
            time for reflection leader today is David McKelvie Rae, president 
            of the Paisley Scotland Stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
            Saints.</P>
          <p><strong>President David McKelvie Rae (Paisley Scotland Stake of the 
            Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints):</strong> Faith is the 
            motivating cause of all action. All men have faith; no one embarks 
            on a journey where the outcome is uncertain without faith. The proposition 
            is, therefore, not whether we have faith, but in what we have faith. 
            Our fourth article of faith states:</P>
          <P>&quot;We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the 
            gospel are: First, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ&quot;.</P>
          <P>All the scientific knowledge that we have amassed over the centuries 
            does not answer the vital questions of life, such as: did we exist 
            before we came to this earth? Are we immortal? Is there purpose in 
            our being born here? Does God live? Is Jesus Christ the only begotten 
            son of God? Do we know where we are going after we leave this frail 
            existence? Our faith in Christ leads us to answer those questions 
            in the affirmative. Faith is not fanaticism; having faith in God is 
            not believing in things that are not so. In matters of faith, the 
            intellect must be involved, for there must exist the rational possibility 
            for that which we believe to be true.</P>
          <P>Of course there will always be scoffers and doubters; there always 
            have been. Two thousand years ago, the apostle Paul addressed those 
            people when he said&#151;I quote from 1 Corinthians, chapter 2, verse 
            14&#151;</P>
          <P>&quot;But the natural man receiveth not the things of ... God: for 
            they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they 
            are spiritually discerned.&quot;</P>
          <P>God, we believe, is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. We also 
            believe that he is omni-loving and that no one, no group and no sect 
            has a monopoly on God's love. He loves all his children and his greatest 
            desire is to bless them, if they would but ask.</P>
          <P>May God bless you in your faith, whether it is in God or in your 
            leaders or colleagues; hopefully, it </div>

          <p></P>
          <P>is in yourselves. May your faith increase and result in greater accomplishments 
            for the benefit of your fellow men.</P>
          <P>I would like to offer a short prayer.</P>
          <P>O God the eternal father, we bow before thee and thank thee for the 
            many blessings thou hast given us. We particularly thank thee for 
            those who are members of this Parliament, who have dedicated their 
            time and their talents to serve the people of this great nation. Bless 
            them with every blessing they stand in need of. Protect them from 
            the designs of evil men. Help them to establish truth and justice 
            for the welfare and fulfilment of the people in this land. Guide them 
            in their deliberations that Scotland might be a better place tomorrow 
            than it is today. That is our prayer in the name of Jesus Christ.</P>
          <P>Amen.</P>

            in the name of Patricia Ferguson, on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau,

            Ferguson</em>.]</P>
          <P>14:35</P>
          <p><strong>Mark Ballard (Lothians) (Green): </strong>The intention of 
            the amendment is to allow the Parliament a proper debate on the Executive's 
            new policy on genetically modified crops. It is a reasonable request. 
            Following press speculation over the weekend, I made my request for 
            a debate directly to the Minister for Parliament. However, all I was 
            offered at the Parliamentary Bureau meeting was a ministerial statement, 
            which is not enough. The minister has already made a statement, which 
            was to the press yesterday. The Parliament must be allowed a voice 
            on this issue.</P>
          <P>The Executive has changed its policy radically. It has abandoned 
            the precautionary principle. Farmers and consumers in Scotland do 
            not want the commercialisation of GM crops; the Scottish Parliament 
            needs to debate how it is taking on those concerns. The Executive 
            has taken the first step to commercialise the growing of GM maize. 
            A voluntary ban is a contradiction in terms. It is unworkable and&#151;crucially&#151;unenforceable. 
            That is why I urge members to vote for the amendment. </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>The Executive must allow a proper debate on the growing of GM crops 
            in Scotland. I ask members to support the amendment to allow that 
            debate to take place in the Parliament.</P>

          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP): </strong>I genuinely 
            regret the need to oppose the business motion, but this is an issue 
            where time is a luxury that we cannot afford. I agree that there should 
            be a proper debate on GM crops. If that amendment were successful, 
            it would allow the half hour allocated for the statement on GM crops 
            to be allocated to a statement on the hunger strike by the three Iranian 
            Kurdish men.</P>
          <P>I want to concentrate members' minds. Farouk Haidari, Farnborz Gravindk 
            and Mokhtar Haydary, three young men&#151;previously fit, healthy 
            and strapping&#151;who are fleeing persecution in Iran, are starving 
            themselves to death. It is not a stunt. It is not a laugh. It is not 
            flippant. It is serious. They are starving themselves to death because 
            no refuge is being offered to them in Scotland. They face deportation 
            and eviction from a country that is experiencing depopulation.</P>
          <P>The Home Office minister, Beverley Hughes, will not budge. David 
            Blunkett has washed his hands of the matter, and the First Minister 
            says that it is not his jurisdiction. Do those three people represent 
            the three unwise monkeys? Will somebody assume responsibility? Will 
            somebody assume maturity?</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> Order. Miss Leckie, 
            I am not prepared to allow you, in the chamber, to refer to the First 
            Minister as a monkey, wise or unwise.</P>
          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie: </strong>I asked a rhetorical question.</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> Order. Do not bandy 
            words. I instruct you to withdraw that remark.</P>
          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie: </strong>I asked a rhetorical question.</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> Withdraw the remark.</P>
          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie: </strong>I withdraw the remark.</P>
          <P>If Westminster will not accept responsibility, it is incumbent on 
            all of us to do so, as human beings, as MSPs and as citizens of Scotland. 
            Is the First Minister concerned for these individuals' health, which 
            is his responsibility? Is he concerned for </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6419">6419</A></p>

          <P>their housing, which is his responsibility? Does it concern him that 
            the men are lying on quilts&#151;they do not even have mattresses&#151;in 
            a crummy bedsit on the south side of Glasgow, starving themselves 
            to death? That is his responsibility. Will he visit them, as any decent 
            human being should, to listen to their requests? That is a very simple 
            request. Will he lift one tiny finger, if that is all that it is in 
            his power to do, or will he wash his hands, like Pontius Pilate?</P>
          <P>I hope that the First Minister and the Executive will agree to make 
            a statement and that they will put humanity before protocol. If they 
            do not do so, I will be forced to agree with Bishop Devine, who has 
            said that Scotland is becoming a country without compassion.</P>

          <p><strong>The Minister for Parliamentary Business (Patricia Ferguson): 
            </strong>The business motion seeks to amend parliamentary business 
            for the week to allow for the inclusion of two important ministerial 
            statements&#151;on GM crops and on the ministerial group on tourism. 
            The Scottish Socialist Party is well aware that asylum and immigration 
            are reserved matters.</P>
          <P>We have proposed that a statement be taken this afternoon on GM crops 
            because we believe that it is important and topical. The minister 
            wishes to discuss the issue in the Parliament at the earliest opportunity. 
            Mark Ballard's assertion that I ruled out a debate at the Parliamentary 
            Bureau yesterday is incorrect. I mentioned the fact that we have had 
            debates on GM crops and I said that I did not doubt that we would 
            have further debates in the near future. I pointed out that the minister 
            has some important things to say and that he will come to the chamber 
            today, with its approval, to say them.</P>
          <P>I find it quite distressing and disturbing that Opposition parties 
            have again chosen to use time set aside for Executive business, rather 
            than raising their concerns in their own time. The longer this exchange 
            continues, the more it will impact on the time set aside for consideration 
            of the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill this afternoon.</P>
          <P>Members on the Liberal Democrat and Labour Party benches happen to 
            believe that antisocial behaviour is an issue that matters to the 
            people of Scotland. This exchange is a smokescreen to </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>cover up the fact that the Greens and the SSP are completely out 
            of touch with the people of Scotland. They have consistently failed 
            to make a constructive contribution on this topic; I suspect that 
            this will continue when the debate begins. I will not waste much time 
            talking about the matter. Antisocial behaviour is worthy of even more 
            time than we have been able to allocate to it today.</P>
          <P>I understand that the Tories are considering voting with the Greens 
            this afternoon. I point out to Conservative members that the effect 
            of doing so will be to ensure that the planned debate on tourism does 
            not take place.<A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_5"></A> Less than a month has 
            passed since David Mundell stood up in the Parliament to say:</P>
          <P>&quot;If the minister had the concerns for the tourism industry that 
            he says he has, he would proceed with the review as a matter of priority&quot;.&#151;[<em>Official 
            Report</em>, 12 February 2004; c 5856.]</P>
          <P>I presume that the rest of David Mundell's group does not agree with 
            him. Labour party members agree with the minister and we want to hear 
            his statement.</P>
          <p><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_7"></A>Mark Ballard: </strong>On a 
            point of order, Presiding Officer. I wish to clarify things for the

          <P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Murray Tosh): </strong>The 
            next item of business is a statement by Allan Wilson on genetically 
            modified crops.</P>
          <P>14:48</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development 
            (Allan Wilson): </strong>I thank the Parliament for giving me the 
            opportunity to make this statement. Members will understand that I 
            wished to make clear the Executive's position on genetically modified 
            crops as soon as possible after the announcement that was made yesterday 
            by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. 
            Unfortunately, the parliamentary timetable did not allow scope for 
            me to make such a statement yesterday, but I was able to inform members 
            of the Executive's position in my response to a question lodged by 
            Alasdair Morrison. I am glad, however, to have the opportunity today, 
            courtesy of the Parliament, to make a more detailed statement on our 
            policy on GM crops. I am more than happy to debate the matter at some 
            future date, should that be the wish of Parliament.</P>
          <P>We have listened to the public's views. It is clear that people are 
            uneasy about GM, and that there is little support for early commercialisation 
            of GM crops. I am equally clear that we do not have the scientific 
            evidence to do that, nor do we have the power to impose a blanket 
            ban on GM crops or, indeed, the power to prohibit GM crops in particular 
            areas. However, we will take action to protect the interests of Scottish 
            consumers and to ensure that there is consumer choice.</P>
          <P>As I have stated consistently, the Executive's primary concern is 
            to safeguard the health of the Scottish people and of our wider environment. 
            We will not allow GM crops to be grown in Scotland unless we are satisfied 
            that they do not pose a risk to health or to the environment. In keeping 
            with the partnership agreement, our approach is cautious and precautionary 
            and it takes into account the long-term interests of the people of 
            Scotland. Indeed, it was that precautionary approach that led the 
            Executive, along with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural 
            Affairs, to set up the farm-scale trials in 1999. Those trials are 
            easily the most extensive study on farmland ecology that has ever 
            been undertaken. We set up the trials because we wanted to be sure 
            that questions that the nature conservation agencies had raised about 
            the management of GM herbicide-resistant crops were answered before 
            we reached decisions on them.</P>
          <P>We have now accepted the advice of our statutory Advisory Committee 
            on Releases to the </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6428">6428</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Environment on the three spring-sown farm-scale evaluation crops. 
            We will oppose the cultivation of genetically modified herbicide-tolerant 
            spring-sown rape and beet, as grown in the farm-scale evaluations, 
            as the management regime that was associated with those crops had 
            a more harmful effect on biodiversity than that of their conventional 
            counterparts. We have agreed with the United Kingdom Government a 
            process for taking forward the amendment of the consent for GM fodder 
            maize to ensure that it can be grown only as in the FSEs, as that 
            was better for biodiversity than conventional maize cultivation.</P>
          <P>There has been some speculation in the media regarding the inclusion 
            or otherwise of Chardon LL maize in the national seed list. I would 
            like to make three points on that. First, the national seed list is 
            a reassurance measure for farmers. The safety of this GM maize was 
            confirmed by its gaining part C consent in 1998. Secondly, any decision 
            on the listing of Chardon LL would be a collective decision of the 
            UK Government and the devolved Administrations. Thirdly, Chardon LL 
            already appears on the Dutch national seed list and it could, of course, 
            enter the European Union common catalogue from there. For those reasons, 
            the talk of a veto is wholly misplaced.</P>
          <P>The FSE results have vindicated our precautionary, case-by-case, 
            evidence-based approach. The review of GM science further reinforced 
            the fact that it cannot be treated as a homogeneous technology and 
            that its application needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
            We cannot and should not dismiss the potential of GM technology out 
            of hand, as some would have us do. We can be proud that Scotland is 
            host to some of the world's leading biotechnology research and development, 
            and we should be cautious about undermining the potential of that 
            innovative sector to contribute to our long-term competitiveness and 
            the future well-being of Scotland and its people.</P>
          <P>The Executive accepts that science alone cannot provide all the answers 
            to the policy questions with which we are faced. The results of the 
            public debate demonstrate that the biotechnology companies have failed 
            to persuade the public about the benefits of GM foods. Although most 
            people can see that there might be potential benefits in medical applications 
            of GM technology, they remain unconvinced about the use of GM in agriculture. 
            The Executive's role is to ensure that the regulatory process operates 
            properly and that applications are subject to robust and detailed 
            scrutiny so that we can satisfy ourselves that the products that receive 
            approval are as safe as conventional crops.</P>
          <P>At the same time, we want to ensure that Scottish consumers can make 
            informed choices </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6429">6429</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>about whether they wish to buy GM products. According to Greenpeace, 
            no less, the new EU rules from April will provide us with the strictest 
            and most comprehensive labelling regime in the world. If any GM product 
            is present in a food product, it must be labelled as such. An exception 
            is made for approved genetically modified organisms that are present 
            for technically unavoidable reasons, but even in that case, labelling 
            will be required at very low thresholds.</P>
          <P>We recognise that it is important for producers to meet public demand 
            for non-GM produce, and we will therefore introduce statutory co-existence 
            measures. We will consult all concerned on the most appropriate co-existence 
            arrangements to deliver choice for consumers and farmers and on possible 
            compensation arrangements for farmers who suffer economic loss.</P>
          <P>We have approached farming organisations to initiate discussions 
            on how we might protect consumer confidence in Scottish produce if 
            the GM maize variety to which I referred receives all the necessary 
            approvals to be grown. We will work with those organisations to develop 
            guidance for farmers who wish to establish GM-free zones in areas 
            where the crop could be grown.</P>
          <P>The Executive believes in responsible science and responsible policy 
            making. We act within a strict regulatory framework that permits GM 
            developments when it can be shown that they do not represent an increased 
            risk to human health or the environment. On the basis of ACRE's advice, 
            we could not consent to the commercial cultivation of GM beet and 
            oilseed rape as grown in the FSEs, but we can agree in principle to 
            the cultivation of the GM maize variety, subject to further important 
            conditions.</P>
          <P>We recognise that even where GM products are considered safe, people 
            should be able to choose whether to consume them. For that reason, 
            we will consult on the introduction of statutory co-existence measures 
            and we will work with farming organisations to develop guidance to 
            farmers who wish to establish GM-free zones.</P>
          <P>We have been accused of not listening to the public debate and of 
            ignoring public concerns. That accusation is untrue. We have listened, 
            but it is clear from that process that there is no single, simple, 
            yes-or-no answer about GM crops.</P>
          <P>I commend the policy and my statement to Parliament.</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> I intend to allow 
            about 20 minutes for the minister to take questions on the statement, 
            so I ask all members, and particularly the opening Opposition spokesmen, 
            to keep their questions tight.</P>

          <p></P>
          <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP): </strong>The minister's 
            statement was nine pages of very little. I am a long-time opponent 
            of GM crops, but I could be a late convert to the technology if I 
            thought that it could genetically modify a backbone into the minister 
            and his Cabinet colleagues. Perhaps the minister will show that he 
            does not need that genetic modification by answering three simple 
            questions. Are the minister and the rest of the Executive for or against 
            the commercial growing of GM crops in Scotland? That is straightforward. 
            If they are against it&#151;the voluntary ban scenario suggests that&#151;what 
            avenues are being explored proactively to delay or prevent the planting 
            of such crops? Will the minister say with a yes or no whether, if 
            he had refused to agree to the listing of Chardon maize, that would 
            have been an end to the matter for Scotland?</P>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Ms Cunningham's tongue is genetically 
            modified, as it is forked. In the absence of credible scientific evidence 
            of potential harm, a ban such as that which she suggests would be 
            illegal. We do not have evidence for the banning of GM maize. Ministers 
            must act responsibly and legally, even if the Scottish National Party 
            will not. We do so within a long-standing EU framework that permits 
            GM developments when it can be shown that they do not represent an 
            increased risk. Legal advice on that is clear. Ms Cunningham's party 
            and its leader may have scant regard for the law on fishing and agriculture, 
            but the Executive does not wish to take that position.</P>
          <P>I answered fully the Chardon maize question in my statement.</P>
          <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>No, you did not.</P>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I answered the question fully. As 
            I made clear, the Executive does not hold the power of veto on the 
            national seed list. National listing is not a GM safety assessment; 
            other measures for that exist under the directive on the deliberate 
            release of GMOs. The placing of varieties on the national list requires 
            collective agreement among the UK Administration and devolved Administrations, 
            so the minister's backbone does not enter into the question.</P>
          <P>The Executive agrees that the listing of Chardon LL maize should 
            be deferred until the current EU marketing consent has been amended 
            to reflect advice from scientific advisers about the special conditions 
            in which Chardon maize can be grown.</P>
          <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North East Scotland) (Con): </strong>I will 
            start by asking the same question that I asked the First Minister 
            two weeks ago. Does the minister have the power to prevent the commercial 
            growing of GM crops in Scotland?</P>
          <P>On a more technical issue, I return to national approved lists. If 
            the minister is asked for permission for Chardon LL to be included 
            on the </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6431">6431</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>national list of approved seeds, will he grant such permission? Will 
            he consider using the option of not granting permission at some future 
            date with some other crop? The minister has stated that he will not 
            allow crops to be grown in Scotland where there is evidence of potential 
            harm. In relation to the national seed list, will he use his veto 
            for that purpose?</P>
          <P>The Government's labelling and traceability regime, which is expected 
            to extend across Scotland, may or may not include the use of imported 
            unsegregated protein supplements. The minister appeared to indicate 
            that such supplements will not be included in his labelling regime. 
            Will he give an undertaking that such supplements, where they are 
            used as feed, will not activate the labelling and traceability processes 
            that he outlined in his statement? Will he also say whether the use 
            of such feedstuffs in specific areas may mitigate against granting 
            GM-free status in the minister's voluntary GM-free zones?</P>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The member has asked many questions, 
            a number of which I have answered to a certain extent.</P>
          <P>I have the power, which we may choose to exercise, to ban GM crop 
            cultivation in Scotland if there is scientific evidence to underpin 
            such a decision&#151;that is, if potential harm is posed to human 
            health or to the environment. We have no such evidence of potential 
            harm to human health or to the environment in relation to the Chardon 
            maize seed to which the member refers&#151;hence our application to 
            the EU for an amendment to the part C consent, given that it dates 
            back to 1998 and that a voluntary regime has precluded its cultivation 
            since then. We take the best possible scientific advice and base all 
            our judgments on a case-by-case, evidence-based scientific approach. 
            However, we do have such a power.</P>
          <P>On the national seed list, as I said&#151;I will repeat this for 
            what must be the third time in the past 10 minutes&#151;the seed has 
            not been listed because we have sought EU approval for an amendment 
            to the part C consent. If that approval is secured, which it may or 
            not be&#151;the decision will take several months&#151;the devolved 
            Administrations will discuss with the UK Government the prospective 
            listing of that seed. I point out again and repeat for SNP members, 
            who do not seem to understand the process, that Chardon maize is already 
            listed on the Netherlands' national seed list and therefore could 
            be approved for admission to the EU catalogue from that source.</P>
          <P>I give members a strict assurance that we will engage in discussions 
            with all the relevant parties, including the national organisations 
            that represent farmers and landowners, about our proposals to establish 
            GM-free zones where there is a demand for that to happen. I say that 
            because I understand </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6432">6432</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>that we have a joint objective and interest. As I have said, I am 
            persuaded that the public are uneasy about the science that underpins 
            GM crops. As a consequence, there is a lack of consumer confidence 
            in the product. Therefore, our interests coincide in trying to secure 
            public and consumer confidence in the product. We will consider that 
            matter in respect of all imports and the cultivation of the crops. 
            I think that that answers the final question that was asked.</P>
          <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) (LD): </strong>Does the minister 
            agree that freedom of choice should be available to farmers who may 
            wish to avail themselves of the technique that we are discussing if 
            they see an advantage in it? For that reason, co-existence measures 
            become quite a high priority. Will the minister expand on the consultation 
            that he proposes to undertake on co-existence measures and tell us 
            what timeframe he envisages for putting in place agreed co-existence 
            measures?</P>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>That is an important question, which 
            underpinned our decision yesterday. We decided that we would not proceed 
            with the process by which Chardon maize could be grown in Scotland 
            at some point without the prior existence of a statutory co-existence 
            regime that will underpin that prospective consent. That is an important 
            development and I was pleased to persuade colleagues in other parts 
            of the United Kingdom of its value.</P>
          <P>The consultation process, which will get under way shortly, will 
            be wide-ranging and inclusive and will take account of the issues 
            that Nora Radcliffe raised. We are conscious of the fact that the 
            cultivation of GM crops could impact on neighbouring conventional 
            or organic farmers. That is why, in tracing and labelling arrangements, 
            we have taken steps to introduce strict thresholds on the adventitious 
            presence of GM crops and we will consult on separation distances between 
            conventional crops and prospective GM crops, whether they are grown 
            on this side or the other side of the border.</P>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab): </strong>I welcome 
            the application of the precautionary principle, which means that GM 
            rape seed and beet will be banned for good scientific reasons.</P>
          <P>I want to press the minister on his welcome acknowledgement that 
            many of us remain sceptical about some of the over-extravagant claims 
            about GM technology. Will the minister outline precisely how he intends 
            to avoid cross-contamination from GM crops on conventional and organic 
            crops in particular, so that we as consumers will retain a real choice 
            when we buy food? Further, will he set out how he sees the delivery 
            of an effective liability regime that will </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>ensure that conventional and organic farmers are not put at risk?</P>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>As Sarah Boyack knows, I share her 
            scepticism about some of the claims that the biotech industry makes; 
            the tenor and scope of my statement reflected that. Equally, like 
            Sarah Boyack, I would not turn my back on technological or scientific 
            advances that could benefit humankind. Consequently, we will not turn 
            our back on GM technology, which as I said, is not a homogenous technology.</P>
          <P>On adventitious presence, I referred to the labelling regime and 
            perhaps there will be a lower threshold in relation to organic produce 
            to protect organic interests. Further, the statutory co-existence 
            regime will underpin, among other factors, separation distances between 
            conventional, organic and prospective GM cultivation.</P>
          <P>Sarah Boyack's last question was about liability. The Agriculture 
            and Environment Biotechnology Commission report on co-existence and 
            liability does not recommend a strict liability regime for GM crops; 
            it prefers a less adversarial approach that is based on a temporary 
            compensation scheme, with insurance as the longer-term solution. I 
            agree with that approach and I think that it is up to the commercial 
            insurance industry to respond in the longer term. It is important, 
            however, that AEBC has recommended that in the meantime there should 
            be special compensation arrangements for farmers who are liable to 
            suffer financial loss. We will consult all interested parties on options 
            for providing compensation to non-GM farmers who may suffer financial 
            loss through no fault of their own as a result of their produce having 
            a GM presence that exceeds the statutory threshold. Any such scheme 
            would have to be funded by the GM industry&#151;I made that clear 
            in the statement&#151;rather than by Government or the producers of 
            non-GM crops. The public purse will not be used to compensate farmers 
            who are affected in that way.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Mark Ruskell (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Green): </strong>Is 
            it not correct that Executive policy on this issue is as contradictory 
            as are the words &quot;voluntary&quot; and &quot;ban&quot;? The Executive 
            could have blocked the seed-listing process, citing all the good reasons 
            that the Westminster Environmental Audit Committee gave last week.</P>
          <P>Yesterday, Andrew George, the Liberal Democrat shadow minister for 
            food and rural affairs, said in a Lib Dem press release that</P>
          <P>&quot;giving the go ahead for GM maize&quot;</P>
          <P>would show</P>
          <P>&quot;breathtaking distain for both the public and MPs ... The decision 
            on GM maize marks a watershed and will inevitably pave the way for 
            other GM crops to be licensed.&quot;</P>

          <P>Does the minister agree with those comments? Does Mr Finnie agree 
            with those comments? Why has the minister ripped up the partnership 
            agreement commitment on GM crops, which states that there will be 
            opportunities for peer review of the field-scale trials before any 
            decision is made on the commercial growing of GM crops? Why has the 
            Executive dropped that commitment?</P>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>No, no and no&#151;I hope that that 
            is clear enough. The Environmental Audit Committee report to which 
            the member refers called for further testing of maize as a result 
            of the banning of Atrazine. We do not believe that there is a need 
            for the farm-scale evaluations for maize to be repeated, because the 
            publication of research in the scientific journal <em>Nature</em>, 
            as recently as Friday, suggests that in the short term the banning 
            of Atrazine or any of the other triazines will not invalidate the 
            conclusions of the FSEs with respect to maize. Further research will 
            be passed to ACRE for more detailed advice&#151;that is what scientific 
            advisers are for.</P>
          <P>I agree that some future research may be necessary, especially if 
            the industry were to apply for renewal of the release consent in 2006, 
            which is a possibility. I repeat that any such work would need to 
            be conducted at the industry's expense; it would not be funded out 
            of public money. Such evidence would be carefully assessed by ACRE, 
            which advises us.</P>
          <P>Today's announcement in no way breaches a commitment in the partnership 
            agreement, which states:</P>
          <P>&quot;We will rigorously apply the precautionary principle in our 
            approach to the planting of GM crops.&quot;</P>
          <P>We have done that. We have carefully considered the findings of the 
            public debate, alongside those of the science review and the cost-and-benefit 
            study and the results of the farm-scale trials. Our approach remains 
            cautious and precautionary. I repeat that we will not allow GM crops 
            to be sown unless and until we are satisfied that they do not pose 
            an increased risk. There is no green light for GM in Scotland. There 
            is no single yes or no on the issue.</P>
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP): </strong>Perhaps 
            I can help the minister and the chamber by asking him to clarify several 
            points. Will he name the definitive study of the effect on human health 
            of GM crops on which he bases his advice? Will he confirm that the 
            studies of GM maize in cattle feed have not been evaluated? Does he 
            agree that, because of that uncertainty, the precautionary principle 
            dictates that in the interests of the health of the people of Scotland, 
            of our animals and of food choice in this country, he must oppose 
            the inclusion of Chardon LL maize on the UK seed list?</P>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>For I suspect the umpteenth time, 
            I state that Chardon LL maize has not been listed. We have applied 
            for an amendment to the part C consent to take account of the outcome 
            of farm-scale evaluation trials, as I said on the previous occasion 
            that we debated this matter.</P>
          <P>We take the very best scientific advice. I have referred to the science 
            review, as well as advice from ACRE and the AEBC. Many assertions 
            are made about the likely adverse effects of growing GM crops. Another 
            has been made today. Numerous allegations of possible harm circulate. 
            Where there is a case to support those allegations, it is always investigated. 
            The statutory Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment carefully 
            monitors new information about the risks. Where that information has 
            implications for advice that ACRE has given and the existing consents, 
            the situation is reviewed and further advice is given, if necessary. 
            Despite claims to the contrary, no credible evidence has emerged that 
            has called into question the safety of any GM crop that has been trialled 
            in Scotland. The consent that we are discussing refers to one type 
            of maize that is grown for fodder, prospectively on a very small hectarage 
            in a very small part of Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>Alex Fergusson (Galloway and Upper Nithsdale) (Con): </strong>Does 
            the minister agree that the mid-term review of the common agricultural 
            policy will leave Scotland's agriculture industry far more open to 
            market forces than is currently the case and that every opportunity 
            to attract premium prices by securing high-quality niche markets will 
            need to be taken? If so, does he also agree that securing those markets 
            will be heavily dependent on the purity and integrity of Scottish 
            produce, which is likely to be put severely at risk once we have gone 
            down the route of accepting GM commercialisation?</P>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I agree with half of what Alex Fergusson 
            said. I agree that we face an opportunity and I have said as much 
            to colleagues previously. There is a coming together of Government 
            and producers in relation to marketing opportunities that arise as 
            a result of our proposal to introduce voluntary GM-free zones. There 
            is an opportunity to address a lack of public confidence in the technology 
            and to ensure that there is increased consumer confidence in the Scottish 
            product. That combination of forces will add momentum to our proposal 
            for GM-free zones, which is a product of the cautionary and sceptical 
            approach that I have outlined.</P>
          <P>The other side of the same coin, however, relates to the issue that 
            was raised by Sarah Boyack. Scotland has long had a worldwide reputation 
            for scientific advances and biotechnological innovation. We cannot 
            turn our </div>

          <P>back on what is not a homogenous technology in order to accommodate 
            a particular part of that technology. People who do that run down 
            Scotland's long-term economic and scientific prospects. I will not 
            take that point of view, because I believe in the long-term advances 
            that scientific progress, including in relation to GM technology, 
            can bring to humankind.</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne (South of Scotland) (SSP): </strong>In 
            light of the fact that the GM crop trials that were conducted in May 
            did not test whether genes could flow from GM crops to other crops, 
            whether the pollen would spread or what effects GM crops might have 
            on soil organisms, will the minister explain how the liability regime 
            will protect non-GM farmers? He has not given us much of an explanation 
            of that today and I would like to hear more from him on the subject.</P>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Ms Byrne asks some interesting and 
            complex questions.</P>
          <P>The purpose of the farm-scale GM evaluation programme was not to 
            test the safety of the crops. Approval would not have been given for 
            the programme to go ahead if the safety of the crops had not been 
            established over more than a decade of research. Indeed, Chardon LL 
            maize, which is now the subject of discussion, was approved back in 
            1998.</P>
          <P>Gene flow was tested in some separate experiments. Gene flow is not 
            a safety issue per se and does not, of itself, constitute harm to 
            the environment. However, the gene flow research will inform all our 
            deliberations on the development of a programme of statutory co-existence. 
            I would be happy to get back to the member separately and in more 
            detail on some of the issues relating to gene flow, but the important 
            point to make is that we have responded to the scientific advice and 
            the outcome of the farm-scale evaluations, as I said we would. We 
            have refused permission for the growing of spring-sown oilseed rape 
            and beet but, with the UK Government, we have applied for amended 
            consent to the pre-existing consent for Chardon LL maize.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab): </strong>I hope 
            that every member of the Parliament will endorse the application of 
            the precautionary principle to the testing and licensing of genetically 
            modified crops. However, does the minister agree that there must be 
            a place for bioscience in a smart, successful Scotland? Does he further 
            agree that it would be a bad day for Scotland if blind prejudice were 
            ever to take precedence over good science?</P>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Absolutely, and I said as much in 
            response to Alex Fergusson's question. I will not be the minister 
            who allows prejudice and misinformation to blind us to the potential

          <P>science and technology. Scotland has a global reputation for science 
            and technology, which does our economy tremendous good.</P>
          <P>I quote Sir David Carter, the chairman of the British Medical Association's 
            board of science, whose assessment was published in association with 
            our response. He said:</P>
          <P>&quot;Our assessment of all the available research is that there 
            is very little potential for GM foods to cause harmful health effects. 
            However the BMA recognises&quot;&#151;</P>
          <P>as do I&#151;</P>
          <P>&quot;the huge public concern over the impact of GM foods and believes 
            that research is still needed in key areas to allay remaining concern 
            about the potential risks to human health and the environment.&quot;</P>
          <P>I endorse such a science-based, evidence-based and case-by-case-based 
            approach as the correct one to adopt in this regard.</P>

            Stage 1</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Murray Tosh): </strong>The 
            next item of business is a debate on motion S2M-532, in the name of 
            Margaret Curran, on the general principles of the Antisocial Behaviour 
            etc (Scotland) Bill, and two amendments to the motion. As we are now 
            behind the clock, I ask members to stick to their speaking times.</P>
          <P>15:21</P>
          <p><strong>The Minister for Communities (Ms Margaret Curran): </strong>I 
            will try to move as swiftly as I can through my speech, Presiding 
            Officer.</P>
          <P>When we were elected, we said that tackling antisocial behaviour 
            was our top priority. That commitment remains. Moreover, when we were 
            elected, we said that we would legislate without delay. That is exactly 
            what we are doing.</P>
          <P>The Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill will change the lives 
            of Scottish people for the better. Let no one tell them that their 
            fundamental right to live in safety and security is too basic, too 
            mundane or too difficult to deserve our attention. I look forward 
            to today's debate on the bill's proposals in the light of the report 
            by the committees that have dedicated so much time to it. I do not 
            think that today is the time to dwell on justifying the bill's existence. 
            After all, we have done that so many times before. Instead, I want 
            to focus on the bill and the changes that it will introduce.</P>
          <P>The bill's provisions fall into one of four interlocking themes: 
            empowering communities, support to change behaviour, environment and 
            community and effective enforcement. On empowering communities, we 
            recognise that combating antisocial behaviour will require a sustained 
            and co-ordinated national and local effort. Although Government must 
            play its part, local joined-up work among the range of agencies that 
            have a role in tackling antisocial behaviour is probably more important.</P>
          <P>That is why part 1 of the bill focuses on strategies for tackling 
            antisocial behaviour. Indeed, that issue is set out at the very start 
            of the bill because it is the most important one and properly should 
            take the lead. The strategies in question recognise that simply bringing 
            the usual suspects to the same cosy table will not work. Part 1 ensures 
            that victims of antisocial behaviour will be involved. Moreover, it 
            will require that strategies are publicised and regularly reviewed 
            and it allows for accountability to local communities.</P>
          <p><strong>Marilyn Livingstone (Kirkcaldy) (Lab): </strong>The minister 
            mentioned empowering communities and </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6439">6439</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>joined-up working. In that light, I want to thank her for meeting 
            my constituents and representatives of Fife Police and Fife Council 
            who have formed the Esplanade action group and are in the gallery 
            today. Will the minister take on board the issues that they have raised 
            about antisocial behaviour in vehicles, which is causing many tenants 
            and residents in my community untold misery? Will she consider an 
            amendment that I will lodge at stage 2 to close that gap?</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Curran: </strong>I was very interested to meet the member's 
            constituents. Having spent so much time on the issue of antisocial 
            behaviour in recent months, I thought that I knew about most of what 
            was going on in Scotland. However, I was quite shocked by the group 
            from Kirkcaldy's compelling arguments about having to live with the 
            antisocial behaviour of people who drive fast cars all through the 
            night, night after night. I will certainly be very sympathetic towards 
            any proposals that we could include in the bill that would bring respite 
            to the member's community. When people live in such desperate situations, 
            they properly deserve the Parliament's support and attention.</P>
          <P>Supporting people to change their behaviour is the second theme that 
            runs through the bill, and it applies to children and adults and the 
            families within which they live. These provisions are not about stigmatisation, 
            punishment or tarring everyone with the same brush. They are targeted 
            at the small minority of young people and adults who cause misery 
            for their neighbours or communities. We will help those people to 
            change their behaviour. Indeed, an important part of the process will 
            centre on making it very clear what is acceptable behaviour and what 
            is not. However, members should make no mistake: if those people refuse 
            to change, we will ensure that they are held to account.</P>
          <P>I want to go through the specific provisions in our proposals. Extending 
            antisocial behaviour orders to 12 to 15-year-olds will provide an 
            effective extra means of checking the behaviour of young people who 
            cause problems in communities. The ASBOs will deal with the small 
            number of young people for whom existing mechanisms have proved ineffective. 
            An ASBO will make it clear to a young person what behaviour is unacceptable. 
            The proposal has been supported by communities, the police and the 
            trade unions, which represent those who have to work in communities.</P>
          <P>Parenting orders recognise that parenting matters.</P>
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>Before the minister 
            leaves the point about extending ASBOs, which is a measure that I 
            agree with in principle, will she comment on the proposals of the 
            Justice 2 Committee and the Communities Committee that, </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6440">6440</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>in every case in which an ASBO is granted for a child, the principal 
            reporter should refer the child to a children's hearing, to ensure 
            that the right package of support is available for the child at that 
            stage and that an ASBO does not just become a passport to the criminal 
            justice system?</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Curran: </strong>I am pleased to have the support of so 
            many forces in the Parliament who originally questioned our proposals. 
            They have begun to recognise that we are introducing a much more rounded 
            package. There is an extra requirement to consult the reporter for 
            12 to 15-year-olds. When granting ASBOs, the courts will have the 
            power to refer to the reporter and to require a hearing to be convened 
            to consider the wider needs of the person under supervision. Therefore, 
            we will ensure that the rounded needs of young persons are taken into 
            account.</P>
          <P>I want to move on to parenting orders. Parenting orders will focus 
            on the behaviour of parents. They will be targeted at parents who 
            have persistently refused to engage with support to improve their 
            parenting. It is the Government's role to ensure that we have the 
            means to support parents. We must also recognise that a very small 
            minority of parents fundamentally fail their children. We cannot ignore 
            the plight of those children who have been failed.</P>
          <P>The bill also introduces community reparation orders and electronic 
            monitoring for young people through the hearings system and the courts. 
            Those measures, too, are about helping people to change their behaviour. 
            Community reparation orders will provide an effective new sentence 
            for the courts. No longer will a fine be the only realistic option 
            for offences involving antisocial behaviour. We will ensure that offenders 
            must make practical amends. We know that that is good for the community 
            and better for the offender.</P>
          <P>Electronic monitoring has proved to be an effective tool in helping 
            to change the behaviour of adults and we believe that it will also 
            work for young people. It will need to be used carefully and will 
            need to be properly supported, as we have always said. We have always 
            acknowledged that electronic monitoring on its own will not be appropriate 
            for a young person, but it is another option that might prevent a 
            young person's behaviour from escalating.</P>
          <p><strong>Elaine Smith (Coatbridge and Chryston) (Lab): </strong>I 
            have concerns about the tagging of young people and, if I get a chance 
            to speak in the debate, I will outline them. If members support that 
            measure and the Executive goes ahead with it, will the minister consider 
            putting a lower age limit on tagging, as is the case for ASBOs? There 
            is no provision for a lower age limit at the moment.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6441">6441</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <p><strong>Ms Curran: </strong>I am sure that we will discuss that when 
            we get to stage 2. However, with the greatest of respect to Elaine 
            Smith, her point misrepresents a wee bit our proposals for electronic 
            monitoring for under-16s. We regard monitoring for under-16s not as 
            a punishment, but as a way to help to support young people who are 
            in danger. It will be for the hearings system to determine what is 
            in the best interests of a child. It will take into account the broader 
            rights of the child and will decide whether tagging is inappropriate 
            for a child who is under 16.</P>
          <P>I have a further point on our electronic monitoring proposals. We 
            know that some young people can be at risk from their own behaviour, 
            to the extent that they are sometimes removed from the community into 
            secure accommodation. We believe that electronic tagging could be 
            a useful pre-emptive step in preventing young people from going into 
            such accommodation.</P>
          <P>The third theme of the bill is the recognition that antisocial behaviour 
            is not just about how people behave towards each other, but is about 
            their environment and community. Litter, fly-tipping, graffiti, excessive 
            noise and vandalism plague many of our communities. Without effective 
            action to tackle them, any attempt at regeneration and long-term improvement 
            will prove to be very shaky indeed. In that context, I confirm that 
            we propose to lodge an amendment at stage 2 that will provide local 
            authorities with additional powers to tackle graffiti.</P>
          <P>As the Justice 2 Committee pointed out, in too many communities throughout 
            Scotland a few unscrupulous landlords are renting out flats and houses.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh (Eastwood) (Lab): </strong>On the minister's 
            previous point about giving local authorities powers to tackle graffiti, 
            I believe that, through the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, local 
            authorities in England and Wales have powers to charge private and 
            public bodies for the removal of graffiti. Would the minister be sympathetic 
            to the inclusion of such powers in the bill?</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Curran: </strong>We will take forward such issues at stage 
            2, certainly in part, and I offer Ken Macintosh the opportunity to 
            discuss that point with me.</P>
          <P>I am rapidly running out of time.</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Indeed you are.</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Curran: </strong>The bill also contains proposals around 
            effective enforcement, fixed-penalty notices and the closure of premises.</P>
          <P>I move on to the proposal about the dispersal of groups, which has 
            received much public attention. I argue very strongly that the proposal 
            is a vital part of the bill. First, we must recognise that </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6442">6442</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>groups cause real fear and alarm in communities in Scotland. Secondly, 
            the problem is not currently being dealt with and communities are 
            suffering as a result. Thirdly, the new power in part 3 will give 
            the police an effective tool that it did not have before for dealing 
            with groups that cause problems.</P>
          <P>I assure members that we have listened to many of the issues that 
            have been raised with us. The police told us that they were concerned 
            about the direction power in section 21, so we will lodge amendments 
            at stage 2 to clarify the matter and to ensure the proper independence 
            of chief constables in relation to operational policing. However, 
            we believe that the proposal gives the police a time-limited and proportionate 
            power to disperse groups from a designated area. Those who oppose 
            the proposal must confront the reality of how people live in Scotland. 
            We live in a Scotland in which, in some areas, dispersal already happens, 
            because young people cannot walk down their streets at night and old 
            people are afraid to go out. That dispersal of people must end.</P>
          <P>We have never pretended that the new power of dispersal will solve 
            all the problems that groups cause in Scotland, but it will give hard-pressed 
            communities, who know what it is like not to be able to go out after 
            dark, and people in sheltered housing complexes that are routinely 
            targeted and harassed, a breathing space from their terrible experiences. 
            We owe it to those communities, who have pleaded for the power, to 
            give them the protection that the power will afford, despite the scorn 
            of those who supposedly know best.</P>
          <P>The committee reports on the bill are very substantial. We have given 
            them and will continue to give them great attention. The way in which 
            the committees have taken forward their work is a tribute to the processes 
            of the Parliament and we will consider that work in great detail.</P>
          <P>In conclusion, the bill is about getting the law right on antisocial 
            behaviour. The approval of its general principles this afternoon will 
            be a significant milestone in improving the lot of those who suffer 
            from antisocial behaviour. The bill represents a crucial part of our 
            comprehensive approach to antisocial behaviour.</P>
          <P>I move,</P>
          <P>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Antisocial 
            Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill.</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Before I call the 
            next member to speak, I advise that, given the loss of time, the debate 
            is heavily oversubscribed. It will be impossible to manage the debate 
            on the basis of six-minute speeches, so I will allocate members only 
            four minutes. I do so with great </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6443">6443</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>regret, but I hope that members understand why that is necessary.</P>
          <P>15:32</P>
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>This is an important 
            debate and I want to begin my speech with some general comments.</P>
          <P>First, as the minister said, antisocial behaviour destroys the quality 
            of life of too many individuals and undermines the fabric of too many 
            communities throughout Scotland. It is fair to say that all members 
            want to do more to equip communities to fight back. However, that 
            determination to do something must not lead us to suspend our critical 
            faculties. It is not enough just to do something; what we do must 
            be effective. We must be as convinced as we can be that what we do 
            will help to make the problem better and does not risk inadvertently 
            making it worse.</P>
          <P>Secondly, we should be aware that new laws are not always the best 
            solutions to problems. Sometimes the solution is more resources, the 
            better deployment of resources or a straightforward change in policy.</P>
          <P>Thirdly, we must ensure that debates about antisocial behaviour do 
            not&#151;even inadvertently&#151;become proxies for having a gratuitous 
            go at young people.</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Curran: </strong>Will Nicola Sturgeon tell me whether 
            I have ever said anything that could be interpreted as having a gratuitous 
            go at young people?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The minister is being a touch sensitive. 
            I did not refer to her; my comment was about the obligation that I 
            believe rests on all our shoulders to ensure that, when we talk about 
            antisocial behaviour, we do not allow our rhetoric to stigmatise young 
            people, however accidentally. The important point is that not all 
            people who behave antisocially are young and not all young people 
            behave antisocially; only a tiny minority do.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr Duncan McNeil (Greenock and Inverclyde) (Lab): </strong>Young 
            people are also victims.</P>
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>As Duncan McNeil is saying from 
            a sedentary position, many of them are victims of antisocial behaviour. 
            We must never punish young people simply for being young; instead, 
            we must provide them with the opportunities, the encouragement and, 
            where necessary, the support to channel their energies towards their 
            own development and that of their communities.</P>
          <P>I believe&#151;and I say this in an attempt to be constructive&#151;that 
            the punitive approach must be reserved for the minority of young or 
            old people who have no regard for the rights of others and </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6444">6444</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>whose behaviour cannot be tolerated. We could probably all agree 
            on that.</P>
          <P>I make those comments for the benefit of all of us in the chamber&#151;I 
            am not trying to be partisan or party political. Sometimes we would 
            all do well to reflect on the rhetoric that we use.</P>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab): </strong>On the issue 
            of not being partisan, does Nicola Sturgeon think that we should have 
            some respect for people whose experience of crime is directly as a 
            consequence of young people? In the past, I have identified male violence 
            as a problem. I have never been asked to apologise to all men in the 
            community before I make such comments. An issue arises when it is 
            assumed that people have to be defensive when discussing such issues.</P>
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>With the greatest of respect to 
            Johann Lamont, I do not think that all men are blamed for the behaviour 
            of a minority of men in the way that all young people sometimes tend 
            to be blamed for the behaviour of a minority. That is a very important 
            point.</P>
          <P>To conclude my general comments, I want to raise an issue that was 
            commented on by the committees: the fact that the bill can be seen 
            by some as being subjective.</P>
          <P>As drafted, the bill defines antisocial behaviour as conduct that</P>
          <P>&quot;causes or is likely to cause alarm&quot;.</P>
          <P>I do not think that there is anything wrong in regarding the problem 
            of antisocial behaviour from the perspective of the victim, but we 
            must be aware as legislators that what may cause harm to one person 
            will be water off a duck's back to another. At the extremes&#151;and 
            I stress the word &quot;extremes&quot;&#151;there are individuals 
            who would be alarmed by behaviour that could not, in any objective 
            sense, be considered to be a problem. That is why I believe, like 
            the Communities Committee and certainly the Justice 2 Committee, that 
            a test of reasonableness should be introduced to the bill. Conduct 
            would then be considered antisocial if it caused or was likely to 
            cause alarm to a reasonable person.</P>
          <P>Let me turn now to the specifics of the bill. Subject to some of 
            the suggestions that the committees have made, I support the majority 
            of the provisions in the bill. However, unsurprisingly, I want to 
            focus on the part of the bill that causes me most concern, which is 
            part 3, on dispersal powers.</P>
          <P>The Queen's counsel and new Labour peer Helena Kennedy says in her 
            latest book:</P>
          <P>&quot;The problem with New Labour and crime so far is that the government 
            is so afraid of appearing in any way liberal or soft that it goes 
            for measures that appear tough but are ineffective.&quot;</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6445">6445</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Those words could have been written about part 3 of the bill. Part 
            3 was supported by the Justice 2 Committee and the Communities Committee 
            only by the narrowest of margins. The overwhelming body of evidence 
            was against it.</P>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P>
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>I have to make progress. I have 
            been generous with interventions but I am running out of time.</P>
          <P>In effect, part 3 gives the police an additional ground for dispersing 
            groups of people. Under common law or statute, the police can already 
            move people on if they are committing an offence. If the proposals 
            in the bill are accepted, the police will be able to move people on 
            simply because they are gathering in an area that, after a very bureaucratic 
            procedure, has been designated as a no-go area. The police will be 
            able to disperse groups even if no offences are being committed; they 
            will be able to disperse groups just because the very presence of 
            the group is causing, or is likely to cause, alarm. Again, no test 
            of reasonableness is applied in that part of the bill.</P>
          <P>Arguably, a power that allows the police to disperse groups that 
            are committing no offences will do little to help to build relationships 
            between the police and young people. Crucially, that power will not 
            help the police to focus scarce resources on people who are genuinely 
            causing real problems in communities. The power may also result in 
            groups simply moving on to non-designated areas. The risk then would 
            be of a domino effect whereby, over time, whole towns and cities would 
            end up as designated no-go areas.</P>
          <P>Of course, we all want the police to deal more effectively with groups 
            of yobs who are making other people's lives a misery. We all know 
            people who are in that situation and we all have the same commitment 
            to wanting to help them to tackle the problem. It does not help when 
            any politician takes the moral high ground in that regard. However, 
            the police have said that they do not want or need extra powers. As 
            an aside, I ask the minister to make it clear today that no further 
            attempt will be made through the bill to introduce a political power 
            of direction over chief constables and that section 21 will be deleted 
            at stage 2.</P>
          <P>What the police and, by extension, the public whom they serve want 
            and need are the resources that will allow the police to use their 
            existing powers more effectively. Most people to whom I speak want 
            more police officers responding more quickly when they need them. 
            We should all listen to them. It is hard to see what possible vested 
            interest the police could have in opposing a measure if it was going 
            to make their job easier. </div>

          <P>I want to put on record a statement on which I hope that we can all 
            agree: our communities face a problem with antisocial behaviour. I 
            fully appreciate that the behaviour that is described in the bill 
            as causing distress and alarm is a real concern for communities throughout 
            Scotland. I see the mental and physical suffering&#151;I often see 
            both&#151;that can result from the intolerable stress, nuisance and 
            aggravation that antisocial behaviour brings. No one should have had 
            to put up with that in the past and no one should have to put up with 
            it now or in the future.</P>
          <P>I have had first-hand experience of such behaviour. In the scheme 
            in south Edinburgh where I live, my family, my neighbours and I suffered 
            a prolonged episode of antisocial behaviour at the hands, voice and 
            actions of an antisocial owner-occupier neighbour in our council block, 
            so I have every sympathy with people throughout Scotland who suffer 
            from intolerable behaviour in the schemes. I am not about to take 
            issue with what such behaviour does to the people and communities 
            that suffer from it, but I question the Executive's suggested approach 
            to dealing with it. That is the message that I want to send out today 
            to communities throughout Scotland.</P>
          <P>As I have said before in the Parliament, I believe that the Executive 
            is using the issue&#151;it is exaggerating the extent of the problem 
            to peddle as solutions measures that are mostly punitive, when it 
            knows full well from all the available evidence and historical lessons 
            that it will not eradicate the essential causes of antisocial behaviour 
            by that route.</P>
          <P>Numerous different organisations and bodies gave oral and written 
            submissions to committees, including the Justice 2 Committee, to which 
            I belong, in which they were critical or extremely critical of different 
            parts of the bill. As the minister </div>

          <P>knows, four out of every five organisations that replied to the consultation 
            exercise were opposed to some aspects of the bill. Children's charities, 
            human rights groups, Safeguarding Communities-Reducing Offending, 
            the police and law officers all had serious and varied objections. 
            They objected to the bill on the ground that existing law already 
            covered each eventuality and offence or on the ground that other routes 
            were better.</P>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
          <p><strong>Colin Fox: </strong>I will give way in a second, if the member 
            will give me a minute.</P>
          <P>Taken in the round, that evidence mounts up to a fairly large body 
            of criticism.</P>
          <P>The punitive approach that underlies the bill has been tried before&#151;by 
            Mrs Thatcher. I suppose that it was only a matter of time before new 
            Labour aped her on antisocial behaviour, too.</P>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
          <p><strong>Colin Fox: </strong>I will give way in a second.</P>
          <P>I had to laugh when I watched the Scottish Labour Party conference 
            on television, live from Inverness the other day. During the debate 
            on antisocial behaviour, critics&#151;including me&#151;were sneeringly 
            dismissed by the minister as middle-class journalists in their wine 
            bars. She said that such critics would not deflect the Executive from 
            giving communities what they needed.</P>

          <p><strong>Ms Curran </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></P>
          <p><strong>Colin Fox: </strong>I will give way to the minister, as I 
            mentioned her name.</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Curran: </strong>When I made my remark about middle-class 
            journalists, I was not referring to Colin Fox; I was referring to 
            middle-class journalists. I associate the member and his speech much 
            more with the vested interests that I attacked.</P>
          <p><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_9"></A>Colin Fox: </strong>I welcome 
            the minister's intervention, as I was just coming to that issue. I 
            thought that mentioning middle-class journalists and vested interests 
            was a funny way of putting her criticism. She did that because she 
            thought that dismissing the organisations that gave evidence to parliamentary 
            committees in that way would look good in the schemes. Mind you, it 
            is not likely that many people in the schemes were watching the Labour 
            Party conference on a Saturday afternoon on BBC2. As Duncan McNeil 
            is saying, it is more likely that they would be serving at the tables 
            of the wine bars that ministers who are on &#163;100,000 use to brief the 
            self-same middle-class journalists about various initiatives that 
            are described as being only one tool in the toolbox.</P>

          <P>I remember when Labour used to value the research and evidence that 
            was presented by distinguished criminologists. [<em>Interruption.</em>] 
            If Labour members were to listen, they might hear some of the other 
            evidence. Dr Lesley McAra and Professor David Smith at the University 
            of Edinburgh produced facts and figures, which the Executive tried 
            to rubbish, and the Scottish crime surveys between 1993 and 2000 showed 
            that crime rates fell in that period, as did the fear of crime.</P>
          <p><strong>Mr McNeil: </strong>Tell that to people in the estates.</P>
          <p><strong>Colin Fox: </strong>If Duncan McNeil would only listen, the 
            next fact will kill him. In 1993, the survey showed that 44 per cent 
            of respondents believed that crime was a serious concern, yet by 2000 
            that percentage was down to 8 per cent. [<em>Interruption.</em>]</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Order. The member 
            is in his last minute.</P>
          <p><strong>Colin Fox: </strong>As the minister said, building attractive 
            communities is one of the aims of the bill. The City of Edinburgh 
            Council has announced the closure of six schools and community centres. 
            Is that part of the Executive's toolbox of measures for building attractive 
            communities? That picture is replicated across Scotland.</P>
          <P>Labour's line is to say that communities are crying out for help 
            and that it wants to help. What has the bill got to offer in the drive 
            to build attractive communities? Nothing. There is plenty of money 
            for tagging, punitive initiatives, secure units and custody, but none 
            for the diversionary activities, leisure pursuits and youth programmes 
            that will engage the passions and energies of our young people.</P>
          <P>The Executive's approach is wrong. The reality is that it seeks to 
            undermine Kilbrandon and the young people who come before the children's 
            hearings system. We are trying to keep youngsters out of the criminal 
            justice system, yet the bill extends the use of antisocial behaviour 
            orders, which, when youngsters breach them, become offences that put 
            youngsters slap bang in the middle of that system.</P>
          <P>If I may, Presiding Officer, in the last second that is available 
            to me, I want to say that I disagree with the proposals on dispersal, 
            as is mentioned in my amendment. Young people should have the right 
            of freedom of association and the Executive ought not to take it away.</P>
          <P>I move amendment S2M-532.2, to leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; 
            to end and insert:</P>
          <P>&quot;does not agree to the general principles of the Antisocial 
            Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill because it believes that the most effective 
            way to address antisocial behaviour is through greater investment 
            in a wide range of community support services, does not believe that 
            the punitive </div>

          <P>measures contained in the Bill will address this issue, believes 
            that a fully-resourced Children's Hearings system represents the best 
            way of dealing with young offenders; does not believe that extending 
            the use of Antisocial Behaviour Orders to under-16s is appropriate, 
            and considers that, rather than creating extra legal powers such as 
            dispersal, the police should be provided with extra resources.&quot;</P>
          <P>15:46</P>
          <p><strong>Miss Annabel Goldie (West of Scotland) (Con): </strong>Despite 
            the recent concentration of public and political attention, antisocial 
            behaviour is not a new phenomenon. We should not be gulled by jargon 
            into thinking that it is. Sadly, behaviour that is offensive or causes 
            distress to another citizen has been a fact of life for centuries, 
            hence the development in Scotland of a comprehensive criminal justice 
            system.</P>
          <P>Indeed, the definition of antisocial behaviour that is used in the 
            bill was devised for the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. What seems to 
            have changed is the apparent mushrooming of the number of people who 
            behave more often in a manner that is unacceptable to law-abiding 
            citizens. The kernel question that has to be asked is whether that 
            pattern of behaviour arises out of too little law or because there 
            is not enough enforcement of existing law.</P>
          <P>I want to make clear that my party agrees, as does every other party, 
            that antisocial behaviour is the blight on and a nightmare for too 
            many of our communities. For that reason, we will support the general 
            principles of the bill, which we recognise as a genuine and sincere 
            attempt to address the problem. However, the answer to the question 
            whether the bill is regarded as a landmark piece of legislation or 
            as window dressing that simply slaps on a bit of lipstick to the face 
            of our criminal justice system depends on two things: first, the extent 
            to which our law is enforced, the new provisions are monitored and 
            the breaches are enforced; and, secondly, the substantive content 
            of the bill.</P>
          <P>The Executive will not be surprised to learn that I have grave reservations 
            about the first aspect. Those reservations are not borne out of some 
            bilious party-political prejudice, but are founded on fact. Mr Douglas 
            Keil told the Communities Committee:</P>
          <P>&quot;We can have as much legislation on the statute book as we like, 
            but unless we have police officers to deal with the problem, there 
            is little point in that legislation.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, 
            <em>Communities Committee</em>, 21 January 2004; c 479.]</P>
          <P>A further fact for the ministers is that, at the moment, only 140 
            police officers are on our streets at any one time throughout Scotland. 
            Many of them are doing things in other places, but they are not out 
            on our streets. A final fact on this subject is that, in New York, 
            the template for the reduction of crime and the restoration of law 
            and order is for </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6450">6450</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>there to be one policeman for every seven committed crimes, whereas 
            in Scotland there is one policeman for every 27 committed crimes. 
            That is why I have very serious concerns about the capacity of our 
            Scottish police forces to deal with the enforcement of existing law, 
            far less to cope with the deluge of new statutory obligations.</P>
          <P>I turn to the substantive content of the bill. In that connection, 
            I thank and pay tribute to my colleagues on the Justice 2 Committee. 
            However the bill may be painted, in essence it is a justice bill&#151;the 
            majority of its provisions relate to law and order. The Justice 2 
            Committee carried out a robust and forensic scrutiny of the bill and 
            I hope that our stage 1 report was of assistance to the Communities 
            Committee.</P>
          <P>The issue of principal concern to me and my Conservative colleagues 
            is part 3, which I was unable to support. We are not concerned because 
            we think that groups of two or more persons who are breaking the law 
            should not be dealt with&#151;they should be dealt with, and under 
            current law they can be dealt with if there are sufficient police 
            officers in our communities to enforce the law. It is interesting 
            that the only witness before my committee who supported the dispersal 
            powers in the bill was the Deputy Minister for Justice.</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Curran: </strong>I am aware of the arguments that Annabel 
            Goldie puts forward&#151;she does so with her usual attempt at persuasiveness. 
            However, one point perplexes me: if she and her party are so strongly 
            against the power of dispersal, why did Michael Howard and nearly 
            all the Tories vote for it at Westminster?</P>
          <p><strong>Miss Goldie: </strong>The context for the bill is the framework 
            of Scots law. I remind the minister that, in the criminal context, 
            Scots law is very different from English law. We have an amplitude 
            of available remedies, but they are not being enforced. If they are 
            not being enforced now, what perils may lie in wait for the subsequent 
            enforcement of the bill when it is enacted?</P>
          <p><strong>Karen Whitefield (Airdrie and Shotts) (Lab) </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></p>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></p>
          <p><strong>Miss Goldie: </strong>I am sorry; I am running out of time 
            and I do not propose to take any more interventions.</P>
          <P>Those members of my committee who were supportive of the dispersal 
            power described it as another tool in the box, but there are two difficulties 
            with that analogy. If there is no one to take the tool out of the 
            box, it is useless. If the tool, once taken out of the box, is found 
            to be unfit for the purpose, it is still useless. The dilemma of part 
            3 is that existing solutions are not being applied and the new provisions 
            do not provide a solution. </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6451">6451</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Part 3 will simply create a conveyor belt that will transfer groups 
            of people from area A to area B. No doubt when area B is then designated, 
            the group will move on to area C. Why not deal with the problem in 
            area A in the first place? It is frightening to me that this ill-thought-out 
            proposal could criminalise people who are not committing any criminal 
            act. That is illiberal, oppressive and excessive. Far from being a 
            tool in the box, part 3 is a case of mobilising a JCB to manicure 
            a toenail.</P>
          <P>We need greater accountability to local communities and transparency 
            in police operation, hence my party's suggestion of having directly 
            elected conveners of local police boards. The Executive may deride 
            that suggestion, but it is finding favour elsewhere.</P>
          <P>My colleagues will mention other aspects of the bill, but I echo 
            Nicola Sturgeon's concern that the children's hearings system should 
            be tied into any measures that will affect children and young people. 
            That is absolutely critical, but the minister's comment on the matter 
            lacked clarity.</P>
          <P>I confirm that we support the general principles of the bill, but 
            I hope that the minister will regard seriously the concerns that I 
            have expressed.</P>
          <P>15:53</P>
          <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>I am happy 
            to confirm that all the Liberal Democrat members will support the 
            principles of the bill, which we see as part of an overall package 
            to deal with antisocial behaviour and associated problems, such as 
            youth crime. Like other members, we recognise that the issue is a 
            major one. We believe that we need an all-embracing policy that involves 
            every department, nationally and locally. Margaret Curran has the 
            ability to bring together ministers and civil servants from all departments 
            to concentrate on sorting out communities and young people in those 
            communities. Getting departments and ministers to co-operate is a 
            Herculean task, but the minister is a female Hercules and I have high 
            hopes for her.</P>
          <P>Some members attended a meeting at lunch time about parks and green 
            spaces, during which the point was made that turning a derelict and 
            unused urban ex-playing field into a well-used and well-laid out attractive 
            park does a lot for the community involved and reduces antisocial 
            behaviour. That is one small example of the many measures that can 
            contribute to tackling the issue.</P>
          <p><strong>Karen Whitefield: </strong>Does Donald Gorrie accept that 
            the issue is not just about providing resources for communities? In 
            one community in my constituency, a lot of money has been spent on 
            a new community centre that was designed by </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6452">6452</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>young people, but the young people who cause difficulties prevent 
            other young people from accessing the services. That is unacceptable. 
            As well as putting resources into communities, we need mechanisms 
            and tools that the police can use to tackle such problems.</P>
          <p><strong>Donald Gorrie: </strong>I agree with that. It is important 
            to have youth workers and the police working together in the community 
            and on the street to deal with such problems. People are more important 
            than facilities.</P>
          <P>I hope that in due course the minister will manage to meet some of 
            the concerns that have been expressed by the Communities Committee. 
            Long-term funding and human resources must be put into youth work 
            and the voluntary organisations that help in that sphere of activity. 
            There is too much short-term funding. A lot of good programmes deal 
            with particular aspects of antisocial behaviour but people do not, 
            on the whole, know about them. We have to get the successes better 
            known and have them copied in more places. A lot of those programmes 
            suffer from the short-term funding that is the curse of voluntary 
            youth activity.</P>
          <P>There needs to be more investment in street youth work, community 
            activities and programmes, and leisure facilities, as well as places 
            to go. We need early intervention to help families when the children 
            are very young and are in danger of going down the wrong path.</P>
          <P>We need more mediation. Some good work is going on but there needs 
            to be more investment in mediation, in support for children's hearings 
            and in alternatives to custody, so that we stop young people offending 
            and reoffending.</P>
          <P>I suggest that we need a major programme to consult and involve young 
            people. Whatever the causes of antisocial behaviour, young people 
            have had a bad press in a sense. We have to confirm that we all acknowledge 
            the huge contribution that the majority of young people make. We want 
            to involve them and find out what they think and want in the way of 
            activities. I suggest that we hold a national and local campaign of 
            consultation with young people, as we did for communities in general 
            last summer.</P>
          <P>We could support some changes to the bill. All committees' reports 
            are taken on board by ministers who respond to them. The Communities

          <P>If each council had to do that, it would be a huge step towards tackling 
            antisocial behaviour.</P>
          <P>We also want to involve reporters and children's panels much earlier 
            and more thoroughly in such matters as applications for antisocial 
            behaviour orders, parenting orders, breach of parenting orders and, 
            in dealing with tagging, restriction of liberty orders. We need guaranteed 
            intensive support packages with parenting orders and restriction of 
            liberty orders. Those are mentioned in the bill, but the provisions 
            are not tight enough.</P>
          <P>On dispersal, we believe that there have to be serious and continuing 
            discussions with the police to form a sensible policy to distinguish 
            between the small groups of young people who cause problems and the 
            majority who do not. We should have community conferences that involve 
            mediation and youth work to try to stop those problems happening at 
            all.</P>
          <P>There are a lot of potential positives in the bill and we support 
            it on that basis.</P>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab): </strong>I welcome 
            the opportunity to speak in this debate, the curtailment of which 
            I regret. Many important aspects of the bill's proposals require full 
            examination. I hope that people have taken the time to read the Communities 
            Committee's report, which is measured and remarkably consensual. I 
            also hope that the minister takes on board some of its points.</P>
          <P>A feature of this debate has been the glib commentary about people 
            being intolerant or having motives that are wrong. People have to 
            move on and to recognise that antisocial behaviour is a serious and 
            complex problem. As public representatives, we have to wrestle with 
            important issues.</P>
          <P>I do not speak on behalf of the Communities Committee, but as its 
            convener I would like to thank the clerks, committee members, those 
            who visited local communities and those who gave evidence to the committee. 
            I thank the Justice 2 Committee, the Local Government and Transport 
            Committee, the Finance Committee and the Subordinate Legislation Committee, 
            all of which played a role in shaping the final report, which I reiterate 
            is a measured and serious response to the bill. The line spun by some 
            witnesses to the Justice 2 Committee received remarkable coverage, 
            which was not matched when the evidence was challenged by the Communities 
            Committee.</P>

          <P>I was interested to hear Colin Fox's comments about the problem being 
            exaggerated. I invite him to examine my caseload, in an average week, 
            of problems faced by people. I encountered four intractable problems 
            relating to private landlords on Monday alone, and today I was told 
            about the serious problems that are being caused by an antisocial 
            neighbour.</P>
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP): </strong>Johann Lamont's 
            constituency was mentioned by the First Minister on 8 January last. 
            He spoke about 150 youths gathering outside the home of an 80-year-old 
            pensioner night after night. Is she aware of such incidents?</P>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>I would be surprised if Tommy Sheridan 
            did not recognise that serious problems are caused by young people 
            gathering in Pollok. I will be keen to let people in Pollok know that 
            he does not regard such problems as serious, but as a means of making 
            a debating point. I have said that members are welcome to examine 
            my caseload, rather than diminish the seriousness of the problems.</P>
          <P>There is a fundamental inequality at the heart of this debate. Many 
            of the briefings that we have received on the bill are hostile to 
            the Executive's proposals. Members will not have received publicly 
            funded lobbying material from those who will pay the heaviest cost 
            for our inaction. The inequality in this debate is encapsulated for 
            me in the public denunciations of the bill throughout the media by 
            some of those who attended meetings of the Communities Committee and 
            other committees.</P>
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></p>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>Let me finish. The lack of coverage 
            of the comments of unions such as the Union of Shop, Distributive 
            and Allied Workers is in stark contrast to the evidence that we heard 
            from representatives of one community group, who had to ensure that 
            the cameras were switched off before they could open their mouths 
            in front of the committee.</P>
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Johann Lamont has criticised certain 
            misrepresentations that have been made during the debate and appealed 
            to people not to indulge in glib commentary. Will she do me the privilege 
            of conceding that not a single person in the chamber advocates inaction? 
            Those of us on this side of the chamber are advocating effective action. 
            If she admitted that, perhaps we would have a more constructive debate.</P>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>I would be interested to know whether 
            Nicola Sturgeon agrees with the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents,

          <P>current legislation. At the heart of the Communities Committee's 
            report is a sharp divergence between what the police and other groups 
            said to the committee and what people reported as having been said 
            to them by the police in their local communities. The bill will allow 
            communities to negotiate with the police and other agencies about 
            why they are not using the powers that&#151;allegedly and reportedly&#151;they 
            already have.</P>
          <P>I recognise that the debate has moved on. We no longer hear claims 
            that antisocial behaviour is not a problem&#151;we have shifted the 
            discussion that far. If one recognises that there is a problem, one 
            recognises that there is a need for voluntary measures, youth facilities 
            and so on.</P>
          <P>Ultimately, nobody was born believing in the power to disperse. If 
            one confronts a problem in one's local community, one owes it to the 
            community to implement solutions in a logical manner. One should examine 
            the problems rather than address them from a pre-determined set of 
            views that one brings to them. One should work with the local community 
            to see what the solutions are. The bill offers us some hope, which 
            will be dispelled if people undermine its provisions before the agencies 
            are given their new powers.</P>

          <p><strong>Campbell Martin (West of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>The seriousness 
            associated with problems related to antisocial behaviour is exemplified 
            by the fact that virtually every member can relate stories of how 
            such behaviour has affected people in the communities that they represent. 
            It is clear that antisocial behaviour can destroy the quality of life 
            of those affected by it, but it can also destroy the lives of those 
            involved in such acts.</P>
          <P>As parliamentarians, we need to recognise that some of the people 
            currently involved in those actions are a product of their environment 
            and of the circumstances in which they have grown up, and that those 
            circumstances have been dictated not by them, but by the policies 
            of successive unionist Governments. [<em>Laughter.</em>] That is actually 
            true.</P>
          <p><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab): </strong>Will the member 
            take an intervention?</P>
          <p><strong>Campbell Martin: </strong>No, thank you&#151;have a wee seat.</P>
          <P>As a member of the Communities Committee, I signed up to the general 
            principles of the bill. However, I have some concerns about certain 
            aspects of it, to which I hope the Deputy Minister for Communities 
            might refer in her summing up.</P>
          <P>I do not think that the Executive will achieve what it hopes to achieve 
            with respect to certain aspects of the bill. On the extension of antisocial

          <P>behaviour orders to people under 16, in the course of the Communities 
            Committee's evidence-taking sessions, I asked the officials with the 
            Minister for Communities, and the minister herself, why some local 
            authorities did not use their current powers in respect of ASBOs. 
            Unfortunately, neither the officials nor the minister could give a 
            specific answer about that; I think that that was because no one had 
            got round to asking councils why they did not use those powers. That 
            is a slight oversight, given that we are talking about extending that 
            provision. The minister gave a commitment to investigate the matter 
            further and to let us know why councils have not been using the powers 
            that they have. When the deputy minister sums up, she could perhaps 
            tell us the extent of that investigation and what the result has been.</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Curran </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></p>
          <p><strong>Campbell Martin: </strong>I would prefer ministers to use 
            their time at the end of the debate&#151;back benchers get only four 
            minutes.</P>
          <P>My other main concern is over what has become probably the most contentious 
            part of the bill: the power to disperse groups. From the evidence 
            given to the Communities Committee, it became very clear that the 
            police do not think that they need such a power and that they think 
            it unnecessary. The contention was made that the police would not 
            use the power if they had it.</P>
          <P>My concern, however, relates to the practicalities of policing the 
            policy. At the moment, if a group has gathered and the police are 
            called and turn up, the people in that group simply run away and the 
            police do not catch them. Under the bill, an area where people cannot 
            gather may be designated. If people gather there, and if the police 
            are called and turn up, the youths will run away and the police will 
            not be able to catch them. In other words, there will be no difference, 
            and the problem will still exist. That is the reality that we face 
            with the proposed power to disperse groups. We should not seek to 
            introduce legislation that will not make things better, but that is 
            what the power to disperse represents.</P>
          <P>Overall, I support the general principles of the bill at this stage, 
            but I ask the Minister for Communities and the Deputy Minister for 
            Communities to reflect on what, for me, was the consistent message 
            that came across from the people who gave evidence to the Communities 
            Committee. That message can be encapsulated in just one sentence: 
            we do not need more legislation; we need more resources, more police 
            and more funds to tackle the problem. People said, &quot;Give us the 
            money and we'll do the job that you've tasked us with.&quot;</P>

          <p><strong>Margaret Mitchell (Central Scotland) (Con): </strong>The 
            term &quot;antisocial behaviour&quot; covers a wide range of behaviour 
            and manifests itself in a variety of ways. Perpetrators' ages also 
            vary. One common feature is the distress, frustration and even intimidation 
            that are experienced by all people&#151;including shop workers, individuals 
            and whole communities&#151;who are unfortunate enough to be on the 
            receiving end of such behaviour.</P>
          <P>The Scottish Executive recognises the scale and extent of the problem. 
            Therefore, the general principles of the bill, which represent an 
            attempt to address this vexing issue, are to be welcomed. That said, 
            I genuinely believe that the Executive has missed an opportunity to 
            get to grips with the underlying causes of antisocial behaviour. Instead, 
            it has concentrated on the symptoms by producing measures that, while 
            attracting the attention of the media, are for the most part unnecessary 
            and superfluous, as existing statute law and common law can already 
            address antisocial behaviour.</P>
          <P>Much has been said about young people who offend, but it is young 
            people and their parents who have been most let down by the content 
            of the bill.</P>
          <P>I fully acknowledge that the Scottish Executive has attempted to 
            address the problem of parents struggling to cope with disruptive 
            youngsters through the introduction of parenting orders. Those orders 
            require the parent to comply with their terms, which are normally 
            that the parent must attend counselling or guidance for a maximum 
            of three months. That is good.</P>
          <P>Breaches of the requirements that are specified in the orders can 
            be a criminal offence. In so far as the measure requires the parent 
            to take their parental responsibilities seriously, it is to be welcomed. 
            However, the orders would not be fair or acceptable, and the legislation 
            would not be effective, if the requirements that are specified sought 
            to extend the principle of vicarious liability in criminal law so 
            that responsibility for the acts and omissions of the child was transferred 
            to the parent, even in circumstances in which a reasonable parent 
            could not have done anything further to prevent an incident of antisocial 
            behaviour.</P>
          <P>Parents are the key to addressing antisocial behaviour in young people, 
            but the success of any policy that attempts to promote parenting skills 
            depends on active parental co-operation. In other words, success involves 
            working in partnership with parents to curb a pattern of disruptive 
            or antisocial behaviour as early as possible. For the most part, that 
            co-operation is forthcoming. However, occasionally, as the minister 
            acknowledged, it is not. That is particularly the </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6458">6458</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>case if the parent's lifestyle is chaotic as a result of drink or 
            drug abuse or other factors. In those circumstances, the school environment 
            is all too often the most stable thing that children have in their 
            lives. That is why it is important that when a child begins school, 
            the head teacher should take the time and trouble to visit the reception 
            class regularly. In that way, they will establish a relationship with 
            new primary 1 pupils that will continue as the children progress through 
            the school. That, in turn, will help discipline in the school and 
            will minimise incidents of disruptive behaviour.</P>
          <P>Unfortunately, in too many schools, the head teacher moves on to 
            another post somewhere else before the relationship that they have 
            built up with the primary 1 children has had a chance to influence 
            the children's progress. Furthermore, head teachers are all too frequently 
            called to meetings outwith the school, as a consequence of which they 
            are often not present to deal with a particularly disruptive or violent 
            incident when it arises. As a result, incident is not dealt with on 
            the spot as effectively as it could be, which can lead to an escalation 
            of disruptive behaviour that translates into antisocial behaviour 
            outside the school gates.</P>
          <P>In conclusion, although the Executive recognises the principle of 
            early intervention, it has not fully grasped the opportunity to provide 
            measures in the bill to establish good practice for parents and others 
            who struggle to cope with antisocial behaviour in children.</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I have to hurry you.</P>
          <p><strong>Margaret Mitchell: </strong>I hope that the Executive will 
            take my comments on board at stage 2 and that it will rectify that 
            omission in order to make the bill a really effective piece of legislation.</P>

          <p><strong>Karen Whitefield (Airdrie and Shotts) (Lab): </strong>I welcome 
            the opportunity to speak in today's debate. The Antisocial Behaviour 
            etc (Scotland) Bill is a vital part of a range of measures that are 
            designed to improve Scottish justice and to help to make our communities 
            more secure. It is vital that the Parliament addresses the problem 
            and works to produce policies and legislation that will support communities 
            in their fight against antisocial behaviour. I will concentrate on 
            the main issues that were tackled by the Justice 2 Committee in preparing 
            its report to the Communities Committee.</P>

          <p></P>
          <P>Today, I have with me the rocks and stones of an equally outrageous 
            misfortune. The rocks in the bag that I am holding were handed to 
            me by a distraught constituent from Shotts. These stones were all 
            thrown at her windows in one night, and such behaviour happens night 
            after night.</P>
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>I hope that this is a helpful intervention. 
            Does Karen Whitefield agree that that behaviour is not antisocial 
            but criminal, and that it should be dealt with as such?</P>
          <p><strong>Karen Whitefield: </strong>I will answer that point directly. 
            I accept that it is criminal behaviour. Night after night, a group 
            of young thugs hangs out in the shadows on a path at the bottom of 
            my constituent's garden. If the police catch them in the act, they 
            can indeed charge them, but the problem is that they hang out there 
            night after night. We must deal with that problem; we must designate 
            that area and state that such behaviour will not be tolerated there. 
            These are real concerns, which cause real distress to my constituents.</P>
          <P>Much has been said about young people having the right of association. 
            I agree that young people have the right of association, but they 
            also have the responsibility that accompanies that right of ensuring 
            that their behaviour does not impact on and destroy the lives of hard-working 
            people throughout Scotland.</P>
          <P>It is also interesting to note that although some people undoubtedly 
            told the Justice 2 Committee that they were not in favour of the power 
            of dispersal, one senior police officer was brave enough to say that 
            there was a place for it&#151;that was said by the president of the 
            Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, John Vine. He said 
            that the introduction of the power of dispersal might have some benefits 
            and that it would be useful. In his recent interview in <em>The Courier</em>, 
            he said:</P>
          <P>&quot;In many respects, I support the intention behind its introduction.&quot;</P>
          <P>In taking on board all the evidence, we should remember that it is 
            not only those who are against the power who have the right to be 
            listened to.</P>
          <P>The bill includes provisions to introduce community reparation orders, 
            which will compel offenders to undertake between 10 and 100 hours 
            of unpaid work as reparation for their antisocial behaviour. That 
            vital tool will allow us to address offending behaviour and make young 
            people and others take responsibility for their actions.</P>
          <P>The Justice 2 Committee took a wide range of evidence on the extension 
            of restriction of liberty orders to under-16s. Unfortunately, a small 
            number of young people cause havoc in the communities in which they 
            live. The introduction of </div>

          <p></P>
          <P>RLOs for the most persistent offenders will help to protect not only 
            communities, because those young people will not be able to get out 
            and about, but the young people, as the RLOs will ensure that they 
            are no longer involved in situations, or associating with people, 
            that aggravate their behaviour.</P>
          <P>Children's charities including the Aberlour Child Care Trust and 
            NCH Scotland have said that it is vital that young people are allowed 
            to become involved in the development of antisocial behaviour strategies. 
            I could not agree more. I know from contact with young people in my 
            constituency that they demand that the Executive should take action. 
            In my constituency, a young person who is aged 17 is organising meetings 
            on behalf of his community.</P>
          <P>The bill will provide the assistance that communities in Scotland 
            are asking for. I urge members to support the motion.</P>
          <P>16:17</P>
          <p><strong>Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): </strong>I 
            make it clear that, in accordance with the partnership agreement, 
            I will vote in favour of the bill's general principles and against 
            the Opposition amendments to the motion. I will outline the reasons 
            why I hope that the Executive will think again on the need for part 
            3 of the bill, but an amendment to the motion to call for a review 
            of part 3 is not necessary or desirable at stage 1.</P>
          <P>As members may know, I believe firmly that the partnership agreement, 
            to which I have referred, is an excellent document. It is the product 
            of exhaustive negotiations between both Executive parties. I speak 
            this afternoon because, on two matters, the bill appears to depart 
            significantly from that agreement.</P>
          <P>The partnership agreement is absolutely clear on the electronic tagging 
            of our children. It says:</P>
          <P>&quot;We will provide sufficient secure accommodation and allow children 
            who might otherwise be in secure accommodation to remain in the community 
            through the use of electronic tagging.&quot;</P>
          <P>The policy memorandum that accompanies the bill makes it clear that 
            that is the reason why section 90 is in the bill. However, the Minister 
            for Communities has made it clear in her evidence that she believes 
            that the use of electronic tagging will not be restricted in that 
            way. I cannot see how that departure from the negotiated position 
            in the partnership agreement was arrived at. I do not want many more 
            of our children to be treated in that way. The point of the provision 
            in the partnership agreement was to keep children out of secure accommodation.

          <P>and progressive measure into an illiberal and backward measure?</P>
          <P>Part 3 deals with the dispersal of groups.</P>
          <p><strong>Karen Gillon: </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
          <p><strong>Mike Rumbles: </strong>No. I have only four minutes. If I 
            had been given the six minutes that we were told we would have, I 
            would certainly give way.</P>
          <P>The no-go, or banning, areas are illiberal and completely unnecessary, 
            according to many witnesses who gave evidence during stage 1. For 
            instance, Douglas Keil of the Scottish Police Federation said:</P>
          <P>&quot;Every police officer to whom I have spoken has said that there 
            are more than enough powers&quot;.&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, 
            <em>Justice 2 Committee</em>, 6 January 2004; c 435.]</P>
          <P>Many people are specifically concerned that our hard-won rights to 
            peaceful assembly are under threat and I have heard no reasons in 
            the debate so far as to why we should support what many people consider 
            to be draconian measures.</P>
          <P>I would like to know where those specific powers in the bill came 
            from; they did not come from the partnership agreement.</P>
          <p><strong>Karen Gillon: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P>
          <p><strong>Mike Rumbles: </strong>No.</P>
          <P>Having outlined my concerns about those two issues, I ask the deputy 
            minister to give me two assurances in winding up. First, I ask her 
            to assure me that in the stage 2 process, the Executive will return 
            to what was agreed in the partnership agreement about the electronic 
            tagging of our children to ensure that large numbers of our kids are 
            not treated in such a way. Our agreement made it clear that the use 
            of electronic tagging is to be limited. Secondly, I ask the minister 
            to think again about part 3 and the last-minute entry into the bill 
            of banning orders that are designed to give more powers to the police, 
            which they do not want.</P>
          <P>The whole point of negotiating a partnership for Government was to 
            ensure that we had detailed policy that both parties could support 
            in the Parliament until 2007. We had a mechanism inserted into the 
            agreement to sort out new policy that arose after the agreement was 
            signed, which involves regular meetings between ministers and party 
            spokespeople. In my own field of responsibility&#151;health and community 
            care&#151;that mechanism has worked well, but is obvious to me that 
            it has not worked for whatever reason in the approach to the bill.</P>
          <P>If the coalition is to work properly, ministers cannot deviate far 
            from agreements that have been reached. The partnership agreement 
            is in </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>danger of being breached on the two issues that I have raised. I 
            ask the minister to return to the partnership agreement and to address 
            those issues at stage 2. I do not want to debate them at stage 3, 
            and I want to ensure that stage 3 is not a divisive and controversial 
            process.</P>
          <P>16:22</P>
          <p><strong>Patrick Harvie (Glasgow) (Green): </strong>I will begin by 
            discussing the scale of the criticism of the bill, which all committees 
            have heard. There have been criticisms from the people who work with 
            and try to change antisocial behaviour, such as youth workers, community 
            workers, housing organisations, the voluntary sector and representatives 
            of the youth justice system.</P>
          <P>There is a huge body of opinion against the basis of the bill. To 
            dismiss those critics as being the usual suspects, vested interests 
            or people from the leafy suburbs&#151;as if anyone who lives near 
            a tree is incapable of reason&#151;is nonsense. It appals me to see 
            those people being dismissed in such a way.</P>
          <P>What criticisms do they make?</P>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P>
          <p><strong>Patrick Harvie: </strong>I will allow one intervention. The 
            member might want to make what she will say a point of substance later 
            on when I discuss the bill itself, although I will take an intervention 
            now if the member wants me to&#151;I do not mind.</P>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>I have a serious point to make. We 
            should recognise that we must listen to the people who live with the 
            problem of antisocial behaviour. People are working with and enduring 
            the problem. It does not help them to imply that, because some people 
            are organised and have bits of paper to send to us, what they say 
            should somehow have more weight in our committee system than what 
            those who raised the problem so that proposals could be brought forward 
            have to say.</P>
          <p><strong>Patrick Harvie: </strong>In my experience of the process 
            of listening to those people, the people who discussed the scale of 
            the problem were, by and large, from communities that are living with 
            the problem. I do not deny the passion and concern with which the 
            member responds to such experiences, but the people who made criticisms 
            were those who are working on the ground to try to change behaviour 
            and not those who are living with the problem. I point out that balance.</P>
          <P>I want to discuss subjectivity in relation to antisocial behaviour. 
            Several members have mentioned that antisocial behaviour is not the 
            same as crime. Crime involves a list of proscribed actions, but antisocial 
            behaviour is a concept that </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6463">6463</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>is defined by other people's emotional responses. It is quite clearly 
            defined in the bill as being based on some people's emotional responses&#151;fear, 
            distress and alarm. I do not deny the importance of those emotional 
            responses.</P>
          <p><strong>Karen Gillon: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P>
          <p><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_11"></A>Patrick Harvie: </strong>No, 
            thank you&#151;I have already taken an intervention.</P>
          <P>However, I am denying that the same is true of crime. Crime and antisocial 
            behaviour are fundamentally different concepts. It is inappropriate 
            for the response to the extreme situations that we have heard Johann 
            Lamont and Karen Whitefield describe to be applied to all antisocial 
            behaviour.</P>
          <P>I will mention a few specifics while I still have time. On involving 
            communities&#151;specifically young people&#151;in the strategies, 
            the difference between Karen Whitefield's opinion and mine is one 
            of emphasis. I would like to see a clear commitment in the bill to 
            wider involvement in consultation on strategies. The only people who 
            will be involved directly under the bill are local authorities and 
            the police. I want wider involvement than that.</P>
          <P>There has been criticism in respect of how tenants of registered 
            social landlords will be affected disproportionately by the use of 
            ASBOs, which have been seen traditionally as a housing-management 
            tool.</P>
          <p><strong>Karen Whitefield: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P>
          <p><strong>Patrick Harvie: </strong>No. I am sorry, but I am in my last 
            minute.</P>
          <P>I wish that I had time to move on to other issues, of which the dispersal 
            power is obviously the most important. The Minister for Communities 
            has said that it will be an effective tool, but there has been no 
            explanation of why the existing tools are ineffective. Problems of 
            gathering evidence, of police call-out times and of the design of 
            urban environments will remain even under the new power.</P>
          <P>Beyond the criticisms of what is in the bill, I say that there is 
            a lot missing from it; for example, there is no focus on the causes 
            of antisocial behaviour, no commitment to the welfare principles of 
            the children's hearings system and no respect for the organisations 
            that work to change behaviour. In some respects, there has also been 
            no mature approach to respectful disagreement. Just because we disagree, 
            we do not have to portray one other as being unconcerned with the 
            reality of the problem&#151;which I am not. If Labour members agree 
            not to portray me in that way, I will agree not to portray them as 
            playing to the gallery.</P>

          <p><strong>Cathie Craigie (Cumbernauld and Kilsyth) (Lab): </strong>It 
            is a pleasure to speak in today's debate and to know that measures 
            that will help to deal with the plague that is antisocial behaviour 
            are nearer to becoming law. As members will see from the Communities 
            Committee report and annexes, we listened to people of all ages from 
            throughout the regions of Scotland and we took evidence from recognised 
            representative groups and individuals. To me, the message that is 
            coming out loud and clear from witnesses and my constituents is that 
            people need protection from antisocial behaviour and our constituents 
            want to see Parliament take action to give them it.</P>
          <P>We need to support and offer protection to decent folk who are being 
            harassed and bullied by their neighbours, whether they live in public 
            or private sector housing, and we need to acknowledge the torment 
            that they are going through. Decent folk, whose lives are made a misery 
            by groups of youngsters who have no respect for themselves or their 
            communities, need our protection, too.</P>
          <P>The Communities Committee highlights the need for community involvement 
            and discussion and sees mediation and youth work as being necessary 
            options for communities. I agree totally with that, as do local authorities. 
            Local authorities, the police and the voluntary sector are working 
            with communities throughout Scotland and the committee acknowledges 
            that the Executive has to provide resources to local authorities in 
            particular in order to allow them to continue that work and implement 
            the provisions in the bill. However, where those intervention measures 
            fail and where unacceptable antisocial behaviour continues, perpetrators 
            need to know that they will have to face the consequences when they 
            go beyond the boundaries of common respect for individuals and property.</P>
          <P>The bill will offer a final line of defence for our long-suffering 
            individuals and communities. Members might have seen the briefing 
            paper on the bill from Shelter Scotland. I do not accept its interpretation 
            of the bill's impact and I believe that it is scaremongering. There 
            is absolutely no case for saying that the bill will dramatically increase 
            homelessness in Scotland. There is no evidence behind that claim; 
            indeed, there is no reason why the bill should increase homelessness.</P>
          <P>Shelter Scotland would also have us believe that the bill perpetuates 
            the myth that antisocial behaviour happens only in the social rented 
            sector. We have said many times before that it does not. Antisocial 
            behaviour orders, parenting orders, orders for dealing with noise, 
            measures for tackling fly-tipping and dispersal will affect all our 
            communities throughout Scotland regardless of </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>the tenure of the homes in them. People are being made homeless by 
            the antisocial behaviour of their neighbours, particularly in difficult 
            areas where the private landlords are taking over. People are forced 
            to leave their family homes because local authorities are unable to 
            identify the landlords and take action. I put on record my support 
            for the private rented sector and acknowledge the valuable service 
            that is provided by responsible and professional landlords.</P>
          <P>However, there are major problems where the rogue private landlord 
            exists. The bill does not go far enough to protect communities from 
            the blight that is antisocial tenants who live in private rented accommodation, 
            or to protect communities from private landlords who abuse the system 
            by buying property only as a means of investing money that they have 
            gained by illegal means. I welcome the commitment to introducing a 
            private housing bill, but there must be amendments to this bill that 
            will protect people and ensure that unlicensed private landlords are 
            registered.</P>
          <P>Let us not listen to the scaremongering of the few, but to the pleas 
            of the many ordinary decent folk who just want to live in peace and 
            quiet in the comfort of their homes. Let us listen to the young people 
            who tell us that they want to be able to walk down the street to their 
            youth clubs with their friends without fear of being set upon by idiots 
            and thugs.</P>
          <P>The message that I bring to the minister today from the people of 
            Cumbernauld and Kilsyth is that she should continue with the strategy 
            for dealing with antisocial behaviour, remain firm in her resolve 
            to deliver for our communities, be on their side and listen to what 
            communities are saying. They want action now.</P>
          <P>16:31</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne (South of Scotland) (SSP): </strong>The 
            Scottish Socialist Party recognises the widespread public concern 
            about antisocial behaviour in our communities. We welcome measures 
            to deal with litter, graffiti, noise nuisance and vandalism and the 
            proposals for mediation and restorative justice. However, the bill 
            will not address many of the problems in our communities and may exacerbate 
            them. Not only will it alienate groups of young people but&#151;by 
            providing harsher punishments for those who live in social housing&#151;it 
            reinforces the view that only social housing sector tenants are responsible 
            for antisocial behaviour.</P>
          <P>Margaret Curran talks about supporting people to change their behaviour. 
            I welcome that. However, I disagree that electronic tagging is the 
            best route to take. I do not want young people in placements in secure 
            accommodation to be locked </div>

          <P>up and not treated. I want the very small minority of young people 
            who cause problems in our communities, who are outwith the control 
            of their parents, who do not attend school and who create problems 
            in school to be taken into residential establishments where they can 
            be treated for their difficulties and problems. Alongside that, their 
            families should be supported. I do not want young people to be tagged 
            in their homes because they may end up beating up their siblings or 
            their mothers and may become more alienated than ever from the system.</P>
          <P>I believe that the children's panel system is excellent but, with 
            the best will in the world, children will not get treatment because 
            of the lack of resources. We need to examine electronic monitoring 
            with much more caution. We cannot just talk about it and say that 
            the resources are in place in the community to deal with it. Clearly, 
            they are not.</P>
          <P>I would like to discuss other aspects of the bill that the SSP and 
            I believe are wrong. What is the best advice in respect of dealing 
            with young offenders? It is that they should be kept out of the criminal 
            justice system. Colin Fox touched on that.</P>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>Does the member accept that the bill 
            tries to give children and young people messages early, so that they 
            are not lured into serious offending? The bill can be seen as a preventive 
            measure to ensure that that happens before we reach the stage at which 
            the police have to lift young people.</P>
          <p><strong>Ms Byrne: </strong>I do not accept that&#151;the problem 
            with the bill is that resources are not being invested in working 
            with children at an early age. Nursery nurses, who are fighting for 
            professional pay and who do a wonderful job with our young children, 
            could tell the member that they are able to identify many of the young 
            people who will later display the kinds of behaviour that we are discussing. 
            That has been the case for years. When I worked in a secondary school, 
            I spoke to nursery nurses who taught in one of the cluster primary 
            schools. They could name to me children in secondary 1 and S2 with 
            whom I was working in my base, trying to modify their behaviour. They 
            said that they knew the problems that existed, but there was no help. 
            There is still no help&#151;the situation has not changed. That is 
            the key to the problem.</P>
          <P>We want to keep young people out of the criminal justice system. 
            Although receiving an ASBO does not criminalise a person, breaching 
            one does and what is being proposed is that ASBOs will be slapped 
            on children who are as young as 12. The minister tells us that the 
            only 12-year-olds who will receive ASBOs will be the persistent offenders, 
            but that is the group that is most likely to breach them. When the 
            ASBO is </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6467">6467</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>breached, a criminal offence will be committed and the attempt to 
            keep children out of the criminal justice system will have failed 
            miserably.</P>
          <P>We should value children's panels, as I said earlier, but they are 
            being undermined by the extension of ASBOs to under-16s. Let us be 
            clear: the bill further undermines the children's hearings system. 
            Despite its being a brilliant system that is admired the world over, 
            we are going to leave it rusting in a shed. In the 1960s, the Kilbrandon 
            report established that youngsters' offending behaviour must be seen 
            in the round&#151;in other words, it said that there are explanations 
            for why offending behaviour occurs and only by addressing those can 
            we hope to turn the situation around. Proper treatment and early intervention 
            are required, but the holistic approach is entirely at odds with the 
            completely punitive approach that is taken by the bill.</P>
          <P>I will end by mentioning the lack of resources in our communities. 
            The chronic problems that face children's panels is one area in which 
            that is evident, and the shortage of social workers is another, as 
            are the cuts in youth workers and youth teams.</P>
          <P>I ask members to support the Scottish Socialist Party amendment.</P>
          <P>16:36</P>
          <p><strong>Mike Pringle (Edinburgh South) (LD): </strong>The bill has 
            the intention of relieving the undoubted pressures on communities 
            that feel that they are under pressure from some young people. Residents 
            and community groups from all parts of Scotland repeatedly report 
            instances of young people commenting or boasting, &quot;You can't 
            touch us.&quot; Such young people display little fear of the system: 
            there is indeed a general lack of respect for authority. As did Nicola 
            Sturgeon, Donald Gorrie and others, I point out that only a few young 
            people cause the problems. It is therefore vital that we do not brand 
            all young people as troublemakers. We must encourage all young people 
            to become active members of our communities and we must recognise 
            that almost all of them have a positive contribution to make. Many 
            young people are in the public gallery today, taking part in our democracy. 
            Is not that a positive thing? The bill will tackle the antisocial 
            behaviour of the few.</P>
          <P>The minister knows of a great initiative in my community that involves 
            a social inclusion partnership and a youth action team. The police 
            informed me yesterday that, since the start of the initiative, there 
            has been a 50 per cent reduction in phone calls from youths about 
            the antisocial behaviour of other youths in south Edinburgh. That 
            is the sort of initiative that we need throughout </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6468">6468</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Scotland. It is essential to remember that young people are most 
            likely to be the victims of antisocial behaviour.</P>
          <P>The root causes of antisocial behaviour are complex and varied. They 
            include family problems, parental criminality, poor parental control 
            and supervision, lack of parental care and consideration and problems 
            at school, such as non-attendance and lack of motivation. However, 
            I suggest that the biggest problem is often boredom. If young people 
            had greater opportunities to engage in positive activities, there 
            would be less antisocial behaviour. Donald Gorrie expressed that view 
            extremely well.</P>
          <p><strong>Karen Whitefield: </strong>As I said to Donald Gorrie, in 
            my constituency there is a community that has had more resources poured 
            into it than many others have. The issue is not only about engaging 
            young people and giving them activities; it is also about addressing 
            some of the causes of their offending behaviour and giving the police 
            the necessary tools to deal with it. If we simplify the debate and 
            pretend that it is only about providing community centres and new 
            community resources, we will fail to address the problem.</P>
          <p><strong>Mike Pringle: </strong>I reiterate that the biggest problem 
            is often boredom. If we give kids something to do, even if it costs 
            us money, we will help solve the problem.</P>
          <P>Part 2 deals with ASBOs and their extension to 12-year-olds. Initially, 
            I was extremely concerned about that proposal and there is no doubt 
            that much of the evidence that was given to the committee was not 
            in favour of such an extension. The Law Society of Scotland was concerned 
            because a breach of an ASBO will be a criminal offence, which will 
            result in under-16s having criminal records. The Association of Chief 
            Police in Scotland, however, welcomed the proposal. There was much 
            discussion about the involvement of the children's hearings system 
            and the Communities Committee recommended that the bill be strengthened 
            to ensure that, in every case in which an antisocial behaviour order 
            or an interim order is made in respect of a child, the sheriff will 
            require the principal reporter to refer the child's case to a children's 
            hearing. I am glad to hear that the minister has taken those comments 
            on board.</P>
          <P>As almost every member has said, the provisions in part 3 are clearly 
            the bill's most controversial proposals. For example, the Justice 
            2 Committee received no oral evidence in support of them. Indeed, 
            when I suggested to David Strang during the committee's evidence taking 
            that the police would not use the dispersal powers because they already 
            had the tools in the toolbox, he said that that was possible.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6469">6469</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Moreover, the chief constable of Lothian and Borders police yesterday 
            confirmed to me the view of the police force in my constituency: they 
            do not foresee circumstances in which they will use dispersal powers. 
            He said that use of the power would only displace the problem&#151;it 
            would not solve it. Nicola Sturgeon made that very point.</P>
          <p><strong>Karen Gillon: </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
          <p><strong>Mike Pringle: </strong>No, I will not.</P>
          <P>As a result, I understand why Nicola Sturgeon has lodged her amendment 
            to the motion and, indeed, I have some sympathy with it. I have no 
            doubt but that the Communities Committee will discuss the issue further. 
            I believe that my colleague Donald Gorrie has had a very constructive 
            meeting with the minister about various issues in the bill; further 
            discussions of that sort would be a positive step.</P>
          <P>There was also considerable concern about section 20 and, in particular, 
            section 21, which gives the ministers the right to influence police 
            operational matters. I think that the minister said at the beginning 
            of the debate that an amendment will be lodged on that matter at stage 
            2. I ask the deputy minister to confirm that in her closing speech.</P>
          <P>The final area of contention was restriction of liberty orders. Much 
            of the evidence that we heard was not in favour of tagging; indeed, 
            some witnesses suggested that an electronic tag could become a badge 
            of honour or status symbol. I agree with some of the concerns that 
            were expressed. However, the committee recommended that, in cases 
            in which the RLO was imposed by the court, there should be automatic 
            referral to the children's hearings system. I am content with that 
            approach.</P>
          <P>I am content with the bill at this stage and will support its general 
            principles.</P>
          <P>16:41</P>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>As my 
            colleague Annabel Goldie said, we support the bill's general principles, 
            which seek to address the blight that is antisocial behaviour. However, 
            we have some concerns, which have been raised both in committee and 
            during today's debate. In particular, I highlight the Scottish Police 
            Federation's comment that we need more police officers, not more legislation. 
            Moreover, ACPOS told the Communities Committee that the police have 
            never faced a situation involving a group of people that could not 
            be dealt with under existing powers.</P>
          <P>As far as Mike Rumbles's speech is concerned, I find it quite strange 
            that in the six months that the Communities Committee has been working 
            on the </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6470">6470</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>bill, the Liberal Democrat member did not once mention that the Liberal 
            Democrats have problems with measures in the bill such as the dispersal 
            of groups, or that the bill raises issues about the partnership agreement. 
            We have heard about no such problems until today.</P>
          <P>As for the comments that Johann Lamont, Karen Whitefield, the minister 
            and others made about dispersal powers, I understand that on BBC Scotland 
            today Chief Superintendent Tom Buchan, the divisional commander for 
            Motherwell and Wishaw, said of those powers:</P>
          <P>&quot;We didn't ask for the legislation, don't feel there is a need. 
            I would think long and hard before I would put it into use. It is 
            not addressing the issue.&quot;</P>
          <P>He also revealed that those views had been put to the Executive. 
            As a result, I ask the minister to clarify whether the First Minister 
            was aware of those comments, whether he lends them any weight and 
            whether he will continue to ignore the expert views of anyone who 
            disagrees with him.</P>
          <p><strong>Cathie Craigie: </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>My time has been cut, so I really 
            cannot give way. I also want to address issues that have not yet been 
            mentioned.</P>
          <P>Much of the media attention on the bill has concentrated on dispersing 
            groups, locking up parents, guidance of and ministerial powers over 
            chief constables, and the ned culture in Scotland in general. However, 
            parts 5, 7 and 8, which contain very important measures, have barely 
            been mentioned in today's debate. No doubt we will have more opportunity 
            to debate them over time.</P>
          <P>On parts 7 and 8, which relate to housing, there are concerns that 
            landlords might become the whipping boys for the personal conduct 
            of their tenants or indeed their tenants' visitors, over whom landlords 
            have no control. There is also concern that an antisocial tenant may 
            be rewarded by not having to pay rent and that the landlord may be 
            penalised by his property management being transferred to a local 
            authority.</P>
          <P>Statistics for the year ending 30 September 2003 show that although 
            local authorities made 20,725 applications for eviction, only 21 of 
            those cases resulted in eviction for antisocial behaviour. Given that 
            10 per cent of the bill relates to noise nuisance, I ask the Executive 
            to comment on the final sentence of paragraph 160 of the Communities 
            Committee report, which relates to noise nuisance and the current 
            provisions for dealing with it, particularly those under the Civic 
            Government (Scotland) Act 1982. The Scottish Parliament should clarify 
            the law rather than muddle it. I point out that the minister has incredible 
            power in that she can set the permitted level of noise.</P>

          <p><strong>Bill Aitken (Glasgow) (Con): </strong>She makes plenty.</P>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>My colleague Bill Aitken says that 
            the minister makes plenty of noise&#151;I would not say that. I make 
            no apologies for asking that we take into account our national musical 
            instrument&#151;the bagpipes&#151;when considering the permitted level 
            of noise.</P>
          <P>The bill addresses persistent offenders, but it also needs to address 
            persistent complainers. The likelihood that one will be alarmed and 
            distressed is different for each individual and is unique to the individual. 
            I take the point that the Justice 2 Committee raised about the test 
            of reasonableness. We need more clarification on that issue. Finally, 
            more should be done to examine why existing legislation is not sufficient 
            to deal with antisocial behaviour.</P>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson (Banff and Buchan) (SNP): </strong>Time 
            is running out not only for the debate but&#151;more crucially&#151;for 
            the many communities throughout Scotland that suffer from the effects 
            of antisocial behaviour and, ultimately, for the Executive if its 
            nostrums fail to fix the problems that we have all heard about and 
            recognise. However, we all know that and we are in suspense only about 
            whether what is proposed will deliver the remedies that are sought.</P>
          <P>It is my belief and my personal experience that no member of the 
            Communities Committee, of which I am a member, has remained unchanged 
            by the experience of visiting communities in eight regions, hearing 
            evidence of people's concerns and tapping into their experience. For 
            me in particular, as someone from the north-east and a traditional 
            east coaster, visiting west coast communities with particular problems, 
            especially in Glasgow, left me in no doubt that the comments that 
            Johann Lamont has long expressed on the subject of antisocial behaviour 
            draw on a deep and legitimate well of concern. I entirely accept that.</P>
          <P>The divergence that there may be between my colleagues and me and 
            the Executive parties is not in the analysis but in the prescriptions 
            that follow from that. We are briefly discussing today what is a large 
            bill, consisting of 13 parts and 112 sections. There are parts of 
            the bill about which we have said nothing. Part 1 of the bill is about 
            having a strategy, which is an excellent idea and I am happy to support 
            it. Part 2, which relates to ASBOs, is fine as far as it goes. I will 
            return to that point. Part 3 has been exercised considerably.</P>
          <P>At this point it is appropriate to refer to the experience that reporters 
            to the Communities Committee had when they visited Gilmerton and </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6472">6472</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>the Inch in Edinburgh. We found that there were significant problems 
            there, including physical intimidation and assault; attacks on pensioners 
            at bus stops; alcohol and drugs; public sex; under-age drinking&#151;which 
            was a major problem; and ball games to the early hours in an open 
            area adjacent to housing. When people complained, the situation escalated 
            into verbal and physical threats. Those are precisely the problems 
            that the bill seeks to address.</P>
          <P>However, the interesting thing there is not the description of the 
            problem but the response of that community and its leaders to the 
            problem. Before I describe the attempts to fix the problem, I should 
            say that they were led by a Labour councillor&#151;so I make no partisan 
            points on behalf of anyone in my party. The councillor had the initiative 
            and the guts&#151;as councillors and members of the Parliament should 
            have&#151;to bring community groups together, to hold public meetings 
            and to ensure that interim ASBOs were sought and obtained. The community 
            is also working on a ban on alcohol and nicotine products. Through 
            multiagency meetings, the community has shared information and put 
            in place acceptable behaviour contracts. It has received some money 
            from City of Edinburgh Council&#151;&#163;90,000&#151;which has helped. 
            It has also changed the physical appearance of the area and painted 
            shops with anti-vandal paint. It has found somewhere for the kids 
            to congregate&#151;unlike Karen Whitefield, I think that hanging out 
            is perfectly acceptable and indeed appropriate behaviour for youngsters.</P>
          <P>Mike Rumbles observes that there is nothing in the partnership agreement 
            that requires him to support the proposal to give the police powers 
            to disperse groups. I imagine&#151;although I did not read this&#151;that 
            the partnership agreement must contain something about blank cheques 
            and require him to support measures that the Government comes along 
            with at a later date. Perhaps he will explain that, although there 
            is not enough time for him to do so just now.</P>
          <P>Part 4 is on the closure of premises. There is a danger that areas 
            will be stigmatised in the long term, so an attempt to deal with the 
            few will be to the disbenefit of the many. Part 5, on noise, is fine. 
            Part 6, is on the environment. I think that litter problems in rural 
            areas will be addressed at stage 2.</P>
          <P>Part 7 is on housing and antisocial behaviour. Karen Whitefield and 
            others had considerable concerns about linking antisocial behaviour 
            orders to tenure. The extended powers in the bill will exacerbate 
            problems and will, of course, leave private owners entirely outside 
            the sanctions that will be applied to tenants. That is intrinsically 
            unfair and unreasonable and is likely to lead to problems in due course.</P>

          <P>I will skip ahead to part 10. Landlords, too, want reform and support 
            registration, because they want to get rid of the cowboys in their 
            business, as we all do. We must make rapid progress on that. On part 
            13, the minister should consider who is a &quot;relevant authority&quot;.</P>
          <P>I conclude by saying that I think that the Executive's policy is 
            based on weedkiller&#151;the attitude is, &quot;Let's spray it on 
            the problems.&quot; Perhaps we also need a little Baby Bio to support

          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Communities (Mrs Mary Mulligan): 
            </strong>This afternoon's debate has demonstrated yet again that antisocial 
            behaviour is a key issue for the people of Scotland and for their 
            representatives in the Parliament. That is exactly as it should be. 
            The Parliament's primary purpose is, after all, to improve the lives 
            of Scotland's people. Too many of our constituents' lives are ruined 
            by antisocial behaviour. The bill represents an important step forward 
            in our determination to put those people first.</P>
          <P>I take this opportunity to thank the people whom we met as we visited 
            communities, who gave us their views and helped us to structure the 
            bill.</P>
          <P>Most of my speech will be taken up with dealing with the points that 
            members made in the debate. However, let me first draw a few general 
            conclusions. Antisocial behaviour kills confidence and damages people. 
            It is a modern phenomenon that reflects an age-old truth: the weak 
            and the vulnerable will be picked on and victimised if the rest of 
            society silently stands by. The Executive is not prepared to be that 
            silent witness.</P>
          <P>Antisocial behaviour will not easily be eradicated. It is a complex 
            problem that requires sophisticated solutions. Margaret Curran made 
            clear our commitment to the whole range of interventions from prevention 
            through to sanction. They all have to be in place if we are really 
            to change behaviour, which is our ultimate goal. I am happy to reaffirm 
            that commitment here today.</P>
          <P>Our strategy to tackle antisocial behaviour must be seen within the 
            context of our wider policies on regeneration and social inclusion, 
            on improving the justice system, on supporting education, on the environment 
            and on housing. It supports and is supported by all those policies.</P>
          <P>Let me turn to issues that have been raised. Too many members have 
            attacked the bill and sought to do so on the basis that it is unfairly 
            aimed at young people. It is not. It is aimed squarely at those who 
            cause misery and fear in our communities, whatever their age may be.</P>
          <P></div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Someone once said that our children are our future. They were right. 
            The bill is about protecting that future. It is about ensuring that 
            young people can go to the youth club or to the swimming pool. It 
            is about protecting the young man I spoke to in Currie this week who 
            said that he had been on a bus that was pelted by stones, which shattered 
            the windows&#151;he had just been going for a night out with his friends.</P>
          <p><strong>Karen Gillon: </strong>Does the minister accept that some 
            of us on these benches find it galling that parties that want to make 
            it a criminal offence to disturb birds in their nests do not feel 
            that the Parliament should be taking action to protect the very people 
            she has just been talking about?</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>There can be no doubt that the Parliament 
            is determined to deal with the consequences of some people's actions. 
            However, some do not seem to see the reality of the situation.</P>
          <p><strong>Miss Goldie: </strong>Will the minister take an intervention?</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>I am sorry, but I cannot. My time 
            has already been reduced.</P>
          <P>I want to deal with Nicola Sturgeon's amendment. It asks us</P>
          <P>&quot;to review Part 3 of the Bill, in light of comments made by 
            the Communities and Justice 2 Committees&quot;</P>
          <P>on the dispersal power. Of course, we will study the reports of both 
            committees in detail and give serious consideration to the specific 
            points that they raise about the provisions in part 3 and elsewhere 
            in the bill. The Executive believes in the committee process and will 
            give the reports their due consideration without the encouragement 
            of what is a superficially innocuous amendment&#151;but is the amendment 
            innocuous? The plain fact is that Nicola Sturgeon cannot accept that 
            a majority in both committees supported the dispersal power. Make 
            no mistake: the amendment is not about a review and it is not about 
            taking the reports of committees seriously. It is about overturning 
            the considered views of those two committees, it is about removing 
            the dispersal power from the bill, and it is about a rather pathetic 
            attempt to inflict a bloody nose on the Executive.</P>
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>I have never had any objection 
            to doing that, but that is beside the point. During the debate, I 
            have made no secret of the fact that I oppose part 3. My amendment 
            asks simply for a review in light of the comments made by both committees. 
            The minister says that she will study those comments and take them 
            into consideration. Does that not simply add up to reviewing in light 
            of those comments? Would it not be in the interest of achieving some 
            consensus in </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>the chamber if the minister stopped playing on words and simply backed 
            the amendment?</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>And Nicola Sturgeon, of course, would 
            never play on words.</P>
          <P>The committees asked for a commitment to evaluate and report back 
            on the operation of the power. We have given that commitment. The 
            committees stressed the need for a comprehensive approach to problems 
            caused by groups&#151;an approach that would seek alternative resolutions. 
            We agree. The committees asked that we review the direction-making 
            power in section 21. We are doing so. The committees urged us to continue 
            discussions with the police about the practical arrangements for using 
            the power of dispersal. We are doing so. The committees also agreed 
            that, if necessary to give relief to hard-pressed communities, the 
            dispersal power should be introduced as a last resort. We agree. If 
            Nicola Sturgeon does not agree, she should have the courage to tell 
            us and those hard-pressed communities. She should not hide behind 
            the amendment.</P>
          <P>I will turn now to Mike Rumbles's concerns about the power of dispersal. 
            He asks where the power came from. It came from the communities and 
            it came from our listening to people. If we can see a problem and 
            can identify a way of resolving it, are we not right to act? I think 
            that we are.</P>
          <p><strong>Mike Rumbles: </strong>Will the minister give way?</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>No, I cannot; I do not have time.</P>
          <P>Mike Rumbles also asked about tagging. I reassure him that tagging 
            is not about punishment. It will be used only if it is in the best 
            interests of the child. We will use it only as part of a package of 
            measures that will support the child, keep them out of secure accommodation 
            and give them other options. We must consider tagging as an alternative 
            to secure accommodation. I hope that Mike Rumbles will view the issue 
            in that way.</P>
          <P>As ever, Johann Lamont spoke passionately about her constituents. 
            She also mentioned communities' concern that their views would not 
            be listened to in the same way that some of the professional views 
            would be. I, too, have heard that concern expressed on recent visits 
            to communities. It is incumbent on us to give the constituents of 
            Johann Lamont and other members the reassurance that the Executive 
            will listen to the views of the communities.</P>
          <P>At stage 2, we will have the opportunity to return to all the issues, 
            on many of which I have not had time to respond today. As I said at 
            the outset, the bill will improve people's lives. It puts ordinary, 
            decent, hard-working people and their communities first and for that 
            reason alone&#151;what </div>

          <P>17:03</P>
          <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> I 
            wish to speak against the motion, not because the Scottish Conservatives 
            take food safety lightly, but because, as we have stated regularly 
            in the past, the operation of what is a blanket ban unnecessarily 
            disadvantages our fishing communities. According to evidence that 
            a member of the Food Standards Agency gave at a meeting of the Health 
            Committee, the Irish end-product testing scheme is perfectly acceptable 
            to the European Parliament. Scallops from Ireland that have been the 
            subject of end-product testing can be sold here in Edinburgh, yet 
            our own fishermen cannot collect or sell their product in Scotland.</P>
          <P>The Executive's approach of not adopting end-product testing is denying 
            our valuable industry access to markets. If the balance of control 
            activity for monitoring were moved on to processors, it would be possible 
            to improve public safety, protect the industry and reduce the amount 
            of Government expenditure that is necessary to manage the problem. 
            I ask the minister to explain why the Executive will not move to end-product 
            testing.</P>
          <P>17:04</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care (Mr Tom 
            McCabe): </strong>We are in danger of repeating ourselves. I must 
            say again that our approach is predicated on the need to ensure public 
            safety and public health.</P>
          <P>Mr Davidson raises the specific issue of end-product testing, but 
            he does not say&#151;and we do not know&#151;how many scallops were 
            ruined when, </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6481">6481</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>through end-product testing, they were found to be contaminated. 
            They had to be destroyed, with all the consequential impact that that 
            had on stocks.</P>
          <P>Of course, end-product testing is an option, but the approach that 
            we have adopted in Scotland is to close boxes. After a period of time, 
            the toxins dissipate and the stocks can be fished again. There is 
            no loss. If we fish the stocks while the toxins are present and, through 
            end-product testing, those toxins are discovered, the stocks are automatically 
            lost&#151;there is no use for them.</P>
          <P>There is no universal view in the industry on whether end-product 
            testing is a better option. In addition to concerns about public health 
            and public safety, legitimate concerns arise about the overall conservation 
            of stocks. The Executive is anxious to avoid the unnecessary destruction 
            of fish stocks through an adherence to end-product testing and we 
            would rather use the existing regime. We recognise that a lot of time 
            and money is spent on the matter. The FSA is always active in its 
            consideration of alternatives.</P>

          <p><strong>Tricia Marwick (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP): </strong>On 
            a point of order, Presiding Officer. Earlier this afternoon during 
            the debate on the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill, I went 
            to the desk at the back of the chamber to ask for a copy of volumes 
            1 and 2 of the Communities Committee's report on the bill. I was told 
            that somebody would try to get me a copy, but one has not yet appeared. 
            Presiding Officer, I ask you to use your offices to ensure that, in 
            future stage 1 debates on bills, committee reports are available to 
            members who require them.</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Trish Godman): </strong>I agree

            final item of business is a members' business debate on motion S2M-913, 
            in the name of Sylvia Jackson, on Commonwealth day 2004. The debate 
            will be concluded without any question being put.</P>
          <P>That the Parliament recognises the valuable role of the Commonwealth 
            in strengthening relationships between nations across the world; welcomes 
            the continued contribution of Scotland and its people to those relationships; 
            reaffirms its support for the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary 
            Association, and commends the theme of Commonwealth Day this year, 
            &quot;Building a Commonwealth of Freedom&quot;, that raises important 
            issues of governance, democracy, human rights, citizenship, building 
            communities and development that are relevant to all peoples of the 
            Commonwealth.</P>
          <P>17:16</P>
          <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab): </strong>I welcome to 
            the gallery Don McKinnon, who is the secretary-general of the Commonwealth, 
            and the high commissioners. We are having a reception later so we 
            look forward to meeting them all then.</P>
          <P>I am pleased to be having this debate today. My colleagues in the 
            Scottish Commonwealth Parliamentary Association will be speaking about 
            different aspects of the work of the Commonwealth and of the association. 
            As everyone knows, Monday 8 March was Commonwealth day. This year's 
            theme was &quot;Building a Commonwealth of Freedom&quot;. The theme 
            reflects the Commonwealth's commitment to democratic freedom as expressed 
            by Commonwealth heads of Government at their summit in Coolum, Australia, 
            in March 2002. They spoke of the need for the organisation to be</P>
          <P>&quot;an effective defender of democratic freedoms.&quot;</P>
          <P>It also reflects the Commonwealth's commitment to freedom of expression, 
            the rule of law and robust civil societies.</P>
          <P>The Commonwealth works to promote many kinds of freedom. First is 
            the freedom to express oneself. Individuals have the right to say 
            what they think and to do what they believe in, as long as they respect 
            the rights of other people.</P>
          <P>Second is the freedom to develop. Sustainable economic development 
            and the freedom to trade enable individuals to earn a living and to 
            take care of their families. Third is the freedom to participate.</P>
          <P>There is also the freedom to learn. As a former teacher and teacher 
            trainer, I know that being able </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6495">6495</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>to attend school is important, because it gives young people the 
            opportunity to develop the skills that they need to lead fulfilling 
            lives.</P>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab): </strong>Does the member 
            accept that it is particularly important for girls to have access 
            to education, given the shocking number of girls and young women who 
            still do not have it?</P>
          <p><strong>Dr Jackson: </strong>I thank Rhona Brankin for making that 
            important point. Not many weeks ago we had a debate about science 
            education and the need to increase the number of girls who study physics 
            and engineering. The point is well made, and there is a much broader 
            point.</P>
          <P>There are two final points to make in relation to freedom. There 
            is the freedom to aspire, which covers the importance of equal opportunities, 
            and the freedom to choose. People have to have the right to elect 
            their leaders, vote for justice and say no to crime and corruption. 
            All those are laudable aims.</P>
          <P>Commonwealth day is an annual event during which all 53 member countries 
            celebrate their links with each other. There have been events up and 
            down the United Kingdom and worldwide. The centre of the activity 
            has been the UK, and the largest event was held at Westminster.</P>
          <P>I would like to speak about the Commonwealth's general background. 
            Some 53 countries throughout the world are involved in the Commonwealth. 
            People may not be aware that its total population is 1.7 billion, 
            or 30 per cent of the world's population.</P>
          <P>Commonwealth countries share certain common threads, such as a common 
            working language and similar systems of law, public administration 
            and education. Over the years, the Commonwealth has built on its shared 
            history to become a vibrant and growing association of states in tune 
            with the modern world.</P>
          <P>When we examine Scottish links with and influence on the Commonwealth, 
            it is clear not only that ties have been strong in the past, but that 
            they continue to thrive. We hope that the work of the Scottish CPA 
            is a real force for good in that regard.</P>
          <P>We are aware of Scotland's connections with Canada, Australia and 
            New Zealand. The Scottish CPA feels that it can do more to strengthen 
            links with Africa. We all know about David Livingstone and the Scottish 
            missionaries who brought education, health and Christianity to Africa. 
            There has been a Scottish influence in many African communities. Medical 
            clinics and churches are often built next to each other to show that 
            foundation.</P>
          <P></div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6496">6496</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>I know from my constituency that there are close Scottish links with 
            the St Andrew's Clinics for Children. Having spoken to constituents 
            who are involved, I know that there are Scottish links with clinics 
            in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Uganda and Zanzibar in Tanzania. The support 
            that is given by the clinics is basic, but it is effective. They plan 
            to provide 1,000 Nigerian children with insecticide-treated bed nets, 
            for example. One might think that that is a basic provision, but it 
            will do a great deal of good in that area.</P>
          <P>I gather that Dr Lorenzo Savioli, who works with the World Health 
            Organisation in Geneva, gave a Land Rover and a trailer to a project 
            in Zanzibar. That may appear like a small gesture, but it was a most 
            generous act that meant that mobile clinics could be held in remote 
            parts of the island of Pemba, two days a week, from January 2004. 
            Such small initiatives are helpful.</P>
          <P>The CPA, which was founded in 1911, is a unique forum. It involves 
            14,000 parliamentarians from all parts of the Commonwealth and has 
            become highly respected. Its Scottish branch was established in May 
            2000, after the first election of the regenerated Scottish Parliament. 
            The presidents of three Commonwealth countries, including Jerry Rawlings 
            from Ghana, came here during the first session of the Parliament. 
            Some 162 inward visits and 26 Commonwealth visits have taken place 
            since May 2000, including five visits by speakers from other Commonwealth 
            legislatures. The Scottish branch has strong links with Canadian provincial 
            legislatures. It has visited New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and 
            Quebec.</P>
          <P>As I said earlier, the Scottish branch of the CPA is looking elsewhere 
            to raise awareness more generally and to encourage people to re-engage 
            with the Commonwealth, particularly with Africa. It has contacted 
            the centre of African studies in Edinburgh, the Royal Over-Seas League 
            and the Council for World Mission, which have provided invaluable 
            information and advice on a variety of issues, including Scottish 
            education and health projects.</P>
          <P>I hope that our guests in the gallery have had an enjoyable time 
            in Scotland and have enjoyed their visit to the Scottish Parliament. 
            I hope that strong links continue to exist between the Scottish CPA 
            and our visitors.</P>

          <p><strong>Mr Keith Raffan (Mid Scotland and Fife) (LD): </strong>I 
            congratulate my colleague on the CPA executive, Dr Jackson, for initiating 
            this important annual debate. I join her in welcoming the secretary-general 
            of the Commonwealth, the high commissioners, the deputy high commissioners

          <P>and the students from various Commonwealth countries who are studying 
            in Scotland.</P>
          <P>In a recent speech, the secretary-general of the Commonwealth quoted 
            one of his predecessors&#151;the first secretary-general, Arnold Smith. 
            He talked about two of the greatest dangers that faced the world 30 
            years ago: the development of what Mr Smith called neo-isolationism, 
            degenerating into mere regional thinking&#151;becoming inward looking 
            and thinking only in European terms; and the danger of the growing 
            gap between the rich and the poor. Thirty years later, those problems 
            and dangers remain. Indeed, they have got worse.</P>
          <P>There are immense problems in sub-Saharan Africa, where 16&#151;nearly 
            a third&#151;of the Commonwealth countries are situated. It is the 
            only region to have grown poorer in the past 25 years; its share of 
            world trade has halved during that period; it receives less than 1 
            per cent of direct foreign investment; an estimated 44 million children 
            do not go to school there; and it contains 10 per cent of the world's 
            population, yet 70 per cent of people inflicted with HIV/AIDS&#151;nearly 
            29.4 million people according to a recent estimate. In our own Prime 
            Minister's words:</P>
          <P>&quot;Africa is the scar on the conscience of the world.&quot;</P>
          <P>I welcome the Prime Minister's announcement of his international 
            commission for Africa along the lines of the Brandt commission, which 
            is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the policies towards Africa&#151;of 
            what has worked and of what has not worked. The commission is due 
            to report next spring, which will coincide with the UK's presidency 
            of the G8 and will be just before our presidency of the European Union. 
            The commission for Africa will consult widely, and I hope that this 
            Parliament's proposed CPA delegation to Africa in the summer will 
            submit a report to the commission.</P>
          <P>I strongly support, and warmly welcome, the Chancellor of the Exchequer's 
            proposal for an international finance facility to provide long-term 
            guaranteed funding to the poorest countries by the richest countries. 
            It is a bold initiative, which seeks to raise the amount of development 
            aid from just over &#163;50 billion a year today to &#163;100 billion a year 
            in the years leading up to 2015. That would help us to meet our internationally 
            agreed millennium goals; it would ensure that every child had primary 
            schooling; it would radically reduce infant and maternal mortality; 
            it would effectively tackle HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and hepatitis 
            in the developing world; it would halve world poverty; and it would 
            halve the number of people who do not have access to safe drinking 
            water and sanitation. The proposal is bold and visionary, and it deserves 
            the support of all political parties in this country. In effect, it 
            is a Marshall plan for the developing world.</P>

          <p></P>
          <P>In the recent speech, to which I have referred, the Commonwealth 
            secretary-general emphasised the importance of fair trade and economic 
            development. Although many poor countries have removed their trade 
            barriers, many developed countries have failed to reciprocate. The 
            World Bank has estimated that, were we to do so&#151;and I hope that 
            we will when the Doha round restarts&#151;by opening up our rich countries' 
            markets to poor nations, we could lift up to 144 million people out 
            of poverty by 2015.</P>
          <P>We in Scotland can play our part and do our bit to help, and I will 
            give just two examples. There is a partnership between Lothian NHS 
            Board and Zambia. The board shares expertise on the delivery of antiretroviral 
            therapy and is helping to train health professionals. It shares methods 
            to encourage testing and to deal with the stigma and discrimination 
            around HIV/AIDS. Fife Council allowed the headmaster of Pitteuchar 
            East primary school, Ian Macaulay, a year off to work in Malawi, a 
            country that is afflicted terribly by AIDS, where teachers are being 
            lost as fast as they are being recruited&#151;7,000 of them are currently 
            HIV positive&#151;and the classes contain over 300 pupils. Those are 
            the kinds of initiative that the Scottish Executive needs to encourage.</P>
          <P>In the oft quoted words of John Donne,</P>
          <P>&quot;No man is an Island ... every man is ... a part of the main&quot;.</P>
          <P>That has never been more true than in this year of globalisation. 
            We all live in one world, in one community and in one family. The 
            problems of one member are the problems of us all. In helping to resolve 
            those problems, Scotland has an important role to play.</P>
          <P>17:29</P>
          <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I 
            support what my parliamentary colleagues have just said and I commend 
            to the Scottish Parliament the theme of this year's Commonwealth day: 
            building a Commonwealth of freedom.</P>
          <P>The Scottish branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association 
            was established in May 2000. As Sylvia Jackson said, it has organised 
            a great many inward Commonwealth visits and has hosted the British 
            islands and Mediterranean regional conference. The 19<SUP>th</SUP> 
            Commonwealth Parliamentary Association seminar will be hosted in Scotland 
            in 2007, which is very exciting for the profile and standing of the 
            Scottish branch of the association and for Scotland as a whole.</P>
          <P>As Sylvia Jackson said, Commonwealth day is celebrated each year 
            by all 53 of the developed and developing nations, which comprise 
            a staggering 1.7 billion people of different </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6499">6499</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>nationalities, religions and cultures. The theme&#151;building a 
            Commonwealth of freedom&#151;is one that the Scottish Parliament should 
            commend, support and endorse. John Stuart Mill said:</P>
          <P>&quot;If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one 
            person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified 
            in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be 
            justified in silencing mankind.&quot;</P>
          <P>President Roosevelt summed up the theme of freedom in his speech 
            about the four great freedoms: freedom of worship, freedom of expression, 
            freedom from fear of armed aggression and freedom from want. Perhaps 
            the most important of those freedoms is freedom from want, particularly 
            in the context of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia and India. I stress 
            that that freedom is important to us all. Should we not all be allowed 
            to live in a house with a roof and to have clean water to drink, food 
            to eat and education for our children? The Commonwealth family believes 
            that we should, which is why educational scholarships, basic literacy 
            training, AIDS and HIV education and awareness, immunisation programmes, 
            health aid and many other initiatives are and should be in place.</P>
          <P>Scotland has a considerable number of Britain's most highly qualified 
            and trained individuals and it is incumbent on us to share, contribute 
            and exchange our valuable knowledge, resources and practices to benefit 
            others. We should continue to build on our good international relations 
            through the Scottish branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, 
            with other Parliaments and at a technical level, and we should continue 
            to encourage maximum participation and contact between the Scottish 
            Parliament and important Commonwealth establishments.</P>
          <P>I repeat what Sylvia Jackson said&#151;we are extremely glad that 
            the Commonwealth high commissioners and consul generals, as well as 
            Commonwealth students who are studying at our universities and academics 
            and business people who have links to the Commonwealth, are with us 
            tonight. I pay tribute to the excellent work of Don McKinnon. He has 
            made a substantial and lasting contribution, of which we are proud. 
            We are delighted that he is with us tonight. [<em>Applause.</em>]</P>
          <P>In the debate two years ago, I said that the Commonwealth brings 
            a touch of healing to a troubled world. Scots have shown a commitment 
            to improving the lot of mankind throughout the Commonwealth, through 
            medicine, education, engineering, construction, science and administration. 
            That is a record of which we in the Scottish Parliament can be justly 
            proud.</P>
          <P>We are right to support and be part of such a valuable global organisation, 
            which has the power and the vision to help others. We should be proud 
            of our country's commitment to the </div>

          <p></P>
          <P>Commonwealth and we should continue our hard work in the knowledge 
            that we have made a difference and will continue to make the world 
            a better place for all people.</P>
          <P>17:33</P>
          <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP): </strong>Like others, I 
            congratulate Sylvia Jackson on securing the debate and I welcome our 
            distinguished guests in the galleries.</P>
          <P>Much of what I was going to say has been touched on by my colleagues 
            on the executive committee of the Scottish branch of the Commonwealth 
            Parliamentary Association, but I want to mention, from a personal 
            point of view, one or two issues that confront us.</P>
          <P>Although saying that the world is a small place trips off the tongue, 
            the sentiment applies particularly to the Commonwealth, because, despite 
            all the geographical differences, it is easy to make and retain contact 
            with the countries that make up this family of nations.</P>
          <P>I remember that my brother and I had a stamp collection when we were 
            children. We used to go through strange stamps that were bought in 
            obscure ways or were sent to us&#151;I am not sure how it all happened. 
            My parents always insisted that we had an atlas so that we could look 
            up countries to see where the stamps came from. The stamps often came 
            from faraway places with strange-sounding names, although I assure 
            the minister that I will not burst into song.</P>
          <P>Many of the countries were originally part of the empire but they 
            joined the Commonwealth and gained their independence. They are sovereign 
            nations within the community of nations and they are proud of that. 
            I confess that there is a wee bit of envy in me that so many others 
            have managed to gain independence while Scotland seems to have found 
            doing that more than a little bit difficult. I remember that, in the 
            1970s, Tuvalu, a place that I had not heard of, was given its independence 
            in a two-page bill&#151;Princess Margaret was sent out for the flag-lowering 
            ceremony&#151;while we struggled with the lengthy, complex details 
            of a minor Scottish Assembly bill. The interesting fact is that all 
            those nations have remained in the Commonwealth, because they do not 
            want to sever ties with it.</P>
          <P>When we have held similar debates over the past few years&#151;particularly 
            last year&#151;the cloud of Zimbabwe has hung over us. That cloud 
            has not gone away. Zimbabwe was suspended from the Commonwealth. There 
            is no easy solution to the complex problem in Zimbabwe, which I find 
            distressing, having visited the country and having happy memories 
            of meeting people there. When I hear other politicians talking about 
            regime change, </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6501">6501</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>I often think of Zimbabwe. Perhaps the Parliament should address 
            that issue.</P>
          <P>The executive of the Scottish branch of the CPA agrees that the African 
            countries should be our priority this year. That is not to ignore 
            our other partners, who are immensely valued, but we regarded our 
            priorities as lying in Africa. I hope that all members of the Parliament 
            agree that that is where the priorities should lie.</P>
          <P>I am fascinated that Lesotho has emerged on the pages of our newspapers. 
            I have visited that little country, but I suspect that few people 
            who were shown a map of Africa would be able to point it out. The 
            fact that Prince Harry is there has given it a bit of publicity. I 
            am sure that the Scottish Parliament's &quot;University Challenge&quot; 
            team would have been able to find Lesotho on a map if that was a starter 
            for 10.</P>
          <P>We must think about such areas. Quite rightly, as locally elected 
            MSPs, we talk about the impact of the shortcomings of public services 
            on the daily lives of our constituents but, given the lack of services 
            in many areas of sub-Saharan Africa, which face drought, famine, HIV/AIDS 
            and civil war, we are truly blessed compared to the people who live 
            in those areas. We should count our blessings. The shortest sentence 
            in the Bible is, &quot;Jesus wept.&quot; Quite honestly, we, too, 
            should weep for some of the difficulties that the people in those 
            areas face.</P>
          <P>The theme is freedom, but freedom requires a level of socioeconomic 
            standards and the achievement of goals. My ambition is to see the 
            provision of clean, available drinking water for everyone, which could 
            do more to save lives than anything else. Is it not a bit hypocritical 
            that we are arguing about Coca-Cola selling processed tap water as 
            pure water while people in Africa do not even have a tap?</P>
          <P>17:37</P>
          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I am delighted 
            that we are having this debate. The first line of Sylvia Jackson's 
            motion states that we recognise</P>
          <P>&quot;the valuable role of the Commonwealth&quot;.</P>
          <P>I think that everyone present recognises that. There are few people 
            who do not. I recognise it so much that, even when Scotland is independent, 
            I will be pushing for it to remain part of the Commonwealth.</P>
          <P>Sylvia Jackson mentioned the number of countries that are part of 
            that great organisation, which comprises 1.7 billion people. A heck 
            of a lot of people around the world are part of the Commonwealth.</P>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>The Harare declaration of 1991 called for the promotion of democracy 
            and good governance, human rights, the rule of law, and sustainable 
            economic and social development. Commonwealth members from the developed 
            world should look to those great goals and help the underdeveloped 
            world to attain them. The Singapore declaration of 1971 set out the 
            principle of international co-operation to promote peace and tolerance 
            and to combat injustice, but here we are 30-odd years later and we 
            are still having to aspire to adhere to that principle.</P>
          <P>Co-operation sounds wonderful&#151;it is how the Commonwealth should 
            be run&#151;but we have to examine the problems with member states 
            over the past few years. Thankfully, Fiji has been reinstated as a 
            full member, but Pakistan is still suspended. Moreover, after we suspended 
            Zimbabwe, Mr Mugabe took it out of the Commonwealth. Although we have 
            a spirit of co-operation, that does not mean that the basic principles 
            that were set out Singapore in 1971 and reaffirmed in Harare in 1991 
            should be ignored. Nobody should be able usurp those principles. I 
            have particular respect for Mr McKinnon for taking those principles 
            seriously while trying to deal with, for example, the situation in 
            Zimbabwe. He took a pragmatic view of the situation and tried hard 
            to improve matters. Sadly, however, that did not work.</P>
          <P>Margaret Ewing and Keith Raffan spoke about Africa. We are all aware 
            of the awful problems there. Margaret Ewing summed them up well by 
            saying that some people cannot even get a decent drink of water.</P>
          <P>Another area of the Commonwealth for which I have particular love 
            and affection is the southern Pacific. I hope to visit many of the 
            islands this summer&#151;I might even end up in New Zealand. I mentioned 
            Fiji, but there is also Kiribati, Samoa, the Solomon Islands and all 
            those places that were once very young members of the Commonwealth 
            and are now very old members of it. Before I say how wonderful they 
            are, I should add that I am a trustee of a charity called Just World 
            Partners, which is registered in Scotland and does sterling work in 
            the southern Pacific islands. The head office is just down the road, 
            in Dalkeith. It is currently working in Fiji on environmental conservation 
            of the coral reefs. We also have projects in Kiribati and the Solomon 
            Islands.</P>
          <P>Work is still going on even in areas that we do not hear much about 
            nowadays and member states still co-operate to ensure that we can 
            do everything that we can for all of those members that are not as 
            fortunate as some of us are.</P>
          <P>Keith Raffan mentioned the millennium development goals. One of the 
            best things that the </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6503">6503</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>Parliament could lobby the United Kingdom Parliament about is to 
            try hard to reach some of those goals. We should start by matching 
            the United Nations' recommendations for development aid, especially 
            goal 7, and we should do so immediately.</P>
          <P>17:42</P>
          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I, 
            too, welcome the debate and congratulate Sylvia Jackson on securing 
            it.</P>
          <P>The Scottish Parliament is only five years old and is a relatively 
            new Parliament in world terms. As a result, we can learn much from 
            other countries. I hope that, because we are a new Parliament, there 
            are also things that we can share with other countries.</P>
          <P>We live in world of many circles, of which the Commonwealth is one. 
            It is important that the Parliament plays a full role in circles such 
            as the Commonwealth in order to make a contribution to the wider world. 
            Of course, I wish that Scotland was an independent member of the Commonwealth. 
            We are not at the moment&#151;that is a few years down the line&#151;but 
            powers have been devolved, so we have the opportunity to make a contribution.</P>
          <P>I remember when I represented the Parliament at the Commonwealth 
            conference, at which there were 500 parliamentarians from 50-odd countries. 
            We met in Australia in 2001. I was there as part of the Scottish delegation 
            with Cathy Jamieson, the Labour MSP who has since gone on to higher 
            things. We sat at the conference as the duo from Scotland; we had 
            a saltire in front of us, which was the first time that that had happened. 
            For a week or so, we were able to pretend that Scotland was there 
            as independent country. We were able to make a contribution. There 
            was a huge, warm welcome from the other countries for Scotland's presence.</P>
          <p><strong>Christine May (Central Fife) (Lab): </strong>The member suggests 
            learning from other Commonwealth members. Will he join me in paying 
            tribute to and expressing gratitude to those many citizens of Commonwealth 
            states who have played a part in the academic, social and economic 
            life of this country? Does he agree that we have learned from them 
            and from the contributions that they have made?</P>
          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>I am happy to agree with the member. 
            She makes an important point. However, it is also important to say 
            that Scotland's contribution to many Commonwealth countries down the 
            centuries has sometimes not been positive. We in Scotland, and people 
            throughout the UK, should remind ourselves that we have a </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6504">6504</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>debt to repay to many of those countries. We should keep that at 
            the forefront of our minds.</P>
          <P>The Commonwealth can play a key role in two specific areas. First, 
            it can play a role in partnership and co-operation with Parliaments 
            in order to improve their accessibility to their electorates. It can 
            also use information technology to improve democracy and, of course, 
            ensure that all the Parliaments learn from one another in scrutinising 
            their respective Governments.</P>
          <P>The second area that is extremely important is that of discussions 
            around issues of international development. At the conference in 2001, 
            the biggest and most important issue, which all the delegates wanted 
            to talk about, was international development and the impact on their 
            countries of globalisation.</P>
          <P>Commonwealth day was 8 March. Just two weeks before that, the World 
            Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation presented to the 
            International Labour Organisation an important report entitled, &quot;A 
            Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for All&quot;. The report 
            states:</P>
          <P>&quot;There are deep-seated and persistent imbalances in the current 
            workings of the global economy, which are ethically unacceptable and 
            politically unsustainable.&quot;</P>
          <P>The report goes on to draw conclusions from its analysis, two or 
            three of which are devastating. It found that the income gap between 
            the richest and poorest countries was widening significantly. In 1960-62, 
            the average annual income was $212 for the poorest countries in the 
            world and $11,417 for the richest. By 2000-2002, the figures had risen 
            to $267 for the poorest countries and $32,339 for the richest.</P>
          <P>The report goes on to talk about</P>
          <P>&quot;a world in which 22 industrialized countries representing only 
            14 per cent of the world's population dominate about half the world's 
            trade and more than half of its foreign direct investment.&quot;</P>
          <P>It also states:</P>
          <P>&quot;Net overseas development assistance (ODA) flows have been decreasing 
            and are far below the long-standing target of 0.7 per cent of GDP&quot;.</P>
          <P>The report is important, because it calls for a reform of world governance, 
            which is what Commonwealth countries are looking for. I hope that, 
            despite the fact that Scotland is a small country, we can contribute 
            to the call for the reform of international bodies such as the International 
            Monetary Fund and the World Bank. I hope that when members of Commonwealth 
            Parliaments get together, we can reach conclusions on those issues 
            so that members can go back to their respective Parliaments and try 
            to get their Governments to sign up to the changes. We have to get 
            results from the Commonwealth, especially given that the Scottish 
            Parliament is </div>

        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>sending its representatives overseas. I hope that the Scottish Executive 
            representative who is about to speak will indicate the Executive's 
            support for reforming governance globally so that we can improve the 
            quality of life not only here in Scotland but particularly for the 
            rest of the members of the Commonwealth who desperately need to improve 
            their standard of living.</P>
          <P>17:47</P>
          <p><strong>The Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services (Tavish 
            Scott): </strong>It is a delight to speak in a debate in which so 
            many members have spoken with eloquence, care and passion about not 
            only the Commonwealth but the world around us. Across the parties 
            is a deep longing for a better world, which has been reflected in 
            so much of what we have heard this evening. I join other colleagues 
            in thanking Sylvia Jackson for introducing the subject for debate 
            and I share her sentiments in welcoming the Commonwealth secretary-general 
            and the high commissioners who are present with us this evening and 
            who will be present later on as well, courtesy of our Presiding Officer.</P>
          <P>This is a useful occasion on which to consider the arguments surrounding 
            the work of the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, 
            the Scottish branch of which is here in Edinburgh. I had the pleasure 
            of going on a CPA visit to Quebec a couple of years ago with Rhona 
            Brankin, John Young and Mike Russell&#151;Mike and John no longer 
            grace this Parliament, but Rhona still does. The visit was a special 
            occasion and was about learning not only from Quebec but from all 
            the Canadian provinces about their ways of doing things, their governance 
            and their style of relationships. That answers Richard Lochhead's 
            last point to some extent, because just as he and Cathy Jamieson were 
            in Australia a couple of years ago&#151;I rather suspect that Cathy 
            might have a slightly different perspective on that visit compared 
            to Richard Lochhead's&#151;it is important that our parliamentarians 
            take opportunities to learn from colleagues throughout the Commonwealth.</P>
          <P>The Commonwealth is a symbol of positive, constructive and peaceful 
            international interaction. It is founded on the principles of liberty, 
            democracy, international peace, the rule of law and equal rights for 
            all. This nation's contribution to the Commonwealth in the past in 
            building communities and in development is undeniable. Scotland is 
            a land of pioneers; history records the role of Scottish explorers, 
            engineers, doctors and missionaries in the countries of the Commonwealth. 
            Sir David Steel gave me a particularly good example of that missionary 
            work yesterday. He argued that the Scottish influence </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6506">6506</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>on the Commonwealth is that there was no conscious separation of 
            the spiritual from the temporal in its development.</P>
          <P>Sir David also recalled this splendid tale. In the then Rhodesia, 
            the development of a strong Christian consciousness of the worth and 
            dignity of the individual was fostered by the spread of education. 
            Amid some tension at a school, a list of grievances was presented 
            to the principal by one of the senior boys. He paused at the end of 
            his speech, bowed and concluded by saying to the principal:</P>
          <P>&quot;Sir, we thought it right and proper that this matter should 
            be brought before you in this fashion, so that government of the students, 
            by the students and for the students shall not perish from this mission 
            station.&quot;</P>
          <P>In passing, I take Mrs Ewing's point about modern-day Zimbabwe, as 
            we all do.</P>
          <P>Scotland has many growing links and contacts with countries in the 
            Commonwealth. Last year, Scotland hosted the 15<SUP>th</SUP> conference 
            of Commonwealth education ministers&#151;as my colleague Peter Peacock, 
            the Minister for Education and Young People, pointed out to me a moment 
            or so ago. I understand that Don McKinnon was present at the conference, 
            which had the largest turnout of any such conference to date and was 
            recorded by all as a considerable success.</P>
          <P>Scotland also held the first ever education youth summit of the Commonwealth. 
            Young people from every country, overseas territory and Crown dependency 
            in the Commonwealth participated in discussions on subjects that covered 
            a substantial agenda for the future. Their conclusions and recommendations 
            were part of the final Edinburgh communiqu&eacute;. In that way, their 
            impact on education across the Commonwealth will be both valuable 
            and far reaching.</P>
          <P>Learning and the pursuit of knowledge&#151;issues that Sylvia Jackson 
            very properly raised&#151;are Scottish traits and are a Scottish theme 
            in the development of the Commonwealth that continues to this day. 
            For the past two years, Kelvin School in Glasgow has enjoyed links 
            with a school in Nigeria that teaches deaf-blind children. Kelvin 
            School has been involved in sending Braille material and equipment 
            to Nigeria. Earlier this year, two teachers from Nigeria visited Kelvin 
            School as part of exchange programmes.</P>
          <P>Recently there was a study visit to Nova Scotia involving teachers 
            from throughout Scotland. The visit was based on the cultural and 
            heritage links between the two areas, including Gaelic language teaching. 
            Anderson High School in my constituency is part of the global classroom 
            project and has links with two South African schools. One, Langa High 
            School, is in the heart of Cape Town's </div>
        <p class="orcolno">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col6507">6507</A></p>
        <div class="orindent">
          <p></P>
          <P>oldest township community. The other is the South Peninsula High 
            School. Anderson High School students were at Langa High School in 
            February&#151;just a month or so ago. At the first conference, a Langa 
            student said:</P>
          <P>&quot;We live daily with the consequences of a past your country 
            left us with.&quot;</P>
          <P>A Shetland student responded:</P>
          <P>&quot;We have to understand each other and this certainly is helping 
            us to do that.&quot;</P>
          <P>Anderson High School is an island school with an international outlook. 
            That is an objective that all our schools should aspire to meet.</P>
          <P>Scottish universities are reaching out to provide the high-quality 
            education that they can offer to students around the world. The University 
            of Dundee's faculty of education and social work and the Department 
            of Education are building capacity at the Botswana College of Distance 
            and Open Learning. The team is training staff to deliver distance 
            learning to rural Botswana from six outreach centres and is delivering 
            staff development to strengthen basic education and training in Botswana.</P>
          <P>The issue of the role of the Scottish Executive has been raised. 
            Government can play a more direct role. Following a proposal made 
            by the Lord Advocate at last April's Commonwealth law ministers conference, 
            the Scottish Executive is offering a series of placement opportunities 
            for lawyers from other Commonwealth countries in the office of the 
            Scottish parliamentary counsel. The trawl, which was co-ordinated 
            by the Commonwealth Secretariat, resulted in a positive response from 
            the countries concerned. A senior state attorney from the Ministry 
            of Justice and Constitutional Affairs in Uganda will take up the first 
            placement in September this year. As a global citizen, Scotland has 
            a role in ensuring that the knowledge that we are privileged to have 
            is transferred as widely as possible. Teaching is fundamental to ensuring 
            that that knowledge transfer takes place.</P>

          <P>In closing this important debate for our young, evolving, new Parliament 
            and in illustrating how important Commonwealth Day is, I can do no 
            better than to quote Jordan Smith, a young, visually impaired lad 
            from Anderson High School in my constituency. When visiting Cape Town 
            High School earlier this year, he said:</P>
          <P>&quot;I'm never going to see the world ... but I want to know as 
            much about it as I can.&quot;</P>
