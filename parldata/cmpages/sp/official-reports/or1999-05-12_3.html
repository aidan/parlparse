<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have the opportunity
to make a short speech and I want to begin with the words that I have always
wanted either to say or to hear someone else say: the Scottish Parliament,
which adjourned on 25 March 1707, is hereby reconvened. [<i>Applause</i>.]&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I could not say those words until all members
had been sworn and the Parliament really had been convened.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is an historic day and, after a long
time in politics, I am aware that we owe a debt to many who are not here,
who did not live to see the promised land. I would like to mention a few
people from across the parties: Arthur Donaldson, Robert McIntyre, Alick
Buchanan-Smith, Johnny Bannerman, Emrys Hughes, John Mackintosh and John
Smith-today is the fifth anniversary of his death. I would also like to
mention my colleague Allan Macartney, who so nearly lived to see the day.
There are many others, but I have been able to mention only the people
who have been my friends. Many people are named in the history books; many
are not, but all of them have made this moment in history possible. I give
my thanks to every one of them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As everyone knows, I have been a member
of two Parliaments. I spent eight years in the House of Commons and I have
spent 23 years in the European Parliament-which does not sound so long
if it is said quickly. Until July, I will be the mother of the European
Parliament. I hasten to add that I am not the oldest member of that Parliament,
although I am the oldest one here, which is very disconcerting-I think
they must have made a mistake on my birth certificate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have several practical and sincere hopes
for the Parliament. The first is that we try to follow the more consensual
style of the European Parliament and say goodbye to the badgering and backbiting
that one associates with Westminster.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, in the House of Commons, I found
that there was a Speaker's tradition of being fair to minorities. I am
an expert in being a minority-I was alone in the House of Commons for three
years and alone in the European Parliament for 19 years-but we are all
minorities now, and I hope that the Presiding Officer, whoever that may
be, will be fair to each and every one of us.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My next hope is that this Parliament, by
its mere existence, will create better relations with England, Wales and
Northern Ireland, and I believe that to be in the hearts of the peoples
of all of those countries.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My last practical hope is that everyone
who was born in Scotland, some of whom, like me, could not help it, and
everyone who chose Scotland as their country, will live in harmony together,
enjoying our cultures but remaining loyal to their&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In Europe and in the wider world, there
is a bank of good will towards Scotland. I was privileged to visit 28 third-world
countries as a member of my third world committee. I met many heads of
state of struggling countries with problems who asked what was taking the
Scots so long. I know that there will be a great deal of good will from
all those countries.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have served on the Lom&eacute; assembly,
which is made up of the European Parliament plus half of the world. One
of our proudest moments was when Lom&eacute; came to Inverness and we agreed
the declaration of Inverness, which became part of international law. In
that declaration, we swept away the last vestiges of apartheid. Thus, we
played a constructive role on the international stage, earning the admiration
of everyone who attended the assembly, from Africa, the Caribbean and the
Pacific.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On behalf of my party, I pledge to make
this Parliament work. All of us here can make it work-and make it a showpiece
of modern democracy. It is no secret that, to members of the Scottish National
party, this Parliament is not quite the fulfilment of our dream, but it
is a Parliament we can build a dream on. Our dream is for Scotland to be
as sovereign as Denmark, Finland or Austria-no more, no less. However,
we know that that dream can come true only when there is total consensus
among the people of Scotland, and we accept that.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

1707. I have chosen a passage by Lord Belhaven, who was an opponent of

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Ewing:</strong> The election shall proceed
in accordance with rule 11.9 of the standing orders of the Parliament.
Members should wait in their seats until a clerk indicates to them that
they should collect their ballot paper from the back of the chamber. Two
tables have been set up for this purpose. The table on my left-hand side
should be used by members with surnames beginning with the letters A to
M-but not Mc or Mac-while the table on my right-hand side should be used
by members whose surnames begin with Mc, Mac or the letters N to Z. Members
should give their names to the clerk, who will hand them a ballot paper.
Members should then proceed to one of the four voting booths, where they
should vote by marking an X on the ballot paper. Members should then put
the folded ballot paper in the ballot box, which is situated in the well
of the chamber, before returning to their seats.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Each candidate can nominate one scrutineer
to monitor the counting of votes. Will candidates ensure that the name
of their scrutineer is notified to the clerks at the tables at the back
of the chamber at the time that they collect their ballot paper. I shall
announce the names of the scrutineers and invite them to the vote counting
table in the well of the chamber at the end of the voting period.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

is absolutely untraceable and the votes will be counted openly on the table

a point of order, Dr Ewing. Will you give us guidance on whether we can
have an open, recorded vote rather than a secret ballot? We have waited
for our first Scottish Parliament for nearly 300 years-indeed, this is
our first ever democratically elected Scottish Parliament-and the Parliament
was supposed to herald a new era of open democracy, but our first vote
is to be a secret one. That seems rather strange. Surely we should behave

there is an open, recorded vote on every occasion, including the election
of the Speaker. Would you be prepared to accept, from me, a motion that
we have an open recorded vote rather than a secret ballot on this important,
historic, first vote of our first ever democratically elected Scottish
Parliament?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
