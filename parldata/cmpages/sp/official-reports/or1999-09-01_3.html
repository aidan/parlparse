(South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>On a point of order, Presiding Officer.
Like other members, I am somewhat embarrassed at having been awarded a
medal. I was unaware that I was worthy of a medal, but I think that this
is a serious issue. The medals, according to the business bulletin, are
a presentation from the Parliament. I am unaware of the Parliament, or
any of its committees, ever having discussed the matter. I think that it
is somewhat premature to award medals; the people of Scotland may want
to award medals after we have done our job of work. Will you inquire into
how this has happened?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):
</strong>I am happy to inquire into the matter. The medals were apparently ordered
before the Parliament came into being and they commemorate the opening
ceremony. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body is not answerable for
them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_4"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael
Russell: </strong>Will the corporate body let the members know how this happened?
I think that most members are concerned about it-[<i>Interruption.</i>]
Well, they should be concerned about it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>We shall
take that on board.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_6"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alex Neil
(Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>On a point of order, Presiding Officer. I
would like some guidance on the Scotland Act 1998. I think that I am right
in saying that, under the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish Executive has
no power to surrender its authority to the UK Government departments in
London to draft concordats between the Government at Westminster and the
Scottish Parliament covering such critical issues as inward investment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As no such legislative authority exists,
is it the case that the Scottish Executive cannot agree to such concordats
without the explicit approval of this Parliament? Will you confirm that
this Parliament has the legal right to reject or amend any such concordats?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I do not
think that that is correct, Mr Neil. However, I shall take further advice
on the matter. The concordats are informal documents; they do not have
a status requiring parliamentary approval.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</strong>We come now to the first item of business, the business motion. I call
Tom McCabe.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_11"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McCabe:
</strong>A modern Scotland for a new age. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thank you, Sir David. This motion sets
out the business for this week and for the period up to Thursday 9 September.
Before moving the motion, it might be helpful if I explain some of its
detail. Subject to the Parliament agreeing the terms of this motion, the
business for today will be as follows.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First, there will be a statement from the
Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning on the proposed closing of
the Continental Tyres factory at Newbridge. After that, there will be a
debate on an Executive motion on the promotion of public health in Scotland.
That will be followed by a formal motion to designate lead committees for
Scottish statutory instruments. Decision time will be at 5 o'clock and,
after that, there will be a members' business debate on motion S1M-90,
in the name of Mr Duncan Hamilton, on the regeneration of Cowal.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tomorrow, 2 September, we will begin proceedings
on the Parliament's first bill. The Mental Health (Public Safety and Appeals)
(Scotland) Bill aims to close the loophole in the law that was identified
in a decision issued by the sheriff at Lanark sheriff court on 2 August.
The bill is the result of intensive discussion and preparation and reflects
the urgency given by the Executive to blocking that legislative gap.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first item of business will be a debate
for up to an hour and a half on a motion to treat the mental health bill
as an emergency bill. That debate will be followed by an immediate decision.
Providing that that decision is in the affirmative, it will be followed
by a Parliamentary Bureau motion on the timetabling of the mental health
bill. Stage 1 consideration of the bill will take place immediately after
the timetabling motion. The debate will last for an hour and a half and
will, again, be followed immediately by a decision. On conclusion of stage
1 there will be a motion on procedures for stages 2 and 3 of the Mental
Health (Public Safety and Appeals) (Scotland) Bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The afternoon session will begin at 2.30
with question time lasting 30 minutes, as normal. That&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">will be followed
by open question time, which will last for 15 minutes. At 3.15 there will
be a debate on an Executive motion on a national cultural strategy for
Scotland. Decision time will take place at 5 pm. That will be followed
by a members' business debate on motion SM1-94, in the name of Maureen
Macmillan, on the subject of domestic violence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Turning to next week, on Wednesday 8 September,
business begins at 2.30. The first item of business will be a motion on
a financial resolution required in relation to the provisions of the emergency
mental health bill. Following on from that there will be a further motion
on the timetabling of the debates in stages 2 and 3 of that bill. The remainder
of the afternoon's business will be allocated to stages 2 and 3 consideration
of the Mental Health (Public Safety and Appeals) (Scotland) Bill. On this
occasion, due to the nature of the emergency legislation, decision time
will take place at 6 pm. Due to the fact that decision time has been moved
to a slightly later time, no members' business is planned on Wednesday
8 September.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Thursday 9 September, the morning sitting
will begin with a debate on an Executive motion on the programme for government.
The debate will be concluded after question time in the afternoon. Immediately
before lunch, I will move the business motion in respect of future business.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Question time will begin at 2.30, lasting
for 30 minutes, and open question time will follow on for a further 15
minutes. Thereafter, we will conclude the debate on the Executive motion
on the programme for government. At 4.30 on Thursday 9 September, there
will be a debate on a Parliamentary Bureau motion on time for reflection.
That debate will be followed by a motion on membership of the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association. Following that there will be motions to approve
the Scottish statutory instruments. Decision time will take place at 5
pm, followed by a members' business debate, which, subject to a revision
of the text in a motion from Mr Nick Johnston, will be on the subject of
employment in Clackmannanshire and West Fife.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The final part of the motion sets out the
dates by which committees, other than the lead committee, with an interest
in subordinate legislation currently before the parliament, should make
any recommendations on instruments or draft instruments to the lead committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><strong><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):</font></strong><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
The next item of business is the ministerial statement from Mr Henry McLeish
on the proposed closure of the Continental Tyres factory at Newbridge.
There will be questions at the end of the statement, so there should be
no interventions during it. Members should note that we will move on to
the next item of business at 3:10, so we have about 25 minutes for this
particular item, should we need it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">14:40</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning (Henry McLeish): </strong>I am glad that I was spared the technological
exercise that Tom had. I was a bit apprehensive about touching the movable
podium that has now arrived in front of me.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With your permission, Sir David, I would
like to make a statement on Continental Tyres. On 18 August, Continental
Tyres announced the closure of its Newbridge plant with the loss of 774
jobs. I do not have to tell anyone in the chamber of the devastating impact
that that news had on the individual workers involved, especially after
their efforts over the past couple of years to ensure the viability of
the plant. Local managers and the work force had implemented a new shift
pattern, and had also increased their working week from 39 hours to 42
hours without any financial recompense.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Despite all that, the company decided to
announce the closure-a commercial decision that was based on a number of
factors. The Newbridge plant had been losing money over a number of years.
Continental's share of the market for the tyres that are produced at Newbridge
has fallen significantly and shows no signs of recovery. The company's
restructuring strategy includes large, low-cost, high-value production
facilities in eastern Europe, Mexico and other locations worldwide. None
of those reasons, of course, brings any comfort to the people that are
affected by them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Government and its officials have been
in close touch with the company-here and in Germany-for a number of years,
offering advice and assistance. The Newbridge plant is not in an assisted
area; nevertheless, when the plant brought in a new shift to improve production
levels, and therefore viability, Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd was
able to offer assistance with the training of new workers who were recruited
to meet the demands of the new shift patterns.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Officials from the Scottish Office, Locate
in Scotland and LEEL were able to offer advice&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">about how the company
could maximise the amount of training assistance that could be offered.
The company was also aware of the support that the Government could make
available for restructuring or relocation. However, it is not the job of
Government to tell companies how to run their business. If, like Continental,
they feel that they do not want to invest further, unfortunately we cannot
force them to.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As members will be aware, I was in touch
with the company before and after the announcement of the decision to close
the plant. As soon as I knew of the company's intention, I immediately
set in motion the actions that were needed to ensure that the Continental
work force would have the advice and assistance that they would need to
ensure that they would find suitable alternative employment. We set up
an action team, including representatives from the Continental work force,
local and regional trade unions, LEEL officials and local MSP Margaret
Smith. I am pleased to say that that team-chaired by my colleague Nicol
Stephen, who is the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning-had
its first meeting at the company premises within two days of the closure
announcement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The action team has since met again and
has put in place a number of initiatives to assist the work force. Those
initiatives include providing a work force profile and skills analysis,
and providing an on-site opportunities shop offering help and advice on,
for example, training, Jobsearch, welfare and benefits, business start-ups,
information technology training, finance and investment, debt counselling
and interview skills.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is our hope that this team will be as
effective as the team that supported Mitsubishi employees in the wake of
the closure of the Haddington plant. To date, only 18 of the 505 people
who were made redundant are still seeking employment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My colleague Nicol Stephen has been in
close contact with Continental's management here in Scotland, and he travelled
to Hanover on Monday for an early-morning meeting with senior Continental
representatives to clarify the company's future intentions. He also emphasised
the importance that we place both on the settlement package for the work
force and on full co-operation with the action team in terms of retraining
for new employment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the meeting, we urged the company to
provide the employees with the most generous redundancy package possible.
In addition, senior management at the company responded very positively
to Nicol Stephen's suggestion that they visit Scotland, in person, to meet
the action team. They are currently discussing how and when to do that.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The future use
of the Newbridge site was also discussed at the meeting, and Locate in
Scotland will continue to pursue that with Continental. In the meantime,
the company agreed to my suggestion that an economic and financial appraisal
should be carried out to help establish future options for the site. This
will be done as soon as possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All members will acknowledge the impact
of Continental's decision to close its plant at Newbridge. This is a hard
time for those involved and for their families, and the Scottish Executive
will continue to do everything it can to help them now and in the future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr John Swinney (North Tayside) (SNP):
</strong>I would like to begin by associating the SNP with the minister's comments
that expressed regret at the closure announcement by Continental. I extend
the sympathies of the SNP to the families that are affected by the decisions
that have been taken. I also give all support to the action team in their
work of guaranteeing that we can assist in delivering new and alternative
employment to those who have been affected by the closure announcement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would like to put three specific points
to the minister. First, I was very surprised that he made absolutely no
reference to the strength of sterling in his opening remarks about the
factors that had led Continental to this decision. The survival package
at Continental was based on valuation of the pound at DM2.80. The pound
is now valued at more than DM3.00. What significance does the Minister
for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning attach to currency, and to the damage
that sterling's strength is doing to a number of key manufacturing sectors
in the Scottish economy?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, was the minister aware, before
the closure announcement was made, of the existence of a company minute
that suggested that there had been zero response to initiatives from the
company for support from the Government over a period of five years? If
he was aware of that minute, does he believe that it is a fair and accurate
reflection of what the Government was doing? If it is not, why did the
company feel it necessary to record that?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, in this statement the Government
has presented a case for acting in a reactive rather than a proactive fashion,
but the Government has not delivered the active company development support
that could have been expected by a company that was facing challenges in
the manufacturing sector. The Government has a great deal to learn about
how to support the Scottish economy in the critical and difficult times
that many of our companies face.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

for the association of the SNP with concerns about the&nbsp;</font></td>

I want to express our appreciation for the work of Harry Donaldson of the
General, Municipal and Boilermakers Union in particular. They have been
intimately involved in this at every step of the way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Swinney raised three specific points.
I will put the reference to sterling's importance into context. In the
first quarter of 1999 it was clear that manufacturing exports from Scotland
were up by 8.3 per cent over the previous four quarters. The volume of
exports was up in a very difficult trading situation. How much that weighed
on Continental is a matter for that company.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to respond robustly to Mr Swinney's
second point. I must say-although it is not my natural style to talk about
the injection of party politics into a serious issue-there was much made
of the lack of activity of the Executive and the previous ministers. If
the SNP had followed up on my telephone call to Fiona Hyslop, it would
have found that on 30 occasions between 1993 and 1999 officials of the
Scottish Office and this Executive or ministers had been in touch with
the company. We were there at every conceivable point, not only in terms
of training packages, which are crucial in restructuring work forces and
shift patterns, but in terms of offering a different future that the company
might want to examine.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the end of the day the company must
make its own decisions, but I refute utterly the criticisms-particularly
those that were made by certain members of the SNP-regarding a zero response.
That simply did not happen. We wish that the outcome could have been different
but it was for no lack of trying that it was not. If people want to make
cheap political points out of that, they can; but we have been sincerely
involved with the work force and, for six years, we have tried to do what
was best by the company and by Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The company minute about the Government's
zero response to the situation was prepared after a video-conference between
people at Newbridge and in Germany. I do not know why the note was written
in that way. When I spoke to Dr Holzbach, he did not want to be associated
with that interpretation of the minute and has, on numerous occasions,
said that the Government has always been there to respond if required.
As I said in my statement, the Government was there to help, but at times
there was no response. That was the company's wish.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Miss Annabel Goldie (West of Scotland)
(Con): </strong>On behalf of the Conservative group within the Parliament, I

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would be grateful for the minister's
comments on two areas that are a cause of concern. We, and the work force,
will want to be reassured that the action team is not a seven-day wonder.
Can the minister confirm that he intends to report to the chamber on the
action team's progress? We all have a profound interest in what is happening
at Newbridge and would like to kept informed of what progress has been
made.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, I accept in good faith what the
minister has said in his statement about the company and other interested
parties having a collective will to introduce counselling and retraining
programmes. However, it is vital that such a help package is conducted
on a one-to-one basis with the employees. I would welcome the minister's
clarification of those aspects.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>I thank Annabel Goldie
for her comments on behalf of the Conservative party. The House should
be united in helping the work force to move on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I can reassure Miss Goldie that the action
team is not a seven-day wonder. We are embarking upon a serious programme
that involves many agencies and it is important for that to succeed. I
also repeat the reassurance that I gave to Mr John Swinney's Enterprise
and Lifelong Learning Committee this morning that we will work closely
with the committee and with every MSP and that we are happy to put on record
what the action team is doing. It is important for MSPs to have confidence
in what is happening and for the work force to know that this chamber respects
and appreciates them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Annabel Goldie is right to stress that
we should not approach counselling and retraining programmes in a mass
or volume way, but on the basis that every individual in the plant has
skills to offer and a future to be secured. I can also reassure her that
everything will be done on a one-to-one basis. I have no doubt that, with
the expertise and skills of the work force, such an approach will be a
significant help during what will be a difficult time for the work force
and their families.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mrs Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West)
(LD): </strong>As a local MSP, I want to record my sincere disappointment at
Continental's announcement of these job losses. As well as the 774 jobs
to be lost at the plant, the loss of other associated jobs will take the
total to more than 1,000, which is obviously catastrophic not only for
my constituency, but for neighbouring MSPs' constituencies and for the
areas represented by list MSPs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">listened to Annabel
Goldie's comments. The Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee and the
Parliament must be kept in touch with what the action team is doing. I
expect to have a mid- to long-term active involvement in the action team
to secure a better future for the people at Continental. We share the concerns
that have been raised about the work force, who have worked incredibly
hard to keep their jobs. We owe it to those workers to do everything that
we can to secure new jobs for them through retraining and access to education.
I certainly intend to do that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The minister outlined some of the action
team's positive work, but one of the things casting a cloud over that is
that the company appears to be offering the work force worse redundancy
terms than it has in the past. For example, when the company pulled out
of Ireland in 1996, it offered the work force five weeks for every year
of service. At the moment, my understanding is that Scottish workers are
being offered three weeks for every year. What is the Executive doing to
make the point that we believe that the work force at Newbridge should
be given the best possible package? What powers do the Executive have to
bring pressure to bear on Continental to make that a reality?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>I thank Mrs Margaret
Smith, the local MSP, for her involvement and assistance. We have spoken
a number of times and I know that Nicol Stephen has also been in touch.
I think that the work force is grateful for her extensive interest in this
major issue, which arose just after she was elected on May 6.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was no coincidence that when Nicol Stephen
went to Germany the first and most important item was the redundancy package.
It is not within the power of the Executive or this Parliament to deliver
on redundancy packages. Different countries, for example, Germany and Ireland,
have different labour laws. We are keen to reinforce the confidence of
the work force and that is why Nicol Stephen and I met Harry Donaldson
about an hour ago. We would not have put redundancy payments high on our
agenda and we would not have mentioned them today if we did not sincerely
believe that the work force at Newbridge deserve the very best. Many people
there have given a great deal of their life to production at Newbridge
and we still stand four-square behind the objective highlighted by Mrs
Margaret Smith.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Reinforcing the point made by Annabel Goldie,
I will also say that this action team must work. We must be optimistic
and confident. If Margaret, or anyone on the action team, feels that there
is something else that we can do I would like to hear about it because,
certainly, we will want to respond.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> You must
ask a question, Mr Sheridan.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> Will the minister
consider the point that this is not a natural disaster, but a man-made
disaster or, more appropriately, a multinational-made disaster? Does the
minister agree that there is clear evidence that Continental ran down the
Newbridge operation over the past three years and that members of the work
force-despite their being prepared to jump through hoops in terms of partnership
and flexibility-have been severely let down by Continental? This is not
about loss of market; it is about cheap labour being available in other
parts of Europe. Obviously, the Continental plan is to close down in Newbridge
and open up in Romania in order to exploit cheap labour.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Does the minister
also agree that it is essential that the fullest provisions of the Scotland
Act 1998 are brought to bear in terms of the redundancy question? Margaret
Smith made the point about the offer that was made to the Irish workers
in 1997. I remind the minister that that offer-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> Mr Sheridan,
you must ask a question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>The offer that was
made to the Irish workers in 1997 was for four-not five-weeks' redundancy
pay for every year of employment. Only after the Irish Government intervened
by going to the employment tribunal did Continental increase its offer.
Will the minister assure me that the fullest provisions of the Scotland
Act 1998, up to and including the removal of assets and machinery from
Continental, will be enforced by the Parliament if the company is not prepared
to offer a reasonable deal to the Scottish workers? Given the workers'
performance and loyalty over a great number of years, that is what they
deserve.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>What is important
is the working relationship that exists between the various members of
the action team, the Executive, local MSPs and the trade unions. I take
it that the Parliament respects the views of the trade unions and of the
full-time trade union officials on what we need to do to progress the matter.
It will not be helpful if the chamber decides to raise expectations on
any particular front; that is not the way in which we should approach a
very serious situation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have already given an assurance that
we want the best package to evolve from the current discussions. We are
committed to that, the Parliament is committed to that and we will see
what can be achieved. We also want to progress the constructive developments
within the plant so that people who have the skills can move on to work.
That is the best strategy and the one that we should support.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>I
appreciate the recognition that the chamber gives to the work force. As
a Lothians list MSP, I know many members of the work force and they will
appreciate that support. I also appreciated the briefing that Henry McLeish
gave me before the closure announcement and, at that point, I warned him
in a private phone call about the zero response minute.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not know about the 30 communications
that he mentioned. I asked a number of questions to elicit exactly what
communications had taken place and what support had been offered by the
Executive and by the previous Government. In the answers that will be published
in the next few days, there is no mention of 30 communications.&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why has the minister
not given me information about those communications?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, let us look to the future. I
acknowledge that there is a limit to what the Executive can do, that the
plant does not have assisted area status, that the bulk of the work force
live in West Lothian and that most of the rest of West Lothian is being
stripped of assisted area status-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> Ms Hyslop,
you must ask a question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>What actions has the
minister taken, or will he take, to ensure that the Kirkliston area achieves
assisted area status in the new proposals?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>On the first question,
we talked about the issue prior to the closure. I have a serious message
for every member, including myself, who might be involved in redundancies:
we have an open-door policy; we can be telephoned and we can meet and discuss.
When that video-conference was mentioned in the minute, it was of no significance
because it was totally without foundation. I say to Fiona, in the most
constructive way possible, that that is the way in which we should conduct
our business. If people want to speak to me, I will speak to them, and
I will tell them as much as possible, subject to the confidentiality often
involved in inward investment issues.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My wider point is that there is good news
on jobs in Scotland at present. While that does not necessarily mean that
people will move from Newbridge into those jobs, I want to make the point
that, apart from the action team, we are working on a bewildering number
of activities in Scotland, from lifelong learning to enterprise. John Swinney
will testify to that from this morning's committee meeting. We have a tourism
strategy, a manufacturing strategy and a science strategy, and I can reassure
Fiona Hyslop that those strategies are about economic development in the
wider sense. However, the key for the Executive is to focus on Newbridge
and on tradeable skills, and to ensure that every person in the plant has
a future-one where their families can continue with the life that they
had prior to the closure announcement. Those are noble objectives to which,
surely, we can all sign up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(Con): </strong>I endorse the comments of my colleagues on the dreadful job
losses at Newbridge. In my previous life, I was a major employer in the
Newbridge area, employing 70 people there. I know the area and the people
well. In a spirit of co-operation with Mr McLeish-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Johnston:
</strong>Thank you, Sir David. I wish to make one or two points that could help
Mr McLeish if he were to ask questions of his fellow ministers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Will Mr McLeish ask whether the planning
process could be speeded up and streamlined to make the planners less obstructive
to development in the area? Will he speak to the Civil Aviation Authority,
which also has a great impact on employment in the area, as there is a
tendency to limit the number of people who can be employed in the corridor
leading west from Edinburgh airport? Is he aware that a planning application
for leisure use of the 20-acre site opposite has been submitted? How does
he envisage Continental's 60-acre site fitting into the plan for the area?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>I am grateful for
Mr Johnston's constructive comments. I have no jurisdiction over planners
anywhere, although I have to confess that, with a degree in urban planning,
I am one of the people whom he may be criticising. However, suffice it
to say that planning is a matter for the Minister for Communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On a serious point, we have asked for an
economic, technical and financial appraisal of the area. It is crucial
that we reach the point where we can look at a future for this strategic
site. We will want to discuss that future with everyone in the area, including
the CAA and the complexes that have been developed by the City of Edinburgh
Council, West Lothian Council and others. This is a genuine team effort
and the spirit of Mr Johnston's question suggests that we can make progress
if we all work together.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan (Linlithgow) (Lab):
</strong>I agree with other speakers that this has been a devastating blow to
the work force, even if the threat has been hanging over them for some
time. One of the effects of such a blow is that the morale of the work
force becomes very low and people's confidence is shattered. I have seen
the task force's work plan and I know that it will set about reinstilling
confidence, showing people that they can go on to find alternative employment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Does the minister agree that the work force
were in no way and under no circumstances responsible for this situation?
As has been said, the work force have jumped through hoops, changing shift
patterns and taking wage freezes. They have been responsive to changing
patterns in the marketplace; the work force have been good.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Will the minister agree that, should any
employers in the local area be looking to take on these people, they will
find a co-operative and skilled work force who will be a boon to their
business? If the work force were taken on, that would bring back life into
the area.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish:
</strong>I am happy to endorse what Mary Mulligan says. The Executive has made
the point that, over the past few years, the work force have attempted
to work with senior management to restructure and to become involved in
shift patterns-at a financial cost.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Confidence is crucial, and that is why
a positive message today from the Parliament to the work force will ensure
that we can work together to achieve the desired outcome. The work force
have real skills, determination and enthusiasm, which are very marketable.
We will do everything possible to ensure that employers throughout the

a new opportunity. That is what we will work towards.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):</strong>
The next item of business is the debate on motion S1M-105 in the name of
Susan Deacon, on the promotion of public health, and an amendment to that
motion in the name of Mary Scanlon. Members who wish to speak in this debate
might care to press their buttons now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Health and Community
Care (Susan Deacon): </strong>Thank you, Presiding Officer. Just under two years
ago, the Scottish people voted overwhelmingly for this, their first ever
democratically elected Scottish Parliament, a Parliament that they wanted
to deliver a better quality of life and better opportunities for the people
of Scotland-in short, a Parliament that would make a difference.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 129 members of this Parliament now
have a historic opportunity and, I would argue, a responsibility to realise
these aspirations and to use the powers vested in us to make a real improvement
to the lives of those we represent. Nowhere can we better demonstrate our
willingness and our capacity to do that than in the fight to improve the
health of the Scottish people. That is why today, on this the first day
of our first full parliamentary session, I ask members to avoid the distractions
and to unite with me to signal our determination to tackle the root causes
of ill health in our country and to work together to build a healthier
Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Good health is not just about having a
good health service. Of course we must constantly work to improve the NHS-we
are doing that-but a healthy Scotland does not just cure ill health, it
prevents it from happening in the first place. For too long, Scotland has
been branded the sick man of Europe. We now have a chance to change that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In February, Donald Dewar, in his previous
incarnation as Secretary of State for Scotland, joined other Scottish Office
ministers in setting out the white paper, "Towards a Healthier Scotland".
It was the product of widespread consultation. It built a consensus around
a comprehensive strategy for improving the health of the Scottish people.
The task now falls to us to translate the ideas of that white paper into
action. Today I ask members of the Scottish Parliament, wherever they sit
in this chamber, to endorse the principles set out in the white paper and
to give their backing to me and to the Scottish Executive to take forward
its implementation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

need a comprehensive, cross-cutting approach that reaches deep into our
policies and practices and into our culture and attitudes. The white paper
sets out a shared vision of a healthier Scotland. It recognises that good
health is about more than not being ill. It recognises that we can tackle
ill health only through a sustained attack on inequality, social exclusion
and poverty, and that we need to address questions of lifestyle and of
life circumstances.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Let me remind members that for 18 long
years in this country we had a Government that refused to recognise that
ill health was linked to poverty. We recognise that connection and we are
prepared to act on it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Gladly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

expenditure on health year on year to an extent that Labour has not yet

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Answer the question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>We say that ill health
is a responsibility for Government to address. Unlike the Conservatives,
this Government is addressing it, and I challenge Conservative members
to join us in doing that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

better housing and better education. We will work towards a sustainable
