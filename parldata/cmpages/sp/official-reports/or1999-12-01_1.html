              <P><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel): </strong>I welcome Professor 
                Donald Macleod of the Free Church of Scotland, who will lead our 
                time for reflection today.</P>
              <P><strong>Professor Donald Macleod (Free Church College):</strong> Thank 
                you for your kind welcome. Let us bow our heads in prayer.</P>
              <P>Our Father in heaven, in you there is peace and calmness, serenity 
                and silence. In us, there is often dispeace and destruction, anxiety 
                and harassment. Enable us now to look up, to see you and to see 
                ourselves and our problems in terms of your perspective.</P>
              <P>We give thanks to you, O Lord, for Scottish democracy. We thank 
                you for this Parliament and for all who thought and acted it into 
                being. We bless you for its openness and accountability and for 
                the integrity of all who serve in it and who serve it as officers. 
                We bless you for the power given to this Parliament and we pray 
                that those who serve will have the grace to use that power in 
                accordance with your mind.</P>
              <P>Remember, Lord, all of us who have power&#151;preachers, journalists 
                and politicians. May we feel a keen sense of responsibility and 
                may we use that power on behalf of those who have no power. May 
                we speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.</P>
              <P>We remember you thus: the God, who, in Jesus Christ, let yourself 
                be pushed out of the world on to the cross. You looked at reality 
                through the eyes of an outsider and of the homeless and of the 
                world's poor. You have known our pain, our fear and the bitter 
                taste of death. You have commanded us, as the God of compassion, 
                to remember the poor. We remember them, Lord, this day before 
                you.</P>
              <P>May each of us in our sphere and capacity use our power in the 
                interests of the homeless, the rough sleepers, the elderly and 
                the victims of crime, drug addiction, alcohol, sexual abuse, domestic 
                violence and discrimination. May we never use that power without 
                sensitivity. May we use it never for ourselves, but only for the 
                sake of others.</P>
              <P>Give us confidence, Lord&#151;not least in this great new institution&#151;in 
                the possibility of change. Although often what we can do is but 
                small, may we know the power of little. May we know that the aggregate 
                of a large number of small changes will lead to a more just, more 
                compassionate and more inclusive society.</P>
              <P>Our Lord, the world is so big and we are so small; the problems 
                so huge in comparison to our vision, imagination, intellect, and 
                resources that it is often beyond our powers to handle them. Give 
                us humility in the face of those awesome challenges.</P>
              <P>We will learn, Lord, not to despair, but to cry for help. In 
              </P>

              <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Beef on the Bone</strong></P>
              <P> <strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel): </strong>There will now 
                be a statement on the beef-on-the-bone regulations. The minister 
                will take questions at the end of her statement, and there should 
                be no interventions during it. The minister has 10 minutes.</P>
              <P>14:37</P>
              <P><strong>The Minister for Health and Community Care (Susan Deacon): 
                </strong>Several members have asked that I make this statement today; 
                I welcome the opportunity to inform the Scottish Parliament directly 
                about the decisions announced yesterday on beef on the bone. I 
                would like both to explain the thinking behind the announcement 
                and to set it in the wider context of food safety policy.</P>
              <P>We have consistently said from the earliest days of the partnership 
                Administration that we would lift the ban on beef on the bone 
                as soon as medical advice said that it was safe to do so. We said 
                that in the partnership agreement document; we repeated it in 
                our programme for government. We have adhered to that principle 
                and today the promise is fulfilled.</P>
              <P>In my statement on 22 September, I informed members of the Executive's 
                decision to retain in full the ban on sale of beef on the bone, 
                which was introduced in December 1997. September's decision was 
                made on the basis of medical advice that I received at that time 
                from Professor Sir David Carter, chief medical officer for Scotland.</P>
              <P>My statement also indicated, however, that while there were a 
                number of uncertainties, in relation to BSE infectivity of certain 
                tissues&#151;dorsal root ganglia and bone marrow&#151;and in relation 
                to the rate of maternal transmission, the position would be kept 
                under regular review. In particular, new evidence, specifically 
                on maternal transmission, would become available in November.</P>
              <P>I can confirm that the position has been kept under active scrutiny 
                and also that the updated predictions from Professor Roy Anderson's 
                group in the Wellcome Trust Centre for the Epidemiology of Infectious 
                Disease at the University of Oxford have now been made available 
                to the chief medical officers. Shortly after receipt of the updated 
                information, the four&nbsp;UK CMOs met yesterday morning and agreed 
                on joint advice which they issued to ministers in the four UK 
                departments. As has been done before, that advice has now been 
                published and is available to members from the Scottish Parliament 
                information centre.</P>

            <TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
              <P>available, the UK CMOs have advised that the current circumstances 
                now allow the beef-on-the-bone ban to be lifted for retail sales, 
                so allowing consumer choice. The advice goes on to indicate that, 
                in view of continuing uncertainty about the infectivity of bone 
                marrow, the retention of the ban on the use of bones for manufactured 
                and processed products would be prudent. Finally, the advice emphasises 
                the need for continued rigorous controls, continued monitoring 
                of the human-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease epidemic and close 
                monitoring of new research results as they become available.</P>
              <P>I am pleased to inform members today that the Scottish Executive 
                accepted that advice immediately and has acted swiftly and decisively, 
                in accordance with our stated policy. A consultation document 
                was issued yesterday to approximately 100 interested organisations, 
                proposing a lifting of the bone-in-beef ban on visible cuts of 
                beef sold through retail outlets. Copies of the consultation document 
                are also available from SPICe.</P>
              <P>When the ban is lifted, consumers will be able to choose whether 
                to purchase and consume such products. The proposal is also to 
                lift the ban on beef and beef products supplied in restaurants 
                and other catering outlets, where consumers will be able to ask 
                whether the beef or beef products supplied have been prepared 
                from bone-in beef. Restaurant owners and caterers will be encouraged 
                to make that information available.</P>
              <P>I stress that I want the matter to be dealt with as soon as possible. 
                Our aim is for a short period of consultation; the consultation 
                document that we have issued includes a copy of the draft regulations 
                to implement the proposals. I intend that the regulations should 
                be laid and implemented quickly, so that the ban will be lifted 
                before the Parliament goes into recess. Scottish consumers will 
                be able to purchase rib roast and T-bone steaks before Christmas.</P>
              <P>The ban will be retained on the use of bone-in beef in the production 
                of manufactured beef products, as consumers in such cases will 
                have no easily verifiable information on whether such products 
                have been prepared from bone-in beef. That residual ban will also 
                be lifted as soon as the medical advice indicates that it is safe 
                to do so.</P>
              <P>I firmly believe that our approach on this high-profile food 
                safety issue has been the right one. The first priority of the 
                Executive&#151;consistently and clearly&#151;has been the protection 
                of public health. Throughout, our policy has been guided directly 
                by our medical advice. Food safety is not&#151;and should not 
                be&#151;a party political issue. It is exclusively a public health 
                issue.</P>
              <P>Of course, a balance has to be struck. </P>

            <TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
              <P>Consumers must be given the opportunity to choose, provided that 
                they are in a position to make informed choices. Again, that is 
                what we propose. Where consumers have sufficient and reliable 
                information to make an informed choice, the proposal is that the 
                ban will be lifted. Where uncertainties remain, and where there 
                are doubts about the public health implications of the use of 
                beef bones in manufactured or processed goods, the ban has been 
                retained.</P>
              <P>That is a prudent approach. Consumers can be reassured that we 
                are taking the most responsible approach and that we have&#151;and 
                will continue to&#151;put their health interests above all else. 
                Finally, we have acted swiftly and decisively, once further evidence 
                of medical advice has been received, on the same day as receipt 
                of the advice.</P>
              <P>This issue underscores some of the key issues that will guide 
                future policy under the new food standards agency: protection 
                of public health will be paramount; policy will be based on the 
                best scientific and medical advice available to us; responses 
                will be proportionate in the light of the risks involved; and 
                consumers will be able to exercise informed choice.</P>
              <P>Such an approach is in both the short-term and the long-term 
                interests of everyone in Scotland: the consumer and the producer. 
                This announcement is good news for consumers and another step 
                forward for the beef industry in this country. In the end, everyone 
                gains from a soundly based food safety policy.</P>
              <P>I hope that this statement serves to explain to members the Executive's 
                policy on beef on the bone, set against the key objectives of 
                food safety policy more generally. I will be pleased to answer 
                any questions that members might have.</P>
              <P><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>The Scottish 
                National party joins the beef industry in welcoming the long-awaited 
                announcement on what today's <I>The</I> <I>Press and Journal</I> 
                called the &quot;beef-on-the-bone farce&quot;. It will certainly 
                bring farmers some cheer in time for Christmas, but will the Minister 
                for Health and Community Care detail the changes in scientific 
                evidence and in the statistics that have persuaded the Executive 
                to lift that unnecessary ban?</P>
              <P>The minister said that consumers should be given the opportunity 
                to choose&#151;why did she not believe that before today, given 
                that the sale of beef on the bone posed no more risk to human 
                health than many other products on sale? Does she accept that 
                the Government's delay in lifting the ban has inflicted further 
                damage on Scotland's beef industry and that it now deserves maximum 
                support to enable it to get back into its former markets?</P>

              <P><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I said clearly in my statement that food 
                safety is not a party political issue, and I insist that it should 
                not be so. I repeat, in case the member was not listening earlier, 
                that the Scottish Executive has said from the outset that our 
                policy would be determined by medical advice. I have been in regular 
                contact with the chief medical officer, Sir David Carter.</P>
              <P>In the summer, when Parliament last debated the issue, we were 
                dealing with predictions about predictions. The Oxford evidence 
                has become available only within the past week. CMOs across the 
                UK have quickly considered that evidence and given us their advice. 
                They have assured us of the continuing decline of the BSE epidemic 
                in cattle; the latest Oxford estimate is that the number of BSE-infected 
                cattle under 30 months that could enter the human food chain within 
                12 months of clinical infection is now only 1.2 cattle for all 
                of Britain in 2000.</P>
              <P>On the basis of that advice, we took a decision; the evidence 
                has changed from six months ago. I suggest that members listen 
                to medical advice on the issue in the same way as we have, as 
                that is the basis for sensible decision making.</P>

                Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>I am grateful to the 
                minister for ensuring that all of us who are interested in the 
                issue were fully informed before yesterday's announcement. Will 
                she confirm that when the beef-on-the-bone ban is lifted, the 
                position will be similar to an option that was available to Jack 
                Cunningham when the ban was originally imposed? On a slightly 
                different subject, given the evidence to the Rural Affairs Committee 
                on the removal of spinal cord material from new carcases, should 
                we press for a review of that issue, so that the sheep industry 
                can be given a much-needed fillip, such as the beef industry has 
                had today?</P>
              <P><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Of course I recognise the industry's concerns. 
                As I have said consistently, we put public health first, but we 
                recognise the industry's interests alongside that. I believe that 
                the more confidence we can give consumers in beef and beef products, 
                the better that is for the industry. So today there is a win-win

                that we ought to be loosening some of the other measures that 
                are in place. I quote from the joint statement by the UK CMOs:</P>
              <P>&nbsp;&quot;It is important to retain and rigorously enforce 
                other control measures for protecting the human food chain from 
                cattle over 30 months infected with BSE.&quot;</P>
              <P>There is still a great deal of work to be done in monitoring 
                human-variant CJD. We must continually monitor, learn and take 
                sensible precautions. I believe that we have done so. Recently 
                Ross Finnie and I had a useful meeting with the National Farmers

              <P>discussed some of the difficulties in striking an appropriate 
                balance. I believe that our policies are sensible, precautionary, 
                appropriate and in the best interests of consumers and the farming 
                industry in Scotland.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): 
                </strong>First, on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I welcome the minister's 
                statement. The Executive has acted swiftly&#151;on the same day 
                that it received the latest medical advice from Sir David Carter&#151;to 
                lift the ban. That is to be greatly commended.</P>
              <P>We also welcome the fact that any future policy under the Scottish 
                arm of the food standards agency will continue to hold that the 
                protection of public health is paramount. I know that the industry 
                backs that view, 100 per cent.</P>
              <P>The minister said that she intended that the regulations be laid 
                and implemented quickly, so that the ban would be lifted before 
                Parliament goes into recess and Scottish consumers would be able 
                to purchase T-bone steaks; I look forward to that greatly. A consultation 
                document proposing the lifting of the ban has been issued to 100 
                organisations. Will the minister clarify the purpose of the consultation 
                exercise? I want to be certain that the ban is actually being 
                lifted.</P>
              <P><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I welcome Mr Rumbles's comments and share 
                his concern to ensure that when the ban is lifted, it is lifted 
                properly. We are carrying out a consultation exercise because 
                the legislation requires that any change to the ban be subject 
                to consultation. We have asked for responses to the consultation 
                by 7 December. That is a short time, but we think that it is reasonable 
                under the circumstances. I also intend to write to the Presiding 
                Officer and the relevant committee conveners regarding how we 
                will progress the rest of the process of changing the regulations, 
                so that we can&#151;I hope&#151;meet the outlined time scale and 
                do so within the letter and the spirit of the law.</P>
              <P><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>Along with everyone 
                else, I welcome the lifting of the ban. I congratulate the Executive 
                on the way in which it has handled the issue, which has been entirely 
                appropriate, following medical advice.</P>
              <P>What will the Scottish Executive, in partnership with the UK 
                Government, do now to promote beef in the United Kingdom, as well 
                as abroad?</P>
              <P><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I thank Dr Simpson for his positive comments 
                and for his many contributions in debates on the issue over previous 
                months.</P>
              <P>As I said in reply to Mr Johnstone, of course we recognise the 
                need to support the Scottish&#151;and, more widely, the British&#151;beef 
                industry. As Minister for Health and Community Care, my main </P>

              <P>area of involvement has been with the health issues. However, 
                I assure the member, on behalf of colleagues, from the First Minister 
                down&#151;or across&#151;to the Minister for Rural Affairs, and 
                all those in between, that a collective effort has been made across 
                the Scottish Executive and, crucially, in co-operation with ministers 
                in other parts of the UK, to ensure that steps are taken in the 
                best interests of our agriculture industry.</P>
              <P>A recent aid package of some &#163;40 million&#151;announced back 
                in September&#151;was given to the livestock sector. In addition, 
                I assure members that work continues to ensure that we do all 
                in our power to support the Scottish agriculture sector.</P>
              <P><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP): </strong>Does 
                the minister agree that, for all of us, public health is paramount? 
                However, does she accept that even now there is no clear-cut, 
                unequivocal scientific evidence of a causal connection between 
                consumption of material infected with BSE and contraction of CJD?</P>
              <P><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Given the way that the issue has been kicked 
                around like a political football in recent months, I wish that 
                I could believe Mr Ewing and his party when they say that public 
                health is paramount. I hope that in future months, in the challenges 
                and issues that we will have to face in relation to food safety, 
                the SNP will join me in putting public health first.</P>
              <P>I despair when I hear members talking about clear and unequivocal 
                causal connections in relation to such a matter. The chief medical 
                officer has issued written advice on the matter on many occasions. 
                He has discussed the issue in great detail with the Rural Affairs 
                Committee. In doing so, he has explained the degree of uncertainty 
                that exists, which is why we have had to take a precautionary 
                approach. It is estimated that the number of years for the incubation 
                period of human-variant CJD goes into double figures. Therefore, 
                we do not have the ability to point to the specific causal connection 
                that Mr Ewing is requesting. That is why we have to have sensible, 
                reasoned, informed debate around those issues and why we must 
                listen to our scientific and medical advisers. That is precisely 
                what we have done.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>I am 
                very pleased to hear the minister's statement, as will be the 
                beef farmers. Will she answer the second part of Alex Johnstone's 
                question? Will the minister and the Executive turn their attention 
                to the sheep industry, where the new rules requiring slaughterhouses 
                to split carcases have imposed huge extra costs and have resulted 
                in many sheep being shot in the fields?</P>

                the sheep industry. I know that he is committed to taking action 
                on that. I will be happy to relay to Mr Finnie the comments that 
                have been made.</P>
              <P><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Is the minister 
                aware that the case of Jim Sutherland&#151;heroic hotelier of 
                Lauder&#151;is due to be heard in the criminal appeal court next 
                Tuesday, to determine whether he has a case to answer? Does the 
                minister agree that in the changed circumstances following today's 
                announcement, notwithstanding the pending appeal, the Crown should 
                now abandon the case against him simpliciter?</P>
              <P><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I can assure the member that I am aware 
                of the case in question, but the fact that it is still being considered 
                in the courts means that I cannot comment on it today.</P>

                that the matter is sub judice.</P>
              <P><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD): </strong>I, too, welcome today's 
                decision. It is good to see the Executive following along the 
                lines that the industry has been calling for over the past three 
                years&#151;all such decisions must be taken on the basis of science, 
                not politics, unlike pre-1996. The industry is still concerned 
                about the other measures that were put in place because the pre-1996 
                regulations were not enforced properly. Can the minister assure 
                us that everything is being done in Europe to ensure that there 
                is a move towards lifting the restrictions relating to European, 
                rather than UK, legislation? Will the Executive do everything 
                possible to ensure that we make progress on lifting some of the 
                BSE regulations in the sheep and beef sectors?</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_8"></A>Susan Deacon: </strong>I assure the 
                member that we will listen carefully to industry concerns. We 
                will always try to achieve the appropriate balance between the 
                public health interest&#151;which is paramount&#151;and the needs 
                of the industry. I mentioned earlier the meeting that Ross Finnie 
                and I had with the NFU Scotland. At that meeting, we discussed 
                how to achieve such a balance. I listened carefully to what was 
                said, and I will consider how to take forward the points raised 
                at the meeting.</P>
              <P><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>Now that Scottish 
                and British beef will be labelled with its country of origin when 
                on sale in the EU market, why cannot meat produced in Europe be 
                labelled with its country of origin in the UK market? When can 
                we be assured that beef from other EU countries has met the rigorous 
                standards that our own beef must meet?</P>

              <P>&quot;a lifting of the bone-in-beef ban on visible cuts of beef

              <P>I presume that we have no plans to sell invisible cuts.</P>
              <P><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I am struck by the member's wit and overcome 
                with mirth.</P>
              <P>It is important that consumers are able to make informed choices. 
                There is still uncertainty about the infectivity of bone marrow 
                and research on that is continuing. Therefore, we believe that 
                that is a suitably precautionary and prudent measure to maintain 
                the ban for processed beef products, such as baby foods, as the 
                consumer cannot know or ask whether beef on the bone has been 
                used in their production. That is why we plan to leave in place 
                the controls in that area.</P>

                that a member of the Parliamentary Bureau will seek leave to move 
                a motion without notice to bring decision time forward.</P>
              <P>As we have just agreed, proceedings on stage 3 are programmed

              <P>I have decided that all amendments for which notice has been

                have been placed on members' desks, and amendments have been grouped 
                to allow a single debate to take place on related amendments to 
                avoid undue repetition. I remind members that all amendments must 
                be called in turn from the marshalled list. Amendments will be 
                disposed of in the order in which the provisions to which they 
                relate arise in the bill.</P>
              <P>There will be one debate on each of the 12 groups of amendments 
                in the groupings list. At the end of the debate on each grouping 
                I will put the question on the first amendment of the grouping, 
                and Parliament will decide whether to agree to the amendment. 
                I will then call the next amendment in the marshalled list. If 
                that has already been debated, the member who has proposed it 
                will move it, but should not make a speech. There will be no further

              <P>Subsection (1) provides that agreements should exist. Subsection 
                (2) provides that those agreements should, in the first instance, 
                be brought by the Executive, as they are at present. Finally, 
                subsection (3) states that Parliament must agree to the written 
                understandings.</P>
              <P>That is the same process as we are engaged in at present. The 
                SNP's idea is that it should happen under any Executive and any 
                Minister for Finance. That does not bind the Executive to anything 
                to which it is not already committed. No one can say now that 
                we would have these agreements if a different Administration were 
                elected. The amendment is to ensure that this helpful process 
                of engagement between the Executive and the legislature is set 
                in stone.</P>
              <P>Finally, it requires that Parliament be engaged in that process, 
                so that it will be seen as inclusive.</P>
              <P>I hope that the amendment can garner cross-party support. I look 
                forward to hearing that during the debate.</P>
              <P>I move amendment 23.</P>
              <P><strong>The Minister for Finance (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>Thank you 
                again for the selection of amendments, Presiding Officer.</P>
              <P>I will make a few remarks and I will reserve the right to respond 
                to the debate as well. I hope that on the basis of my remarks, 
                Andrew Wilson may be prepared to reconsider.</P>
              <P>As a new Parliament, we do not have the benefit of years of experience, 
                or of established conventions that govern the processes of interaction 
                between the Government and the Parliament. Not all the processes 
                can be easily enshrined in legislation&#151;the processes featured 
                in the amendment come into that category&#151;and neither can 
                they all be dealt with adequately in standing orders. None the 
                less, we must make them work. It is for that reason that we suggested 
                that some of the financial issues advisory group's recommendations 
                be given force, not by </P>

              <P>legislation, but by a series of understandings. In effect, we 
                are attempting to build conventions in a new Parliament.</P>
              <P>The advantage of that approach is that understandings bring flexibility, 
                which is absent using the blunt instrument of legislation. The 
                nature of those processes means that the precise requirements 
                will change over time, in the light of events and changing circumstances. 
                That is not to say that such arrangements should not be honoured; 
                of course they should. The Executive is determined to abide by 
                agreed arrangements. If the Executive ever sought to change those, 
                that could happen only following full discussion with the Finance 
                Committee and the Audit Committee, or with the Parliament.</P>
              <P>The amendment seeks to do two things. First, it seeks to give 
                the detailed agreements legislative force. Given the nature of 
                the subject matter&#151;which does not easily lend itself to legislation&#151;I 
                do not think that that is appropriate. As I have already said, 
                I view those as serious undertakings, by which we shall abide.</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Will Mr McConnell give way?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>Mr Wilson will be able to respond later.</P>
              <P>Secondly, the amendment seeks to ensure that the terms of any 
                agreements are agreed by resolution of Parliament. That is the 
                key point. It is a matter for the Parliament that does not require 
                legislation. I expect the committees to report to the Parliament 
                on the terms of the proposed agreements, and the Parliament to 
                resolve accordingly. I had always imagined that when the agreements 
                were finalised they would be approved by the Parliament and by 
                the Executive. That is what I understand by agreement. It is not 
                necessary for that requirement to be laid in legislation.</P>
              <P>I hope that Mr Wilson will take this important point on board. 
                If the amendment were carried, it would give the power to impose 
                an understanding in the absence of a parliamentary agreement. 
                That was never my intention and I am surprised that that is raised 
                in the amendment&#151;even by accident. The amendment says that 
                if the agreement is not covered by a resolution of the Parliament, 
                the minister's proposed agreement shall be put in place. I do 
                not think that the agreements should be put in place unless they 
                have been agreed by this Parliament and by the Executive. That 
                may not be a deliberate intention of the amendment, but it is 
                clear from subsection (1)(c) that subsection (2) would be in place 
                if an agreement had not been reached by the Parliament.</P>

                today, that Mr Wilson will withdraw his amendment at the end of 
                the debate.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr John Swinney (North Tayside) (SNP): </strong>I thank the minister 
                for his comments and I compliment him on the way that he has handled 
                the bill and the arrangements with the Finance Committee. The 
                comments that I will make today are designed to draw attention 
                to some limited problems, which have emerged from the way in which 
                those matters have been handled. I want to provide clarity for 
                Parliament regarding the way in which it handles such issues in 
                the future.</P>
              <P>Let us examine the history of the written agreements to which 
                the minister has referred. The first draft was issued to the Finance 
                Committee on Friday 22 October for it to debate on Tuesday 26 
                October. I say that not to make pedantic points of detail, but 
                to raise the point that at the outset of the process concern was 
                expressed by members of the Finance Committee about the amount 
                of time that was available for consideration of those written 
                understandings.</P>
              <P>In column 45 of the <I>Official Report</I> of the Finance Committee 
                meeting on 26 October those comments were made, not by me, but 
                by Keith Raffan&#151;a member of the Finance Committee.</P>
              <P>Once the Finance Committee had provided its views on those issues, 
                the minister issued revised drafts on, I think, 24 November, which 
                was last Wednesday. Those amended drafts have not been considered 
                or agreed by the Finance Committee. Throughout consideration of 
                the bill, the minister has invited us to accept that substantial 
                aspects of financial procedures, in which this Parliament should 
                engage, should not be included in the bill but should be left 
                to written understandings. We are at the stage 3 debate, being 
                asked to agree the contents of the bill, when the Finance Committee 
                and its convener cannot come to Parliament and say that they are 
                content with the contents of the written understandings. That 
                suggests to me that we are being asked to give commitments today 
                when we have not seen all the documents that should have been 
                seen and scrutinised by the Finance Committee. Therefore, a serious 
                parliamentary issue is at the heart of the amendment that we have 
                lodged.</P>
              <P>Amendment 23 asks the Executive to agree to nothing more than 
                what it has agreed to already, with one additional point&#151;simply 
                to record in the bill that there is a requirement for such written 
                understandings to exist. I accept without reservation all that 
                the minister said about the need for us to have flexibility in 
                our financial </P>

              <P>procedures and not to set those procedures in stone. However, 
                I want to put an obligation on the Executive, on its successors 
                and on its successors' successors, to strike an agreement with 
                the Finance Committee and the Parliament about the way in which 
                we conduct our procedural consideration of these matters.</P>
              <P>All we ask of the minister is that he formalises a process to 
                which the Executive has consented, and that he inserts the agreement 
                in principle on that point into the bill. I hope that the purpose 
                of the amendment finds favour with many members of the Executive 
                parties who, I know, strongly support the Parliament's committee 
                system. The amendment's purpose is to protect the position of 
                the Finance Committee and its ability to execute properly the 
                functions that it has been given in the first written understanding&#151;functions 
                that we do not want to be eroded in any way in future.</P>
              <P>I took part in a debate last night in Dundee, with Mr McAllion, 
                Mr Raffan, Mr Gallie, Mr Harper and various other people, during 
                which Mr Raffan made the point that Parliament would today consider 
                a world-class finance bill. He was absolutely right&#151;the bill 
                is a tremendous step forward. Before arriving at this stage we 
                have given the Executive clear support throughout the Finance 
                Committee's consideration of the bill. However, there is an important 
                issue on financial procedures that we are being asked to consent 
                to, in principle, without there being enough protection for Parliament 
                in the bill&#151;the one point on which we seek the Executive's 
                agreement.</P>
              <P>The minister said that the amendment would give the written agreements 
                legislative force&#151;it would not. The SNP wants to give the 
                agreements a status in legislation that will bind the Executive 
                and Parliament to certain obligations. He said that the terms 
                of the agreements had to be agreed by Parliament&#151;that is 
                absolutely right&#151;and that he plans to bring the agreements 
                to Parliament for agreement. His final remark was on the ability 
                of the Executive to impose an agreement. However, that is in no 
                way covered by subsection (2) of our amendment. Subsection (3) 
                adequately covers the need for us to secure agreement between 
                the Executive and Parliament on the issue.</P>
              <P>There is nothing in what the minister has said so far that, in 
                my view, questions the validity in principle of our amendment. 
                As I said earlier, the written understandings that we are considering 
                have not been agreed by&#151;or signed off by&#151;the Finance 
                Committee. However, members are being asked to sign off a bill 
                without the consideration that is part of the process being completed.</P>
              <P>I therefore suggest that the Minister for Finance consider the 
                opportunity that is available to him under rule 9.8.5 of the standing 
                orders. As the member proposing the bill, he can adjourn stage

                suggestion to address the way in which the minister could wind 
                up this afternoon's debate.</P>
              <P>15:15</P>
              <P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I remind members that we have 12 
                groups of amendments to go through. I am anxious to ensure that 
                we have time for debates on the other groups. If we have not had 
                time for debates, the amendments will be put to the chamber without 
                discussion. I am making an appeal for brief speeches.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Keith Raffan (Mid Scotland and Fife) (LD): </strong>I rise on 
                behalf of the Liberal Democrats to oppose the amendment and support 
                the minister. Much of what the minister said, I would have said. 
                My problem with the amendment is that it is unnecessary. What 
                is more, it reduces flexibility. I take the point that we have 
                not yet debated the amended draft agreements, but their last paragraph 
                makes quite clear that they are agreements between the Finance 
                Committee and the minister.</P>
              <P>The minister has co-operated well with the committee&#151;indeed, 
                we got the papers on 22 October, four days before we debated them, 
                which I believed is a record for a minister. I wish that the others 
                would do the same, although I am aware of the pressures that ministers 
                are under.</P>
              <P>The agreements are important and the guarantee that the minister 
                has given that they will be debated in this chamber is important. 
                I also think that it is important that we retain flexibility. 
                Mr Swinney was right to say that I said that we have established 
                a world-class budgetary process. That is a tribute to the financial 
                issues advisory group and their excellent report to the minister 
                and to the Executive.</P>
              <P>I do not want to make what would be the equivalent of a third-reading 
                speech now, but I must say that we have a world-class system in 
                place. We have a framework that will have to be altered in the 
                light of the experience that we will go through in stages 1, 2 
                and 3 of a budget bill when we get into a full financial year. 
                I would not want to tie the hands of the Finance Committee or 
                of the minister by enshrining this in legislation at this point. 
                I would rather that the committee and the minister retained a 
                flexibility that allowed us to alter those agreements and understandings 
                in the light of experience. That is common sense.</P>
              <P>I oppose the amendment because I believe that it is crucial that 
                we retain flexibility.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>Much of 
                what the previous speakers have said relates to the honesty with 
                which this Parliament is approaching what could be a very good 
                bill for Scotland.</P>
              <P>We support, in principle, what Andrew Wilson is trying to achieve 
                with his amendment. Nothing in the bill cannot be dealt with through 
                the amendment. What the amendment does not do is specify what 
                the written agreements are. It provides a framework to which the 
                Parliament, the Finance Committee, the minister and other committees 
                can refer as a method of deliberation and as a means to update 
                the bill when it becomes law.</P>
              <P>We need flexibility but we also need to have building blocks 
                in the bill that satisfy the requirements that have been stated 
                on a cross-party basis in the Finance Committee. It is refreshing 
                that people do not divide on party lines in that committee, which 
                has approached the issue positively and sensibly. All members 
                of the committee have made contributions. The wording of the amendment 
                might not be perfect, but I am happy to let the minister use the 
                powers given to him by the standing orders to change the wording 
                to make it more suitable. However, the amendment satisfies the 
                general desire of the members of the Finance Committee.</P>
              <P>I see that I am being frowned at by Liberal Democrat members, 
                but we have had a good discussion in the committee. We have demonstrated 
                trust, in that the Finance Committee does not have the written 
                agreements in a discussed form. The amendment would ensure that, 
                whatever discussions take place, either with this Executive or 
                a future one&#151;which might be of a different persuasion&#151;there 
                is an opportunity for this Parliament to deal with the process. 
                In saying so, we support the amendment.</P>
              <P><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> I recommend to members that we 
                wind up debate on this amendment, as we are a quarter of the way 
                through our time and we have dealt with only the first amendment, 
                important though it is.</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>I am grateful for the comments that we 
                have heard so far on this amendment. I hope that they have been 
                made in a spirit of improvement. I say to Mr Raffan that his argument 
                against setting in stone the form of the written agreements does 
                not stand. All that we want to set in stone is the existence of 
                written agreements. The form that those written agreements take 
                can be amended as we choose; there is nothing binding on that. 
                Therefore, his justification for opposing the amendment does not 
                stand.</P>
              <P>I hope that the minister will give thought to the opportunity 
                at his disposal to improve the wording. </P>

              <P>I am not precious about that. I would be delighted if he agreed 
                to the amendment in principle and took the opportunity to amend 
                it, as both Mr Swinney and Mr Davidson have suggested. I invite 
                all members to support the principle of the amendment.</P>
              <P><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> I apologise. I should have allowed 
                Mr McConnell to speak first.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>I address the specific point that I made, 
                that this amendment would give more power to the ministers than 
                has ever been envisaged by our drafting of the bill.</P>
              <P>I do not have strong views on whether the procedure for agreeing 
                written agreements should be in legislation, although I think 
                that it is better that it is not. If the amendment had addressed 
                that point, we could perhaps have gone ahead today. I do not think 
                that it is necessary to break up the debate and adjourn, to revisit 
                this amendment. I have said very clearly on the record today that 
                these written agreements will be agreed. It will be up to the 
                Parliamentary Bureau to decide how the Parliament agrees them. 
                However, it will be for this Parliament as well as for the Executive 
                to agree them.</P>
              <P><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>I wonder whether the 
                minister will agree with me on two points.</P>
              <P>First, because of the inflexibility of this amendment, it may 
                not include some items that we may want to include later. For 
                example, subsection (1)(b) mentions changes only to expenditure 
                allocations. If we wanted to change income allocations during 
                the year, that would not be allowed. There is already that inflexibility.</P>
              <P>Secondly, it is always open to the Finance Committee to introduce 
                this in legislation through the Finance Committee at a later date, 
                if we feel that the terms that have been promised today are not 
                being appropriately met.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>I think that those are good points that 
                are well made. Flexibility may be an important issue. We may want 
                to have more agreements, in the future, than are listed here.</P>
              <P>I hope that Mr Swinney will listen to this point. The amendment 
                says:</P>
              <P>&quot;Scottish ministers shall ensure that . . . administrative 
                arrangements&quot;</P>
              <P>will conform to</P>
              <P>&quot;an agreement established under subsection (3) or, if no 
                such agreement has been established, proposed agreements under 
                subsection (2).&quot;</P>
              <P>That means that, if this Parliament has not passed the written 
                agreement that is referred to in subsection (3) by resolution, 
                our proposed agreement, without amendment by the Finance </P>

              <P>Committee or discussion in the Parliament, will become the written 
                agreement that is put in place.</P>
              <P>What I have said again clearly today is that I want written agreements 
                to be agreed here&#151;not just proposed by ministers&#151;by 
                Parliament and the Executive.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Swinney </strong><I>rose&#151;</I></P>
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>The agreement of this amendment would lead 
                to a situation in which the ministers would have more authority 
                than they would have had otherwise. Much as I might enjoy that, 
                we have sought all the way through to avoid that situation. I 
                ask once again that this amendment be withdrawn. If it is not, 
                I am prepared to recommend that the Parliament vote against it.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>I thank the minister for allowing me to intervene. 
                This subject is not an unfamiliar one in debate between the two 
                of us, as we have discussed it many times in the Finance Committee. 
                I refer him to the <I>Official Report</I> of the Finance Committee 
                from 2 October, when I raised exactly the same issue. At stage 
                2 of the bill, we were encouraged not to amend the contents of 
                the bill, as the written understandings would be in a condition 
                and a position before we completed the process of the bill. We 
                do not have Finance Committee agreement on the contents of those 
                written understandings, yet we are being asked to sign off the 
                process today.</P>
              <P>I ask the minister, who, in the process of his speech, has not 
                objected in principle to there being reference in legislation 
                to the written understandings, to accept the offer that I have 
                made to him today and to consider this issue, bearing in mind 
                that the Finance Committee's rights have been compromised by the 
                fact that we have not had the opportunity to sign off those written 
                understandings.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>It is unfortunate that, when we have been 
                trying to build a consensus around this bill, and when the revised 
                arrangements are based on the comments of the Finance Committee 
                and the Audit Committee that were circulated last week and are 
                in the public domain, we are facing what I regard as an attempt 
                by Mr Swinney to point-score about the timing of the arrangements. 
                I do not think that that is appropriate.</P>
              <P>Today a firm undertaking has again been given that these understandings 
                will not be put in place without the agreement of this Parliament, 
                which is exactly what this amendment is meant to be about. Because 
                such an undertaking has been given, the amendment is unnecessary. 
                It would give additional powers to ministers that my version of 
                the understandings would not give and, as Dr Simpson has correctly 
                pointed out, would put in place an inflexible list of arrangements 
                that could </P>

                19.</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_11"></A>Mr McConnell: </strong>I move amendment 
                1, which responds to a suggestion that was made by the Finance 
                Committee. It changes the way in which the control of ministerial 
                spending under the contingency arrangements set out in section 
                3 of the bill is set. The bill originally proposed that the total 
                spend in any one year under those arrangements should be no more 
                than &#163;50 million, and provided that that figure could be uprated 
                by order.</P>
              <P>The amendment is intended to remove the need to make such orders 
                by setting a control that is a percentage of the expenditure authorised 
                by the Parliament under the terms of section 1 of the bill&#151;a 
                percentage of the resource expenditure authorised in the annual 
                budget act, which will vary from year to year&#151;and that takes 
                account of increases due to inflation.</P>
              <P>The two amendments to section 25 are consequential on amendment 
                1 and remove references to the process of revising by order the 
                limit on contingency spending.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>I am grateful to the minister, because this 
                amendment follows on from an amendment that I proposed on 2 November, 
                which would have replaced the figure of &#163;50 million with a percentage. 
                It is in everybody's interest that we do that, because a figure 
                can be eroded in the short term&#151;let alone the long term&#151;by

              <P>The amendments impose parliamentary control on the Executive's 
                proposals for local authority capital spending, in so far as that 
                counts against the total budget. Without these amendments, ministerial 
                decisions on local authority capital expenditure would not be 
                subject to parliamentary approval. The Executive considers that 
                to be anomalous. Local authority capital expenditure is a mixture 
                of expenditure that counts against the total Scottish budget, 
                and expenditure that is financed from local authorities' own resources. 
                The intention is that the figure that appears in a budget act 
                should relate only to that part of local authorities' expenditure 
                that counts against the total budget. It would be inappropriate 
                for a budget act to specify a figure that included any part of 
                expenditure that was financed directly by local authorities.</P>
              <P>We have concluded that it is not possible to define the relevant 
                part of local authority capital expenditure in legislation; instead, 
                the amendments require Scottish ministers to lay before Parliament 
                a report that describes the expenditure to be covered by the limits 
                set out in budget acts. The Executive intends that the expenditure 
                that is described in such reports will be that part of local authorities' 
                and related bodies' expenditure that counts against the total 
                budget.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP): </strong>Amendment 21 says that</P>
              <P>&quot;the Scottish Ministers shall seek to ensure that the aggregate 
                amount of relevant expenditure . . . does not exceed the amount 
                specified for that year&quot;.</P>
              <P>Could the minister explain how? What powers and what monitoring 
                does the Executive propose will be used?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>Without these amendments the Executive will 
                be able to establish the annual limits on local authority capital 
                expenditure without reference to Parliament or reference to the 
                budget acts. The phrase &quot;relevant expenditure&quot; means 
                that we will specify in each budget act and in the supporting 
                documentation exactly which element of local authority capital 
                expenditure is subject to parliamentary control each year. In 
                that way, we hope that each year Parliament will have the right 
                to approve that total, rather than that total simply being a matter 
                for the ministers themselves.</P>
              <P><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD): </strong>I seek clarification 
                on subsection (6) of amendment 21. Is the minister suggesting 
                that he is taking new powers to determine the methodology of annual 
                capital receipts and capital expenditure? I understand the point 
                that he made about bringing to Parliament the whole question of 
                his decisions, but in that subsection is there any new mechanism

                to ensure that while it was important that parliamentary control 
                was possible over minister's decisions on local authority capital 
                expenditure, that did not extend to local authorities' decisions 
                on their own receipts. Therefore, the amendment as proposed puts 
                existing ministerial decisions and controls under the authority 
                of Parliament, but only those ministerial decisions, and would 
                leave local authorities to make their own decisions in relation 
                to their receipts.</P>

                financial arrangements</strong></P>
              <P> <strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>The next series of amendments are technical, 
                so I will be as brief as I can be.</P>
              <P>Amendment 3 is a technical amendment. Section 9 of the bill intends 
                that the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland should operate on 
                a trading fund basis. In other words, his expenses are to be funded 
                from his income, without the authority of Parliament. Of course, 
                the keeper will not have a free hand, as section 9 already ensures 
                that he will have to meet the financial objectives that are set 
                by ministers.</P>
              <P>The amendment is necessary to ensure that section 9 operates 
                as intended. Without it, all the controls that are set out in 
                part 1 of the bill would apply to the keeper, and a trading fund 
                style of operation would not be possible. The amendment rectifies 
                the situation by specifying that the only section of part 1 that 
                applies to the keeper is section 6. Section 6 covers procedures 
                for repaying money that has been paid into the Scottish consolidated 
                fund in error, as it is possible that the keeper might erroneously 
                pay money into the SCF. The application of this provision to the 
                keeper is appropriate. I hope that members support this amendment.</P>

              <P>The main amendment is amendment 26. It is largely technical,

                planning cycle, it is felt prudent to make adequate provision 
                now.</P>
              <P>Amendment 24 prohibits Audit Scotland from charging the Scottish 
                Administration for work undertaken in connection with any consolidated 
                public accounts. That is in accordance with other arrangements 
                set out in the bill that already ensure that Audit Scotland is 
                not able to charge the Scottish Administration for any work that 
                it undertakes, as funding for that type of work will be arranged 
                through budget acts.</P>
              <P>Amendment 25 is consequential on amendment 26 and removes the 
                reference to consolidated accounts in section 18, as amendment 
                26 removes the requirement for that.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>I move amendment 4, which is a very minor 
                and technical amendment. As drafted, section 11 would restrict 
                Audit Scotland's application of resources to fund expenditure 
                to the amounts authorised in budget acts. Section 7 of the bill 
                now provides for the possibility of authorising the application 
                of resources in legislation other than budget acts for everybody 
                else and section 11 requires similar amending. Furthermore, the 
                amendment adds more flexibility to the provisions as it now caters 
                for the possibility that future enactments may authorise the application 
                of receipts by Audit Scotland.</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Many amendments that we will hear today 
                appear to be drafting improvements on amendments that the minister 
                has previously lodged. It would have been nice if he had shown 
                the same flexibility to the SNP's draft amendment, given that

              <P> <strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>I move amendment 9. I will speak to amendments 
                10 to 17 as well. Those amendments respond directly to concerns 
                that were expressed in this chamber, as well as in committees, 
                about the scope of the bill and the need to give further powers 
                to the Auditor General for Scotland. They all concern arrangements 
                for value-for-money examinations. The Executive expects that the 
                majority of value-for-money studies will be conducted under arrangements 
                that are provided for in the bill.</P>
              <P>Amendment 9, however, provides the additional option of value-for-money 
                examination by agreement. It enables the Auditor General to conduct 
                a value-for-money examination into the use of resources by a body 
                that is not covered by the remaining provisions of section 21, 
                with the agreement of the body concerned. That complements the 
                existing provisions, and provides for the Auditor General to arrange 
                for studies in circumstances that might otherwise be precluded.</P>
              <P>Amendments 10 to 17 have been prepared as a result of points 
                that were made by members of the Audit Committee during stage 
                2 scrutiny of the bill. The intention is to widen significantly 
                the scope of bodies that the Auditor General might examine for 
                value-for-money purposes. The original draft of the bill would 
                have prohibited Scottish ministers from specifying as a suitable 
                subject for value-for-money examination any body that received 
                no more than half of its income from public sources. Amendment 
                10 reduces that threshold so that Scottish ministers are able 
                to propose any body that receives more than a quarter of its funds 
                from public sources as suitable for value-for-money examination.</P>
              <P>Amendment 11 recognises that, on occasion, a body may receive

                of its total annual income, may not be within the scope of the

                changes that have been prepared merely to refine the drafting 
                of the bill.</P>
              <P>I commend these amendments.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>This group of amendments is very welcome. 
                In particular, I would like to highlight the minister's decision 
                to lower the thresholds for value-for-money studies, in terms 
                of the proportion of an organisation's income that may have come 
                from the public purse and of the absolute sum that may be the 
                subject of inquiry. That is important, because we live in an age 
                in which we must ensure that issues of value for money are implicit 
                in the operations of Government.</P>
              <P>The minister will not be surprised to hear me say that, in the 
                past few months and years, many of us have been impressed by the 
                work of the Accounts Commission in driving forward value for money 
                and in examining comparative performance in the delivery of public 
                services, with the objective of improving the management practices 
                involved in the delivery of those services. I hope that that approach 
                will be encouraged under the new arrangements that this bill will 
                provide.</P>
              <P>The minister will be aware that, prior to the election, the SNP 
                made considerable input to the debate on value-for-money exercises 
                and what the public purse could achieve if there was a systematic 
                willingness on the part of Government to seek out best value in 
                using those resources. I hope that some of that thinking now underpins 
                the actions of the minister as he exercises his duties.</P>
              <P>15:45</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Welsh: </strong>I would like to draw out the thinking behind 
                the minister's proposal. The Auditor General's powers to initiate 
                investigations on economy, effectiveness and efficiency are crucial 
                to the work of public financial accounting in Scotland. By encouraging 
                best practice and by bringing to light and to public scrutiny 
                poor use of resources, the Auditor General will undoubtedly be 
                able to improve financial awareness and create higher standards 
                of service provision in Scotland.</P>
              <P>The work of Audit Scotland is at the heart of good government 
                and resource use within the province of this Parliament. Although 
                I note the reduction of the constraint on the Auditor General 
                from a threshold of 50 per cent to one of 25 per cent, I believe 
                that the amendment still does not go far enough in allowing proper 
                public scrutiny </P>

              <P>and accountability. I do not believe that there should be any 
                no-go areas for the Auditor General or for Audit Scotland where 
                public money is being spent.</P>
              <P>Although allowing access to bodies funded up to 25 per cent by 
                public funds is definitely an improvement, I still ask why any 
                such restriction is being placed on Audit Scotland. That public 
                watchdog should be able to track and to account for public funds. 
                Although the Auditor General may choose not to investigate smaller 
                amounts spent by publicly funded organisations, he or she should 
                have the power, where it is considered appropriate, to go into 
                anywhere where public funds have been allocated, unless there 
                is very good reason not to do so.</P>
              <P>I am also wary of the new catch-all amendment, which will work 
                only if the organisation involved voluntarily agrees to its own 
                scrutiny. I am concerned that situations may arise in which scrutiny 
                would be desirable but the organisation that needs to be scrutinised 
                will not co-operate. I ask the minister to explain the caveat 
                of volunteering an examination. Why is the Auditor General not 
                given full powers to follow public money wherever it goes? I hope 
                that the minister can explain more fully the reasoning behind 
                those exceptions to the normal rules of scrutiny.</P>
              <P><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>I welcome the changes to the threshold; the 
                quarter figure is much more acceptable than the half. I note what 
                Mr Welsh, the convener of the Audit Committee, has said. However, 
                having asked some parliamentary questions about this matter in 
                an attempt to find out which organisations might be concerned, 
                I know that it is difficult to get an understanding of precisely 
                which bodies might be involved below the quarter threshold.</P>
              <P>The quarter threshold is a good starting point. It was also sensible 
                to include the &#163;500,000 figure; that is an important development. 
                I welcome the flexibility of the minister's approach to the matter. 
                The amendments, if they are agreed to, will improve the bill considerably.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>I, too, 
                welcome the minister's flexible approach. I lodged the original 
                amendment for a threshold of 15 per cent. As members of the Audit 
                Committee realise, 50 per cent is an arbitrary figure, as are 
                25 per cent and 15 per cent, and we have to come to some compromise.</P>
              <P>I welcome the new threshold, but I do not welcome the fact that 
                the minister has missed out an important concession that he offered 
                verbally to the committee&#151;that, in exceptional circumstances, 
                the Auditor General would be able to go into any organisation 
                where public funds were involved. Why, at this late stage, did

              <P>that he should leave that out of the bill?</P>
              <P><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>I welcome the proposed amendments, which are 
                skilfully drafted. Despite the concerns of Andrew Welsh and Nick 
                Johnston, the threshold that has been adjudged is reasonable because, 
                if the figures are too small, we run the risk of totally overwhelming 
                our administration. Both the Audit Committee and the Finance Committee 
                will have to keep that under review.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>When considering this matter, it is important 
                to differentiate clearly between access to financial and other 
                information and value-for-money studies. The amendment is primarily 
                about value-for-money studies, for which it was entirely appropriate&#151;in 
                the light of the discussions that we had&#151;to review the threshold 
                and to bring it down from 50 per cent to 25 per cent.</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Will the minister 
                give way?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>It may be helpful for Mr Adam to listen 
                to my point; afterwards, I will bring him in.</P>
              <P>If we were to go below 25 per cent, a wide range of organisations 
                that receive a very small proportion of their money from public 
                funds would be included on a compulsory basis. They may then hold 
                back from applying for public funds because of the possibility 
                of a value-for-money exercise.</P>
              <P>The amendment does not restrict the Auditor General's power to 
                get access to information for any of the audits that he is carrying 
                out. Section 22 gives the Auditor General wide-ranging powers 
                to gain access not only&#151;as part of one of his audits of another 
                body&#151;to information from bodies that have received public 
                funds, but to documentation that relevant persons might have that 
                could affect that audit or the use of public funds. That wide-ranging 
                provision gives the Auditor General for Scotland the power to 
                look after the public pound as far as he or&#151;perhaps in the 
                future&#151;she will ever have to.</P>
              <P>The provision is important and must be compared with the 25 per 
                cent figure for value-for-money studies. The latter provision, 
                combined with the provision for a specific agreed value-for-money 
                audit to be carried out by the Auditor General for Scotland for 
                bodies that receive less than 25 per cent of their income from 
                public funds, covers the exceptional circumstances that have been 
                mentioned. Mr Johnston may disagree about the interpretation, 
                but I hope that he will agree that the combination of those two 
                provisions gives the Auditor General sufficient powers to look 
                after public funds in Scotland.</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>Like others, I welcome the concession that 
                the minister has made. However, </P>

              <P>not everybody is used to reading legalistic documents. I therefore 
                ask the minister to clarify two technical points and respond to 
                the detailed point made by Mr Johnston about what I had understood 
                was the agreement to reduce the threshold to 0 per cent in exceptional 
                circumstances. Will the minister clarify whether amendment 9 allows 
                the Auditor General free access to any organisation that expends 
                public money, as Andrew Welsh and Nick Johnston would like?</P>
              <P>My second point is perhaps even more technical. Amendment 12 
                would delete the words &quot;the condition in&quot; from section 
                21(3)(b), which refers to whether,</P>
              <P>&quot;in the case of a class of body or office-holder, the condition 
                in paragraph (a) is satisfied in relation to at least half of 
                those in the class.&quot;</P>
              <P>I am not sure whether</P>
              <P>&quot;half of those in the class&quot;</P>
              <P>is another area where the threshold should be 25 per cent rather 
                than 50 per cent. Indeed, I am not sure what exactly is meant 
                by those words. How will the minister honour his pledge to allow 
                full access to information from any organisation that spends public 
                moneys in exceptional circumstances?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>The words</P>
              <P>&quot;half of those in the class&quot;</P>
              <P>refer to the class of body or office-holder, which is mentioned 
                in the line above.</P>
              <P>On access to information in exceptional circumstances, section 
                22 of the bill gives the Auditor General the power to seek the 
                information to which Mr Adam, Mr Welsh and Mr Johnston refer. 
                That is different from conducting a value-for-money exercise. 
                I suspect that if a body in Scotland that received less than 25 
                per cent of its income from public funds&#151;and that was subject 
                to parliamentary scrutiny or debate because of the way in which 
                that money was spent&#151;refused to agree to a value-for-money 
                study that the Parliament felt was reasonable, the Parliament 
                would not agree to that body getting the 10 or 15 per cent of 
                its income that it got from public moneys in the following year. 
                That is the control that we would have and why the bill will work 
                by agreement, without an audit being imposed.</P>
              <P>We need to set some priorities for the Auditor General for Scotland, 
                which is what the amendment seeks to do. The amendment follows 
                the public pound and ensures that proper value-for-money exercises 
                can be carried out, but it does so in a way that prioritises the 
                elements of public finance that are substantial and whose scrutiny 
                is therefore in the public interest.</P>

              </I> 
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>Amendment 27 concerns value-for-money examinations 
                of the water and sewerage authorities. The Water Industry Act 
                1999 creates the new office of Water Industry Commissioner for 
                Scotland, which is a major step forward in the regulation of the 
                water industry in Scotland. We are concerned that, as both the 
                commissioner and the Auditor General for Scotland have a remit 
                to ensure that the water and sewerage authorities act with economy, 
                efficiency and effectiveness, there is a potential for overlap. 
                I am sure that the Auditor General and the commissioner will liaise 
                to ensure that their activities are complementary and do not duplicate 
                each other. Amendment 27 merely gives such an arrangement statutory 
                force. I hope that members will agree to it.</P>
              <P>I move amendment 27.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>To clarify that point, will the minister 
                say whether he has in mind a pecking order in terms of who initiates 
                what? There is some ambiguity&#151;I hope that the minister will 
                pardon me, but I am not sure about the way in which he has drafted 
                the provision. Is it the Auditor General who will ask the Water 
                Industry Commissioner to get involved in a value-for-money study, 
                or will the commissioner do that automatically and then report 
                to the Auditor General? Alternatively, will they have two separate, 
                independent functions? From the Parliament's point of view, would 
                the Auditor General kick-start the study?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>The bill refers specifically to the powers 
                of the Auditor General and to the role of Audit Scotland. It would 
                therefore not be appropriate for it to determine how the Water 
                Industry Commissioner would carry out his or her duties. The bill 
                is about what the Auditor General will do; as amendment 27 says, 
                the Auditor General would have to consult the Water Industry Commissioner 
                for Scotland before he chose to carry out a value-for-money study.</P>
              <P>The commissioner and the Auditor General could, in theory, still 
                carry out two studies at the same time, but one would hope that 
                the Auditor General would not institute a value-for-money study 
                in an area that was already being dealt with by the commissioner. 
                That is what the amendment seeks to achieve.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>Given the shortage of time, I will shorten 
                my remarks on amendments 28 and 29, both of which are technical. 
                Their intention is simply to maintain existing arrangements in 
                relation to water authorities' working capital flexibility.</P>
              <P>The bill, as drafted, would apply parliamentary control to all 
                borrowing by the new water and sewerage authorities. The controls 
                would extend to borrowing by means of bank overdraft to meet a 
                day-to-day excess of expenditure over income. The controls could 
                severely limit the authorities in managing their expenditure efficiently, 
                because they would have to ensure that, at the year end, they 
                had not exceeded the borrowing limit set by Parliament. That might 
                require them to reduce their investment on capital projects so 
                as to be certain that they would not be exceeding their borrowing 
                authority. Presently, administrative arrangements allow the authorities 
                to operate an overdraft facility that does not count against the 
                Parliament's budget. The bill, as drafted, would remove that flexibility; 
                the amendments are intended to reinstate it. I hope that members 
                will agree to them.</P>

              <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) 
                Bill</strong></P>
              <P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Patricia Ferguson):</strong> I invite 
                Mr McConnell to move motion S1M-320.</P>
              <P>16:02</P>
              <P><strong>The Minister for Finance (Mr Jack McConnell):</strong> This bill 
                is a fine example of how devolution can make a real difference 
                to the people of Scotland. It will help the Parliament and the 
                Executive to take decisions on expenditure that are critical to 
                Scotland and to our future success. Those decisions will, of course, 
                be taken in a Scottish context.</P>
              <P>The bill has shown that a devolved Administration can tackle 
                issues of real consequence. Its provisions go to the heart of 
                good governance. The bill has shown that the Parliament and the 
                Executive can work together&#151;although it was developed by 
                the Executive, it owes a great deal to the input of the Parliament, 
                particularly to that of the members of the Audit Committee and 
                the Finance Committee.</P>
              <P>Let me place the bill in context. In February 1998, the then 
                Secretary of State for Scotland asked the financial issues advisory 
                group to mark out a blueprint for Scotland's public finances after 
                devolution. Members will recall from earlier discussions that 
                that group produced an extremely thorough report, proposing a 
                variety of measures intended to ensure that, after devolution, 
                Scotland's public finances could be managed effectively.</P>
              <P>As many of us will be aware, the statutory framework that the 
                bill will put in place is just one of several ways in which FIAG's 
                recommendations are being implemented. FIAG's vision of a financial 
                regime that would be open and accessible, and that would provide 
                a balance between the Parliament and the Executive, goes to the 
                heart of the bill. Although there was a deliberate decision not 
                to throw out tried and tested Westminster procedures unless something 
                better could be devised, there are a number of areas where the 
                Parliament is about to lead the way on financial management. Examples 
                that spring to mind are the statutory arrangements for ensuring 
                that officials of the Scottish Executive are answerable to the 
                Parliament for their financial stewardship, and the arrangements 
                for public audit, which are perhaps epitomised by the proposal 
                to establish a single public audit service for Scotland&#151;a 
                service that we all expect to be at the leading edge of public 
                audit practice.</P>

            <TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
              <P>The main provisions of the bill cover Parliament's controls on 
                the Executive's expenditure, including controls on temporary and 
                emergency arrangements. They ensure that the Executive's spending 
                programme will be subject to thorough parliamentary scrutiny. 
                Members should be in no doubt&#151;the partnership Executive supports 
                those processes and we will meet their demands. We will account 
                for our actions and ensure that Parliament is involved in our 
                financial decisions. I reiterate that again on behalf of my colleagues; 
                this is a challenge, but we will make it work.</P>
              <P>Having covered the statutory requirements of the budgeting process, 
                the bill goes on to deal with accountability. Crucially, it will 
                make officials answerable to the Parliament, while in no way diminishing 
                ministerial accountability. It puts officials under a statutory 
                duty to challenge the decisions of ministers on the grounds of 
                irregularity, impropriety or poor value for money.</P>
              <P>Other measures will help to ensure that financial accounts are 
                prepared promptly and that proper accounting standards can be 
                insisted on. It is my intention that the public sector in Scotland 
                should lead the way in producing financial information that is 
                accurate, informative and on time. The bill's provisions for audit 
                will help to ensure that that objective can be met.</P>
              <P>Finally, the bill puts in place a value-for-money regime. It 
                does not place unreasonable burdens on public sector managers, 
                but it enables the Parliament to ensure that the expenditure that 
                it authorises is spent economically, efficiently and to good effect. 
                Overall, the bill sets up a statutory framework for financial 
                management of which we all can be proud.</P>
              <P>There have been a number of changes to the bill since it was 
                first debated in Parliament; many stem from recommendations made 
                by MSPs during meetings of the Finance Committee and the Audit 
                Committee and during informal discussions. The process by which 
                the bill has been prepared has seemed to me very positive; I hope 
                that it will set a model for how the Parliament and the Scottish 
                Executive will work together in future.</P>
              <P>This bill would not have been possible without a great deal of 
                help and support. I extend my thanks first to the members of FIAG; 
                their report was the foundation of the bill and of wider matters 
                covered by the standing orders and non-statutory parliamentary 
                arrangements. I also thank the individuals and organisations, 
                too numerous to mention individually, who responded to the consultations 
                conducted by FIAG and the Executive. Help in drafting tricky technical 
                issues came from a number of sources; I mention particularly officials 
                from the Accounts Commission and the National Audit Office. My

              <P>thanks also go to the members of the Finance Committee and the 
                Audit Committee and to their clerk and her assistants. As I said, 
                members of the committees approached the bill in a positive and 
                constructive way and the clerk greatly assisted in that. I thank 
                my colleagues on the Executive for their support.</P>
              <P>The bill stems from recommendations whose sole purpose was to 
                ensure that Scotland has the best possible framework for public 
                financial management. Its provisions are often complex and, although 
                its objectives are straightforward, its implementation will require 
                our dealing with a variety of technical, financial and legal issues. 
                Despite its complexity, the bill has been subject to thorough 
                and effective scrutiny by the Parliament, which has resulted in 
                a number of improvements. We now have a bill that allows us in 
                a new way to set our budgets, to spend money openly and wisely 
                and to account for what we do.</P>
              <P>I move,</P>
              <P>That the Parliament agrees that the Public Finance and Accountability 
                (Scotland) Bill is passed.</P>
              <P>16:07</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I welcome the 
                bill in its final form and I congratulate FIAG for the role that 
                it played at the start of the process, informing so much of the 
                legislation before us.</P>
              <P>The good governance that we can demonstrate as a Parliament is 
                critical to the whole process. I think that it was Mr Welsh who 
                said at stage 2 that one of the beauties of a small country was 
                that one could govern better; that is the principle of devolution 
                that we would like carried into all the areas of policy competence 
                that normal countries have. If we can demonstrate that we can 
                spend our resources more wisely, more effectively, more efficiently 
                and with greater transparency and if we can promote better governance, 
                surely that makes a powerful case for having the same responsibilities 
                as a normal country in revenue raising. I look forward to the 
                day when we have a balanced budget&#151;when, like any normal 
                country, we are responsible for raising as well as spending the 
                money.</P>
              <P>When Mr McConnell relaxes after the rigours of a tough day, I 
                suggest that he reflects on his colleague across the Irish sea, 
                Charles McCreevy TD, who is today administering perhaps the most 
                exciting budget bill in Europe this year&#151;the Irish Government 
                is about to allow the people of Ireland to share in the country's 
                economic success. It would be nice if we had the same opportunity 
                in Scotland.</P>
              <P>I commend the Minister for Finance for lodging 20 of the 28 amendments 
                to correct previous </P>

              <P>inadequacies in his drafting. It would have been nice if he could 
                have engaged with some of the positive, co-operative politics 
                that the Finance Committee and the Audit Committee, under the 
                able convenerships of Mike Watson and Andrew Welsh, seek to promote. 
                Perhaps as we go on we can return to those good principles.</P>
              <P>16:09</P>
              <P><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>I welcome 
                the approach that has been taken to the bill. The bill must be 
                a fascinating piece of legislation, because we have the largest 
                turnout of Labour members for many weeks&#151;it is encouraging 
                to see them supporting the Minister for Finance.</P>
              <P>The Scottish Conservatives welcome the bill for providing a structure 
                and a mechanism by which the Parliament can ascertain on behalf 
                of the Scottish people where their money is spent and whether 
                it is spent prudently and to the maximum effect. The bill sums 
                up what we have tried to achieve in the Finance Committee and 
                the Audit Committee; I hope that people recognise that we have 
                approached it in a constructive, non-partisan manner. I also welcome 
                the input, before the establishment of the Parliament, from FIAG 
                and the many other organisations that the minister mentioned.</P>
              <P>The written agreements are vital to the role of the Finance Committee 
                in budget scrutiny. They will help the committee to support the 
                work of Parliament's other subject committees. We must build on 
                what we have done today to produce a good, proactive relationship 
                between the minister and the Finance Committee and the Parliament's 
                other committees. In particular, we must be able to call on the 
                minister at fairly short notice when an item needs to be discussed. 
                We will try to be flexible, as the minister has always tried to 
                be.</P>
              <P>We must have an assurance today that any potential Cabinet or 
                Executive committee structure set up by Mr Blair&#151;such as 
                the one that has been mentioned in the past couple of days&#151;will 
                not undermine, in any way, any relationship between Scottish ministers 
                and the Parliament.</P>
              <P>We have always said that every penny must be traceable and that 
                there should be no build-up of war chests. We hope that the bill 
                will prevent the recycling of previous financial statements as 
                new spending. We need clarity about the status of all on-going 
                spending programmes. Perhaps the minister will consider the provision 
                of monthly management accounts, or some such vehicle, to assist 
                the committees in their work.</P>
              <P>Public consultation, while laudable, takes place only at stage 
                1. The Finance Committee had problems at stage 2 and even the 
                expert </P>

              <P>witnesses whom we brought in to give assistance and clarity had 
                some difficulty. I hope that the minister will address that.</P>
              <P>Perhaps the minister would like to give some thought to a contingency 
                fund. I am always unhappy when contingencies are drawn from various 
                budgets; that gives an opportunity for smokescreens, which we 
                do not want in this Parliament. We want to be able to see clearly 
                what ministers are doing. We must also recognise that honest Jack 
                may not always be our Minister for Finance. It is important for 
                whoever succeeds to that role, whatever end of the bench he currently 
                sits at&#151;I do not know, as I am not the First Minister&#151;that 
                what we do today progresses in a constructive manner.</P>
              <P>In conclusion, I simply remind the First Minister&#151;at least 
                I would like to do so, but he is not here&#151;of his words at 
                the opening of the Parliament about Government openness and accountability.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid):</strong> Ten members 
                have indicated their desire to speak. Any other members who want 
                to participate should press their buttons now.</P>
              <P>16:12</P>
              <P><strong>Paul Martin (Glasgow Springburn) (Lab):</strong> I welcome the 
                fact that the bill will be passed today. I am sure that I speak 
                for all members of the Audit Committee when I say that I welcome 
                the minister's contribution to the process. The Audit Committee 
                has had a constructive debate on the bill; that is to be welcomed.</P>
              <P>I welcome the fact that the minister has accommodated a number 
                of points that were raised during the committee's proceedings, 
                particularly the point on value-for-money studies. The 25 per 
                cent threshold will certainly be a start to the process.</P>
              <P>The Parliament has been the subject of much criticism recently. 
                The bill establishes financial accountability to ensure that we 
                have a fully transparent process that will be a credit to the 
                new Parliament. I ask that the public and the press give us some 
                credit for what has been done so far. I see that three members 
                of the press are sticking out the debate this evening. [<I>Interruption.</I>] 
                I stand corrected&#151;four members of the press are in the gallery.</P>
              <P>Quite rightly, the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) 
                Bill has leaned towards the FIAG recommendations. Those recommendations 
                have been largely welcomed and have allowed us to ensure maximum 
                transparency and financial accountability.</P>

              <P>disposal, we must target funding towards priorities and avoid 
                waste. We are entering a refreshing era, where the spending of 
                public funds is under fierce scrutiny. I believe that the model 
                that we are debating meets those aims.</P>
              <P>I am pleased, in particular, with the bill's emphasis on plain 
                English. As an ex-member of Glasgow City Council, I know that 
                officials used to compete with one another to create new jargon. 
                The only way in which we can excite interest in the budgeting 
                debate is if we use plain English to make our accounts more accessible&#151;that 
                will ensure proper accountability.</P>
              <P>The proposal to transfer the Accounts Commission's responsibilities 
                for the health service audit to the Auditor General is crucial. 
                I have been frustrated by not being able to raise in the Parliament 
                issues concerning local health boards. The proposal recognises 
                the prominent role that the Parliament must play in the health 
                service audit. The Executive's plans to consolidate public accounts 
                give us real powers to obtain information from bodies and to allow 
                information to be audited. That is another example of effective 
                financial management.</P>
              <P>As Keith Raffan said, we will have a financial framework that 
                will receive worldwide recognition. That framework will ensure 
                the highest possible standards of financial accountability.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I should have called Keith 
                Raffan to open for the Liberal Democrats; my apologies.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Keith Raffan (Mid Scotland and Fife) (LD): </strong>I am happy 
                to follow Mr Martin, particularly given his remarks about the 
                press gallery. It is interesting that the press gallery is so 
                full when something minor or trivial happens, yet when the Parliament 
                does a piece of work that is not just solid and substantial, but 
                a first-class model for other countries&#151;I include the United 
                Kingdom and Westminster in that description&#151;so many of the 
                journalists have left. I am glad that there are a few more journalists 
                now. The last time we debated the matter, there was only one journalist 
                in the press gallery. We in the Finance Committee like percentages, 
                so I could say that the amount of journalists has increased by 
                400 per cent. [<I>Laughter.</I>]</P>
              <P>The bill goes to the heart of the relationship between the Parliament 
                and the Executive. I doubt that the Parliament will pass a more 
                important bill in this session. The bill establishes the financial 
                management framework for the future. Most important, it establishes 
                the budget-making process and the relationship between the Executive 
                and the Parliament and the Parliament </P>

              <P>and its committees in that respect. It is not just a question 
                of the Executive's accountability to Parliament, or to the Finance 
                Committee and the Audit Committee in particular. What is important 
                is that those committees and the Parliament will be involved in 
                the budget-making process. That is central to the bill and it 
                is infinitely superior to anything at Westminster.</P>
              <P>I hope that what we have done today will have a reaction&#151;occasionally 
                at Westminster there is a response as well as reaction&#151;and 
                that the UK Parliament will begin to debate its right to be involved 
                in the budget-making process.</P>
              <P>Some questions remain. There is a question about stage 1 of the 
                budget bill. The Minister has given a guarantee that he will provide 
                a provisional expenditure plan for that crucial stage. At the 
                beginning of the financial year, between April and July, not just 
                the Finance Committee and the Audit Committee, but the subject 
                committees, will have an opportunity to have input into the budget-making 
                process. The provisional expenditure plan must be fairly detailed 
                if the committees are to be able to make an intelligent judgment 
                about different spending priorities.</P>
              <P>Stage 2 will be in the autumn. September 20 is when the minister 
                is likely to introduce his detailed budget, and by the end of 
                November we will need to have fully debated and discussed it in 
                the Finance Committee, the Audit Committee and the subject committees. 
                That is a very short period. In the light of experience, we may 
                well have to try to lengthen it.</P>
              <P>Those are some current reservations&#151;there are very few&#151;about 
                the bill. Much will be revised in the light of experience. As 
                soon as we move into the new financial year&#151;the first full 
                financial year of the Parliament&#151;we will be able to make 
                a judgment about how well the process is working.</P>
              <P>As the minister rightly said, we are leading the way. It is important 
                that we pay tribute&#151;as all parties have&#151;to the financial 
                issues advisory group. If it had not been for its excellent work&#151;the 
                foundation for the bill&#151;we would not be at this stage now.</P>
              <P>It is very important to pay tribute to those who, in the run-up 
                to the Parliament, produced a very fine piece of work to help 
                us to do our work once we were elected. Credit is due to them, 
                and from now on&#151;as authors always say at the beginning of 
                their books&#151;all the mistakes will be ours. I am sure that 
                the press and the voters will remind us of that in the months 
                and years to come.</P>
              <P>I am happy to support the bill. I believe that it sets out a 
                budget-making process for Scotland that is a model of its kind 
                and to which other countries will look in future.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP): </strong>I congratulate the minister 
                on successfully piloting through this measure. What is happening 
                today is of massive importance for Scotland. This bill sets out 
                one of the foundation stones for the work of the Parliament. The 
                objectives of clarity, openness, accountability and the need to 
                obtain maximum effectiveness and efficiency in the use of public 
                money are at the heart of the FIAG recommendations, and all are 
                to be found in this bill. If the bill meets those objectives, 
                it will be a massive achievement for the people of Scotland.</P>
              <P>The Parliament has no option but to budget prudently because 
                of the fixed, limited nature of devolution finances. Westminster 
                regularly overshoots the chancellor's predictions by tens of billions 
                of pounds, but no such luxury is available to this devolved Parliament. 
                We have to harness, gather and maximise the effect of every available 
                pound on behalf of the Scottish people. Therefore, the greater 
                the openness, scrutiny and financial efficiency, the greater will 
                be the benefits for the people of Scotland in terms of services 
                delivered and the use of resources.</P>
              <P>The foundation stones exist in this bill; now Parliament and 
                the Executive must deliver. Scotland is currently governed by 
                quangos in many areas. I hope that the powers that are available 
                to the Auditor General will bring to public light and scrutiny 
                many dark areas of Scotland, and will do so on behalf of the people 
                of Scotland. Wherever public money is involved, the public must 
                be assured that there is transparency and value for money. However, 
                the proper scrutiny of public accounts goes further than simple 
                close investigation and reporting back. The scrutiny powers in 
                the bill have to be used positively and with sensitivity, rather 
                than becoming the simple application of fixed-rote formulae.</P>
              <P>I look forward to a public scrutiny system in Scotland that always 
                seeks out, and encourages the dissemination of, best practice, 
                without stifling innovation and initiative. Raising overall standards 
                and the quality of the services that are provided to the public 
                must always be an essential part of the new Scottish financial 
                system. This bill can only set out the framework for action. It 
                is now up to everyone involved to deliver the reality.</P>
              <P>The Minister for Finance has now delineated the system, and the 
                lines of responsibility between Parliament and the Executive, 
                and between Parliament and Audit Scotland, have been made clear. 
                Now we must all check against delivery. I congratulate FIAG and 
                thank the minister for delivering this bill. I wish everyone concerned 
                every success in delivering for Scotland.</P>

              <P><strong>Mike Watson (Glasgow Cathcart) (Lab): </strong>At the risk of giving 
                my colleague, the Minister for Finance, a red face, I join Andrew 
                Welsh and others in congratulating him on the way in which the 
                bill has been piloted to a successful conclusion&#151;the formality 
                of the vote notwithstanding. It is important to recognise that 
                this is an example of decentralised government in practice. This 
                Parliament, and not just those who have been involved in the various 
                stages of the bill, should take some credit for that. Decisions 
                on expenditure in Scotland are clearly set out, as are the means 
                of holding to account those who have responsibility for them.</P>
              <P>The bill has provided an example of effective working by two 
                committees in the various processes of a bill&#151;the Audit Committee 
                under the convenership of Andrew Welsh was the lead committee, 
                but the Finance Committee had a considerable role as well. It 
                has shown how the system can work for bills in other subject areas. 
                The system is not perfect, but we have shown very effectively 
                how it operates.</P>
              <P>As everyone has acknowledged, the bill is crucial. It is both 
                forward looking in authorising Scottish public resources and finances 
                and retrospective in scrutinising spending and holding to account 
                the Executive and public bodies. We cannot overstate the importance 
                of that in the context of the governance of Scotland and the crucial 
                role that this Parliament has in it.</P>
              <P>The important principle of value for money has also been established 
                and set out as part of a statutory framework for financial management 
                based on maximum transparency, as my colleague Paul Martin eloquently 
                outlined. This process has been an historic event: this is the 
                first bill to go through the full process of this Parliament. 
                All of us who have played a part in it have formed a template 
                for bills that will follow.</P>
              <P>Not many people knew what the financial issues advisory group 
                was before the process started. FIAG, as we refer to it, produced 
                a blueprint, which will endure and will be a cornerstone of the 
                way in which this Parliament operates and the government of Scotland 
                is carried forward. All those who have contributed to that group, 
                over a considerable period of time, should be congratulated.</P>
              <P>On a more personal note, I thank those involved in steering through 
                the first bill to go through all the various processes. It was 
                not easy and often the way in which the process was set out was 
                not as obvious as it might have been and had to be tested. I thank 
                Sarah Davidson, who is clerk to the Finance Committee and the 
                Audit Committee, which is not an easy task. I also thank her staff

              <P>and colleagues on both committees for the successful conclusion 
                of what, I am sure in retrospect, will prove to have been an historic 
                bill in this Parliament.</P>
              <P>16:26</P>
              <P><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>The declared aim of the 
                bill is to make public finances accountable. I am not sure that 
                the bill will achieve that aim to the extent to which many of 
                us would like. I will give the minister an example, on which I 
                would like him to respond.</P>
              <P>Last year, serious allegations were made about misappropriation 
                of public funds by senior management of the former Central Scotland 
                Healthcare NHS Trust. The prima facie evidence was so strong that 
                it convinced Mr John Rafferty, who was then chairman of the trust, 
                to arrange for the setting up of an independent review panel to 
                investigate the matter, which was also reported to the procurator 
                fiscal. Mr Rafferty, who is now special adviser to the First Minister, 
                gave me a commitment at that time that the findings of the independent 
                review panel would be made public.</P>
              <P>Sam Galbraith, then the health minister, reiterated that commitment 
                in a parliamentary reply given to me in the House of Commons in 
                January. That commitment has never been fully honoured. I want 
                to know how this bill will ensure the honouring of that commitment.</P>
              <P>Last week, Forth Valley Primary Care NHS Trust published a report 
                of an internal audit that raises more questions than it answers. 
                It identifies failures and irregularities but it does not identify 
                who was responsible or say how much public money was misappropriated. 
                Those are matters of legitimate public concern. Will the minister 
                tell us whether this bill will help to ensure public access to 
                information about alleged misappropriation of public funds?</P>
              <P>Last week, we had a statement about freedom of information; this 
                week, we have this bill, which is a statement about the need to 
                bring public finances more to public account. It is time that 
                we turned those fine words into action.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Under the terms of the business 
                motion, we now move to the winding-up speeches.</P>
              <P>16:28</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>I am pleased 
                to be speaking at the final stage of this bill. Like Andrew Welsh, 
                I think that in it we have laid the financial foundations for 
                the governance of Scotland and for proper scrutiny.</P>

              <P>First, we have exposed the consistent underspend of the Scottish 
                Office. I hope that by exposing that underspend we will make better 
                use in future of the &#163;16 billion block grant.</P>
              <P>Secondly, we have the chance to ensure that every public body 
                that spends public money does so in the bright light. Perhaps 
                we will be able to ensure better and more effective use of public 
                funds. My colleague, David Davidson, spoke at length on the financial 
                sections of the bill, so I will not dwell on that.</P>
              <P>I welcome the establishment of Audit Scotland and give the good 
                wishes of the Parliament and the Audit Committee to the staff 
                of the National Audit Office and the Accounts Commission. I hope 
                that the bringing together of those two bodies is a smooth transition.</P>
              <P>We also welcome the transfer of audit of health boards and trusts 
                to the Auditor General for Scotland. Speaking of the Auditor General, 
                I was honoured to be asked to play a part in the appointment of 
                that august gentleman. The calibre of all the candidates was extremely 
                high.</P>
              <P>I wish to put on record again the Conservative party's concerns 
                that the bill, in broad terms, will not embrace the allocation 
                of &#163;6.4 billion to local authorities. I know that the Convention 
                of Scottish Local Authorities has highlighted the need for an 
                independent accounts commission that is free from political influence. 
                Perhaps now we may get the openness that will ensure that the 
                Executive does not keep constantly recycling, under the guise 
                of new expenditure, money that has already been committed.</P>
              <P>Finally, as time is tight, I want to add my thanks to Sarah Davidson 
                and all the clerks to the Finance Committee and the Audit Committee 
                for giving us guiding light and showing us the way through often 
                stumbling footsteps. I commend to the chamber the patience that 
                the clerks showed to people who, like me, have not been involved 
                in this process before. I commend the bill to the chamber&#151;it

                issues advisory group for the considerable work that was put into 
                this area of thinking before our Parliament was established. I 
                am glad that the minister has shown a willingness to go as far 
                as he can to incorporate FIAG's thinking into the bill That is 
                much appreciated. I also wish to record the SNP's thanks to the

              <P>In his opening speech, the minister set out an impressive list 
                of hopes for the financial management and control process that 
                the bill gives the Parliament. He talked about openness and accessibility 
                and about his determination to meet the demands of the parliamentary 
                process. The SNP warmly welcomes those concepts and commitments: 
                we intend to hold the minister to them vigorously.</P>
              <P>Last week, the minister produced a glossy document, &quot;Spending 
                Plans for Scotland&quot;. If that document, with not one real-terms 
                figure in its 24 pages of glossy print, reflects his definition 
                of openness, I am afraid that his definition is different from 
                mine. He gave commitments to ensure that accurate information 
                is available to Parliament&#151;and on time. As an Opposition, 
                we warmly endorse those concepts, but we must look back to some 
                of the steps in the bill's progress and recognise that not all 
                the information was available on time.</P>
              <P>I return to the major question about the process, which remains 
                unanswered. As we approve the bill today&#151;we will do so in 
                a moment&#151;the Finance Committee has not agreed the financial 
                procedures aspect of the bill. These are important issues about 
                the responsibility of Parliament and the scrutiny that Parliament 
                can exercise over the Executive. The SNP intends to use this Parliament's 
                procedures to ensure that that scrutiny is applied to its fullest 
                extent. However, we need the Executive's co-operation to guarantee 
                that the partnership that has existed so far on these issues can 
                continue during the remainder of this parliamentary session.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>I wish to reiterate my thanks to those outwith 
                the bill team who were involved in producing the bill. I also 
                wish to record my thanks to the officials who managed to deliver 
                a bill that, in September, was presented to Parliament two weeks 
                ahead of schedule. Even at that stage, I did not really expect 
                that my hope of a Christmas finish would be met. However, today 
                we have managed to reach stage 3 and the closing speeches three 
                weeks ahead of schedule. I wish to thank those officials for their 
                help in ensuring that that happened. It has given me a lot of 
                pleasure to be part of the team that produced the bill and to 
                speak to the bill today.</P>
              <P>This has been an interesting, if short, debate, covering many 
                issues that are crucial to the good management of the Parliament's 
                finances. I do not want to pick up on the various close-to-party-political 
                points that have been made. While that might liven up the afternoon, 
                I do not think that it would be appropriate.</P>

            <TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
              <P>Twenty years ago, I was one of Dennis Canavan's constituents. 
                I clearly remember him entering his second term in Parliament 
                and entertaining the students of the University of Stirling with 
                descriptions of appropriations in aid and various other phrases 
                used at Westminster in order to, as he put it then, confuse members 
                of Parliament and the public, and to hide decisions away from 
                openness and transparency.</P>
              <P>I am pleased that we have produced a set of procedures that will 
                use plainer English and will be more open and transparent. However, 
                I also remember Dennis describing to us at great length how he 
                was able to use the procedures of the House of Commons to raise 
                issues in debates that people were not expecting or which were 
                not appropriate. He clearly still has that talent 20 years on.</P>
              <P>It would not be appropriate to talk about the former Central 
                Scotland Healthcare NHS Trust today, but it is important to note 
                that the Auditor General for Scotland will be responsible for 
                auditing the health service in Scotland and that the powers that 
                this bill gives the Auditor General will ensure that the health 
                service is subject to more scrutiny than it has had for a long 
                time.</P>
              <P>The bill is not the end of a process. Granting resources and 
                scrutinising the use of them ranks among the most important functions 
                of any Parliament. Detailed procedures will be put in place and 
                will be agreed in the Parliament, but they will have to evolve 
                to suit changing circumstances. We must be vigilant to ensure 
                that the procedures remain appropriate; we must not be afraid 
                to make changes if circumstances demand that we do. The bill provides 
                the framework for the proper conduct of financial affairs by this 
                Parliament, the Executive and other bodies.</P>
              <P><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>Does the minister agree 
                that the process that we are setting up, whereby the Finance Committee 
                will be able to scrutinise the general budget intentions and consult 
                the subject committees, which will be expected to consult the 
                public, means that we will have one of the most open systems in 
                the western world?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>I agree with that and confirm that we want 
                to make the process work.</P>
              <P>The partnership agreement said that the people of Scotland wanted 
                open, stable and responsible government, fully accountable to 
                a modern, representative Parliament. The Scottish Labour and Scottish 
                Liberal Democrat partners said that they wanted innovative government 
                that was open and that they welcomed from any source good ideas 
                that encouraged participation. Those statements built on the work

              <P>I must start by declaring an interest. I am a member of the Co-operative 
                party. It is somewhat strange that it is the only political party 
                whose manifesto says that every time we speak on something, we 
                will declare our interest. I hope that the Procedures Committee, 
                the Standards Committee and the Parliament will address that issue 
                and resolve the situation.</P>
              <P>I welcome the co-operators, from various strands of the Co-operative 
                movement, who have come along today to listen to the debate in 
                the public gallery, and I thank the many people who have stayed 
                behind to hear this debate on an important issue.</P>
              <P>We have heard a lot of talk about finance. I am going to talk 
                about finance from a slightly different perspective. We have heard 
                a lot of talk about the passing of the bill being an historic 
                event. I want to put it on record that this is also an historic 
                occasion for the Co-operative party and the Co-operative movement 
                in Scotland.</P>
              <P>Most members will know that co-operation is not new. There is 
                a long history of ordinary people working together for the common

                If members think back beyond the Rochdale pioneers, to the Fenwick 
                weavers in Ayrshire and the work that was done by Robert Owen

                first to campaign on behalf of women, seeking equal rights, maternity 
                rights and family allowances.</P>
              <P>The Co-op in Scotland is following its long and distinguished 
                history. Our information from the Co-operative Union puts in perspective 
                exactly where co-operation exists in Scotland today. Five co-operative 
                societies are operating nearly 500 Co-op stores, more than 100 
                funeral homes, 24 travel bureaux, 37 post offices and 17 farms&#151;not 
                a kind of business that people would necessarily associate with 
                the Co-operative movement. Those enterprises are spread throughout 
                the country, from Shotts and Ballater to Brechin, from Dumfries 
                to Dalkeith, and from Stromness to Stornoway. There are Co-op 
                shops in inner cities and suburbs, in towns and villages, in the 
                Highlands and Islands, and in Scotland's rural areas.</P>
              <P>Nearly 14,000 people in Scotland earn their living working for 
                the Co-op. It is a truly grass-roots organisation that is owned 
                by more than 430,000 Scots and directed by boards that are elected 
                from among the consumer owners. For me, that is the essence of 
                co-operation.</P>
              <P>Over the past few years, Scottish Co-op has gone further than 
                setting up its own stores in local communities; it has begun to 
                find ways of helping people to help themselves. For several years, 
                it has supported community stores that are managed by local volunteers, 
                by offering consultancy on start-up, developing an on-going retail 
                policy, helping to provide staff training, giving interest-free 
                loans for initial stock, supplying equipment and delivering products. 
                The Co-op has kept co-operatives and stores going in remote areas, 
                often in the islands, and provides a service to consumers in underpopulated 
                areas where there is not enough trade to sustain a commercial 
                store and where the private sector would not have an interest.</P>
              <P>Based on that experience, schemes have recently been extended 
                to assist smaller self-help projects in the central belt&#151;for 
                example, Fruit Barra, which is part of the Govan healthy eating 
                project, and the North Lanarkshire Federation of Food Co-ops. 
                In July, the latter became a corporate member of the Co-operative 
                Wholesale Society, which is a significant development.</P>
              <P>Scottish Co-op and the wider Co-operative movement agree with 
                the Scottish Executive that social inclusion is a key issue for 
                Scotland. We have already had discussions with ministers about 
                working in local communities and supporting the work of local 
                volunteers. We welcome the initiatives that have been introduced

                Social inclusion means giving people opportunities, the back-up 
                and the confidence to help themselves&#151;not just in the large 
                co-operative societies, but in other co-operative organisations 
                such as credit unions, food co-ops, housing co-ops and community 
                businesses.</P>
              <P>I will say a few words about the credit union movement. A recent 
                document from the Local Government Association describes community-based 
                credit unions as</P>
              <P>&quot;financial co-ops that offer quality and low cost financial 
                services to their members.&quot;</P>
              <P>&nbsp;It continues:</P>
              <P>&quot;They can be particularly beneficial to those on low incomes 
                or those excluded from mainstream financial institutions. They 
                can also play an important part in the social regeneration and 
                economic development of communities, as well as being important 
                to anti-poverty and sustainable development initiatives.&quot;</P>
              <P>Most people recognise the need for further development of the 
                work of credit unions. A recent study based on research by Liverpool 
                John Moores University highlights the potential of credit unions 
                to play an increasing role in the financial world.</P>
              <P>All of us involved in the Co-operative movement favour an expansion 
                of that form of common and mutual ownership. That was why in the 
                early days of the Parliament I lodged a question asking us to 
                consider paving the way by setting up some form of credit union. 
                Although there is nobody from the press here to report this&#151;which 
                is significant, given the comments that have appeared in some 
                articles&#151;I want to say, for the record, that a credit union 
                in the Parliament would not be about providing cheap loans to 
                MSPs, but would be about sending out the message that co-operation 
                and mutuality are a fundamental principle that is valued in Scotland, 
                and a way forward that is supported by the Scottish Executive.</P>
              <P>Today I want to restate the principle of common ownership and 
                mutuality, and to say that it is as relevant today as it ever 
                was. The recent setting up of the Scottish Co-operative and Mutual 
                Forum is important, because it brings together for the first time 
                all strands of co-operatives and mutuals in Scotland. That will 
                enable us to take forward the message and to promote practical 
                alternatives. The forum will provide a focus for the promotion 
                of common and co-operative ownership and will allow us to promote 
                mutuality as an alternative form of ownership of both services 
                and institutions. The continued, sustained and predatory attacks 
                on building societies and other mutual institutions indicate why 
                that is necessary.</P>

                Scottish Parliament, but it will certainly not be the last. We 
                will seek to ensure that the Executive considers co-operative 
                solutions in all its policy initiatives. In true co-operative 
                tradition, I end by inviting all members to come and join us for 
                a small reception at Parliament Headquarters after the debate.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>If co-operators and others 
                are to contribute to the debate, speeches should be kept to well 
                under three minutes.</P>
              <P>16:48</P>
              <P><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I congratulate 
                Cathy Jamieson on drawing Parliament's attention to an extremely 
                important sector of Scottish society and&#151;which is sometimes 
                overlooked&#151;an important part of the Scottish economy.</P>
              <P>Scotland has played a leading role in developing co-operative 
                and mutual institutions&#151;the Trustee Savings Bank, public 
                lending libraries, parochial schools, working-class housing societies 
                and, most recently, rural community co-operatives.</P>
              <P>The Executive has recently drawn attention to the increasing 
                exclusion of many communities from the rest of society. The withdrawal 
                of the banking industry from any kind of presence in Scotland's 
                most deprived communities undermines the financial sector's argument 
                for reducing regulation of its activities. Like Cathy, I have 
                been pleased by the focus on the potential of credit unions to 
                fill some of the gaps that have been left by the banks. I, too, 
                am a great supporter of credit unions and would like to see a 
                steady increase in the proportion of the population that has access 
                to them.</P>
              <P>Another mutual sector that is close to my heart is the housing 
                association movement. I know that members from all parties hold 
                the movement in high regard, and I have heard many individuals 
                refer to the valuable work that is done by their local housing 
                associations and co-operatives. I would like to make a plea for 
                members to turn the rhetoric of support for the movement into 
                active support. I address that plea in particular to the back 
                benchers of the governing parties who, in the </P>

              <P>press of other priorities, may have overlooked just how much 
                the actions of the Executive are damaging housing associations 
                and co-operatives.</P>
              <P>I have time to refer to only two of the most significant ways 
                in which the Executive's actions are damaging. The first&#151;and 
                perhaps the most easily demonstrated&#151;is the withdrawal of 
                resources from housing associations and co-operatives. Over the 
                period of the expenditure plan that was published by the Minister 
                for Finance, the resources available to Scottish Homes will drop 
                from &#163;319 million to &#163;264 million&#151;a reduction of almost 20 
                per cent. That will cause major difficulties, not just for the 
                organisation, but for the people who depend on it.</P>
              <P>I do not have time to address the second element of the Executive's 
                approach, but the policy is disastrous.</P>
              <P>I ask the Minister for Communities, who basks in the title of 
                the listening minister, to try trusting communities and to listen 
                to them properly before forcing decisions on a no-choice option. 
                Please abandon the big-bang approach, and invest in a proper success 
                story. It might not go down well in John Wheatley House, but it 
                will go down well in John Wheatley's home of Shettleston, which 
                is now represented by the Deputy Minister for Local Government.</P>
              <P>16:50</P>
              <P><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab): </strong>I welcome the opportunity 
                to speak, even if the previous speech was hardly in the spirit 
                of co-operation.</P>
              <P>I am proud to be a Labour and Co-operative MSP. I declare an 
                interest as a member of the Co-operative party. I recognise and 
                applaud the tradition in my area of co-operative activity in the 
                Co-operative party, and importantly in the Co-operative Women's 
                Guild, and the co-operative initiatives in the broader community. 
                The Scottish Co-operative and Mutual Forum reflects the diversity 
                of the movement that we seek to celebrate today.</P>
              <P>There is a tendency to think that co-operative initiatives are 
                the province of woolly-hatted do-gooders, that they are easy or 
                soft options, and that they are not part of the hard debates on 
                the economy and social inclusion. However, co-operation offers 
                a significant contribution to those debates. The reality is that 
                co-operative initiatives involve hard work, risk taking and high 
                levels of trust, and when they work effectively, they are a standing 
                reproach to those who would have us believe that there is no such 
                thing as society, and that as individuals we must be appealed 
                to only on the basest of motives&#151;that of personal gain.</P>

              <P>The Co-operative movement is not just a movement of the past 
                that was intriguing in its time. It has something to say now and 
                in the future. The Rochdale pioneers knew that, as did the visionaries 
                closer to home in New Lanark. They understood the importance of 
                social inclusion, the liberating influence of education and the 
                power of decision making at local level. Those examples say something 
                to those of us who might be defined as the political class. Vision, 
                the ability to develop policy and to seek and find solutions to 
                the world's problems are not the monopoly of those in elected 
                positions, and we will stand or fall in Parliament by our ability 
                to work with our communities to develop solutions.</P>
              <P>The Co-operative movement is of significant importance, and is 
                often willing to take responsibility, whereas the private sector, 
                simply looking for quick gain, will not take the risk. Co-operative 
                initiatives can meet needs that the public sector is often slow 
                to recognise. Co-operative child care initiatives are a good example 
                of the public sector following on where co-operation has gone 
                previously.</P>
              <P>The Co-operative movement also offers a variety of interesting 
                options for the future, whether it is in finance, the housing 
                sector or elsewhere. I hope that in the future, those models will 
                be taken up.</P>
              <P>The most powerful thing about co-operation is that it speaks 
                to the good in us all, and it allows us to be optimistic that 
                we can manage our affairs together and liberate ourselves to work 
                together for the commonweal.</P>

              <P><strong>Marilyn Livingstone (Kirkcaldy) (Lab): </strong>Like Cathy Jamieson 
                and Johann Lamont, I must declare my interest as a member of the 
                Labour and Co-operative movement. I am proud to be able to say 
                that.</P>
              <P>The Co-operative movement has been part of my daily life and, 
                like millions of people, I welcome co-operatives in our society. 
                More than 150 years on from the Rochdale pioneers, the co-operative 
                ideal is as relevant as it has ever been. Over the years, the 
                Co-operative party has championed retail co-operatives, working 
                and housing co-operatives, credit unions and the Co-operative 
                Development Agency. The co-operative ideal embraces fully our 
                commitment to the social justice agenda. That agenda is at the 
                heart of all our policies in Parliament.</P>
              <P>For more than 150 years, co-operative principles have provided 
                a successful blend of individual advancement and collective betterment, 
                and have held dear the key values of equality and democracy. The

                and economic well-being of the community, through initiatives 
                ranging from food co-ops to community businesses.</P>
              <P>Those initiatives have enabled many people who feel excluded 
                from our society&#151;for whatever reason&#151;to feel that they 
                are able to take part in their communities. As Cathy Jamieson 
                said, people who feel excluded need help to help themselves. As 
                other members have said, the valuable work of community-based 
                credit unions and housing associations has gone a long way to 
                address those problems. A major expansion of co-operatives within 
                a social economy would provide us with a welcome social and economic 
                alternative.</P>
              <P>I congratulate Cathy Jamieson on bringing this debate to the 
                chamber and add my support to the recent inception of the Scottish 
                Co-operative and Mutual Forum, which will bring together co-operative 
                organisations across Scotland. I wish the forum every success.</P>
              <P>16:55</P>
              <P><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>I applaud the motion 
                and the co-operative principle. I want to raise two points.</P>
              <P>First, our tax and social security system encourages many people 
                to enter the black economy. It would be possible to make the rules 
                more flexible in many areas to encourage small co-operative ventures 
                in poorer urban and rural areas to provide interesting and useful 
                work for people in a way that did not unfairly impinge on their 
                benefits. If we were more relaxed, perhaps a light grey economy 
                might replace the black economy to everyone's benefit. However, 
                the co-operative principle of a community working together for 
                the community's benefit should be behind that.</P>
              <P>Secondly, the co-operative movement produced an extremely good 
                pamphlet on running football clubs as co-operatives, which is 
                a scheme that has had great success on the continent. Rhona Brankin 
                kindly answered my question about the subject. Perhaps we should 
                consider encouraging some of our football clubs to become co-operatives, 
                which would bring all kinds of benefits to the community. The 
                community would feel more involved and the scheme might also resolve 
                some of the clubs' financial problems.</P>
              <P>I wish the co-operative movement the best of luck.</P>

                secrets.</P>
              <P>That number will never leave me; members can see how easily it 
                comes to me. It represented a way that working-class men and women 
                could save. They bought their goods in the local co-ops and waited 
                with bated breath for the divvy either during the Glasgow fair 
                or at Christmas.</P>
              <P>I remember the word menadge&#151;I will not say that we would 
                be able to run one in Parliament&#151;which is another form of 
                working-class saving. However, we have moved from that system 
                to the credit union, which gives people not only the power to 
                save but, more important, the power to borrow. That means that 
                people are socially included in a way that they were not before.</P>
              <P>We should congratulate activists in credit unions, such as the 
                vibrant credit union in Port Glasgow. However, they should be 
                as widespread in this country as they are in Australia and the 
                Republic of Ireland. For example, my son Mark, who lives in Sydney, 
                banks with the Resources Credit Union.</P>
              <P>With the advent of out-of-town shopping in large supermarkets, 
                the retail and food co-operatives now have a unique and essential 
                place. As people might have no means to travel outwith the town 
                and corner shops might be overpriced, local co-operatives provide 
                fresh, healthy and wholesome food at reasonable prices. Last night, 
                while watching a TV programme that compared the health of kids 
                in the 1950s to today's kids, I thought that most parents in the 
                1950s would have shopped in the local co-op. Not only were the 
                co-ops a form of social inclusion, they provided a good and appropriate 
                local service that contributed to the health of the nation.</P>
              <P>When I was a single parent living in a difficult-to-let house 
                in Pollok, a housing co-operative provided me with my first move 
                into the housing market, which gave me the opportunity to be socially 
                included rather than excluded. Cathy Jamieson has to be congratulated 
                for bringing the motion to the chamber. The bringing together 
                of co-operative movements across Scotland will make the movement 
                much stronger and more cohesive, which can only be good for the 
                promotion of social inclusion and community involvement.</P>

              <P>Edinburgh, are now public houses. Perhaps there is something 
                to be learned from that.</P>
              <P>I welcome this debate and the motion. I would like to speak about 
                an area of expertise that I gathered when I was in public relations 
                and working for a co-op&#151;the Edinburgh Bicycle Co-operative 
                Ltd. When it started life away back in 1977, it was just three 
                people working in a corner shop of no more than 570 sq ft. All 
                they did was bicycle repairs, and their turnover in that first 
                year was &#163;28,000. Today, Edinburgh Bicycle Co-operative is the 
                largest independent bicycle retailer in the United Kingdom. It 
                has 44 full-time staff, and 3,600 sq ft of retail space just up 
                the road from the Parliament in Bruntsfield. It has the largest 
                mail-order catalogue on the market for bikes and accessories&#151;accessories 
                being especially important. That was not meant as a plug; that 
                was meant to show that co-operatives can have an important place 
                in modern life and in the economy of retail Britain.</P>
              <P>We have to admit that co-operatives are not always successful, 
                so why was the Edinburgh Bicycle Co-operative successful? The 
                difference was that it was oriented towards the customer. It continually 
                reviewed what the customers wanted and had a management structure 
                to do that. It was oriented to marketing and looked outwards rather 
                than just inwards. That is important for any company, whether 
                it is a co-operative limited company or an individual.</P>
              <P>Co-operatives have a place. We Conservatives have absolutely 
                no reason to fear or oppose them. We want them to be part of the 
                structure of our economy. Any organisation that can encourage 
                me to buy a bike has to have something going for it. It is with 
                pleasure, therefore, that I support this motion.</P>

                to an important movement in Scotland, which, as we have heard, 
                can make a key contribution to combating social exclusion.</P>

                the milestones that we identified in that document.</P>
              <P>We have heard much in the past half-hour that the Executive welcomes, 
                and many principles that we have absolutely no difficulty in supporting.

              <P>can reassure members that we will consider those ideas in the 
                context of the action plan that we will bring to Parliament.</P>
              <P>I think that members will agree that the main driver of poverty 
                is worklessness: being without a job for any length of time is 
                the surest guarantee of economic exclusion. We are working closely 
                with Henry McLeish and his enterprise team to promote more inclusive 
                policies and practices.</P>
              <P>Since its establishment, Highland and Islands Enterprise has 
                had an explicitly social remit. It has three strategic objectives, 
                one of which is strengthening communities. Its priorities for 
                that are: to promote investment in community assets; to develop 
                community strengths and leadership; and to enhance the value of 
                culture and heritage. Within each of those priorities, it sees 
                a significant role for co-operatives, and seeks to support them 
                with financial assistance, where appropriate, and through the 
                provision of practical advice.</P>
              <P>We have strongly encouraged Scottish Enterprise to follow suit. 
                Its new strategy gives welcome attention to inclusive enterprise 
                policies&#151;indeed, promoting social inclusion is one of its 
                four major goals.</P>
              <P>Providing support for the development of new businesses in Scotland 
                is a priority. Scottish Enterprise welcomes initiatives that help 
                to produce businesses that are operated by a consortium or a co-operative 
                group. It uses the expertise of Employee Ownership Scotland and 
                other specialist advisers to assist clients who have expressed 
                an interest in co-operatives and mutuals.</P>
              <P>Over the next year, Scottish Enterprise is committed to developing 
                a clearer focus for creative and innovative business engagement 
                in the inclusion process. We will be considering what more Scottish 
                Enterprise can do to encourage enterprise, particularly in deprived 
                areas, but I believe that we can and should go further. This important 
                debate has yet to involve all those who help to shape our economy. 
                It is a debate about the role of social enterprise, and it involves 
                co-operatives and mutuals as a key element.</P>
              <P>The organisations that we find in the social economy have some 
                important characteristics. Professor Peter Lloyd, whose research 
                I shall share with members, has called them</P>
              <P>&quot;partnership driven for social ends&quot;.</P>
              <P>He notes that they have a leaning towards solidarity and democracy, 
                and recognise individuals and communities above giving returns 
                on capital. They are usually locally based, and are usually found 
                identifying solutions rather than identifying markets. Cathy Jamieson 
                is absolutely right: they empower communities and provide a </P>

              <P>significant platform for self-help.</P>
              <P>Let me pepper in a few statistics. The third sector is growing 
                faster than most other parts of the European economy. In Germany, 
                it grew at 11 per cent against 3 per cent in the economy overall; 
                in France, it grew by 16 per cent against 4 per cent; in Italy, 
                it grew by a staggering 39 per cent as opposed to 7 per cent. 
                That is vital in relation to our mission to create new jobs.</P>
              <P>Enterprise and communities are at the heart of our social justice 
                strategy, and the Scottish Co-operative and Mutual Forum can do 
                much to strengthen the links between communities and the enterprise 
                sector. We need to boost prosperity and allow more people to share 
                in that prosperity. We can do that only by building on the foundations 
                of a healthy economy that generates jobs.</P>
              <P>I can assure members that more will be done to promote the social 
                economy, including co-operatives and mutuals. We recognise that 
                Government has a part to play and we will offer clear leadership 
                and appropriate support. We value the social economy and will 
                seek to strengthen it. Our aspirations for a stakeholder society 
                are not simply empty rhetoric.</P>
              <P>I can tell Linda Fabiani that the money that is going into our 
                new housing partnership programme amounts to &#163;333 million. Coupled 
                with the amount available to Scottish Homes, that equates to an 
                increase of more than &#163;200 million. That extra money offers a 
                substantial opportunity to develop housing associations and co-operatives.</P>
              <P>Let me say a few words about financial exclusion. The need for 
                creative solutions is pressing&#151;and so is time, so I shall 
                rattle on quickly. We are examining financial exclusion and I 
                am pleased that banks are beginning to recognise that they can 
                deliver services to low-income households in disadvantaged communities.</P>
              <P>The role of credit unions in delivering appropriate and accessible 
                financial services is crucially important. They give the Executive 
                a sound platform for the next phase of our work on financial inclusion, 
                and we are keen to promote their merits and change their image 
                as a poor persons bank. I hope that this Parliament will consider 
                setting up a credit union.</P>
              <P>Finally, I shall deal briefly with the Scottish community investment 
                fund. It is not just the issue of personal financial services 
                that we want to address. We want to ensure that community organisations 
                established to address some of the issues of exclusion&#151;food 
                co-operatives, child care projects and housing co-operatives&#151;have 
                access to funds. We recognise that encouraging enterprise is vital.

              <P>The Executive is serious about tackling poverty and exclusion. 
                We welcome the energy and creativity of the Scottish Co-operative 
                and Mutual Forum in promoting the principles of the movement as 
                a vital component of the social economy. We have a historic opportunity
