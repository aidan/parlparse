is the debate on motion S1M-52 on the proposals for the development of
the new Parliament building at Holyrood, and an amendment to the motion.
I will invite the First Minister to move the motion with a time limit of
10 minutes. I will then call Donald Gorrie to move his amendment with a

initially at four minutes, for the simple reason that the corporate body
is anxious to hear as many views as possible on the project.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_3"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First
Minister (Donald Dewar): </strong>I welcome this debate. It is right that the
Parliament should take stock and consider how we should proceed. However,
I hope that it will take a decision today, as I believe that that is important.
The Parliament inherits plans-it inherits a scheme that I commend to this
chamber-but it is entitled to consider the instructions that it should
give to the corporate body. On that basis, I welcome what is happening
today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There has been a great deal of difficulty
and uncertainty about discussing this matter rationally, and there has
been much excitement in the public prints. I want to underline the fact
that it has been difficult for those working on the project to do so in
a conducive atmosphere. One member of the design team said to me recently
that the whole period had been demoralising. We should bear in mind the
impact of today's decision on those who have worked hard over a lengthy
period to get us to where we are.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have heard many fine words in this chamber
about parliamentary business, about Parliament speaking and about Parliament
being in charge of a particular project. I can think of no project that
belongs more to the Parliament than the construction of the Parliament
building. That is why the project will be the responsibility of the corporate
body-an impartial body in which all parties are represented.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I say to the nationalists that I am astonished,
in view of all that they have said about the business of Parliament, to
discover that they are whipping on today's motion. I make it clear that,
on my side, there will be a free vote. I am confident that I will carry
most of my colleagues, although I cannot say whether I will carry them
all. As the Scottish nationalists are whipping, I suspect that the result
will be very close. I hope that even during this debate they will recall
and consider some of the things that they have said about how we should
run the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would never, in any public place, mention
names but, from discussions at the presentations and from numerous private
conversations, we know that the SNP is split on this matter. Almost all
my colleagues would confirm that and I have no doubt that we would carry
this vote comfortably on a free vote. Given the subject matter, it is absolutely
disgraceful that the chamber will not get that chance. If I sound angry,
it is because I am angry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">thought that we
had to get the project under way and so we started in June 1997. The lead
times on such major international projects are very long and it was essential
that we started to prepare the ground. We had consulted: I will not try
to pretend that we reached consensus on the site, for example, but we consulted
the other parties and the public. As members know, there were exhibitions,
which moved from Inverness to Selkirk to consult the public, and there
were videos and models. There was also much discussion in the press and
publicly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We had to take a decision on the site and
I recognise that that may have been controversial. I ought to make it clear
that in the 10 minutes that Sir David has imposed on me, I cannot go into
points of information; I have a lot of things to say. I accept that there
was a presumption in many people's minds that the Royal High School would
be the site; in fact, we went there first, with our group of advisers and
experts-people whose opinions had to be respected. There was a unanimity
of view that the Royal High School was not-and could not satisfactorily
be made into-a practical proposition, even if we built the debating chamber
in the middle of Regent Road like some extended traffic island. That was
not a possibility and we moved on from it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We looked closely at St Andrew's House,
which was a runner. An ingenious, fine and imaginative adaptation was produced
for the interior, behind the traditional Tait fa&ccedil;ade of 1939. We
were tempted by that, but decided against it, largely because of difficulties
over space and over expansion on the site and because the construction
costs were going to be &pound;15 million higher than for the scheme that
we ultimately accepted. Mr Salmond may laugh at me-he can go and discuss
the matter with the architects, the quantity surveyors and the costing
people-but I repeat: we were advised that the cost would be &pound;15 million
more.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):
</strong>Will Mr Dewar give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the cost was &pound;15 million higher, is he talking about the estimates
at that time or about the new costs that we now know have arisen?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

&pound;50 million. The whole point of the St Andrew's House scheme was
that one would have seen no external difference to the building; we would
have added nothing to Edinburgh's architectural heritage and the Parliament
would have been hidden behind a pre-war fa&ccedil;ade. It seemed to us-and
I put it to the chamber-that to build a Parliament incognito was not an
attractive proposition. Expense was also a consideration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We wanted a site that presented the right
challenge. That challenge came with Holyrood, which was a late entrant
because the owners and occupiers of the site were prepared to adjust their
timetable in order to make the site available. The site is beside Holyrood
Palace, on the Canongate, in the centre of one of the great medieval cities
of Europe, beside and under the looming bulk of Salisbury crags and Arthur's
Seat. The site gave us the challenge of creating, with empathy, a 21<sup>st</sup>
century building that would be a gift from our time to succeeding generations
and an appropriate and fitting home for our Parliament. Holyrood gave us
the opportunities and we thought that it was right to go ahead.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We then decided to have a competition for
a design team. I will go over that very quickly, but I will pay tribute
to the independent members of the panel, Kirsty Wark, Joan O'Connor and
Andy McMillan, who brought expertise and vision to the choice and worked
extremely effectively in-I make no secret of it-what was one of the most
exciting and satisfying processes of my 25 years in politics. I am a veteran
of politics and have come out of many meetings telling the press that the
decisions of those meetings were unanimous. On this occasion, the decision
was unanimous. Every member of the team considered the distinguished architects
who had submitted entries, looked at the designs, which had very different
characters, and concluded that the design that was put forward by Enric
Miralles best fitted the remit.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I again pay tribute to Enric Miralles,
Benedetta Tagliabue and all others involved. I pay particular tribute to
their partners RMJM (Scotland) Ltd for the way in which it has evolved
the design and treated the site with sympathy and for its vision of a group
of buildings rising from the site to mirror and merge with the sweep of
the Canongate and the surrounding hills and buildings. The way in which
the project grows out of the landscape is attractive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I remember that when Mr Miralles first
appeared before the judges, he produced splendid, large panels that were
full of sweeping colour and vision and occasional pieces of script. I was
much taken by the piece of script on the first panel, which said that Parliament
was a mental place. That is an&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">interesting thought
for those of us who are familiar with the patter of Glasgow, but I know
what he means. His whole approach was particularly sympathetic. We consulted
the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland, Historic Scotland and many
other interested bodies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am already running out of time, but I
will say a word or two about costs. We always said that &pound;50 million
was an initial construction cost and that there would be additional costs
of VAT, fees and extras. It will be clear to those who bothered to read
answers to parliamentary questions-I am sure that Mr Swinney did, as some
of the figures that he adduced in parliamentary questions revealed this-that
the final total would be around &pound;80 million or &pound;90 million.
Mr Gorrie-indefatigable as always-extracted a lot of that information through
parliamentary questions. The information was available and was never hidden.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I make it clear that the &pound;109 million
that we now hold to-to the best of our ability-includes VAT, fees, site
acquisition and preparation, information technology and fit-out. I must
make it clear that landscaping into the park and the traffic calming measures,
which are a matter for the Executive and City of Edinburgh Council, are
not included.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The reasons why the original construction
costs went up from &pound;50 million to &pound;62 millions are well known,
so I will skim over them. One was that there was a general view that a
formal entrance at the bottom of the Canongate was a requirement. An increase
in the circulation space-the passage and plant spaces-was largely dictated
by the integration of Queensberry House. If members consider comparable
buildings they will see that we are still doing well on price. As a result
of the consultative steering group's work, the size of staff accommodation
also had to be increased; the floor area in the original proposal increased
by 44 per cent to 23,000 sq m and the cost rose by 24 per cent, which is
perhaps not surprising. The increase was not caused by overspend on the
original building. It was caused by the evolution of the building to meet
the needs of this Parliament. The increase was fair and proper.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There have a been a lot of rumours, based
on an article in a technical journal, that the building will be shoddy
and inadequate and that the materials will not be fit for the purpose-I
think that the phrase was that we would be given a Dinky and not a Porsche.
I found it a little puzzling-if I may be allowed a small snipe-that the
source of that phrase had complained about the cost of the building only
a few weeks before. I was caught in the crossfire, although I do not necessarily
object to that too violently.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we had adopted such options we would
not have unveiled the figure of &pound;62 million. We did not take up those
options because we want a quality&nbsp;</font></td>

deliver the standards of service that this Parliament requires. The Scottish
Parliamentary Corporate Body can consider them again, if this Parliament
believes that it should. That would be a matter for synergy between the
corporate body and the design team.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hurrying on-I have to use that phrase constantly
now-I say that the motion asks us to consider a few options. One is to
cancel the project. I hope that that does not happen. If it does, there
will be substantial implications in terms of the immediate cancellation
costs and the claims for damages that inevitably arise when a disaster
of that kind strikes a project. It would be a very expensive and-to use
the phrase again-totally demoralising event.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The circumstances would also be serious
if we were to call a moratorium or decide to stay in our present accommodation.
We are, to an extent, camping in these buildings. Anyone who has worked
here during the past few weeks will understand that. The building is inadequate
in scope; the floor area of the group of seven buildings that we occupy
is too small, probably by a third. Although the chamber is splendid-and
I congratulate the architects, Simpson &amp; Brown, on the work that they
have done-it has few facilities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know that there is a suggestion, which
Mr Gorrie will no doubt support, that we could take over the university
premises and acquire a large number of properties in mixed ownership around
this site. However, as anyone with experience of such matters will know,
that is an expensive, time-consuming and difficult business, even if it
were desirable, which I do not think it is. Yesterday, the rain came down
as I left the chamber at about 5 o'clock and I was fair drookit by the
time I got back to my office. When the winter comes, the difficulties of
working in seven separate buildings will become apparent to all members.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not believe that it is any better
to take the easy way out and ask for a substantial pause so that we can
consider the other options. That will cost money, a factor about which
the Conservatives are particularly worried. I am told by civil servants,
my advisers and people who are involved in the design process that the
immediate costs of a two-month delay would be around &pound;2 million to
&pound;3 million and that there might well be other claims and costs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We started on this trail in June 1997.
We cannot, in two months, consider a range of new sites, get in the quantity
surveyors and the statements from the architects and organise a new judging
panel-it is unlikely that the same design team would go on to another site.
There would be a major delay and-to put it bluntly; it is time to be blunt-this
Parliament would be a laughing stock.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The problem that
opponents of the Holyrood project have is not even that we are somehow
junking Leith-although the proposed committee would consider Leith, apparently,
along with other sites, such as Donaldson's school, which has suddenly
appeared in the business bulletin thanks to Brian Monteith. That site was
considered at the time; we were told that the proposal was unacceptable
and that we should not waste money investigating it. However, if Parliament
votes in that way, we will be committed to doing so. It would be a mistake
to put ourselves in that position and, on any reasonable reckoning, we
would not have a new home until 2004 or 2005.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The chamber is important and there has
been a great deal of controversy about it. The plans for Holyrood show
a slightly flattened semi-circle, which is similar to the seating arrangements
in this hall. However, such plans can and will evolve. The Scottish Parliamentary
Corporate Body might argue for change and arrive at a consensus with the
design team. No one should think that the seating arrangement that we have
in this chamber can be transferred to the new Parliament. I am advised
that, if we stay here long enough, the seating will have to change as it
does not conform to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have employed the international access
consultants, Buro Happold, who tell me that, in the not-too-distant future,
there will have to be a revamp of the signing and physical access arrangements
in order to comply with the law. That is a matter that will have to evolve
along with other matters. It is not caught in concrete-to use a happy metaphor.
That we should stop the building contract on the basis of an argument about
seating would be unwise and unfair, not only to the Parliament, but to
the many other people who have worked so hard to make a success of the
project.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I apologise for slightly overrunning, Sir
David. I finish by saying to my colleagues that this has never been an
arbitrary process or a one-man show. All the important decisions were taken
on specialist and skilled advice, matured by the cross-referencing of opinion.
The design team was put in place by an independent body of good reputation.
It is important that we press on with the project. We are trying to put
in place a building of which we can be proud and we are putting in place
a client and design team relationship that makes sense.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

body to move on and to try to work out any difficulties that emerge, I
believe that we are almost sending it a vote of no confidence. We cannot

body will be able to influence, guide and work with the immensely&nbsp;</font></td>

either we will not get those improvements or cuts will have to be made
elsewhere.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The motion limits us to the present budget

many members without craning my neck, whereas if I were to sit in an equivalent
place in the proposed debating chamber, I would see only the back of members'
necks. Personal contact is critical to any democratic debate, but the proposals
will destroy that. Instead, they will produce a sort of Stalinist gathering,
where people listen to a speech from the great leader. I am not into that
sort of politics.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to the Assembly Hall or to the Calton hill-Regent Road site. It is against
rushing in without proper information.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scottish Office involved various clever
people, but they are all totally committed to the Holyrood project. With
all due respect, they do not give unbiased advice, and the document from
your office, Sir David, is tendentious in the extreme. We must get independent
advice if the Holyrood scheme is to go ahead with proper, genuine support
from the public and from members. Such advice would enable us to improve
the chamber and other aspects of the design. Moreover, we could consider
the other options that Mr Dewar has tried to rubbish.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I understand it, there were a number
of different proposals for Calton hill, one of which was a very elegant
scheme to add the chamber on to the outside of St Andrew's House. It is
not true to say that the chamber would be hidden away, although there was
one proposal to that effect. Part of the attraction of that site is not
that it would be a traffic island in the middle of Regent Road, but that
Waterloo Place and Regent Road would make a splendid boulevard. The site
would involve the use of the Royal High School for meetings-not for full
meetings of the Parliament, but for public consultation, committees and
so on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Calton hill has been seen as the great
icon of the Parliament movement. We could use the existing, improved facilities
of St Andrew's House. We could have a fine, new debating chamber-with new
architecture and any other new buildings that were necessary-up on a hill,
where people could see it, and not in down in a hole.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Assembly Hall has great potential,
as Mr James Simpson has shown, having dug out old plans from the University
of Edinburgh on how to develop the area. That option needs to be considered,
and it is extraordinarily foolish to rush ahead without considering it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Calton hill site has fine buildings
and space for expansion, which Holyrood does not. It is a fine site, as
is the Assembly Hall. When I walk up from the bus stop in the morning,
my heart lifts on seeing this building on the hill. It is something that
one can be proud of.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The designs for Holyrood are ingenious
in many ways, but the site is in a hole. It has no presence-one has to
climb Arthur's Seat to see it at all. It is a small site, with no room
for expansion. It is hard to get to. People will drive to it, as the right
bus routes do not exist. Even if people take the bus, they will have to
make more bus trips, as they will have to change buses.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

options of staying here permanently, of going ahead more slowly with Holyrood
if some improvements are made or of going to another site. There is no
rush. We want to get things right, because, although no Parliament lasts
for eternity, this one may last for a very long time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The downside is that there might be a delay,
which will cost &pound;500,000 a month, if we believe your office, Sir
David, or &pound;1 million a month, if we believe the First Minister. I
would not like to choose between those two estimates. Although there will
be some cost, it will be quite small. On the other hand, the cost of voting
for the motion will be that we will never know whether we got things right

major changes in cost.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I said yesterday

works well is almost beyond price, but this project contains no guarantees
about what that final price will be. With every passing day, we hear different
figures. Mr Gorrie was right to say that the price of a pause started off
at &pound;1 million. At the meeting on Tuesday, we were told that it would
be &pound;2 million. The First Minister now says that it is &pound;3 million.
If the cost of drawing a breath is rising by &pound;500,000 a day, who
knows what will happen to this building. We must look at the figures and
the cost again because, in terms of cost efficiency and cost control, this
building is out of control.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A second reason to pause is the concept
of the building in almost every regard. I hope that Mr Harper will speak
on the environmental issues, which are important and have been neglected.
The question of traffic access has not been answered. We were confidently
told at the briefing meetings that with 2 million visitors the increase
in traffic would make no difference to that end of the High Street. That
is nonsense and we must consider that matter again.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue of the chamber is essential.
I will briefly quote from the report by Mr Miralles. Mr Miralles talks
about the chamber as being somewhere where MSPs could embrace each other.
I see little sign of that happening here. He complains about the tendency
for Parliaments to seat members of the assembly facing a wall. Presiding
Officer, you are not a wall and we sit like this so that you may control
the debate. Mr Miralles also calls members in the chamber performers. Clearly,
he has seen Mr Raffan at work, but most people here are not performers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should oppose this on the simple grounds
of error in thinking. The building that we are talking about will not make
us a Parliament. All the comments that we have heard so far suggest that
we will miraculously become a Parliament in two years' time and that the
problems we have with the new politics and the style of debate will change
because we have a new building. That is not true. We must think about what
we should be doing and how we, as men and women, should make ourselves
a Parliament and not imagine that a building can do that for us. We must
pause, consider the future and the costs, then come back in the autumn
and decide where we go. We must not be rushed into this decision, because
it could be the wrong decision.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Parliament building should accommodate
our wishes, should make provision for inclusion, and should reflect the
sentiments and views of the Scottish people. We have to accept that the
measures that will be required to do that-if we are to build on solid foundations-do
not come cheap. Clearly, the original construction cost estimates of 1997
have been exceeded to meet the demands for increased floor space and additional
requirements. Is that really the main issue to consider when deciding where
the permanent home of our new-found democracy should be based? It has taken
300 years for the Scottish people to have their Parliament returned to
them. Their desire is for a Parliament that will reflect and address their

does the current proposal for a Parliament building at Holyrood represent
the best option?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

people were certainly denied full information about the costs at the time

was between &pound;40 million and &pound;50 million. Today, the final estimate
is running at approximately &pound;109 million. With a capital cost running

of other options. I offer no comment on those options other than to say
that they seem worthy of investigation. Until that investigation happens,

result of today's debate will echo down throughout the history of building
and architecture in Scotland for a century-a century that will look to
the new building as an example of all that should be aimed for in public
building. The building will have seen a century of use by parliamentarians.
We have a public and a private responsibility to get it right.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am speaking to that portion of the motion
that calls for delay on one set of very important and compelling grounds.
There is every possibility that the principal new building of the century
will not live up to what should be expected of it due to imprecise specification,
lack of clear direction and the recently whispered willingness to relax
the building's energy standards to save money.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That would be the biggest imaginable waste
of public money. Embodied energy, or lifetime energy use, is part of the
cost of a building. Every pound spent now on energy conservation will be
an investment that will pay back a significant proportion of the total
cost of the building during its lifetime. We have a duty to make time for
a thorough assessment of the energy use of this building and to improve
the specifications. We must demand a building that will be an icon for
the future and a yardstick of sustainability. In the present climate of
opinion and Government's public commitments, which I shall come to, it
would be bizarre to settle for anything less.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that it is a Crown project means that building warrant drawings that would
allow us to calculate the lifetime costs of the building need not be produced.

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">every day? What
about disabled visitors? It may be pleasant now to use three buildings
and mingle with the tourists in the summer sun, but what about in December,
January and February when the snow is six inches deep? Will it be such
a nice little stroll then?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the great opportunities when creating
a great building is the chance to rectify all the things that are wrong
with existing buildings. Is our current home environmentally friendly?
I think not. Environmental issues will be a major consideration in the
new building. Energy efficiency and environmentally conscious design principles
will result in more economic construction costs, which is of prime importance,
not least because it can also lead to reduced maintenance and energy consumption
costs. Water will be used more economically and waste will be minimised
and recycled. Natural lighting and ventilation via windows and a passive
cooling system will ensure that everyone who uses the building is comfortable
and will reduce the incidence of ailments such as sick building syndrome.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For me, however, of prime importance is
the need to provide a building that is accessible to everyone. The design
for the new Parliament is compliant with Disability Scotland's guidelines.
Compliance covers not only access facilities, but signage, interior design,
pedestrian and vehicular access and assistance for people who are hard
of hearing, the visually impaired and the infirm.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As a brand-new Parliament whose members
seek to formulate a new type of government, the new building must be an
exemplary model of access for all, irrespective of disability. The Scottish
Parliament last sat 300 years ago. How long do we want this one to last?
To use my mother's clich&eacute;, "You only get what you pay for." If we
do not invest now, how many years will it be until we are examining designs
for another new Parliament? What would the cost be then?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All members know how frustrating it is
to be here and not to be able to pass legislation because we have not yet
taken on our full powers. What about the frustration of the staff who work
here in cramped conditions, and of the public who are being disfranchised
because we are not allowing them access? Let us waste no more time. Let
us get down to this project now and get into our new building as quickly
as possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">members think that
if we say that the Parliament is accessible, it is. I am afraid that there
are a number of concerns about access for the disabled and to the Holyrood
site.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At Tuesday's meeting with the architect
and Scottish Office officials, I raised the issue not of access within
the Parliament, but of access to the Parliament site. The transport problems
that will undoubtedly occur will have a disproportionate effect on people
with a disability. We know from comments made by one of the Scottish Office
officials that one of the ideas that is being considered to ensure that
disabled people can get to the Parliament is a shuttle bus service. I am
sorry, but that is an unacceptable standard to set for a new Parliament
from the start.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Parliament will have a secure area
for dropping off VIPs, but there are no plans for an area near the Parliament
to drop off disabled people or the elderly. I am sure that many members
of this Parliament will agree that it is more important that disabled people
can be dropped off at the Parliament than that the odd dignitary who may
choose to visit us can be.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are also concerns about the interior
of the building. It will be a cambered chamber, like this one. The same
access problems will exist as here. How does someone with a wheelchair
go from this end of the Parliament to the other end of the Parliament,
without having to go down to the front or round the back? On Tuesday, that
question could not be answered.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Presiding Officer's area will be elevated
and will be accessed by stairs. At the heart of our Parliament, there will
be an area that someone with a disability will be unable to access. When
that point was raised, Scottish Office officials stated that they were
aware of the problem and were looking into the possibility of an elevating
platform. When I heard that suggestion, I must confess that the vision
of the Blackpool organist coming up through the stage floor went through
my mind.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Already we are considering adapting a building
that should be built to the standard that anyone with a disability, whether
they be the Presiding Officer, a member or a member of the public, can
access any part of. The Parliament should be built to ensure that, during
the next 200 years, every member of our society, no matter that they have
a disability, can access the building and every part of the building. We
are talking about a Parliament that may last for 200 years. What is two
months if we ensure that we provide a Parliament that includes all members
of our society?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>(Con): </strong>I
will be brief, as I know that many people wish to contribute to this debate.
I support Mr Gorrie's amendment with the benefit of the experience of having
builders in my home.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The eventual home of the Scottish Parliament
is a decision for which we as parliamentarians will be held to account,
not just from an architectural standpoint, but by those who will visit
and watch what we do. I am willing to bet that this is the only time that
most of us will ever make a decision on where this Parliament will be situated.
Certainly, I do not have experience in the matter, but I would welcome
the time to look at the situation anew.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will leave aside the arguments about
whether we were duped by the announcement of the initial cost price; whether
it was &pound;40 million or &pound;50 million and whether it included things
such as VAT, fees or demolition costs. I intend no slight to the then Secretary
of State for Scotland who is now First Minister. He is not by nature a
devious man. I felt for him when he said that he was drookit last night,
but he could easily have taken a remedy-an umbrella.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yesterday, I noticed the obvious addition
to the chamber. Gone were the two box files for Mr Henry McLeish, from
which it was easier to read his notes, and instead we had a solid wooden
lectern, in like wood to the desks we occupy. The amount of fiddling to
the microphones showed that it was clearly an unforeseen addition. That
is the shape of things to come. There will be constant additions, amendments,
little extras and forward planning for advances in technology in whichever
building the Parliament makes its home. That all costs money-money which,
as constituents will tell us, would be better spent on things other than
a monument to anyone's ego. My own particular bid would be for the upgrade
of the A77 between Malletsheugh and Fenwick, a notorious black spot that
is rightly known as the killer road.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, our present office accommodation
is far from ideal. Is the road building outside our building a coincidence,
or is it to hasten our departure? I have not had the delights of visiting
the ministerial floor with its red carpet. This chamber, as has been said,
would benefit from some alterations to improve access for the disabled
and the cost of those alterations would be considerably less than the proposals
for Holyrood. I am concerned about the financial aspects of this proposal.
In this day and age who would not be?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

than some other members, but enough to say that&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">delay is prudent.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are not constructing a building that
will stand for 10, 20 or 50 years; potentially, we are constructing a building
that will stand for hundreds of years. We must make sure that we get it
right.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a previous existence not too far from
here as a local councillor in the City of Edinburgh, I served on the transportation
and planning committees. From the beginning, there was much concern among
the people who serve Edinburgh about the Holyrood site. There was a definite
feeling that we were bounced into accepting Holyrood. The vast majority
of City of Edinburgh councillors thought that Calton hill was a better
situation. As Donald Gorrie said, having a boulevard with a Parliament
on Calton hill that is accessible in terms of transport and for people
with disabilities is very attractive. It is unfortunate that that site
is not the one that we accepted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, I am not totally against the idea
of Holyrood. We are at an historic point in our nation's history. It is
a time for us to be bold and adventurous, but also to get it right. I am
not saying that Holyrood is the wrong site; I am saying that members of
this Parliament have enough questions about the project for us to take
stock. We should examine the costs and the materials, as well as accessibility
and transport, to which I shall refer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am concerned about the inadequate transport
impact assessment studies that we have seen. Like Mr Russell, I am concerned
that the project team said that a Parliament could be built at Holyrood,
which is next to a palace, the Dynamic Earth exhibition, the new offices
of <i>The Scotsman</i>, new flats and other developments, which will attract
2 million people a year, but that that would not mean more cars at any
of the junctions. I am sorry, but I sat on a transport committee for four
years and in that time I managed to work out that if 2 million people were
put into an area of half a square mile, there would be congestion at some
junctions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We do not have the full transport picture.
I say to the First Minister and to the project team that this is an ideal
opportunity for us to build a Parliament that befits what we do. We-the
men and women of this chamber-are the Parliament. We could meet in a hut,
if we did it in the right spirit and with the right soul, the right briefing,
the right intelligence and the right passion in our bellies for our country-that
is what is important. It is right that we construct a splendid building,
wherever that happens to be, but it is also right that we use it to show
symbolically that we are moving into a new century. One of the things about
that new century is that we must put in place transport systems that work
for the people of this city and for the people of Scotland.</font></td>
