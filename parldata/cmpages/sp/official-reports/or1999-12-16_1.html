                a ministerial statement on Hampden Park from Mr Sam Galbraith

                (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Presiding Officer, I have given 
                you notice that I would like to move a motion without notice, 
                in my name, about the agricultural business improvement scheme. 
                I submitted the motion to you this morning and I want to address 
                the issue of whether it should be taken.</font></P>

                </strong>Under the standing orders, the decision whether to take such 
                a motion is entirely mine. As the Rural Affairs Committee has 
                reported this morning on ABIS, as the scheme ends on 31 December 
                and as the application is supported by more than one party, I 
                have decided that I should accept the motion. My decision allows 
                the Parliament to decide whether to debate the issue. The motion 
                that I am accepting is simply the motion without notice that an 
                extra debate be added to this morning's business.</font></P>

                be useful to stress to the chamber again the interpretation and 
                ruling that you have just given.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I understand that the 
                motion that has been referred to is a motion without notice to 
                debate an issue and that the debate that we will now have will 
                be on whether we should discuss the issue, not on the substantive

                be brief.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two issues are at stake&#151;one 
                is the issue of principle and the other is the issue of practice. 
                The issue of principle is that this morning's time in the Parliament 
                is Opposition time, which has been allocated to the Scottish National 
                party. Yesterday, we chose to bring forward an urgent motion that 
                was lodged on Monday, which seeks to redress an injustice that 
                is being done to some 4,000 people and which involves &#163;22 million. 
                It is a matter of real hardship in many sectors of the agriculture 
                community in Scotland.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the report from 
                the Rural Affairs Committee strongly recommending that action 
                be taken on ABIS, it seemed only fair to give Parliament the opportunity 
                to have its voice heard, particularly as the cut-off date for 
                the scheme&#151;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_11"></A>The 
                Deputy Minister for Parliament (Iain Smith): </strong>On a point of 
                order. I am a little confused. Mr Russell seems to be implying 
                that he had knowledge of the report of the Rural Affairs Committee 
                before it was published this morning at 7.30. My point of order 
                is that yesterday, he said&#151;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Presiding Officer: 
                </strong>It was well known yesterday that the report would be published 
                first thing this morning. The committee convener supplied me with 
                a draft of the report and I trust that the report is now in the 
                hands of every member.</font></P>

                Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>At the risk of incurring your 
                wrath, Presiding Officer, I want to inform you that that was not 
                the point of order. The point of order was connected to the fact 
                that Mr Russell referred to items in the report in laying the 
                motion without notice before the Parliament. That is a relevant 
                point of order.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> 
                Please continue, Mr Russell.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Michael Russell: 
                </strong>Thank you very much.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obviously, Mr Smith's 
                long train journeys from Fife, to which he referred yesterday, 
                are preying on his mind. The report, which is in the hands of 
                everyone in the chamber, clearly indicates that an injustice is 
                being done. In those circumstances, it is right that we consider 
                the motion. If members had listened to the evidence in the committee, 
                it would be surprising if they did not know that an injustice 
                was being done, even before the report came out. Perhaps Mr Smith 
                should read the evidence more often.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a wrong to 
                be righted and this is the last opportunity to do so. It would 
                be a huge failure of the Parliament if it did not take that opportunity 
                and I am glad that the SNP is offering that opportunity. A decision 
                on the matter involves all of us, particularly Liberal Democrat 
                members, who should recall that at Westminster&#151;and I am not

                the voice. We have heard many voices raised by the Liberal Democrats

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second matter of 
                great importance for the chamber is that this morning is SNP Opposition 
                time. If we choose to bring a motion for debate, it should not 
                be subject to veto by the Executive. There is a basic principle 
                about allocation of parliamentary time, which I have addressed 
                repeatedly in the Procedures Committee. In the circumstances, 
                it would be wrong for the Parliament and any member on those benches 
                to vote not to allow the SNP to use its time in the way that it 
                wishes. If the Parliament were to do that, it would be a great

                to me, and I was told that it would not be debated. If anybody

                of Scotland) (Con): </strong>I would like to support Mr Russell's desire 
                to have the issue heard in the Parliament. I was part of the Rural 
                Affairs Committee, which heard evidence from all sides of the 
                debate. The committee felt sympathy towards the Minister for Rural 
                Affairs because it became obvious, through the process of gathering 
                evidence, that he had been handed a poisoned chalice by his predecessor, 
                Lord Sewel. One of the principles at stake is the extent to which 
                the actions of the present Administration should be led by the 
                promises of the previous one.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is more important 
                is that there was all-party agreement in the committee about the 
                fact that many applicants have spent considerable sums of money 
                applying for the scheme. They are, under the present circumstances, 
                very unlikely to get that money back. It is essential, for the 
                sake of democracy and principle, that the matter be debated in

                (Sir David Steel): </strong>We proceed to this morning's business, 
                which is a debate on motion S1M-117, in the name of Michael Russell, 
                on the Act of Settlement. I call Mike Russell to open the debate.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">09:50</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Michael Russell 
                (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Perhaps we should pause for a moment 
                to allow the smoke of battle to clear, because this morning we 
                are considering an issue that is not only significant, but historic. 
                It is important that we apply our minds to that rather than to 
                the difficulties of the past 15 minutes.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, I thank the 
                77 MSPs who signed the motion that I lodged on 1 September. Given 
                the convention that ministers, Presiding Officers and Deputy Presiding 
                Officers do not sign motions, 77&#151;70 per cent of MSPs who 
                were able to sign the motion&#151;is a substantial number.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Ian Jenkins's criticism 
                is the worst that can be made of me this morning&#151;that I have 
                brought to debate in this chamber a motion that was not for debate&#151;that 
                is fair enough. I plead guilty. The reality is that I lodged the 
                motion on 1 September with the support of five other MSPs because 
                I felt that, if the Parliament's expression and will could be 
                given on the business bulletin, over a period of time there might 
                be some change south of the border that might move the issue on. 
                That has not happened, which is why we are debating the issue 
                today. We have had rumour and counter-rumour, spin and counter-spin. 
                We have heard allegations that the First Minister was in favour 
                of change pre-Rafferty, but against change post-Rafferty. We have 
                heard a variety of rumours. However, what we have not had is any 
                commitment to action.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I hope that we will 
                debate the issue constructively and respectfully to say that this 
                is a blot on Scotland which requires to be changed and that, by 
                letting its voice be heard, the Parliament can be instrumental 
                in such change.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us consider what 
                the Act of Settlement 1701 and the following Act of Union 1707 
                actually are. They are extremely offensive pieces of legislation 
                that stipulate that those who &quot;profess the popish religion&quot; 
                can neither be monarchs nor marry into the royal family. Although 
                the issue of who is or is not the monarch is not something that 
                keeps me awake at night, I am concerned when any individual is 
                told that the profession of his or her religion disbars him or 
                her from anything. Most of us thought that such times were over 
                in Scotland; many people are surprised to find that such times 
                are still here.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the Church of Scotland 
                said yesterday, the Act of Settlement is a product of its times, 
                as is the Act of Union. When those acts were passed&#151;somewhat 
                narrowly in the case of the Act of Union&#151;the killing times 
                were still within living memory. Profession of the Protestant 
                religion had been injurious to health and even to life. Within 
                living memory, a monarch had been removed from the throne for 
                the profession of a very aggressive form of Catholicism which 
                was felt to threaten the nation's unity. In such circumstances, 
                it is scarcely surprising that such provisions were made. However, 
                that was then, not now. We should not carry the prejudices of 
                the past down to this and future generations; if we are to carry 
                them down, we need a good reason for doing so.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What has surprised 
                me in the debate over the past three and a half months&#151;and 
                indeed in the debate over the past 20 to 30 years&#151;is that 
                there are no good reasons for failing to change these offensive 
                provisions. I had hoped that the reasons would at last be given 
                when I read this morning's <I>The Scotsman, </I>which outlines 
                the formidable constitutional obstacles that Lord Hogg of Cumbernauld 
                came up against when he attempted to introduce a 10-minute rule 
                bill on the matter in 1981.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The obstacles included 
                the Coronation Oath Act 1688, the Union with Scotland Act 1706, 
                which is indeed a formidable obstacle, but not in this context, 
                and Princess Sophia's Precedence Act 1711&#151;I suspect that 
                even the First Minister could not tell us what that is about. 
                They included the Royal Marriage Act 1772, article 2 of the Union 
                with Ireland Act 1800&#151;Lord Hogg is obviously unaware that 
                that is not particularly relevant any longer&#151;section 4 and 
                the schedule to the Regency Act 1937 and the Statute of Westminster 
                1931.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">None of us here could 
                tell anyone what those laws are about, but what they should not 
                be about is institutionalising discrimination. If any of them 
                are, they should also be changed. Far from those laws being a 
                reason for inaction, they are a spur to further action. That is 
                what we should try to achieve in the chamber today.</font></P>

                not be in the spirit of today's debate, in which we are trying 
                to change something that needs to be changed. With respect to 
                Michael McMahon&#151;I know that he supports the change&#151;the 
                best way to get change is for people in this chamber to agree 
                that it is needed, rather than for them to make political points, 
                which will get us no further. The act will remain unchanged if 
                the matter is seen as party political.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am sorry that Mr 
                McMahon is waving his hands in a rather odd fashion. There is 
                not a shred of political advantage in this issue for any party 
                in the chamber. There is an advantage for the people of Scotland, 
                however, if, today of all days, the Parliament comes together 
                to say that the act is wrong. There need be no wild words or statements, 
                but together we should add our voice to the voices of the Church 
                of Scotland, the Catholic Church, the Baptist union, the Hindu 
                community, the Muslim community, distinguished historian Tom Devine 
                and James MacMillan, who from the reporters' gallery conducted 
                a fanfare for the opening of this Parliament on 1 July. If the 
                Parliament adds its voice to those voices, we will do the Parliament 
                credit. If, however, we comb through the minutiae of history to 
                find a reason not to change things, they will not change.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want to hear one 
                simple thing from Mr McCabe: that there is an intention to move 
                forward. The amendment says simply that this is a terribly difficult 
                matter and that it is somebody else's problem. We should remember

                Henry that the motion is not a challenge to anybody. The argument 
                that I put out arose because of representations made to me from 
                the Labour benches&#151;that this would be a challenge to Westminster. 
                This is a challenge to decency in Scotland, not to Westminster.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I acknowledge that 
                Mr McCabe's amendment states the facts as they presently are and 
                not as I would like to see them. I hope that, in those circumstances, 
                the chamber would like to hear some positive intention from Mr 
                McCabe. I hope that members can then move forward together.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do not support the 
                constitutional settlement as it is at present. I hope that we 
                will move on to a written constitution and a bill of rights. They 
                would make this debate completely irrelevant. In such circumstances, 
                it would be impossible to have discriminatory legislation.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I regret that one of 
                the excuses that has been given for inaction is that there would 
                require to be change in 15 Commonwealth countries. Members will 
                know from the material that we have been releasing over the past 
                few days that that is not true. Any country with a written constitution 
                and a bill of rights will automatically override the Act of Settlement. 
                With a written constitution and a bill of rights, we could transfer 
                the matter to the history books. We can do that today if the Parliament 
                unites to say that we are in a process of change and of making 
                Scotland a better country to live in. In those circumstances, 
                we are in the process of removing any offence towards our fellow 
                citizens.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I hope that the tone 
                of this debate will be one in which we can make those points. 
                If we do not have a debate of that tone, the matter will not go 
                away. We can take the matter away today. United, we can say that 
                discrimination is wrong. Let us end it. That would be a suitable

                Parliament (Mr Tom McCabe): </strong>I, too, think that this is a very 
                important debate. The tone in which it is conducted is critical 
                to the standing of the Parliament. It is disappointing that Mike 
                Russell has set the tone by quoting a private conversation. Furthermore, 
                he is condemned by his own words.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hugh Henry was right 
                to point out that when people were encouraged to sign the motion, 
                it was against the background of some important statements made 
                by Mike Russell. He acknowledged that this Parliament cannot change 
                the act. He said that the motion was not a challenge to Westminster. 
                Yet as soon as he rises to his feet, he asks for a statement about 
                when this Parliament will move forward&#151;although it has no 
                power to change the act. That is unfortunate in relation to setting 
                the proper tone for a debate as serious as this.</font></P>

                am sure unwittingly&#151;what Mike Russell is saying. We are not 
                asking for a repetition of the fact that we do not have the power 
                to change the act. We accept that. It is not something that we 
                like, but we accept it as a fact. What we are asking for is an 
                indication of intent from Mr McCabe in his position as a Labour 
                party minister and an indication that the Labour party in government 
                in Westminster intends to progress on this issue.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>I 
                greatly appreciate the elevation, but I point out to Mr Salmond 
                that I am a minister in the Parliament of Scotland, not of Westminster.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no doubt that 
                we are dealing with a sensitive and important subject, but it 
                is also beyond question that it is outwith the legislative competence 
                of this Parliament. That does not mean that we cannot discuss 
                it, within the rules of order and competence. The coalition Administration 
                will defend this Parliament's right to choose its own subjects 
                for discussion.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With all rights come 
                responsibilities. In this chamber, matters that are within Westminster's 
                powers should be approached with caution. Expressing an opinion 
                is of course a valid exercise, but it can often raise expectations 
                that we are not in a position to satisfy.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The motion discusses 
                discrimination. I am in no doubt that this Parliament will want 
                to combat discrimination wherever it is found. Indeed, we want 
                to replace it with a Scotland characterised by fairness and justice 
                for all its citizens, whatever their background, faith or race.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The amendment recognises 
                the complex constitutional difficulties that change or repeal 
                of the act raises. It also acknowledges the fact that it is the 
                responsibility of the United Kingdom Parliament. When we express 
                the wish to repeal the discriminatory aspects of the act, we have 
                to examine the constitutional and parliamentary time implications 
                that that would have for the Westminster Parliament. Any Administration 
                has to take tough decisions on its competing priorities when considering 
                how best it can address discrimination.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The harsh reality is 
                that we live in an unequal society. In this Parliament, we have 
                embarked on a crusade against poverty. Thousands of Scots battle 
                against the odds every day. They need to know that this Parliament 
                is on their side. It is a fight we will not give up. We will dedicate 
                ourselves to winning it, no matter how long it takes. It has been 
                said that Roman Catholics and indeed Scots of other faiths are 
                insulted by the Act of Settlement. Of course they are, but by 
                allowing people to meet their full potential, by removing the 
                insult of poverty, exclusion and deprivation we also allow them 
                to repudiate that insult.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fact that the act 
                is a message from the past does not excuse or justify the situation. 
                Nor does the fact that it has been an issue for many years in 
                any way make it acceptable. People support politicians who know 
                the value and priority of giving every child the best possible 
                start in life. Scots know the value and priority of concentrating 
                on quality education, decent housing and a safe environment. Those 
                must be basic expectations for all Scots, not just the privileged 
                few or a particular race, sex, religion or class.</font></P>

                (Moray) (SNP): </strong>Everyone in the Parliament is opposed to discrimination 
                in any form. I want to ask Mr McCabe about the role of the joint 
                committees that have been much trumpeted by Gordon Brown. Would 
                it be helpful to joint committee members from this Parliament 
                to have the vote of the Parliament on ending this aspect of discrimination 
                to back them up? At least it would mark a staging point on the 
                route to eliminating this discriminatory legislation.</font></P>

                at Westminster, like the coalition Administration here, has a

                an end to discrimination with vigour but we should do it in a 
                way that will not deny social progress across the country. In 
                moving the amendment we condemn discrimination and acknowledge 
                it has no place in a multifaith, multicultural society.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Being concerned about 
                the Act of Settlement should not preclude a desire to tackle distortions

                of our citizens of the right to develop their full potential. 
                The two are not mutually exclusive. However, I am a little surprised 
                by the decision to use Opposition time to debate a 300-year-old 
                law. This afternoon, we will debate the challenges that face the 
                health service in Scotland. Already this week there has been an 
                expression of concern about the French ban on British beef. There 
                are many other issues that the Scottish people might think more 
                pressing for an opposition party debate.</font></P>

                Conservative party had occasion to make that very point to the 
                Executive, when it happened that approximately 38 minutes were 
                devoted to a debate on homelessness, followed the next day by 
                a debate of three hours on the millennium bug? I am pleased that 
                the Executive acknowledged that problem and accorded more time

                knowledge&#151;to amend the Act of Settlement in the UK Parliament 
                were made under the 10-minute rule. As far as we can determine, 
                those attempts were promoted by Norman Hogg, the former Labour 
                MP for Cumbernauld and John Home-Robertson, who is now a Labour

                Commonwealth Parliaments and would require amendments to at least 
                eight separate acts. Mr Russell referred to another view, but 
                I note that the letter he received from the Canadian Parliament 
                ended with the words, &quot;it would appear&quot;&#151;a useful

                year as a result of wholesale constitutional reform and the approaching 
                millennium.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The important issue 
                is whether there should be legislation that blatantly discriminates 
                against a Christian religion. The subject is particularly relevant 
                as we live in a multifaith community. In the context of the millennium, 
                it is intended to recognise and appreciate the contribution of 
                all faiths and communities in our country. The heir to the throne 
                can accede if he marries a Muslim, a Buddhist, a scientologist, 
                a Moonie, an atheist or a sun-worshipper, but not if he marries 
                a Roman Catholic. Leaving such a stigma in place when no other 
                religion or faith is singled out is grossly unfair.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Mr Mike Russell 
                lodged his motion, I wrote to the Prime Minister, whose response 
                offered no defence or justification for the present legislation. 
                He had &quot;no plans&quot; to do anything about the situation 
                and said&#151;as the amendment says&#151;that reforming the law 
                would be complex. That is absolutely right. Similarly, it was 
                complex to reform the House of Lords, but that did not prove an 
                insurmountable problem. The complexity can be exaggerated. I recommend 
                the acceptance of Mr Tom McCabe's amendment in view of the positive 
                remarks that he associated with it.</font></P>

                are in the parliamentary information centre and the chamber office, 
                indicate widespread consensus against this kind of religious discrimination. 
                Out of nine responses, eight were clearly opposed to discrimination 
                and the ninth was conscious of the complexity of the matter. Cardinal

                commands broad public and political support. Indeed, I can think 
                of no major public figure prepared to defend the language of intolerance 
                contained in the offensive clauses. What is now needed is a clear

                of the debate in 1829 on the subject of Roman Catholic emancipation&#151;enabling 
                Roman Catholics to become members of Parliament. The Prime Minister 
                at the time was the Duke of Wellington, who defeated Napoleon 
                at Waterloo. He was on the side of emancipation. Lord Winchilsea 
                attacked Wellington in language that was so offensive that it 
                would not be tolerated today. He implied that Wellington was being 
                disloyal to his country. The Prime Minister immediately challenged 
                Winchilsea to a duel&#151;the only time, as far as I can recall, 
                that a Prime Minister has had to defend his honour in that way. 
                On 21 March 1829, not long after first light, the Prime Minister 
                and Winchilsea met on Battersea fields with their seconds. When 
                the moment to shoot arrived, the Prime Minister took careful aim 
                and fired wide. Winchilsea, not wishing to kill his Prime Minister, 
                fired in the air. He then wrote a grovelling letter of apology.</font></P>

                the Prime Minister to put reform of the Act of Settlement firmly 
                on the agenda. If the Duke of Wellington&#151;who was, if I may 
                say, even more right-wing than Mr Tony Blair, which is saying 
                quite a lot&#151;was prepared to take a stand on principle and 
                bring in progressive reform, surely it is not too much to hope 
                that our Prime Minister can show the same kind of moral courage.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The basic truth that 
                was applicable in 1829 and remains so today is that a substantial 
                proportion of our countrymen and countrywomen are of Roman Catholic 
                origin. There are some 800,000 Scots of Roman Catholic origin, 
                and they deserve better than to have outdated legislation, some 
                300 years old, in force discriminating against them. Only a few 
                years ago, in 1974, there had to be legislation to confirm that 
                a Roman Catholic could be Lord Chancellor.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Act of Settlement 
                and its corresponding Scottish provisions are, as the First Minister 
                has described them, a &quot;legacy from the past&quot;. However, 
                as well as being a very unwelcome legacy from the past, it constitutes 
                what Michael Forsyth called the British constitution's &quot;grubby 
                little secret&quot;. The Equal Opportunities Committee of this 
                Parliament calls it an &quot;anachronistic anomaly&quot;, and 
                the cardinal has described it as an &quot;insult to all Catholics&quot;. 
                It is neither in keeping with the spirit of the times nor consistent 
                with the social inclusion that we wish to celebrate in the year 
                of the millennium.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our vote today should 
                serve as a signal that blatant and hurtful legislation discriminating 
                against a Christian religion is not acceptable, just as discrimination 
                against a race or ethnic community is not acceptable. Today we 
                have the opportunity to give an example to Britain, by recommending

                have been virulently against the European Union. Although they 
                have changed, it would be a waste of time to cast that in their 
                teeth. People change. The most effective apostle was St Paul&#151;he 
                changed. It is pathetic to argue on the basis that somebody had 
                the chance to do something and did not take it. For God's sake, 
                let us get away from that kind of argument.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I support the Executive 
                amendment. I do not think that there is any necessity for the 
                Executive to put forward an amendment, and I strongly contest 
                the idea that the Executive has to have a view on everything&#151;that 
                is rubbish. However, this amendment is sensible and is not hostile 
                to the motion. It had been rumoured that there was to be an amendment 
                that was hostile to the motion.</font></P>

                English. There are many very decent English people who take the 
                matter of the head of the Church of England very seriously and 
                for whom it is a big deal. I find it stupid that when the Queen's 
                aeroplane crosses the Solway as she comes up to Balmoral or Holyrood, 
                she has to remember that she is no longer the head of the Church 
                of England, but is now a member of the Church of Scotland. She 
                carries that off remarkably well, but it is a ludicrous position.

                conducted by the same worthy Church of England gentleman, who

                members believe that to be the case, but whether a debate on the

                all our people, including the Catholic community. Labour has radically

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is true that Labour

                Scotland. Neither, however, did the nationalists, the Tories or 
                our Liberal partners. The view was that the act had little relevance 
                to the lives of ordinary Catholics, and I believe that that is 
                still the case. I wonder, therefore, why there is now such urgency 
                to debate that irrelevancy. Where did it come from and how genuine 
                is it? I can only conclude that the nationalists, in deciding 
                to hold this debate, believe that repeal of the Act of Settlement

                on outdated legislation affecting one privileged family, rather 
                than delivering for all our families. They want the matter debated 
                in the Scottish Parliament, not for the right reasons, but rather 
                to divide our Parliament. Rather than debating the real issues 
                that affect Scotland's people, they seek to use valuable time

                said, would be required. In spite of Mr Russell's assurances that

                The writer, clearly puzzled at the emergence of this subject as 
                a political issue, turned to Dr Peter Lynch of the University

                Act is silly and it should be changed, but we recognise that the

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am sure that when 
                the Act of Union 1707 and the Act of Settlement came along, my 
                family in Argyllshire embraced both with vigour, but my family 
                was wrong. Times have changed. I do not embrace the Act of Union 
                or the Act of Settlement. The latter was a child of its time, 
                when the religion of the monarch almost invariably dictated the 
                faith of the entire population. It was inextricably bound up with 
                the theory of divine right, which created a direct line between 
                God and the monarch, and the association of the monarch with a 
                religious infrastructure that supported that divine right. In 
                progressive nations, that theory waned with the onset of constitutional 
                democracy or with the arrival of vigorously anti-clerical republics, 
                where monarchs who did not adapt, such as the Romanovs, went down 
                cataclysmically.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In their time, the 
                Act of Settlement and similar expressions of exclusivity were 
                the norm as the dominant faith in a nation attempted to maintain 
                its position against the supposed menace of its religious minorities. 
                It was perhaps justifiable to the people then, in times of institutionalised 
                intolerance. At the end of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, when institutionalised 
                and organised religion is less popular than it was, when an individual's 
                right to chose their own faith or none is universally accepted 
                in these islands, and when there are acts of Parliament that rightly 
                demand equal opportunities and legislate against racism and sexism, 
                the continued existence of the Act of Settlement can be seen as 
                a last gasp from the past, or an eccentric blip. Eccentric blips 
                can be harmless, but this one is not, because its terms disqualify 
                one religious denomination from the throne of the United Kingdom 
                and disqualify anyone with a claim to the throne who marries a 
                Roman Catholic. Repeal of the act will not cause a rush of people 
                marrying into the royal family, but this is a matter of principle.</font></P>

                bigotry has no place in a modern nation. That is a good message 
                to deliver on the eve of the millennium. I know, Tom McCabe, that 
                there will be some administrative difficulties as this grinds 
                its way inexorably through the system; however, I think that we 
                would capture the mood of the Parliament, the mood of the people 
                that we represent, and that we would give a lead to the UK Parliament 
                and encourage it to follow our example.</font></P>

                stated that discussing and passing this motion is a gesture. However, 
                I recall Glasgow City Council, and other city councils across 
                England and Wales, proudly conferring the freedom of the city 
                on Nelson Mandela while he was incarcerated in Robben Island. 
                That was an important gesture because it sent the message of our 
                abhorrence and hatred of apartheid to the rest of the world. This 
                discussion today is a gesture, but an important one. It sends 
                out the message that this type of institutionalised discrimination 
                is unacceptable as we move into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.</font></P>

                to vote for that today. I have no love for organised religion

                the amendment because it is an addition rather than a deletion.

                on local authorities throughout the country. I am glad to say

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless, we are 
                debating an issue over which we have no power to legislate. I 
                will not repeat Michael McMahon, who quoted from last week's <I>Scottish 
                Catholic Observer</I>, in which that point was made. However, 
                if the SNP chooses to use its parliamentary time for this purpose, 
                it is clearly its right to do so. We can, of course, express an 
                opinion; I am happy to express mine.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Parliament was 
                founded on the understanding that the principle of equality was 
                at its heart. We have a powerful Equal Opportunities Committee 
                and a responsibility for the promotion and encouragement of equal 
                opportunities, within the Parliament and the Executive and across 
                public authorities and bodies. The principle of equality should 
                apply to all Scotland's people, in all areas of life. There can 
                be no doubt that the Act of Settlement is discriminatory to Catholics&#151;not 
                only in Scotland, but throughout the UK and the Commonwealth&#151;and 
                is offensive to any reasonable person.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I well remember, as 
                a young girl, being told that the monarch was not allowed to marry 
                a Catholic. I grew up with that knowledge and wondered why I should 
                have any fewer rights than other Christians, people of other religions, 
                or any other citizen, because I am a Catholic. However, to be 
                perfectly honest, I do not think that the Act of Settlement impinged 
                greatly on my life or on my ability to make the most of my opportunities.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nor do I believe that 
                the act has great significance to the daily lives of my constituents 
                in Coatbridge and Chryston. What affect their lives are issues 
                such as poverty, drug use and abuse, anti-social neighbours, homelessness, 
                lack of educational opportunities&#151;the whole huge area of

                that the Government has other legislative priorities. There is 
                no doubt that the sentiments expressed in Mike Russell's motion 
                are right, but I hope that they are being expressed for the right

                (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>It would be easy for the debate 
                to become bogged down in the issue of whether the Parliament has 
                the power to change the Act of Settlement, or whether the act 
                is a burning issue among Catholics in Scotland. However, by seeking 
                to have the debate, we seek to address the fundamental issue of 
                discrimination.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cannot agree with 
                Michael McMahon that this is an irrelevancy to many Catholics. 
                Many Catholics may be ambivalent about it, but that does not mean 
                that they think that things should not change. We can always be 
                selective in our use of quotations. Both he and Elaine Smith quoted 
                Monsignor Tom Connelly, but the monsignor also stated, in the 
                <I>Daily Mail </I>of 15 November, that he was very pleased that 
                Scotland was taking the lead in this matter. The monsignor is 
                not here to defend himself or to settle our differences, but we 
                should bear in mind the fact that we can be selective in trying 
                to give a set impression.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Michael Matheson: 
                </strong>This is not about whether the act impinges on people directly 
                or indirectly; it is about a fundamental principle of standing 
                up against discrimination. I was brought up with the same views 
                as Elaine Smith has described. I understood that, because of my 
                religion, I could not be king or queen of this country&#151;[<I>Laughter.</I>]&#151;not 
                that I wanted to be.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important to

                Church; it is about standing up against discrimination on the 
                ground of religion. I am conscious that, given my religion and 
                my enthusiasm for the act to be repealed, some could say that 
                I had a registrable interest. I may be a Catholic, but at this 
                stage I have no plans to marry a member of the royal family, although 
                one never knows what is waiting round the corner. There is no

                </strong>How would Mr Kerr feel about a local authority discussing 
                the matter? In particular, how does he feel about Glasgow City 
                Council having done so, as it did two weeks ago? It passed unanimously 
                a Labour motion that was in stronger terms than the one before 
                Parliament today. Was that discussion a waste of time?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Kerr: </strong>Michael 
                Russell fails to understand what we are trying to determine. We 
                need to determine what the Parliament can and will do for the 
                people of Scotland, not what it wishes to do.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mike Russell's e-mail 
                to all MSPs clearly stated that the purpose of signing the motion 
                was to send a message about the act, not to bring the motion to 
                the chamber. That was dishonest and disingenuous of him.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want us to deal with 
                the new Scotland that we want to achieve. The issue of the Act 
                of Settlement has never been raised with me on the doorstep in 
                years of campaigning; there has been a rarefied debate only. Nobody 
                is saying that it is incorrect to deal with the issue, but it 
                is not a priority and it is not practical. People want to deal 
                with the issues of drugs, homelessness, the economy and unemployment.</font></P>

                is committed to dealing with constitutional matters. No other 
                Government has delivered in two years the amount of constitutional 
                change that we have. The National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish 
                Parliament, the social chapter of the European convention on human 
                rights, the reform of the House of Lords&#151;those are all major 
                constitutional changes.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>I 
                think that we all know what the Labour line is, which has been 
                distributed for this debate. I appeal to Mr Kerr to enter into 
                the spirit of the debate and to recall the fact that Elaine Murray 
                brought forward a motion on the war executed. That is a reserved 
                matter, but it is also one of principle. I ask Mr Kerr to have 
                some grace.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Kerr: </strong>That

                in the name of Michael Russell because, although I recognise that 
                the Act of Settlement is a reserved matter, I felt that we are 
                duty bound to recognise and do something about the illiberal and 
                in-built discrimination at the heart of our constitution. I say 
                illiberal&#151;and I speak for myself, as this is not a party 
                line&#151;as, to quote from the preamble to the constitution of

                and inequality.&quot;</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;recognises that 
                . . . repeal raises complex constitutional issues, and that this

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cannot see anything 
                that I disagree with in the terms of the amendment, as it simply 
                identifies the facts. I agree that it is a matter reserved for 
                Westminster and that there are complex constitutional issues. 
                I will support the amendment, as it does not take anything away

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I agree with Donald

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the complex 
                issues identified in the debate is the coronation oath. I see 
                that as something of a red herring. We live in a constitutional 
                monarchy where the will of the people, as expressed through democratic 
                parliamentary institutions such as this one, is supreme. In my 
                view, there are no complex issues that cannot be reasonably overcome 
                with a bit of political will. I am sure that this reform will 
                not pose a problem for the royal family itself. I say that as

                royal connections, Royal Deeside. In fact, I was on Balmoral estate 
                last Friday.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would like to widen 
                the debate by adding one more scenario to this examination of 
                the Act of Settlement. We have, quite rightly, focused on the 
                religious bias inherent in the act. When, at some time in future, 
                the whole issue of the succession to the throne is examined by 
                Westminster, we should take that opportunity to ensure that the 
                succession is free of gender bias as well as of religious bias. 
                Why should male children inherit the throne before female children? 
                In the modern world, such bias should be completely unacceptable, 
                and we should say so.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conclusion, I whole-heartedly 
                support the motion, and I will support the Executive amendment. 
                However, I would like the minister, in summing up, to assure Parliament 
                that that amendment is not simply an excuse for others to do nothing.</font></P>

                the worst of us, in our motives; it is simply not so. I have felt 
                strongly about the Act of Settlement since I was at school. I 
                am not a Catholic; it was a mixed school. When I first heard about 
                this abysmal piece of legislation, rather like Richard Wilson, 
                I could not believe it. Therefore, in those childhood days, I 
                added tackling the Act of Settlement to my long list of things 
                to do to save the world. Today, things have come full circle: 
                I have the privilege of being in the Parliament and being able 
                to chip in a bit to plead with people in Scotland to take a strong

                so forth&#151;are always there. The suffragettes, when they went

                to give it its real name&#151;is one of the most difficult and 
                deserving subjects that the Scottish Parliament can take on. I 
                was born and grew up in Glasgow, a member of an Irish Catholic 
                family. I grew up on the front line of the sectarian divide in 
                Scotland. I remember my puzzlement, at the age of five, to discover 
                that the boys with whom I played would go to a different school 
                and that I would have to think of them as being different from 
                me.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I remember the Orange 
                marches along our road, when half the families came out to wave, 
                cheer and applaud, and the other half withdrew into their houses, 
                pulled down the blinds and sat in the dark until the march had 
                passed. I remember the insidious questions: &quot;What school 
                do you go to? What team do you support?&quot; I remember the upwardly 
                mobile Catholics who suddenly discovered a passion for Queen's

                the principles behind it. I would like to think that that is what 
                today's debate is about. However, I am not sure. Why the Act of 
                Settlement? Does the Act of Settlement lie at the root of sectarianism 
                in Scotland? I do not think so. The Act of Settlement is an act 
                of the English Parliament, passed at a time when the Scottish 
                Parliament still existed. It did not apply in Scotland in 1701; 
                it still does not apply in Scotland, because it has never been

                any one of a number of acts that were passed by the English Parliament 
                at that time, which were probably even more offensive to Catholics 
                than the Act of Settlement? For example, in 1700, one of the acts 
                against popery actually rewarded with &#163;100 people who apprehended 
                and prosecuted popish bishops, priests or Jesuits. Before anyone 
                gets too excited, it did not mention cardinals.</font></P>

                National party has quite legitimately campaigned all through its 
                existence for the repeal of the Act of Union, and I hear what 
                Alex Salmond said about its most recent manifesto. However, in 
                a quarter century of fighting the SNP, I have never once heard 
                it argue for the repeal of the Act of Union on the ground that 
                it discriminated against Catholics. Not once have I been in a 
                debate during which any SNP member has put that particular argument.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am opposed to discrimination, 
                whatever form it takes. I believe that the true test of any democracy 
                is not how it provides for rule by the majority, but how it protects 
                and nurtures the minorities within it. I support the motion, but 
                I do not think that the amendment changes the motion in any way. 
                The amendment does not say that change should not happen; if it 
                did, I would not support it. But the amendment does not preclude 
                change&#151;however complicated that change may be&#151;and I 
                think that that change should take place.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, I do not think 
                that repealing the Act of Settlement as it exists in the Act of 
                Union will take on the challenge of removing the stain of sectarianism 
                from our society. If we are to do that, we will have to do it 
                in very different ways.</font></P>

                who will succeed to the British throne, but when I do think about 
                it, I am determined that there should be no discrimination. Catholics, 
                Protestants, atheists, Muslims, Hindus&#151;nobody should succeed 
                to the British throne. I do not want a British or a Scottish throne.

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is commendable that 
                we began this Scottish Parliament with our legislation being subject 
                to the European convention on human rights. To all of those whom 
                the Parliament represents&#151;and, indeed, to all those whom 
                we do not represent but with whom we deal&#151;the ECHR provides 
                and guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion under 
                article 9; the prohibition of discrimination under article 14; 
                and a prohibition of the abuse of rights under article 17.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would that Westminster 
                had been founded on those principles. The provision of a written 
                constitution and a bill of rights might well have guaranteed that 
                our history did not burden our present and future with a relic 
                of an institutional discrimination that was the product of a bygone 
                age.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, it seems that 
                of greater concern at that time was the maintenance of the ruling 
                establishment, rather than the good governance of these islands, 
                which were then termed the British Isles. The Act of Settlement 
                incorporated the acts of union with Scotland and Ireland and was 
                a guarantor of the hegemony that was begun under Henry VIII and 
                was consolidated by the so-called glorious revolution of Mary 
                and William. It passed into statute under Queen Anne in 1701. 
                However, it is fundamentally wrong to allow shameful anachronisms 
                of history to sully the future.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This archaic and discriminatory 
                act is entirely at odds with the fundamental political changes 
                that are taking place within this group of islands. For example, 
                the Northern Ireland Assembly agreement is specific; it guarantees 
                such rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity under its 
                human rights commission and legislation as</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Surely equal opportunity 
                in social activity includes the right to marry without prejudice

                find that employment. The newly created equality commission has 
                developed a clear formulation of the right not to be discriminated 
                against and of the right to equality of opportunity in the public

                that is at odds with the ECHR is a breach of the UK Government's 
                own legislation. When Westminster commits itself to the ECHR in 
                the autumn of next year, it will make the repeal a little more 
                complex. However, the key question is not complexity of any repeal, 
                but the political will to consign a discriminatory, divisive and 
                illogical legal relic to the dustbin of history.</font></P>

                public order or public health? Furthermore, I am sure that Labour 
                members would not suggest that the act was necessary to protect 
                our morals.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Act of Settlement 
                is simply incompatible with the basic agreement on human rights 
                in Europe, and the ECHR is perfectly clear on that point. It states:</font></P>

                that they cannot hide behind that excuse. If they accept that 
                abandoning this prejudicial and discriminatory act might not be 
                a priority, is somehow too complex or impacts on too many other

                unable to congratulate Mike Russell on bringing forward this morning's 
                debate. Mike Russell's motion was fine as a members' business 
                motion, although, as a Catholic, I did not see the issue as being 
                at the top of my&#151;or my constituents'&#151;agenda. In fact, 
                like many other members in the chamber, I wondered more about 
                the relationship between the monarchy and the new Scottish Parliament. 
                I wondered whether there even needed to be a relationship. However, 
                the Scottish National party could not leave it at that. It had 
                to waste the Parliament's time again, discussing issues in relation 
                to which the Parliament has no power.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I understand that the 
                SNP is trying to make a point by using its debates to highlight 
                issues for which power is retained at Westminster, but I believe 
                that that is an unnecessary use of parliamentary time. More important, 
                I believe that the people of Scotland will question why we are 
                using our time to debate issues that are the responsibility of 
                Westminster when there are plenty of other issues that we could 
                debate, which would affect and improve the lives of many people 
                in Scotland.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I must make one point 
                clear, however. I, my party, our partners in the coalition and&#151;I 
                believe&#151;the majority of members in the Parliament are totally 
                committed to equal opportunities. I totally reject discrimination 
                on any grounds&#151;gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. 
                I believe that the Act of Settlement is wrong, but I have every 
                confidence that our colleagues at Westminster will amend the act 
                when time permits.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That brings me to our 
                colleagues who have had that opportunity, but who have not used 
                it, of whom Lord James Douglas-Hamilton is one and Michael Forsyth 
                is another. When Michael Forsyth was Secretary of State for Scotland, 
                he never considered discussing the matter. Talk about conversion

                has been focused on the constitutional aspects of the monarchy,

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was born and brought 
                up in Liverpool. I have lived and worked in a number of places, 
                including Glasgow and Edinburgh, but it was not until this year 
                that I saw religious bigotry at its worst, not in my election 
                campaign, but during a colleague's campaign in the council elections. 
                My colleague was outed as a Catholic, as if it was something to 
                be ashamed of. I would have had more respect for the supporters 
                of the motion, particularly Alex Salmond, the SNP leader who lives 
                in West Lothian, if he had condemned such action and defended 
                the democratic process instead of backing this cynical move, which 
                will help only a few people and supports an unelected elite.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In my experience, Catholics 
                are just like other members of the community. They are concerned 
                about the health service, education and jobs. Last week, we had 
                an excellent debate on the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Bill. 
                One thing that was not discussed was how we enable people with 
                terminal illnesses to live out their last days with dignity. Living 
                wills are a sensitive issue, but the Parliament has a duty to 
                tackle, not avoid such issues. Many of my constituents&#151;Catholics 
                and non-Catholics&#151;would feel that the Parliament was working 
                for them if we faced up to such issues. The willingness to tackle 
                controversial issues would be a sign that the new politics really 
                had arrived in Scotland.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today's debate is nonsense 
                if we expect the people of Scotland to take the Parliament seriously. 
                The amendment accepts that the Act of Settlement is wrong, but 
                recognises the reality of what the Parliament can do. I know, 
                and I am sure the people of Scotland will understand, that the 
                SNP does not want this Parliament to work. The motion is an insult 
                to the intelligence of the people of Scotland, particularly Catholics.

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was brought up in 
                the United Free Church of Scotland in a small mining village in 
                south Ayrshire. My grandmother was a Catholic. Since I can remember, 
                I have abhorred discrimination for or against Catholics throughout 
                society, in Scotland or anywhere else. The first job that I had 
                was as a 14-year-old schoolboy&#151;a summer job as a cleaner 
                in Butlin's holiday camp. The first question that I was asked 
                was, &quot;Whit fit dae ye kick wi?&quot; I did not even know 
                what the question meant. When I found out, I was disgusted.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I say to Mary Mulligan 
                that today's debate is not a party political question for the 
                Tories, the SNP, the Labour party or the Lib Dems. Surely the 
                Parliament can rise to the occasion. Surely we can lift our sights 
                above petty party politics.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This debate is about 
                a fundamental principle. I agree with Tom McCabe that the Act 
                of Settlement is not the talk of the steamie&#151;if there are 
                any steamies left in Scotland. I agree with what Tommy Sheridan 
                said and with what Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said, and I agree 
                with Mike Rumbles that Lord James's speech was probably the best 
                that we have heard in this chamber.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The debate is about 
                the message that we want to send out as a new Parliament for a 
                new Scotland in a new millennium. It is about the symbolism of 
                the Act of Settlement and the symbolism of the continued existence 
                of legislation on the statute book that embodies an element of 
                sectarianism and of discrimination against Catholics.</font></P>

                mean that they should have their human rights undermined. This 
                is about the human rights not just of a potential Catholic spouse 
                of a monarch, but of the monarch himself or herself. If the monarch 
                is a Protestant and is not allowed to marry a Catholic, that is 
                a denial of his or her human rights as well.</font></P>

                as I was corrected earlier, I hope that Alex Neil will accept 
                this correction. The monarch is not denied the right to marry 
                a Catholic; they are just not allowed to succeed to the throne 
                if they do.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People have made a 
                big issue of the fact that this Parliament does not have the legislative 
                power to change the Act of Settlement. Of course it does not. 
                We know that. This Parliament operates at three levels. We operate 
                at the legislative level, although we do not have legislative 
                power on this matter. We also operate on a political level and 
                a moral level.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mary Mulligan used 
                the word responsibility. The Parliament does not have legislative 
                responsibility on this matter, but I argue that we have the moral 
                and political responsibility to send a loud and clear message&#151;not 
                just to Westminster and not just to people south of the border, 
                but to our own people here in Scotland&#151;that the Parliament 
                will not tolerate any form of discrimination or anti-Catholic 
                behaviour.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I agree with John McAllion 
                that discrimination in Scotland will not end if the motion is 
                carried or even if the act is repealed. However, this debate is 
                about sending a loud and clear message that the Parliament is 
                determined to end discrimination. The Act of Settlement is one 
                part of that; it is only the beginning. We will take whatever 
                measures necessary to convey to the people of Scotland, and of 
                further afield, that this new Parliament and the new Scotland 
                will not tolerate discrimination of any kind at any time, irrespective

                Wee Free and met my father, who was a Catholic of Irish background, 
                in Aberdeen. After they had been married for a while, she changed 
                faith. We came to Edinburgh and I had to go to school. She was 
                a lady of forthright manner; she knew what she did and did not 
                like. She went to the local priest&#151;she was not very used 
                to the system of lads with frocks on who had some kind of dynamic 
                power, as she described it. She went to Holycross Academy, as 
                it then was, but decided that she did not like the headmaster&#151;he 
                was not the man for her boy. She went down the road and saw the 
                sign for Trinity Academy, which, because of her background, she 
                thought was another Catholic school. I was duly enrolled.</font></P>

                bigotry. I was the only Catholic boy in a Protestant school and 
                on the other side of the park was a Catholic school where they 
                knew that there was a Catholic in the Protestant school. So what 
                happened during snowball fights? My non-Catholic school friends 
                protected me against my fellow parishioners with whom I went to 
                mass. On the sports field I played fullback; I used to get thumped 
                and my non-Catholic friends would thump the guys who thumped me. 
                I understood through that that the children who went to those 
                schools wore a blazer and that they fought the badge fight&#151;like

                with it? Does it interfere with people's rights?&quot; That is 
                what this debate is about. I am not going to argue about the rights

                to lead on issues, to pick up social concerns that matter to people 
                in different ways and to air those concerns in this chamber on

                Mary and Hugh about the atrocious anti-Catholic comments made 
                by Sam Campbell, the former Labour provost of Midlothian, who 
                remains a serving Labour councillor.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>I 
                assure Shona Robison that I would reject anyone's discrimination 
                or bigotry. It is quite wrong for her to suggest that I would 
                not.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>If 
                Mrs Mulligan's feelings were so strong, I am sure that she would 
                be working to remove Mr Campbell from the Labour party.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This motion is important 
                because we do not want Sam Campbell's comments&#151;or those of 
                anyone else&#151;to be acceptable in modern-day Scotland. We want 
                Scotland to be united in condemning discrimination against any 
                section of the population. That is why this debate is not a waste 
                of time. It is very important that this Parliament sends that 
                message out to the people of Scotland and sets a lead in tackling 
                discrimination wherever it arises.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is also important 
                to examine the role of the Parliament. Several people have said 
                that we should not discuss reserved matters and have suggested 
                that the SNP is somehow trying to destroy the Parliament by doing 
                so. As a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee, on which 
                I am proud to serve, I remind members that equal opportunities 
                are a reserved matter. Nevertheless, this Parliament took the 
                right decision in setting up an Equal Opportunities Committee.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr McMahon: </strong>We 
                all welcome the fact that the Equal Opportunities Committee has 
                been set up. The complaint that has been made of it is that the 
                SNP spends too much time addressing what that committee cannot 
                talk about rather than what it can talk about. We need a positive 
                agenda in this Parliament, which we are not getting.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>I 
                say to Mr McMahon that some self-reflection is needed. The members 
                of the Equal Opportunities Committee are hard working and I resent 
                his comments.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Government cannot 
                have it both ways. This Parliament has the right to discuss all 
                matters, including the very important matter of equal opportunities, 
                which I wish was not reserved. The fact that we have an Equal 
                Opportunities Committee sends out a message to the people of Scotland 
                that equal opportunities are at the core of this Parliament's 
                philosophy. I hope that, by the end of the day, we can reach a

                of the council&#151;and he is still a serving Labour councillor. 
                Rather than talk about what happened 80 years ago, what will the

                that people from an Irish Catholic background are more likely 
                to die early, end up in prison or live in poverty. Behind all 
                this is a history of discrimination and sectarianism, as John 
                McAllion indicated. However, the legacy of that, as Scottish society 
                begins to move on, is that such people are unable to play a full 
                part in many areas of life because of their class and their position

                in certain professions in this country? Equally, however, working-class 
                Protestants are under-represented in many of those professions. 
                Why are the top civil servants in this country mainly products 
                of private schools reflecting a certain class background? We need 
                to have a mature debate about how our society should move forward. 
                It would be far more relevant to Catholics and many other sections 
                of our society if, in these three hours, we were to address some 
                of the fundamental problems that affect people living in poverty

                made are the result of the struggles of men and women over many 
                years. One of the things that I am most proud of is that women&#151;who, 
                like Catholics, still cannot get into many golf or bowling clubs&#151;are 
                now better represented in this chamber because of the efforts

                uneasy, perhaps, about the tone of one or two parts of it. Some 
                fundamental elements have been obscured by more personal and, 
                at times, parochial issues.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I welcome the fact 
                that Mr Russell lodged this motion. I entirely support the amendment. 
                Quite simply, this issue is as simple or as complex as one chooses 
                to make it. There are two inescapable elements: the monarchy and 
                discrimination. I will make clear my standpoint. I am a deputy 
                lieutenant and, as such, I both support and believe in the monarchy. 
                I am also a member and elder of the Church of Scotland and, as 
                such, I am wholly opposed to discrimination in any form, wherever 
                it is found.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the question of 
                why this issue has arisen now, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton rightly 
                referred to devolution putting our whole constitutional process 
                under the microscope. I do not agree with Mary Mulligan, as I 
                think that the royal family has become more topical in the past 
                10 years. The constitutional settlement for Scotland has enabled 
                an eye to be cast over the more intricate relationships that exist 
                between Scotland and other elements of our constitution.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was curious that 
                Mr McCabe just about managed to omit any reference to the monarchy 
                in his speech. I wondered whether that reflected a 50 per cent 
                appetite for all this. At least Mr Henry was more forthright: 
                he dismissed the monarchy as an irrelevant institution.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the Executive's 
                amendment, I wonder whether the difficulties are not being slightly 
                exaggerated. It is indeed the case that seven or eight statutes 
                would require repeal or amendment, and that, perhaps, the Church 
                of England would have a more significant dilemma over this matter 
                than any other religious institution. However, it is also the 
                case that our devolution settlement involved us in a very considerable 
                number of statutory repeals and amendments, so I cannot believe 
                that this constitutional challenge would be insuperable. As Lord 
                James said, reforming the House of Lords has proved to be within 
                the management of the Government. I do not think that, in technical 
                constitutional terms, this would be more challenging.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It pleases me to say 
                that I have no doubt that this Parliament has a role in this matter, 
                and I do so genuinely. In the past six months, I have been taken 
                by surprise by how important many significant institutions in 
                Scotland regard this Parliament to be in relation to reserved 
                matters. It has become clear that those institutions see this 
                Parliament as a repository for opinion, and an increasingly influential 
                player in that role. Therefore, I entirely support what Lord James 
                said: it is important that this chamber sends out a message that 
                is sensible, constructive and, above all else, contemporary with 
                the feelings and mood of the Scottish people.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If there is one thing 
                that we can infer from this debate, it is that we are all opposed 
                to religious discrimination, wherever it is to be found. If we 
                can be unanimous in that message, it will do this chamber a lot 
                of credit and will be a good advertisement for Scotland. I am 
                conscious that the Act of Settlement as currently framed is, at 
                best, divisive and, at worst, profoundly offensive. That is an 
                unacceptable anachronism. I support Mr Russell's motion, and endorse 
                the Government's amendment.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Deputy Minister 
                for Communities (Jackie Baillie): </strong>This issue is clearly one 
                on which many members of this Parliament and many people in Scotland 
                have strongly held views. However, I am disappointed that, having 
                predicated his comments on the clear desire for the need for reconciliation 
                and unity of purpose, Mike Russell turned on both Michael McMahon 
                and Frank McAveety. That set the tone for the rest of the debate.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having said that, I 
                agree with Alex Neil. He is right to say that we must raise the 
                sights of this Parliament. I am grateful to Lord James for what 
                was probably the most interesting history lesson that I have ever 
                received. However, I rush to reject any notion that duelling is 
                an appropriate way to settle issues in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. 
                Duelling is a male preserve and, despite my commitment to equal 
                opportunities, I am therefore excused from participation.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There can be no doubt 
                that, historically, there has been religious discrimination in 
                this country. Sectarianism is a scar on the soul of Scotland, 
                and it certainly has no place in the Scotland of tomorrow. Our 
                aim and ambition is to end all forms of discrimination: religious 
                discrimination, racial discrimination, sexual discrimination and 
                discrimination on the grounds of disability or sexual orientation. 
                Achieving that is not simply about changing one act that is almost 
                300 years old.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michael Matheson said 
                earlier that he never dreamed about being the king, or indeed 
                the queen. I certainly never dreamed about being the king. I am 
                sure that royal marriage proposals are winging their way to Michael 
                as we speak, but how will he feel about the horses and corgis 
                that come with them?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The discrimination 
                inherent in the Act of Settlement is truly offensive to many people 
                in Scotland. The fact that it has little practical significance 
                does not negate its symbolic significance. Tommy Sheridan is right 
                to say that the passing of the amended motion will have symbolic 
                significance. However, it is not just a matter of priorities; 
                it is also about competence.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us get beyond symbolism 
                and talk about areas in which the Scottish Parliament has the 
                influence, the opportunity and the responsibility to get it right. 
                Shona Robison was right to say that we do not have legislative 
                responsibility for any aspect of equality. However, we have a 
                clear role in promoting equality, and key to that is our responsibility 
                to tackle discrimination&#151;through education, health, employment 
                and dealing with poverty. Those are areas for which we have responsibility.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our programme for government 
                set out our pledge to the people of Scotland: our pledge to work 
                together to build a modern, prosperous and socially just Scotland. 
                To make a real difference in people's lives, we must tackle the 
                discrimination caused by poverty. I do not need to remind people 
                that deprivation affects life chances. The fact that child poverty 
                increased dramatically between 1979 and 1996 is a damning indictment 
                of the previous Government. Two in five children in this country 
                are born poor, one in six families are pushed into poverty at 
                childbirth. We have a responsibility to improve the life chances 
                of our children, to end child poverty within a generation, and 
                to build a socially just and equal Scotland that is free of discrimination.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In working together 
                for a Scotland without discrimination, we must search for agreement 
                on the most effective way forward. We should not seek confrontation, 
                which will merely make worse the problems that we are trying to 
                solve.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>There 
                is a huge desire across all parties for the Parliament to speak 
                with one voice on this issue. That is of great symbolic importance. 
                The minister has heard the concerns of the SNP, the Liberals and 
                the Tories that the Executive amendment, phrased in complexity, 
                might be a euphemism for inaction. In the spirit of working together, 
                will she confirm that she does not favour inaction on an issue 
                that she has just said is of great symbolic importance?</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">to Alex Salmond, and 
                indeed to Mike Rumbles, that the Executive amendment is not, and 
                I repeat not, an excuse for inaction. I am sure, as members will 
                be aware, that this debate and motion will be considered carefully 
                by Westminster. However, John McAllion is right: the repeal of 
                the Act of Settlement will not in itself end sectarianism, so 
                let us focus on what we can do at our own hand. I am sure that 
                members will agree that discrimination has no place in a modern 
                society. We all believe that. Annabel Goldie was correct in her 
                analysis of the debate. It follows that we would like to see any 
                act of Parliament that contains religious discrimination repealed.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In closing, I will 
                focus on the Executive's amendment and the two key points that 
                it contains.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First&#151;and this 
                debate has illustrated the point well&#151;amendment or repeal 
                of the Act of Settlement raises complex constitutional issues. 
                At least eight other pieces of legislation would require amendment 
                or repeal. Similar legislation would need to be passed in at least 
                15 realms within the Commonwealth. There is no doubt that any 
                process of amendment or repeal would be complex, controversial 
                and demanding on parliamentary time&#151;not our time, but the 
                time of other Parliaments.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On that point, Mike 
                Russell is wrong. It is interesting to note that he is now an 
                expert not only on constitutional law, but on international constitutional 
                law. Is there no end to his many talents? Perhaps it signals the 
                expansionist plans of the SNP that it speaks for the Parliaments 
                of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other Commonwealth countries. 
                I am sure that those Parliaments affirm our commitment to equality, 
                but it is a matter for them, and for the whole Commonwealth, not 
                for Mr Russell.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, the Act of 
                Settlement is a matter reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament. 
                That is a matter of act and law, and is laid out in the Scotland 
                Act 1998. No one can dispute that.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I say again that the 
                Executive amendment is not an excuse for inaction. The Executive 
                is intent on ridding Scotland of discrimination in all its forms. 
                We believe that the way forward is by a broadly based programme 
                of social justice that tackles poverty and ends social exclusion 
                and discrimination in effective ways. It is a radical programme 
                but, above all, it is a practical programme that we can deliver, 
                one that will provide real change for the people of Scotland.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I urge Parliament to 
                support the motion as amended by the Executive.</font></P>

                which usually accuses us of the opposite.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had hoped that today's

                McMahon started that ball rolling, and once it started rolling, 
                the debate followed that course, so I will declare my interest;

                spent almost three hours debating the Abolition of Feudal Tenure 
                etc (Scotland) Bill, which affects a law that is more than 300 
                years old; it is something like 800 years old. In effect, we have 
                set about abolishing what is widely recognised to be an anachronism. 
                However, it is only one of the anachronisms that remain enshrined 
                in Scots law. This morning, we are debating another and some of 
                the same arguments should, in principle, apply.</font></P>

                of power to enact any repeal is not a reason why we cannot have 
                an indicative vote on our wish to do to this legislation what 
                we intend to do to feudal tenure. Let us be clear; we are talking

                to that in their speeches. That line of argument will not wash. 
                There is nothing to prevent the Scottish Parliament from debating 
                and voting on a motion in which it petitions Westminster to change 
                UK law. It was always envisaged that that would happen from time 
                to time. From the earliest days of the Parliament it has been

                agriculture; this is the first on a reserved matter. The fact

                and Hugh Henry made remarks that were, perhaps, misplaced in the 
                context of the debate. Michael McMahon's tone was also a little 
                unfortunate. There was slight confusion in a number of speeches 
                because members could not decide whether to attack the SNP for 
                jumping on a populist bandwagon or for picking up on an irrelevant 
                issue. They cannot have it both ways, but some members have tried 
                to do so.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The debate will draw 
                attention to some of the many areas in which the Scottish Parliament 
                is constrained by Westminster. Some of those issues, which are 
                germane to this morning's debate, were touched on in the debate 
                on equalities that was initiated by the Executive some weeks ago. 
                As I said then, the SNP has always believed that a Scottish Parliament 
                would present us with an opportunity to take radical steps forward 
                in Scottish society; that it would take us into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> 
                century with laws that ensure that there is no discrimination 
                on the basis of sex, age, religion, race or sexual orientation. 
                In that debate I highlighted religious discrimination. I also 
                highlighted some of the points that were raised in the debate 
                today, because of their specifically Scottish dimension. Because 
                of that dimension and Scotland's particular history and experience, 
                today's debate is of considerably greater importance than might 
                otherwise have been the case.</font></P>

                following the debate with interest.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Orange Lodge's 
                intervention reminds us forcefully of how important debates such 
                as this can be in Scotland. John McAllion spoke eloquently of 
                the experiences that he had while growing up. Those of us in the 
                Parliament who were raised in the same faith will have shared 
                many of those experiences. I look forward to motions in John McAllion's

                other legislation. My colleague, Mike Russell, mentioned information

                other Commonwealth countries to ask what their view of such a

                unaware of the existence of this discriminatory legislation. It 
                would be of some use if formal approaches could be made at this

                the continuation of the project with all its aims and objectives

                of the importance of Hampden to the nation, the Scottish Executive 
                has taken on a key role in finding the solution. The redevelopment 
                of Hampden is a flagship millennium project&#151;one of the largest 
                to be funded by the Millennium Commission in Scotland. The Scottish 
                Office was a minor funder of the project; its decision to contribute 
                &#163;2 million was taken in 1996 when the Conservative Administration

                before the problems could be fully resolved. That has proved to 
                be the case. The rescue deal is still subject to finalisation 
                of some detailed points and completion and execution of legal 
                documentation. I urge all the parties to permit no further delay

                Office contributed &#163;2 million over three years channelled through 
                sportscotland's grant in aid. Other public funders were the Scottish

                Work completed to date has cost some &#163;60.6 million. The estimated 
                final cost is &#163;65.7 million if all the planned works are carried

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The purpose of the

                and extent and to identify possible solutions. In essence, we

                some way short of bridging Queen's Park FC's deficit on the capital

                Park FC and National Stadium plc, it was necessary for a complex 
                process of negotiation to be undertaken with other parties that 
                had a financial interest in the project, who might be able to

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will detail the key 
                elements of the rescue package. McAlpine has accepted a settlement 
                that involves a cash payment of &#163;3.4 million and debentures which 
                would cost &#163;1.4 million to buy. The co-funders will meet the cash 
                component and Queen's Park FC is giving the debentures from a 
                stock that had not been offered for sale to the general public. 
                We are in the final stages of concluding agreements with other 
                parties to ensure that the funding gap on the construction phase 
                of the project is bridged. I am sure members understand that these 
                are very sensitive negotiations, but they represent the last part 
                of the process.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The remaining &#163;1 million 
                of the co-funders' money will be paid to the Royal Bank of Scotland. 
                That will reduce Queen's Park's indebtedness to the bank to a 
                level that can be accommodated within the new management arrangements. 
                The bank has agreed to convert its underwriting of the debenture 
                scheme, which was due to expire in March 2000, to a term loan 
                to Queen's Park. The bank is also co-operating in other ways that 
                are essential to ensuring an orderly transition from the present 
                arrangements to the new management set-up.</font></P>

                to take on responsibility for the future management of the stadium 
                under a lease granted by Queen's Park. The lease will run for 
                20 years, with an option on the SFA's part to extend it for a 
                further 20 years. The level of rent payments will enable Queen's 
                Park to pay off outstanding debts and derive an income to help 
                meet its running cost requirements. Queen's Park will continue 
                to own the stadium and adjacent land.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There will be a reciprocal 
                rights agreement between the SFA and Queen's Park, which will 
                enable Queen's Park to continue to use the main stadium for matches 
                and other purposes and the SFA to make use of Lesser Hampden for 
                squad training and car parking when major matches are being staged

                longer term. The co-funders were satisfied, as a result of that 
                work, that there was a viable business there, so long as it did 
                not have to service an unduly high level of debt incurred on the 
                construction phase of the project. The work persuaded the SFA,

                for drawing up and implementing a business plan for the stadium

                in 2002. I am hopeful that the rescue deal will be concluded this 
                week. If that is the case, it will maintain the historic relationship 
                between the oldest club and Scottish football's national governing 
                body. It will be a different relationship, but once things settle 
                down, I hope it will be a better relationship. It will allow Queen's

                made a great fool of herself over this, on several occasions, 
                and she is doing it again. She asked why we gave a press briefing. 
                I am renowned for never giving off-the-record briefings to the 
                press. On the issue of Hampden, I am renowned for saying nothing

                Sturgeon obviously thinks that I am lying and she must be able 
                to justify that. That is a serious accusation, Presiding Officer. 
                I hope that she will see fit to withdraw it. I have been very 
                circumspect and have not released any information. These have 
                been extremely difficult and detailed negotiations, involving 
                many people. It is not appropriate to give a running commentary 
                on them. This is not about achieving headlines, it is a serious 
                matter that must be dealt with carefully.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ms Sturgeon also asked 
                why money was originally put into the project. As I pointed out 
                in my statement, that was not done by the Executive, but by a 
                previous Administration, in 1996. She may wish to pursue the question 
                in that respect. We picked up the situation&#151;a stadium was 
                being built and there was a deficit&#151;and we had to deal with 
                it. She has again made a great fool of herself over the question 
                of where the money is coming from. Again she has made the wild 
                accusation that the money is coming from education funding. Let 
                me reassure the chamber that the money did not come from my education 
                budget. I can state that categorically. The money was added to 
                my budget in September from savings that were made across the 
                Scottish Executive budget. I hope that I will receive an apology 
                for yet another wild accusation in due course, but I will not 
                hold my breath.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ms Sturgeon's final 
                question related to the SFA's management of the project. We put 
                in money to save the project; if we had not done so, Queen's Park 
                Football Club and the stadium would have folded. If the SNP wants 
                to save the project, it must accept the consequences of that&#151;we 
                had to put in money. We were prepared to put in further money

                welcome the fact that the Executive has recognised its role to 
                find money to save the project. All parties should agree that

                the project; sportscotland and previous Administrations have laid 
                out their various monitoring mechanisms, which we will certainly

                (Lab): </strong>The minister will be well aware of my view that public 
                money could have been used more productively to finance and promote 
                football in ways other than building a new national stadium. However, 
                the stadium having been built, is the minister completely satisfied 
                that the rescue package, which I know to have been the product 
                of tortuous negotiations, is robust enough to be sustainable in

                we need not consider them now. The deed is done. The stadium is

                would have been better used improving facilities throughout the 
                country, instead of building another national stadium in Glasgow. 
                Is the minister convinced that the business plan is viable and 
                that it will ensure a commercial return within a reasonable time 
                scale? I see that the minister is nodding, which helps me to ask 
                my second question. If he is convinced that the agreed business 
                plan is commercially viable, does he agree that it would be a 
                better use of public money if the Executive agreed to a long-term 
                interest-free loan, on the basis that the money could be returned

                have done, but it was necessary to have a solid business plan

                I am happy that Queen's Park FC, which has a long tradition, will 
                continue. I am happy that the stadium has been completed and I

                glad that everybody is now co-operating in trying to get a solution. 
                However, given that the Executive and sportscotland have invested 
                public money, does the minister recognise that questions will 
                be asked about other aspects of football in Scotland? Does he 
                agree that, as well as funding a national stadium, he must consider 
                the plight of football clubs such as Dumbarton, at the grass roots,

                problems face football. Most of the solutions rest with the governing 
                bodies and the football authorities. One thing on which I can 
                assure Ian Jenkins is that the funding package in no way affects 
                either our commitment to the proposed youth academies or the money

                that two things have to be done&#151;not just in football, but 
                for all sport. First, we must ensure, by funding excellence in 
                sport, that everyone realises their potential. Secondly, we should 
                build up a large base of youth sport from which future champions 
                can be generated. That raises awareness and more folk are in turn 
                drawn into the base&#151;it is a virtuous circle, which is good 
                both for sport and for the health of individuals. It is also good

                some victims have been waiting nine years for a hearing? In the 
                year to March 1999, only 6 per cent of cases were dealt with within 
                a year. In contrast, during the final year of the previous Conservative 
                Government, 63 per cent of cases were dealt with within a year. 
                Does the minister therefore agree that new Labour's slogan should

                programme in Scottish schools to identify children suffering from 
                dyslexia, and that dyslexia has no respect for age, sex or background, 
                does Mr Galbraith agree that to consider such an initiative would 
                be an encouraging demonstration of the Executive's social inclusion

                The member is right&#151;it is important to pick up dyslexia early 
                if it is to be dealt with effectively. I am pleased to be able 
                to tell her that in 1998-99, 165 teachers received training in 
                dyslexia awareness and early identification of it through a project 
                funded jointly by the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Dyslexia 
                Trust. The expansion of pre-school education and early intervention

                thank the minister for expanding on that point, but does he agree 
                that the absence of a standard programme is an alarming omission? 
                There are clear disparities between different communities in Scotland. 
                Is not that a matter for some concern, which the Executive could 
                usefully address?</font></P>

                One of the reasons why we set up the special educational needs 
                advisory forum was to highlight such problems before they develop 
                to the stage where they present significant difficulties. Standard 
                guidance was established several years ago and there is specific 
                guidance on children with dyslexia. The framework is in place, 
                but we are not complacent about it. We set up the special educational 
                needs advisory forum to keep us informed. We have put money into 
                additional training on dyslexia and into special educational needs 
                in general. I hope that the member will be assured that that package

                Officer, and we hope that it will be available to everyone at 
                the start of next year&#151;but it is my intention to put a presumption 
                in the bill that individuals with special educational needs will 
                be taught in mainstream schooling. I do not want to put that into 
                the bill just yet, until it has been fully consulted on. I will 
                be asking the special educational needs advisory forum to consult 
                us. I hope that it will be able to come back to me in time to 
                get that presumption into the bill.</font></P>

                Technically, that probably was not a point of order, but it was 
                a point of importance. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body 
                discussed that matter in detail some time ago, and we decided 
                that the safest period to shut down the system was from 30 December 
                to 5 January, to ensure that millennium bug issues were sorted 
                out before the network went live again in the new year. There 
                will be public holidays on 3 and 4 January; while I admire Roseanna 
                Cunningham's assiduity, I cannot believe that she will need the

                fitting that this, our last parliamentary debate before the turn 
                of the century, should be about the future of our national health 
                service in Scotland. That reflects the priorities of this partnership 
                Executive, and I believe that it reflects the priorities of the 
                Scottish people.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today I want to look 
                to the future&#151;but first I would like to reflect briefly on 
                the past. The NHS, which was founded 51 years ago, stands as one 
                of the lasting monuments of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century. Since 
                its inception, the NHS has faced up to challenges. The first was 
                that of its creation, when giants such as Beveridge and Bevan 
                married vision with practical, determined action to create a new 
                era&#151;a new era in which care and treatment was based on need, 
                not on ability to pay.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the years, the 
                NHS has faced up to other challenges, for example, the challenge 
                of diseases such as smallpox, diphtheria and tuberculosis, or 
                present-day killers such as HIV. Another challenge is that of 
                need. The NHS has met ever increasing demands on resources as 
                medicine has advanced and technology and treatment have improved. 
                It has also&#151;rightly&#151;met the challenge of the growing 
                expectations of patients.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, the biggest 
                challenge might still be ahead of us: to meet the needs and expectations 
                of the next generations and to deliver a truly patient-centred 
                health service. The challenge is to deliver an NHS in Scotland 
                that is fit for the purpose, fit for our people and fit for the 
                21<SUP>st</SUP> century. Today I lay down a challenge to every 
                member of this Parliament to join the Executive in addressing 
                meaningfully and constructively the real challenges and opportunities 
                that lie ahead.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are often asked 
                about how we will address such challenges. For example, we are 
                asked whether we are putting more money into the NHS. The answer 
                is yes. There have been record levels of investment&#151;&#163;1.8 
                billion over this and the next two years, which is real money, 
                not false promises.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr David Davidson 
                (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>Is the minister aware that, in 
                the past few days, there has been much publicity about the inability 
                of health boards and trusts to fund their activities without getting 
                into debt and not having the funds for next year? The minister 
                talks about capital investment, but what about the revenue requirements?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Let 
                me repeat my previous point. We are putting record levels of investment 
                into the NHS in Scotland; we are not squandering resources on 
                a divisive and bureaucratic internal market, which is what the

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am asked whether 
                there are pressures and demands on the system. Of course there 
                are&#151;there always have been and there always will be. However, 
                those are situations to be managed, not crises to be manufactured. 
                Although there are always issues and incidents in the NHS that 
                have to be dealt with, it is important that we work constructively 
                to deal with them positively and practically.</font></P>

                cash crisis that is leading to bed closures and bed-blocking. 
                How does the minister propose to deal with that crisis?</font></P>

                The health service exists to improve people's lives, not to enhance 
                politicians' careers. The NHS needs mature debate and sensible

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Executive is determined 
                to do that. We want to build on the foundation that we inherited 
                from the previous Labour Administration, which drew a line under 
                the madness of the internal market, ended the inequity of GP fundholding 
                and so began the process of healing the health service. No one 
                should underestimate the damage that was done by the divisiveness 
                of the internal market and by policies that put political ideology 
                before the needs of patients.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have begun the process 
                of renewal, but I am determined that we will see it through to 
                fruition. First, we must ensure that the NHS of the future is 
                based truly on collaboration, not on competition. I want us to 
                increase the pace of collaboration and partnership in the NHS 
                in Scotland, not just between trust and health board or trust 
                and trust, but between manager and clinician, doctor and nurse 
                and carer and cleaner. There must be a new mobilisation of all 
                the staff who deliver our NHS services.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through the Scottish 
                partnership forum, we have put that philosophy into practice. 
                We have brought together NHS staff, trade unions, management and 
                Government, not across the table, but around it. We have worked 
                together to deliver real improvements: the first ever education, 
                training and lifelong learning strategy for the NHS in Scotland, 
                the soon-to-be-launched occupational health and safety strategy 
                for NHS staff and other products of partnership working, such 
                as the millennium pay deal and action to reduce junior doctors' 
                working hours. Those are real improvements for NHS employees, 
                which in turn deliver real improvements to NHS patients.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The partnership approach 
                is now being developed at local level and, over the months ahead, 
                I want to ensure that partnership working becomes a reality across 
                the NHS in Scotland. There is no one better placed to help shape 
                the future of the NHS than the people who work in it. I want them 
                to be at the heart of the decision-making process.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alongside that, I will 
                be working to bring about a step change in the way in which the 
                NHS&#151;locally and nationally&#151;communicates and engages 
                with the wider public. The NHS belongs to the people of Scotland. 
                They must feel that it does.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It will not be easy 
                to achieve that change in culture. It will take years, not months, 
                to make it happen, but happen it must. Local communities and local 
                elected representatives have a right to know who takes decisions 
                and why they are taken and must have the opportunity to contribute 
                to the decision-making process.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The remote and faceless 
                NHS boardroom of the internal market must become a thing of the 
                past. Next month, I plan to meet all NHS board and trust chairmen 
                to discuss with them how that change can be achieved. Over the 
                coming months, I will be taking steps to attract a far wider pool 
                of people into NHS boardrooms.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a first step, I 
                am writing to every MSP of every political hue to ask them to 
                identify people in their local communities who could make a contribution 
                in NHS boardrooms. That new sprit of openness, accountability 
                and inclusion must extend to patients. A patient-centred NHS must 
                be more than just a slogan&#151;it must become a way of life.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is why, in our 
                programme for government, we committed ourselves to developing 
                the patients project, which will aim fundamentally to change and 
                improve the way in which the NHS communicates with patients through 
                every stage in their journey: from GP surgery to out-patient clinic, 
                from hospital to home. That work, which will draw widely on the 
                views and experiences of patients themselves, will start in earnest 
                early in the new year.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As well as keeping 
                patients informed, we must work to reduce delays throughout the 
                system. No single issue dominates my mailbag more than that. Such 
                delays provoke a fear of the unknown: patients and their relatives 
                wait and worry, not knowing what will happen next or when or where 
                it will happen.</font></P>

                there. In our programme for government, we committed ourselves 
                to set targets for speeding up treatment and shortening waiting 
                times. Over the past few months, an expert support force has been 
                working with the NHS across Scotland to explore how best we can 
                do that.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Doctors, nurses and 
                patients' representatives have told us that we have to tackle 
                the inequalities in waiting times across Scotland, and that we 
                have to address all the stages of a patient's journey through 
                the NHS, not just one part of it. They have told us to redesign 
                that journey so that it is not only faster but better planned, 
                with realistic timetables that are met day in, day out, so that 
                patients can have confidence that promises will be kept. I intend 
                to heed their advice.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is why I can announce 
                today that, over the coming months, we will be working with the 
                NHS to establish national maximum waiting times to be met by March 
                2001 in the key clinical priorities of heart disease, cancer and, 
                for the first time, mental illness.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much of that work will 
                be achieved through the redesign of existing services. It can 
                be done. We know that because, in many cases, it has been done. 
                For example, the cataract redesign project in Ayrshire has resulted 
                in the waiting time being reduced from 12 months to six weeks. 
                Think of the difference that that makes for an elderly person 
                waiting for a cataract operation. I want that approach to be rolled 
                out across the country. That is why we will double the number 
                of one-stop clinics and why we will work with NHS staff to support 
                staff in the modernisation and redesign of services.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There will be a new 
                alliance for patients, in which the Executive will work together 
                with staff to deliver a new type of patient-centred care where 
                services are made to fit people, not the other way about.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To achieve such changes 
                and to deliver services in Scotland that can be the envy of the 
                world, we must change the way in which the NHS delivers care. 
                We must build on success, using innovative service design, our 
                leading-edge work in clinical standards and our new approaches 
                to multi-disciplinary working. However, that process of modernisation 
                and improvement also requires us to tear down some of the relics 
                of the NHS of the past, including the outdated ways of working 
                and, sometimes, the outdated buildings and shells that house them.</font></P>

                The NHS is not just about bricks and mortar&#151;it is about the

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fifty years ago, when 
                most of our hospitals were built, they were the home of services 
                because there was no other way of delivering them. Today, they 
                are a hub for many services because so much more can now be delivered

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, we need

                we are developing a new generation of walk-in-walk-out hospitals 
                that harness new technologies and the benefits of day surgery.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout Scotland, 
                a process of reviewing local facilities is now taking place, to

                draw the blueprint of a new NHS. Our aim is to deliver local,

                will not shirk from the need to provide first-class treatment

                put in place. The key issue is that it is simply not feasible 
                to transfer resources from secondary to primary care when the 
                whole system is under-resourced. The real need is for an additional

                shortage of &#163;20 million. Tayside University Hospitals NHS Trust 
                is looking at a shortage of &#163;12 million, while it is estimated

                cuts and cancellation of non-emergency operations in almost every 
                area of Scotland. Perhaps the most alarming revelation came yesterday,

                The staff at Lennox Castle hospital are in danger of losing their 
                jobs in 2002. Instead of being redeployed in appropriate settings, 
                the option has been created whereby they will be paid benefits 
                to take someone into their home. That, surely, is the wrong motivation 
                for someone who is being asked to care 24 hours a day for somebody 
                who is severely disabled.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We now know, from Jack 
                McConnell's budget statement, that the real-terms increase in 
                health spending in Scotland, next year, will amount to 0.8 per 
                cent, although the equivalent increase in England will be 4.4 
                per cent. According to the UK pay review body reports on the pay 
                increase for health service staff, that increase is likely to 
                settle at around 3 per cent. As a result, the health service in 
                England will be able to cope with the increase, but the health 
                service in Scotland will not. Therefore, the Executive must either 
                provide extra money to cover the increase or make cuts in other 
                areas of the health budget to meet the pay settlement. Can the

                In conclusion, I say to the minister that she should come out 
                from behind the smoke and mirrors. She should forget the glossy 
                brochures; it is time for the spinning to stop before it is too 
                late. Let us have an open and honest debate about the state and,

                hospital for the care of the elderly, which is undertaking desperate 
                measures. It is asking staff to take patients home&#151;as a newspaper 
                headline said, &quot;to 'adopt' a patient&quot;. According to 
                Unison, a similar system has been tried, but failed, in Liverpool, 
                yet it will now be implemented in Scotland. The most vulnerable 
                people in society are being touted around for a good home, which 
                will be paid for by welfare benefits. In the week before Christmas, 
                at the end of this century, is the minister proud of health care 
                in Scotland under which long-term mentally ill patients will be

                heard today. I confess that I have not had such a depressing experience 
                for a long time and it was exacerbated by the fact that Kay Ullrich 
                had the nerve to give us all that negative stuff for eight to 
                10 minutes and then depart&#151;she did not have the courtesy 
                to listen to the rest of the debate.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The NHS is an institution 
                to whose achievements all parties in the state have contributed. 
                It is right to recognise that at the beginning, even though that 
                is why it is the hot stuff of ardent political debate.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is also right to 
                emphasise the point that Susan Deacon made: the achievements of 
                the NHS are the achievements of its staff, often in spite of the 
                system. They are the achievements of nurses who are paid less 
                than they should be, of doctors who work longer than they should, 
                of consultants who develop pioneering techniques, and even of 
                managers who try to organise everything efficiently. I would not 
                like to do a job burdened by the knowledge that my mistake could 
                cost a human life.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the 1980s, the Conservative 
                Government tried to remodel the structure. In my view, it got 
                it profoundly wrong. It genuinely thought that the changes would 
                improve the structure, but it was at the price of millions of 
                pounds in unproductive bureaucracy.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1997, the Labour 
                Government came in with its fixation about waiting lists&#151;that 
                was a product of policy priorities being driven by spin-doctors 
                who were concerned with electoral considerations. Labour got it 
                wrong again, and the waiting-list obsession seriously distorted 
                NHS priorities. However, Labour managed to get rid of the internal 
                market structure.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, we are getting 
                back on course. The minister's statement, which has not even been 
                touched on in the speeches that have been made so far, about the 
                importance of waiting times rather than waiting lists is welcome 
                and right. Incidentally, it also shows the power and influence

                health records and documents. It is not an easy thing to get right; 
                there is a delicate balance to be struck between democratic accountability, 
                managerial efficiency, the meeting of national targets for a national

                what must surely have been the most unaccountable structure in 
                the whole history of the NHS. They are the very people who introduced 
                competition and divisiveness into the heart of the health service. 
                Their amendment, to which they have not properly spoken, calls 
                for waiting times to be the top priority for the NHS. Waiting 
                times are undoubtedly important, but it is quite out of tune to 
                consider it a top priority against the overriding importance of 
                targeting health improvement and health promotion&#151;another

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of us are genuinely 
                concerned about this issue. We look to Robert Brown to define 
                the debate, but he is not doing it. He should pick one point and 
                flog it, rather than flog the SNP, because we are not the Administration.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>Margo 
                MacDonald makes a valid point. I have succumbed to the temptation 
                to try to respond to the Opposition's approach to the debate. 
                The fact is that health spending under this Administration will 
                be greater in real terms than ever before. It will also represent 
                a greater share of national wealth than before.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is an endless 
                list of demands on health resources, so it is important that we 
                get the best out of them. As a Glasgow member, I am particularly 
                concerned about greater Glasgow. It has many Victorian buildings&#151;not 
                50-year-old buildings, but Victorian buildings. Often, they are 
                in the wrong place, which hampers the effective provision of secondary 
                care in the city. If we are to move towards the modern system 
                that we require, I hope that the minister will find it possible 
                to ease the transition by providing access to more capital funding 
                in a way that will not impose an unacceptable revenue burden on 
                Glasgow's health services.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will make two points 
                to finish. The first relates to the National Audit Office report 
                on ambulance services, which we heard about earlier this week. 
                Is the minister prepared to look at ambulance service funding, 
                bearing in mind the requirement on it to meet target times, and 
                that training for paramedics in Scotland has ground to a halt?</font></P>

                in funding that we now have should be redistributed in terms of

                Simpson is right, but on the question that Andrew Wilson asked 
                yesterday, which nobody answered, will Dr Simpson tell us that 
                he believes that Scotland gets an over-generous share of UK health 
                spending? Does he think that Scotland does better than it needs

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>Absolutely 
                not. At the present time, we need that spending, because we have 
                some of the worst health records and as long as that pertains 
                we will be able to justify that from the UK exchequer in the block

                4.4 per cent increase for England?</font></P>

                more than that. Over the next three years, the planned increase 
                is in the region of 12 per cent cumulatively. I do not accept

                &quot;public accountability&quot;. I accept that public accountability

                have been used. The word &quot;humility&quot; was also mentioned 
                earlier. At this time, we should show a bit of humility, because 
                there is a real danger that the people at the centre of this debate&#151;the 
                patients with their experience in the health service&#151;are 
                being lost. That is what I want to focus on. I do that in the 
                knowledge that some young people are here today from the organisation 
                for which I used to work&#151;Who Cares? Scotland. Those people

                will have friends or family who are alive today only because of 
                the dedication and hard work of the NHS staff.</font></P>

                want to say that my constituents welcome the fact that a new community

                I welcome the minister's commitment constructively to address 
                the needs of 21<SUP>st</SUP> century health care.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want to make a few 
                points about the innovative work that is being done at the Ayr 
                hospital as part of the designed health care problem. The project 
                gives a message about how designed health care can be taken forward. 
                It started off from the point of view of the patient and looked 
                at the patient's journey from the initial referral through to 
                final treatment. I have spoken to patients and to the people who 
                deliver the service to find out what they thought about it.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Susan Deacon is right: 
                the number of visits that patients have to make has been reduced, 
                as have the waiting times. Previously, the process took between 
                10 and 12 months and involved seven visits, including some repeat 
                visits to the out-patients department. The new project has reduced 
                the journey time to around two months and the number of visits 
                from seven to three. That must be progress.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patients now go directly 
                to the optometrist, who refers them to the hospital. The patient 
                attends the hospital for treatment and the follow-up is carried 
                out by the optometrist. The reduction in waiting time for surgery 
                has been from six months to around six weeks and the reduction 
                in the number of out-patient visits has been from three to zero, 
                which is especially significant in a rural area, given the difficulties 
                with transport.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The number of people 
                who have been dealt with in the day clinics has been increased 
                from eight to 15 per day, which potentially frees up 1,000 new 
                and 600 repeat out-patient slots. Those figures are from Ayrshire 
                and Arran Community Health Care NHS Trust, which says that this 
                approach is the way forward.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A current audit of 
                the project shows that the benefits include a reduction in the 
                number of inappropriate referrals, a reduction in the number of 
                people who do not turn up for appointments, a reduction in bureaucracy, 
                less paperwork, fewer letters to and from general practitioners 
                and fewer patient visits to GPs.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The patients surveyed 
                report a high level of satisfaction. What is crucial is that the 
                project did not start out as a cost-cutting exercise or as an 
                exercise in cutting waiting lists. It started out as an attempt 
                to find out what the patients who needed a service wanted and 
                how that could best be delivered&#151;it is being delivered in 
                Ayrshire. I hope that the minister will visit the project and 
                talk to the people of Ayrshire about what will be rolled out in 
                future. That is the way forward; it represents the kind of constructive 
                debate that this Parliament should be having instead of once again 
                making patient care a political football.</font></P>

                (Con): </strong>I was interested in Cathy Jamieson's speech and pleased 
                that she was so content with the East Ayrshire community hospital. 
                I wonder whether she will draw to the attention of her constituents 
                the fact that the invitation to tender was approved by Michael 
                Forsyth. Donald Dewar simply signed the contract.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy Jamieson: 
                </strong>My constituents are very well aware of that. They are also 
                very well aware of the damage that was done to their health during 
                the many long years of the Tory Government, particularly during 
                the miners' strike, when many of them ended up out of work.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Bill Aitken: </strong>That 
                is a period during which record numbers of patients were treated 
                by the national health service and unprecedented investment was 
                made. I hear no acknowledgement of those facts.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In her introduction, 
                the minister paid tribute to the national health service and its 
                personnel. Given her political background, I can understand that 
                she has a deep emotional attachment to the principles of the national 
                health service. I doubt whether anyone in this chamber today does 
                not fully support those principles.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I feel that there has 
                been a conspiracy of silence about the state of the NHS for far 
                too long. We see in press reports every day that the NHS is not 
                fulfilling the role that the minister and all of us in the chamber 
                think that it should. The level of patient care is not what we 
                would wish. Until that point is appreciated, any debate will be 
                sterile and negative. When the point is faced up to, we can be 
                more constructive.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have longer waiting 
                times than we used to. I accept the minister's point regarding 
                the question of waiting lists, but the length of time that a patient 
                has to wait for important treatment is a real problem. The minister 
                should address that. Staff morale in the NHS is undoubtedly extremely 
                low. Every year, substantial numbers of staff vote with their 
                feet. We have fewer nurses than we had the last time Labour was 
                in power. I see that the minister, being unable to deal with the 
                rationale of my argument, has left the chamber.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Robert Brown dealt 
                with the input of the Liberals into the Executive's health proposals. 
                Having read the Liberal party manifesto, I have to say that Robert's 
                party sold itself cheaply. It has not fulfilled one iota of what 
                it promised before the election. Labour promised to spend, spend, 
                spend on the NHS. The mantra of education, education, education 
                was replaced late in the 1997 general election campaign with promises 
                that the NHS would have capital and revenue investment as never 
                before.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald 
                (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>I listened intently to the minister being 
                interviewed on &quot;Good Morning Scotland&quot; this morning 
                because I had not made much sense of the motion as it appeared 
                in the business bulletin. I thought that I was listening to a 
                snow warning because of the flurry of words that all seemed to 
                run together. The words were reminiscent of the ones that are 
                used in the chamber when members discuss the radical restructuring 
                of the national health service in Scotland, which is what I think 
                the minister was promising in her speech.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What will be the difference 
                between this radical restructuring and that introduced by Sam 
                Galbraith when he was the Under-Secretary of State for Health? 
                I think it was &quot;Designed to Care&quot; that he introduced. 
                Much of the same terminology was used in the minister's speech 
                today. My question concerns the radical restructuring of the NHS 
                and the move away from old hospitals to what will presumably be 
                bright, shiny, community-based service providers. Will they be 
                provided by son of PFI? Is that where the money will come from?</font></P>

                Simpson is as intrigued by this as I am. Richard, I am sure&#151;I 
                apologise, Presiding Officer, for speaking directly to the member. 
                I am sure that we would all like to know whether any limit is 
                to be put on the extent of PFI involvement in this new community 
                service provision. None of us disagrees with that&#151;we think 
                that there should be a switch away from old and unsuitable hospitals&#151;but 
                what is the new service provision to be? We know, from what the 
                minister and other members of the Executive have said, that there 
                are cash limits on this brave new world. Unfortunately, those 
                limits are not set by the minister in this chamber, but by her

                believe what I am told by the Lothian Local Medical Committee,

                22 per cent of the spend in terms of people with learning disabilities 
                in Lothian. Those are the community-based services that the Executive 
                is trying to introduce. There is no investment in introducing 
                the new plan. I have no quarrel with the plan itself, but if the 
                Executive is going to invest properly, it should invest in development. 
                I have not heard any recognition of the need for that investment

                mistaken belief about Arbuthnott needs to be clarified. It means 
                changes in increase in expenditure; no area will lose money. To 
                hear Lothian officials talking about slashing their learning disabilities 
                expenditure and moving people back into hospital is utterly disgraceful 
                and is an unbelievable misperception of what will happen. Those

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The change he is referring

                encourage the chosen few to take all the decisions in closed rooms. 
                That is currently manifest in the service. Recently, the Health 
                and Community Care Committee took evidence about Stracathro, which 
                continued to carry out the policies of the Tories, which amounted 
                to &quot;Don't tell the people until you have decided what you 
                are going to do.&quot; The Parliament must ensure that we advise

                health service&#151;that the days of decisions being made in closed 
                rooms are finished. The national health service is open and accountable.

                ordinary people who make decisions. Staff also need to be involved 
                in the process. Rights for staff should be enshrined in the constitutions 
                of health boards and trusts. When the minister examines the make-up 
                of such boards, I ask her to consider setting aside a place for

                most modern in Europe. Let us have a reality check. We can do 
                only so much. There is a bottomless pit in terms of people's expectations 
                of the NHS; there is not a bottomless pit in terms of money, even 
                if Gordon Brown were to open his war chest and give more to Scotland 
                for its public services. If he did, I would say &quot;Thank you 
                very much&quot; and take as much as I could. There is not a bottomless 
                war chest. Every member could stand up and say that they want 
                money spent on certain areas, but we must do the best we can with 
                the available resources, at the same time as wresting as many 
                resources for Scottish health care as we can. We need those resources.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No one in the Executive 
                or the Parliament should be smug and complacent, sitting back 
                and saying, &quot;We're doing a jolly good job. Everything is 
                perfect&quot;. We need the debate on rationing that Kay Ullrich 
                called for. Let us get real. People know what is happening in 
                our health service and we must start talking about it. At all 
                times, we must remember that we should be putting the patient 
                first. Cathy Jamieson is right. Putting patients first means redesigning 
                services in a way that takes into account what patients want.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mary Scanlon is absolutely 
                right. We heard about Stracathro hospital&#151;25,000 signatures

                asked to speak to hospital representatives; that is why we listened

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Margaret Jamieson is

                listen to what people want. At the end of the day, it is the minister 
                who makes the final decisions. However, the views of the people

                problems of rationing, financing of acute hospitals and so on, 
                this chamber has rightly flagged up some of the difficulties in 
                the health service. But for goodness' sake, as our national health 
                service staff go into a new millennium, let us pat them on the 
                back and say that there is a heck of a lot of good work going 
                on in that health service. The Health and Community Care Committee 
                will continue to work with people, whether it be with the minister

                I urge her to recognise the problems that exist here and now. 
                It does not surprise me that the Executive's motion is couched

                insists that resources are not the issue and that health board 
                reorganisation is delivering better services; in the real world, 
                health boards are admitting to massive overspends and will have

                and are being manipulated. Hundreds of expensive beds across Scotland

                the minister's failure to match funding to Executive priorities

                that the Opposition parties must stop scaremongering and damaging 
                staff morale. Does the minister really think that that is a fair 
                comment? Do you really think that the 3,000 nurses who leave the 
                NHS in Scotland have nothing to do with your responsibilities 
                as a minister and everything to do with Opposition parties&#151;which, 
                apparently, have nothing positive to contribute? Is that your 
                analysis of what the Health and Community Care Committee has told 
                you during meetings, of what it said in its report and of the 
                positions of the parties in the chamber? Frankly, if that is true, 
                relations between the minister, the committee and the Parliament 
                are reaching breakdown point.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout her speech, 
                the minister told us very patronisingly that it is time for everyone 
                to grow up and to take a new consensual attitude to the issue.

                the need for mature debate and sensible solutions, not soundbites 
                and scaremongering. That in itself is a soundbite, which suggests 
                to me that the language needs to be changed. If the minister wants 
                to have a more constructive debate, we can do it that way.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this morning's press, 
                the minister referred to the sterile exchange over finance. That 
                is important. The Barnett squeeze, which is mentioned in our amendment, 
                is at the core of the debate. Despite what some members have said, 
                the fact is that spending on health care in Scotland in the next 
                financial year will rise by less than 1 per cent, compared with 
                4.4 per cent south of the border.</font></P>

                </strong>Will the member give way?</font></P>

                do not think that I can because of the time.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does anybody think 
                that Scotland receives an over-generous allocation? I do not think 
                that any of the trusts that are in crisis or any of the people 
                who are asking for more resources in the NHS would go along with 
                that view. Government statistics show that by the end of 2002 
                there will be &#163;400 less per capita in the health budget in Scotland 
                than if spending were to rise at the same rate as it is rising 
                south of the border. Those are the facts.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The minister might 
                describe this as a sterile debate, but that is absolutely the 
                wrong approach. Dorothy-Grace Elder talked about the north-south 
                divide and about the reports on poverty and Glasgow's situation&#151;which 
                several members mentioned. The point is that the top six areas 
                of deprivation in the United Kingdom&#151;and nine of the top 
                15&#151;are in Glasgow. That is the scale of the problem and one 
                of the things that the Arbuthnott report sought to change.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us run through

                Hospitals NHS Trust and Forth Valley Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. 
                Those are the people who need more resources. They will listen 
                to ministerial statements that we need no more resources&#151;they 
                will laugh and then they will cry because they will realise that

                An interesting point about what that means was raised by Duncan 
                Hamilton. What a pity that it came so late in the debate. What 
                a pity none of his colleagues chose to address such issues.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Susan Deacon addressed 
                those issues, however. She announced a drive to maximise grass-roots 
                representation on NHS trust boards, in which every one of us was 
                challenged to take part and which we were all challenged to promote. 
                What a pity that Kay Ullrich interpreted that challenge as an 
                invitation to put SNP placemen on health trusts. Are the SNP's 
                roots in communities so weak that the only people it knows and 
                can promote are its own party members?</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is the all-encompassing 
                challenge for us today. I say to Mr Hamilton that that is what 
                is meant by meeting us halfway and by addressing the debate. Are 
                we big enough and grown-up enough to show the leadership and vision 
                that will take our NHS into the next century?</font></P>

                said:</font></P>

                Parliament to be a platform for Jeremiahs and defeatists. Because

                certain anticipation of the holidays has been evident this week 
                in Parliament. Holiday moods can vary. We have a choice. We could 
                have a Hallowe'en debate about our NHS&#151;searching out the 
                dark side, working it up to a scary horror story and painting 
                a nightmare vision of our health service. That gets the headlines, 
                but it is a mask. It is guising and it serves us ill. We are certainly 
                ill served by attempts to make a scare story&#151;[<I>Interruption.</I>] 
                We are ill served by attempts to make a scare story out of proper 
                attempts to liberate learning-disabled people from long-stay hospitals. 
                We are ill served by those who talk about spin doctors and then 
                wave headlines at me. I have spoken to hundreds of learning-disabled 
                people and they all say the same thing: &quot;Close those hospitals 
                down.&quot; That is what we are doing.</font></P>

                it is nearly Christmas. We could also have the Christmas wish-list 
                debate, with its endless demand for resources. Duncan Hamilton 
                admitted that the demands are endless. That wish list is unfocused 
                and uncosted, and size is the only criterion&#151;massive size, 
                according to Dorothy-Grace Elder. Quality is not considered. Resentment

                we do not expect any problems with our IT system. Nevertheless, 
                we are following best recommended practice by closing the Parliament's

                essential double back-up will take place. The service will resume 
                as soon as possible on Tuesday 4 January, when, although it is 
                a public holiday, we have asked our IT staff to come in to restart

                give the Parliament an assurance that the appropriate trade union

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> 
                I can answer that. It was always assumed&#151;and it was agreed 
                a couple of weeks ago&#151;that those staff would come in on 4 
                January to deal with the matter. The only difference from the 
                statement that was issued on e-mail is that they hope to get the 
                system up and running on 4 January rather than on 5 January. However, 
                it had already been agreed that they would come in exceptionally. 
                We record our thanks to them for that service. [<I>Applause.</I>]</font></P>

                debate this evening. The subject relates to the finding of more 
                effective ways to support women offenders who have drug-related 
                problems. I would like to begin by addressing the history of the 
                issue.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A major review of community 
                disposals and the use of custody for women offenders in Scotland 
                was carried out by the chief inspector of prisons and the chief 
                inspector of social work. That culminated in the publication of 
                &quot;Women Offenders&#151;A Safer Way&quot;, which made seven 
                recommendations, all of which were accepted in principle by the 
                Government.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those recommendations 
                centred on the following important issues: the need for increased 
                services to support court decision making on the use of bail; 
                ways in which to reduce the number of women who default on their 
                fines and the number of women who are taken into custody as a 
                result; the fact that local authorities should ensure that criminal 
                justice social work services are tailored to work with women offenders; 
                the aim that, by the year 2000, women under 18 will not be held 
                in prison establishments; and, finally, specific recommendations 
                on the estate management at Cornton Vale prison.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main focus for 
                the follow-up to the report is an inter-agency forum that is chaired 
                by Professor Sheila McLean, which brings together representatives 
                from the main criminal justice agencies to address problems in 
                the treatment of women offenders. That forum began its work last 
                year, and I shall return to it later.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within the recommendations

                Those include, for example, defaulters on fines for offences such 
                as prostitution or the failure to buy a TV licence. It is also 
                recommended that better use be made of the bail system, with more 
                information and support being made available to women. At the 
                moment, the number of offenders at Cornton Vale, particularly 
                those in the 18 to 34 age group, is at a record level. In addition, 
                the drug and alcohol-related problems of the women there make 
                the management of the prison population more complex.</font></P>

                outset, it is important to ask two questions. The first is whether 
                prison is the right sentence. The second is whether, in cases 
                where it is, enough is being done to facilitate women's rehabilitation

                concern has to be the protection of the public. In cases where 
                a real problem is posed, a custodial sentence is the right disposal. 
                However, in too many cases prison is used not because there is 
                a danger to the public, but because there is no adequate alternative. 
                Many women at Cornton Vale need help to overcome drug and alcohol 
                addiction and to deal with the myriad social problems that they 
                face.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research by Dr Nancy 
                Loukes gave an indication of the typical circumstances of women 
                committed to Cornton Vale. More than 90 per cent of the women 
                in her sample had left school at the age of 16 or under. Roughly 
                three quarters had a history of truancy and, as a result, left 
                school with few or no qualifications. Many had experienced physical, 
                emotional or sexual abuse, and relatively few had received help. 
                There were significant problems of drug and alcohol addiction.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again, let me stress 
                that, in some cases, prison is the right sentence, because of 
                the need to protect society. However, let us be under no illusion: 
                prison cannot deal with many of the deep-seated underlying problems. 
                Let us also recognise that, in cases where there is no danger 
                to the public, a suitable alternative would be more appropriate 
                if it existed.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I now turn to the second 
                question: the help that is provided to women during their time 
                in prison and after release. The report &quot;Women Offenders&#151;A 
                Safer Way&quot; listed changes that could be made at Cornton Vale. 
                Many of those have taken place already, including improving services 
                for those with psychiatric needs and addiction problems, and better 
                communication between court-based social work staff and the staff 
                at Cornton Vale.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know that other members 
                present have more specialist knowledge in the area of drug treatment 
                and will speak in more detail on that issue. Let us remember that 
                many women are sentenced to relatively short periods of imprisonment, 
                often for petty crimes, and then released. Although support such 
                as that given through the turnaround project is increasing, much 
                more is needed. Too often, women leave Cornton Vale prison only 
                to face the same range of social problems that led to their conviction 
                in the first place. Often they turn to crime to feed a drug habit. 
                If we are to be effective with such offenders and to ensure that 
                they do not reoffend, we must do more to prepare them for release 
                and support them afterwards.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One initiative that 
                has been used very successfully in north America, particularly 
                in Canada, is halfway houses. Those provide a well-supported environment 
                in which women can live&#151;we should not forget that 70 per 
                cent of women offenders have children&#151;and receive dedicated 
                help to overcome their problems, particularly drug and alcohol 
                addiction. The halfway house could be an effective alternative 
                to prison for those who do not pose any threat to society. It 
                could also offer longer-term support after release from prison.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In bringing forward 
                this motion, I hope that we can consider seriously the suggestion 
                of halfway houses, working through the following process. First, 
                we should undertake research in the area, looking at best practice 
                in other countries and building on the on-going work of Professor 
                McLean and her inter-agency forum. Secondly, we should undertake 
                a pilot project based on that research, which would most likely 
                bring together a more co-ordinated support structure within a 
                halfway house approach. It is to be hoped that that would allow 
                women to have their children with them. It would also build on 
                the work of Professor McLean's forum and the useful suggestion 
                for the turnaround project to be expanded. Thirdly, we should 
                put in place an after-care service to support women once they 
                are fully back in the community.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research so far shows 
                that, in addition to support for drug and alcohol problems, women 
                offenders need help with housing and basic education and training, 
                which are as essential as the drug and alcohol treatment. That 
                means adopting a holistic approach to solving not just one, but 
                a number of problems.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This issue is essentially 
                one of social exclusion. By the measures that we suggest today, 
                we can bring a number of very vulnerable women back into society 
                to lead what we hope will be effective and rewarding lives. There 
                are many issues that I have been unable to touch on, but I will 
                leave those to the remaining speakers. I beg members to support 
                the motion.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dr Richard Simpson 
                (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>I have had personal experience of the situation 
                in Cornton Vale prison, as I was a deputy medical officer there 
                from the time when it opened in 1976 until quite recently. Indeed, 
                my practice resigned from providing general medical services on 
                a regular basis one week before the first suicide.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That suicide followed 
                a period of seven or eight years in which the whole character 
                of the prison changed. In 1987, 10 women with drug problems were 
                admitted to the prison. By 1994, the number had risen to 600, 
                although the number of annual admissions, at around 2,000, had 
                not substantially changed. The degree of recidivism&#151;repeated 
                minor offences&#151;among that population is very substantial. 
                Prisoners are admitted for very short sentences, often for failing 
                to pay fines, which may have remained unpaid for a long time.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is possible for 
                the professionals and officers in the prison to establish a reasonable 
                treatment programme for those who are serving longer sentences. 
                However, there is a problem even with those longer-term prisoners 
                in that their discharge is not always well supported. It would 
                be helpful to have some way of releasing prisoners on licence 
                into a more caring environment.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sylvia Jackson has 
                made a strong point about people going into custody. It is totally 
                abhorrent that we still admit so many women and that we split 
                up so many families, which causes so much devastation to the next 
                generation. This chamber should do something about the situation. 
                I state my intention to make it my business, along with Keith 
                Raffan and the others on the all-party group, to ensure that measures 
                are introduced to divert people from prison.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the visit the 
                other day of the all-party group to Brenda House, which is the 
                unit run by the Aberlour Child Care Trust in Edinburgh, I was 
                appalled to find that only two of the six places there were occupied 
                because funds were not being made available. Members of all parties 
                were shocked to find that the very limited resources that we have 
                in the community are not being fully utilised.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are 112 agencies 
                dealing with drug problems in the community. I believe that it 
                will take all of the minister's energy to co-ordinate those agencies 
                with the Scottish Prison Service to ensure that we bring about 
                a substantial change early in the new millennium.</font></P>

                a lot of my speech.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I thank Sylvia Jackson 
                for bringing this motion before us. I associate myself with her 
                comments and, in particular, with those of Richard Simpson. I, 
                too, am a member of the all-party group and was with Dr Simpson 
                when he visited Brenda House.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sylvia pointed out 
                that women are put in jail for offences such as television licence 
                evasion and fine default. I would like the right sentences to 
                be given to the right people. Prison should be used as a last 
                resort. It is not the right decision for fine defaulters and shoplifters 
                who are trying to feed a family.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have examined some 
                of the things that are happening in offender rehabilitation in 
                other parts of the world, and have learned that an important goal 
                of the criminal justice system is to help offenders to become 
                law-abiding citizens. I hope that some of the training that prisoners 
                get in prison and at halfway houses does that. Incarceration and 
                intensive supervision by themselves do not lead to the long-term 
                changes that many offenders need to live productive and law-abiding 
                lives in the community. Treatment services and programmes are 
                also necessary to bring about more long-lasting changes in behaviour.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research shows that 
                effective correctional treatment requires a careful match between 
                the specific needs of offenders and programmes that address those 
                needs. Treatments that match offender needs to the programme, 
                using behavioural training techniques, have been shown to reduce 
                offending by an average of 50 per cent. Under such programmes, 
                offenders do not commit new offences and do not break the conditions 
                attached to their release.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rehabilitation programmes 
                are more effective when delivered in community rather than prison 
                settings. As one of the few members of Parliament to have been 
                a position to send women to Cornton Vale, I can tell the chamber 
                that I considered doing so only as a very last resort. There are 
                far better things to do with people who need help and treatment 
                than sending them to prison.</font></P>

                side of my family is more involved on the legal side, but perhaps 
                there is a coming together of views on these issues.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leaving aside that 
                rather jokey approach, Sylvia has raised an important point about 
                the treatment of offenders. It is not seen as the sexiest of issues 
                by the press, which always takes a reactionary view of prison 
                facilities and the Prison Service's aim of ensuring that offenders 
                are given the best opportunity to come back into society without 
                reoffending.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We built Cornton Vale 
                with great hopes and great expectations, but a catalogue of disasters 
                has befallen it. The record of suicides has given Cornton Vale 
                a bad reputation, despite the efforts of those who work with the 
                inmates of that facility. Members of Parliament must express support 
                for the people who work in Cornton Vale and for what is being 
                achieved in that prison and in the penal system as a whole.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I shall mention three 
                important aspects of the treatment of offenders. The first is 
                education. Having worked in that area, I know that many people 
                in Cornton Vale do not read, cannot write and cannot communicate 
                with society as most of us have to be able to do in our everyday 
                lives. More emphasis should be put on the educational side of 
                the Prison Service.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second important 
                aspect is detoxification, which Dr Simpson has mentioned. I am 
                not an expert on that, but I am aware of the huge debate on the 
                issue of drugs and alcohol in prisons. We must emphasise the importance 
                of detoxification. We may be able to do it through improved funding 
                or perhaps through education, but there will be no easy answers.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third aspect is 
                support in the community. We have to educate our communities about 
                helping people who, for whatever reason, have fallen foul of the 
                laws laid down by our country. If we put greater emphasis on support 
                in the community, making available resources to support individuals, 
                a great deal could be achieved.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those of us who have 
                stayed to participate in Sylvia's debate hope that the Executive 
                and the Parliament will take a constructive approach, because 
                that is what the problem deserves.</font></P>

                cent of inmates admitted to using drugs illicitly, 70 per cent 
                were habitual users, 61 per cent were heroin users and 45 per 
                cent had drink problems. An average week's admission last month 
                was 22 people. Of them, 46 per cent admitted to injecting heroin, 
                23 per cent to smoking it and 80 per cent had had hepatitis C.

                criminal justice system that is failing those women&#151;society

                Scotland that is about to move into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. 
                We need a joined-up criminal justice system. The minister will 
                know about the turnaround project, Scotland's first diversion 
                from prosecution scheme for women drug users. If they meet the 
                referral criteria they are accepted on a 12-week programme of 
                prescribed medication and intensive one-to-one group work. If 
                they complete that successfully, they are not prosecuted. Those 
                who work for the turnaround project are veterans of the drugs 
                field, but this is what they said:</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Despite our combined 
                experience in the drugs and alcohol field, we had never come across 
                such intense levels of personal distress and constant crisis.&quot;</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must develop and 
                extend that pilot scheme through the use of halfway houses instead 
                of prison, and their use before and after prison. They could be 
                run by prison staff, and provide counselling, group therapy and 
                peer support. One-to-one counselling and group therapy, followed 
                by after-care, should be available to those who are sent to prison. 
                The governor of Saughton prison is concerned about prisons being 
                seen as institutions in and of themselves, with no through-care

                assessment, referral, advice and through-care&#151;which started 
                in English prisons on 3 October. Many in the Prison Service expected 
                the &#163;13 million underspend in Scottish prisons to be allocated 
                to drug rehabilitation and treatment, but that does not appear 
                to be happening. We must have halfway houses and after-care as 
                a way for people to get back to normal living in the community, 
                and to ensure that they do not relapse.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sylvia also mentioned

                women are not articulate. They cannot speak up for themselves, 
                and they get put off by having to go to housing departments, and 
                going for benefits, jobs and training. We need a one-stop shop 
                to help and support those women, so that they have a chance of 
                getting back to living in the kind of world in which the rest

                thing to do. It is also the cost-effective thing to do. It costs 
                &#163;37,000 per year to keep a woman in prison, and &#163;27,000 to keep 
                a man. We must return women to society in full mental and physical

                Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I also thank Sylvia for lodging this motion. 
                As many members have said already, Cornton Vale has a lot of women 
                who should not be there. Many of them are there for non-payment 
                of fines. An analysis of the criminal justice system showed that 
                women were more likely to be given custodial sentences for crimes 
                such as non-payment of fines&#151;if they can be defined as crimes. 
                When we consider many of the women who are in Cornton Vale, we 
                could describe them more as victims than criminals. The system 
                has failed them. As has been said, a huge number have been physically 
                or sexually abused. Many have chronic alcohol or drugs problems. 
                They need help, not punishment.</font></P>

                try to find appropriate placements for them. It was frustrating 
                because, when a woman was ready to go into a rehabilitation or 
                detoxification unit, it was necessary to strike while the iron 
                was hot. If there was no place available, going back to them four 
                weeks later was no good, because the opportunity had passed. We 
                must have the resources, so that when a woman says, &quot;Yes, 
                I am ready to seek treatment&quot;, the treatment must be available.</font></P>

                about the other problems faced by women in Cornton Vale, so I 
                will skip over most of those issues. We must break the cycle of 
                women going in and out of prison with little being done to tackle 
                the underlying problems. There are many good alternative to custody 
                programmes. Halfway houses are a good idea, and I will find out 
                more about them. The criminal justice system is, as all members 
                have said, currently failing these vulnerable women. I hope that 
                this Parliament will change that situation sooner rather than

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will begin by placing 
                on record my view that the speeches that we have had tonight have 
                been thoughtful and constructive, on a painful and difficult subject. 
                None the less, this debate has probably been the most pleasurable 
                of any I have participated in since coming to this Parliament 
                because of the real feeling and genuine value of the speeches 
                that have been made. I thank Sylvia Jackson for placing this motion 
                before the Parliament and for making such a positive contribution 
                to the debate.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The position of women 
                in Scottish prisons is a serious and emotive subject. It deserves 
                to receive serious attention from the members of this Parliament. 
                As Dr Richard Simpson said, it is an important issue for the Parliament 
                and its committees to consider. I welcome the motion and the standard 
                of debate that we have heard this evening.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I emphasise the continuing 
                commitment that the Scottish Executive gives to improving the 
                way the criminal justice system deals&#151;or attempts to deal&#151;with 
                women offenders. It remains our aim to ensure that there is a 
                wide range of effective and credible community-based alternatives 
                available to the courts, not just the sentencing and prison option.</font></P>

                to help change that offending behaviour. That has been reflected 
                in some of the speeches. On that basis, the Executive and I are 
                in no doubt that prison will remain the correct solution for some 
                groups of offenders, but for others it is a last resort and one 
                of dubious quality.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the past decade, 
                the use of community sentences has increased. For example, the 
                number of probation orders has doubled and the number of community 
                service orders has increased by 70 per cent. We recognise, however, 
                that much of this work in the past has been informed by an analysis 
                of offending patterns among men rather than women. It was for 
                that reason that the importance of establishing effective and 
                credible community-based alternatives for women who offend was 
                one of the important issues highlighted in last year's review 
                of women offenders in Scotland.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we know, and as 
                members have mentioned, the origins of that review lay in the 
                tragic loss of seven young lives at Cornton Vale prison between 
                1995 and 1997. Any suicide, in any circumstance, produces a reservoir 
                of pain and misery for everyone concerned. In the Prison Service, 
                that includes prisoners, families and prison staff. Every single 
                one is a tragedy. In 1996, three out of the 17 suicides in Scottish 
                prisons were women.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite that, in Scotland, 
                women offenders make up only a tiny percentage of the criminal 
                cases that come before our courts. Of the 6,000 average daily 
                population in Scotland's prisons in 1998, only 193 were women, 
                and most were serving much shorter sentences than men. Those figures 
                are startling and disturbing evidence, compared with the number 
                of suicides by women.</font></P>

                (Highlands and Islands) (SNP): </strong>Would the minister find it 
                useful to meet the sheriffs to get across the fact that we are 
                all united in thinking that short prison sentences do no good 
                and that sending people to prison for, say, non-payment of fines, 
                is not acceptable to the Parliament? Perhaps an early meeting 
                with the sheriffs, to find out whether they are aware of our feelings, 
                would be a good idea.</font></P>

                thank the member for that contribution. In the remainder of my

                to address that point.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we consider the 
                number of suicides among women prisoners relative to the number

                unacceptable. The link with drugs, which has also been mentioned 
                tonight, is clearly relevant. The human tragedy that hides behind 
                the statistics we are discussing is the stark fact that we are 
                dealing with a group of particularly vulnerable people, who are

                term. I can see, at face value, the immediate attraction of the 
                halfway house approach and I can certainly understand the desire 
                not to sever the links between women offenders and their children. 
                However, halfway houses appear, to me, to be another&#151;albeit 
                lesser&#151;form of custody. I am seriously concerned about the

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and radical than putting 
                women into any form of incarceration may be required. &quot;A 
                Safer Way&quot;, the review into women offending, concluded that 
                almost all women offenders could be safely punished in the community 
                without any major risk to the general population. That underlines 
                the point that I am making.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following that review, 
                the aim has been to increase the range of supervised accommodation 
                provided by local authorities. Good progress has been made in 
                many areas. There is now a range of accommodation throughout much 
                of the country, from supported flats to closely supervised hostels&#151;all 
                funded through the 100 per cent funding arrangements. That is 
                a positive approach. Moreover, an extra &#163;20 million is going into 
                the budget for community sentences in the current three-year period.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much has been and is 
                being done to address the specific problems associated with women 
                offenders. Accommodation in Glasgow for women, including those 
                on bail, has increased with the opening of a new facility to extend 
                existing provision. A new bail retrieval scheme in Cornton Vale 
                has been introduced to offer those women originally remanded in 
                custody a second chance of release on bail under supervision. 
                There is a new 24-hour staffed hostel in Dundee with four dedicated 
                bed spaces for women or women and their children. The expansion 
                of the turnaround project addresses the specific needs of female 
                drug misusers in Glasgow at all stages in the criminal justice 
                process from arrest to release from prison.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mainstreaming of 
                funding for bail schemes has been introduced in Glasgow and Edinburgh 
                to offer courts a feasible alternative to custody by adding supervision 
                to the bail conditions. Funding has also been provided for new 
                schemes in North and South Lanark. Supervised attendance orders 
                for fine defaulters are being extended to all courts in Scotland. 
                Drug treatment and testing orders are being piloted in Glasgow 
                to deal with those offenders who are committing crimes to fund 
                their drug misuse. That programme will be doubled in Glasgow next 
                year and extended to Fife. To help to shape future policy, further 
                research is being carried out on the specific issues around young 
                women who offend.</font></P>

              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As members will know, 
                the inter-agency forum has looked at the problems in Glasgow and, 
                within the past month, has submitted its first report. It sees 
                the way forward as the provision of more projects that pursue 
                the diversion agenda in its broadest sense. The forum is looking 
                for the provision of a safe, community-based service for women 
                that is not run by the Prison Service. I believe that that is 
                the correct approach. The Executive is following it through by 
                negotiating with Glasgow City Council the early establishment 
                of a diversion scheme as a matter of priority. We hope that the 
                scheme will be up and running by April.</font></P>
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 24 January, I will 
                visit Cornton Vale to assess the situation for myself. I suggest 
                that the only relatively sure method of dealing with the problems 
                associated with women in prisons is to make a significant reduction 
                in the number of women going to prison or undergoing any kind 
                of prison service. That should be the core policy objective.</font></P>
