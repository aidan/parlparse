<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):
</strong>We now move to the debate on members' business, on motion S1M-94, in
the name of Maureen Macmillan. This debate will be concluded in 30 minutes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Motion debated,</font></i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That the Parliament notes the Work Plan
drawn up by the Scottish Partnership on domestic violence which has as
part of its remit an examination of the experience of women in rural areas;
calls for swift consideration to be given to improving the safety of women
at risk, and supports the work carried out in this field by Women's Aid
and other organisations in the Highlands and Islands.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17:04</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;<strong>Maureen Macmillan (Highlands and
Islands) (Lab): </strong>When one has been involved, as I have, in campaigning
against domestic violence for nearly 20 years, it is easy to forget that
not everyone realises how domestic violence pervades every part of society.
As I speak I am conscious that women who have experienced domestic violence
might be listening, because one in five women will be victims of violence
in their lives. Two hundred children in Scotland today will see their mothers
abused. Twenty-five per cent of all reported violent crime is domestic
violence that is committed by men against women, and dear knows how much
goes unreported.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are misconceptions about domestic
violence. The most common one is that the abuse is drink related. Domestic
violence is not caused by alcohol, as both the Strathclyde police and Ross-shire
police discovered when they kept records of cases last Christmas. It is
not confined to one social class. Middle-class women might not present
themselves at refuges, but they telephone for advice and help. They are
as likely to suffer domestic violence as are women from other social classes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another misconception is that domestic
violence happens only in urban areas. I can assure members that it happens
in rural areas, too. Isolated areas are often deliberately chosen by an
abuser to cut a woman off from her friends.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Abuse does not run in families and it is
not necessarily the case that a violent father will have violent sons.
Nevertheless, domestic violence affects children profoundly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Violence is used to control a woman by
making her afraid. The abuser uses threats as well as physical violence,
and assaults are sometimes severe. Just less than half of female murder
victims are murdered by their male partners, and three quarters of those
victims are killed by the man after they have left him. Not all abuse is&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">physical. Many
women suffer psychological or sexual abuse, which is used to control, and
which can be damaging in a different way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is of the utmost importance that women
have easy access to help and support, but in the Highlands and Islands
there are particular problems. In a small community, the abuser might be
an important figure who is well liked. A woman might suffer in silence
because she feels that she would not be believed. It is important that
women in such situations should be able to get information on where to
find help.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It can often be difficult for a woman to
leave her abuser because there might be little or no public transport and
the distance involved might be enormous. Once a woman has made the decision
to leave-and that is not an easy decision-it is of paramount importance
that she has a safe place to go. In the Highlands, that is not always easy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are no women's refuges on the west
coast mainland north of Dunoon and none on the east coast mainland north
of Dingwall. The existing refuges are overloaded; three families might
be living in a house meant for one. We still need more space.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last year, Ross-shire Women's Aid gave
shelter to 26 women and 43 children, and helped and advised 200 women through
telephone helplines and visits. It had to turn away 37 women and 55 children.
One reason for that is that women often have to stay on in refuges longer
than is necessary because there is a lack of rented housing to move on
to, and that blocks refuge spaces that other women need.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Refuges are funded, not centrally, but
by local authorities. The provision of housing therefore varies from council
to council, and the level of commitment can depend on the attitude of one
official in a housing department. I pay tribute to Orkney Islands Council's
housing department for its efforts to help abused women.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Outreach work and the building of new refuges,
both of which are now being tackled by Highland Council, are only part
of the answer. Not every woman wants or needs to be in a refuge, although
some women need to move as far as possible from their abusers for safety's
sake. There are only two outreach workers for the Highland Council area.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Not every woman wants to leave her community.
A woman needs to be supported in her community and to feel safe. Changes
in the law are required to achieve that. The support that is available
is improving through partnerships among health boards, the police and voluntary
organisations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Domestic violence is beginning to be treated
in an holistic way. That is a significant move forward.&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Organisations such
as the Highland Domestic Abuse Forum are trying to reach out to the whole
of the Highlands by educating and campaigning, or rather, they would do
so if they could get sufficient funding. It is discouraging to be unable
to initiate campaigns that have long been established in other areas. O
for a zero tolerance campaign in the Highlands.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An audit of good practice throughout the
country is needed. The areas that are only now recognising the extent of
the problem need successful initiatives and encouragement. What we need
most of all is a change in public attitudes, and that can be achieved only
through public service broadcasting and through work in schools. Relationship
education is as important as health education or drugs education, and it
is a matter of great concern that around 10 per cent of teenage girls still
condone violence in a relationship.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No amount of refuge provision will stop
abusers, but a change in social attitudes will. I hope that the Scottish
Partnership on Domestic Violence will reconvene soon and that its recommendations
will be presented to Parliament as soon as possible. Domestic violence
is a cancer in our society and we must do our utmost to find a treatment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I should
be grateful if members kept their speeches to about four minutes' duration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17:09</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands)
(SNP): </strong>I whole-heartedly congratulate Maureen Macmillan on her speech.
The passion and clarity of her description of domestic violence should
make us all pause to consider this terrible problem. I welcome her last
point about public attitudes: we must find a way to get the nature of the
problem home to people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have some credentials to speak in the
debate. I served on the Westminster select committee on violence and marriage,
which was miscalled "battered wives". Hundreds of women came before us,
as well as one battered husband, who very bravely gave evidence. It is
almost always women who are battered, although not in all cases.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My second credential is as a former member
of a legal practice, which was not a posh one. I advised hundreds of battered
women in civil and criminal cases. I will mention one case of a woman who
came to see me. I could see immediately that she had been battered and
I thought that she must be over 50. She was 31 years old and her face had
no planes left, because all the bones had been broken. Domestic violence
is a terrible thing, and we do not know whether violence towards women
extends almost inevitably to the children.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The select committee
on violence and marriage was followed by another on violence and the family,
and on which Margaret Ewing served, because clearly the subject needed
to be widened. If many of the recommendations made by those select committees
had been acted on, perhaps the problem would not be as grave as it is now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Being one of the Highlands and Islands
list MSPs, I am aware of the lack of provision in the far north and west
of Scotland. We need to make more money available to create the safe haven
provided by refuges. I do not often read <i>The Sun</i>, nor do I always
believe what I read in it. However, today I read that Chancellor Brown
is sitting on a &pound;10 billion surplus because of the self-assessment
tax arrangements, which have provided more money than he expected.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need some money to tackle the problem
of domestic violence. It will not be solved entirely along the lines that
Maureen suggested-we need to spend some money on creating safe houses.
I criticise the cutting of money to citizens advice bureaux-where they
exist-because often they provide people with a port of call. As a lawyer,
I am also aware that in some places people do not even have ready access
to a legal aid lawyer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have one final significant point, which
grew out of my years of reflection on the subject, about having a roof
over one's head. I used to find that if a woman had a mother, a friend
or a sister who would take her, her problem was not so grave and she could
escape. However, that was not a possibility for many women-the mother's
house was overcrowded, or there was nowhere to go-who were stuck in their
wretchedness.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would like council house tenants to have
the right to take the tenancy and to throw out a husband who has been proven
to be violent to his wife-a battered husband would have the same right.
That would require a simple change in the law. Many tenancies are joint,
many are in the man's name, and many are in the woman's name. Legally,
the woman can put the husband out, although she often does not know how
to do it. Sometimes, I was able to help in that process. However, where
the tenancy is joint or is in the man's name, the woman is stuck. That
would be a sensible issue for the Executive to consider and it would not
require a complicated bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I appreciate very much what teachers do
when they see evidence of violence towards children. Teachers often act
as a barometer and draw problems to the attention of people who can help.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh (Central Scotland)
(Con): </strong>I am delighted to be able to speak in today's members' business
debate on domestic violence. I am grateful to Maureen Macmillan for highlighting
the work plan drawn up by the Scottish Partnership on Domestic Violence,
particularly for rural areas. Living in and representing central Scotland,
I have to say that the problem of domestic violence still pervades the
central belt.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As colleagues inform me, rural areas in
the Borders and the south of Scotland suffer acute problems that are similar
to those of the Highlands and Islands. I am thinking particularly of tied
housing-the Matrimonial Homes Acts tie the house so that a woman cannot
put her husband out. I am thinking of access to services. As has already
been said, sometimes people have to travel 100 miles to the nearest public
telephone to call for assistance-a woman who has suffered domestic violence
cannot chap a neighbour's door. Geographical isolation, the lack of housing
stock, people's attitudes and-sometimes-the response of the police, can
all be problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I should add a note of caution. Domestic
violence-as Dr Ewing mentioned-is not just men abusing women and children.
A number of women-admittedly a small number-harry and verbally and physically
abuse men. It would be wrong not to admit that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Before I became a member of this Parliament,
I sat on the bench in my district court, and I chaired the justices training
sub-committee. Part of the training was to go out and do a tour of duty
with the local police force-not just on traffic duty when we got to go
in the fast cars, but on night duty. Going out and seeing the way in which
the police do their job is not a new idea of Ian Davidson's; it is something
that we were trying to do many years ago. It would pain members to see
the sights that I saw. I came upon those scenes not because women had reported
violence themselves, but because neighbours had reported a disturbance,
gone to the home and seen women who had been battered to a pulp. It was
horrifying.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I sincerely hope that this Parliament will
address the issue of domestic violence, and I am grateful to Maureen for
bringing it to our attention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) (LD): </strong>I

in which they are funded. I will illustrate the problem with reference
to a refuge in a market town in my constituency. A letter from the manager

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The refuge gets &pound;22,000 in grants
from the local authority, out of which it pays back to the authority nearly
&pound;11,000 in rent. The letter continues:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Our main income has to be derived from
housing benefit. This has caused serious problems for us in the past as
not all families are eligible to receive this; when occupancy rates fluctuate
we have to struggle to pay even the basic expenses."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On occasion, the manager has had to wait
to receive her salary until the housing benefit money came in. That is
totally unacceptable. Last year, the refuge dealt with 146 contacts and
accommodated 30 families including 34 children, but it had to turn away
35 families.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The need is huge. There is some provision
to meet that need, but it is woefully inadequate and refuges are not funded
properly. There is an enormous amount of work to be done. We have to give
much greater commitment to it, and somehow we have to find the money to
fund refuges and to give equity of access across rural and urban areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

hide some of their scars and bruises and pretend to lead a normal life.
I have met women who have been kicked in the stomach while they were pregnant
or have had their arms broken and their ribs kicked in; and I once met
a woman who had had a lit blowtorch taken to her body.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In many ordinary homes right across the
spectrum in Scotland-"chez nous"-there are women who are no better off
than their great-grandmothers, because, like their great-grandmothers,
they have no place to go and will put up with anything just to keep a roof
over their head. I am sure that members will agree that that is totally
unacceptable in this age.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Such violence can never be tackled until
we have sufficient places of immediate refuge for those women and their
children. The most terrible scandal in this whole affair is that, in Scotland,
each year 9,000 women and their children are turned away from refuges because
of lack of places. Those 9,000 women actually believed the pledges of successive
Governments that something would be done about domestic violence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The motion quite properly concentrates
on domestic violence in rural areas, particularly the Highlands. However,
cities such as Glasgow are so short of refuge places that, in areas such
as Easterhouse, desperate Women's Aid workers have to phone round refuges
as far apart as Galloway and Inverness to find a bed for the night for
a woman and her children. Every week, 50 women from Easterhouse alone apply
for the four available places in that area. That is scandalous. In the
long term, battered women will be in a worse position because of the massive
housing stock transfer and the demolition of 15,000 Glasgow council houses.
The homeless, including battered women and their children, will suffer
more. As it is, women stay for far too long in the few refuge places available
and many children are being brought up in so-called temporary shelters
for several years at a time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last year, Helen Liddell announced that
a series of advertisements in a campaign against violence would start on
boxing day. The campaign cost the Scottish Office &pound;600,000, but not
one penny went into extra refuge places. A sum that was mere peanuts was
added later because women's groups and my party protested strongly that
we wanted substance-real money-to save those women, rather than a shadow
show on television.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have a great chance in this Parliament

of good will, so let us not blow that. What happened to the thousands of

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the recognition that women in
rural areas have received today, particularly the recognition of the difficulties
in reporting incidences of domestic violence, which is a term I prefer
to the phrase "battered women". I also recognise the problems that people
in rural areas have finding alternative accommodation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My main point relates to the effects of
domestic violence and abuse on children and young people. Quite often,
that kind of abuse cannot be seen written on children's faces. In a publication
that is about to be produced by Scottish Women's Aid, there is a piece
of writing by a child. The child wrote, "Dad makes me angry and sad. I
am sad but you can't see sad because I am smiling. I am sad inside." That
says it all and explains children's position in relation to this issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Information from Scottish Women's Aid suggests
that as many as 100,000 children might be living with the problem of domestic
abuse. Earlier, Winnie Ewing mentioned taking a pause to think about things.
I would urge people to pause for a moment and reflect on the sheer scale
of the impact of domestic abuse on children. We have responsibilities to
those children. They are not safe or secure in their own homes, but face
daily physical violence, emotional abuse or sexual abuse.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How can a child concentrate on their school
work when they have been up for half the night because of what has been
happening in their house? How can a child concentrate on their school work
when they are afraid of what is happening at home when they are not there?
How can a child risk bringing their friends home from the school when they
do not know what they will face or walk into? How does a child deal with
the well-meaning people who ask what is wrong, when they are too embarrassed
to tell? Those are the real issues that children are facing daily.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

excellent services throughout Scotland, despite their piecemeal funding.
Helen Liddell's Scottish Office campaign against domestic violence raised
expectations, as Dorothy said. The worst aspect of that was that the expectations
were not met and many of the women who subsequently phoned the helpline
were not found refuge places. It must have taken a lot to reach the stage
of being able to leave a violent relationship and make that difficult decision,
but not receiving the service they expected must have been a difficult
blow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are aware of the acute difficulties
in rural areas and the lack of refuge spaces. I would support the move
to consider that as a matter of urgency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Much has been said about physical abuse,
but I want to make a couple of comments about the psychological abuse that
many women experience. People ask why women do not leave. They do not leave
because they do not have the self-confidence left to make that decision.
We must raise those women's self-confidence and enable them to make the
decision, but we must ensure that services exist for them once they have.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab): </strong>I
too wish to congratulate Maureen on securing a debate on this important
issue. I am glad that so many people are here; this is a large attendance
for members' business and it shows the importance that we attach to the
issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Like many other members, I ask the Executive
to examine how women's aid groups are funded. There is a particular problem
in my constituency with Dumfries and District Women's Aid. The group does
a vital job, locally and nationally, and recently achieved a national profile
for its "Breaking Point" video, which not only describes the experiences
of women who have suffered domestic violence, but shows how they managed
to get out of their relationships and began to rebuild their lives. It
is important that women get the message that there are ways in which they
can get through the abusive situation and that mechanisms are in place
to support them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I should say that Dumfries and District
Women's Aid also provides support for male victims of domestic or sexual
violence. The group is not affiliated to Scottish Women's Aid; that is
true of about 15 per cent of rural women's aid groups throughout the country.
Dumfries and District Women's Aid is affiliated over the border in Carlisle
and therefore, last year, could not receive a portion of the &pound;250,000
that was distributed to local groups through Scottish Women's Aid. We should
ensure that there is a mechanism that allows all groups to get their share
of funding, because irrespective of their affiliation the job that they
do is extremely important.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Maureen said, we must recognise that
there are particular problems in rural areas such as the Highlands and
the south and south-west of Scotland. Perhaps we should consider a more
coherent way of addressing the problems of funding and giving some stability
to the rural groups.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):

does not affect just women; it affects families.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Cathy Jamieson's speech about children

of domestic violence in the home are horrendous and they carry on through
a lifetime. We hear about them all too often when cases are tried in our
courts and people relate&nbsp;</font></td>

and experiences as young children. Cathy's points were very important.
That does not undermine, in any way, the issues that Maureen has raised
today and I congratulate her on the fact that she has also raised those
issues with the Justice and Home Affairs Committee. That is another way
in which the issue will be debated well into the future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is not a new issue, but it has been
hidden under the surface for many years. Dorothy spoke about people who
wore long sleeves to hide the signs of the abuse they were experiencing.
That says something about society in the past. We should hope that we are
now moving forward and have the strength to stand up to the issues.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The solution is not all about injecting
money. It is about care and support. It is also about the way in which
the police address the issue. At the beginning of the summer, I went along
to a good conference that was organised by Strathclyde Police and heard
a wide range of contributions. The conference emphasised that the attitude
of the police in the past was perhaps to think, "Oh no, it's just another
domestic abuse situation." That attitude has changed and the seriousness
of the issue is now coming to the fore. It is great to see that forces
such as Strathclyde Police are getting to grips with this issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to highlight the fact that, in the
past, local authorities, Governments-in particular the Conservative Government-and
others have not been dead to this issue. Elaine served on South Ayrshire
Council, which replaced the Tory-led Kyle and Carrick District Council,
which treated domestic violence very seriously indeed. It introduced a
shelter in the Craigie area of Ayr, where 20 women could find shelter and
support. Part of the support is the breathing space that shelters offer:
the time for reflection, the time to gather things together again and the
time to relate to other people with the same problems. It is very important
for like-minded people who have the same experiences to come together,
particularly when we hear that all their confidence has been driven out
of them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I could go on for much longer, but the
Deputy Presiding Officer is getting impatient with me. We should think
about men as well-domestic violence sometimes happens to them, as the mother
of the house said. All the men are with her.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I
am never impatient, Mr Gallie, but I am conscious that if we keep speeches
to about three minutes everyone might be able to speak.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

important that Maureen has brought the issue to this arena. As many members
have said, if we are to assist women in situations of domestic violence,
we must make resources available. It is important that we do not raise
expectations and then fail to fulfil them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to pick up on two points Maureen
raised: the zero tolerance campaign and education. The zero tolerance campaign
has been clear that prevention should be part of the campaign. At the beginning
of this year, it launched a project called Respect, the idea of which was
to show young people that they should have respect for one another-both
young males and young females-and that they should treat one another as
civilised human beings rather than get involved in violent acts, be they
physical, mental or sexual.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The project used posters, postcards and
a great deal of literature, which was given to young people in places where
they usually go, such as youth clubs, discos and clubs in towns and cities.
However, there is still concern that the message is not getting across
and that prevention will not become part of the package. The zero tolerance
campaign has gone on to develop an education pack that includes all the
usual booklets, CD-ROMs and everything else that we have in education packs
these days. The pack is to be taken into schools. It might be more effective
in rural areas than some of the methods that have been tried in the past.
It is also designed to instil in all of us a respect for one another, a
respect that would ensure that no one, male or female, is abused in the
same way as some of the people we have heard about today. I hope that members
will join me in welcoming that progress and that, in the future, the zero
tolerance campaign will be able to distribute the pack to all schools in
Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17:39</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>I
wish to thank Maureen for initiating this debate, and to thank you, Mr
Deputy Presiding Officer, for extending the debate. I realise that, when
you were a member of the Westminster Parliament, you introduced a bill
on this issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is a very emotive issue, and I do
not want to get too emotive about it. Others have described the horrific
scenes that they have seen, and the consequences. The majority of incidents
of domestic violence involve battered women.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must take a two-step approach to this
issue. First, we need immediate action. The zero tolerance campaign has
been mentioned. The campaign raised awareness; the problem was that it
gave people hope and aspirations, but we did not follow them up with funding.
I hope that we have learned a lesson from that.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Both emotional
and financial resources are desperately needed. Local authorities fund
women's aid groups; perhaps the Parliament could consider ring-fencing
local authority funding for this purpose.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We cannot impose such a change, but we
could perhaps recommend to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities
that the funding could be ring-fenced. That way, women's aid projects could
go ahead on a long-term basis, which would give them continuity and security,
and women who approach the organisations would have something to hang onto.
They would know that the organisations will still be there in two or three
years' time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second approach is a long-term education
strategy, through schools and homes. We must introduce something like a
good citizenship scheme into schools, to teach boys and girls to see each
other as equal partners. I would like that on the curriculum. It would
go a good way towards getting people to treat each other equally. It may
take a number of years-women have had to endure violence for centuries-but
we must tackle it for this generation and for future generations. I congratulate
Maureen on raising this important subject.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Malcolm Chisholm (Edinburgh North and
Leith) (Lab): </strong>I was moved by Maureen Macmillan's speech, and I hope
that from today the Parliament will make it a priority of its first year
to develop a comprehensive strategy against violence against women. I was
brought into this issue by the zero tolerance campaign, which started in
this city, and which taught us about the three Ps, which have also been
mentioned by others.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prevention, through education, is important.
The male attitudes that lead to domestic violence, rape, child sexual abuse
and other male abuses of power must be challenged. I hope that the Scottish
Executive will involve zero tolerance from now on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Protection is also essential. That is why
we need several legislative changes, such as allowing all women, rather
than only married women, to get an interdict with power of arrest, and
such as providing specific protective measures for rape victims in court.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Provision is the third P, and the one that
has been highlighted most today. I hope that funding will be sorted out
in this year's spending round for Women's Aid and for rape crisis centres,
either by a specific central grant, or through ring-fenced local authority
budgets.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Irene Oldfather (Cunninghame South)
(Lab): </strong>Colleagues, we sit here today in a Parliament which has equality
at its core and a greater proportion of female members than any other level
of elected representation in Britain. That is why I particularly welcome
the opportunity for us to debate this motion. It is a sign that Parliament
recognises the importance of women and of combating domestic violence in
Scottish society. I choose my words carefully. The problem is a societal
one. There is a tendency for some to see the perpetrators of domestic violence
and their victims as the only parties involved. That is not so. Domestic
violence feeds off the ugliest attitudes within sections of our society
and gives those same attitudes succour. Such violence is a cycle which
can only be broken by zero tolerance, both of the act itself and of those
attitudes which undermine the equality to which we are entitled within
a just society.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It will be difficult to confront those
attitudes. A recent survey carried out by the child and women abuse studies
unit showed that more than one in two young people between 14 and 21 thought
that women provoked violence in a number of contexts, such as by the way
that they dressed. One in two boys and one in three girls thought that
there were some circumstances where it would be acceptable to hit a woman
or to force her to have sex. That these results come some 30 years after
the first equal opportunities legislation shows that a concerted effort
is required to challenge attitudes and ensure that violence towards women
is eliminated. Nothing can be more important than ensuring that a woman
can live free from fear and free from threat of violence within our society.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The change in attitudes which that requires
will not be easy to achieve and a concerted effort from people from all
walks of life will be needed. I believe that we have made an important
start here today; we have shown cross-party support. Let us hope that we
have sent a message of zero tolerance of violence against women to all
Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Aid next week to discuss legal means of protecting women, and to see what
this Parliament can do to help them.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Maureen rightly
says, there are particular problems in rural areas. For those who live
in a small village, miles from the nearest town, who rely on public transport,
and who have two toddlers in tow, it is very difficult to get away and
there is nowhere to go anyway.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is difficult to enter the debate at
this stage, because much has already been said: I just want to add my thoughts.
One of the central themes of this debate is the need for resources and
money. One of the most horrifying statistics is the fact that 9,000 women
were turned away from women's refuges last year. Those women took the decision
to make a break from their partners and we did not find them the help and
resources to do so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I saw Jack McConnell nodding his head at
Jackie Baillie: I hope that he was telling her that there will be money
for women's resources.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need safe and accessible refuges, with
the support staff, and we need dedicated police officers to deal with complaints.
We need 24-hour helplines so that women can get the help they need, particularly
in rural areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I look forward to working with Maureen
Macmillan in the Justice and Home Affairs Committee, under the convenership
of my colleague Roseanna Cunningham, to put legislation in place that will
truly protect women, but we need the resources-the money-to do that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

often left hidden and not allowed to come out into the open.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We spent some time this morning, quite
rightly, debating issues of public safety in relation to people with diagnosed
mental illnesses. Domestic violence, which, in the vast majority of cases,
is a violence which men visit upon women, is carried out by sane men against
the women whom they live with or have lived with, and they carry it out
simply because they can.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue of male victims of domestic violence
is the exception which proves the rule. In reality, most domestic violence
emerges where we find a certain kind of behaviour acceptable, where men's
and women's roles are defined in a certain way, and where it is acceptable
for men to view women in that way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

not there for them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need to examine a whole range of issues
in some detail: I want to highlight one. There is a clear issue about the
legislation in this country, some of which does a disservice to women and
undermines those who are fleeing violence. There is a clear role for the
Justice and Home Affairs Committee in scrutinising current legislation.
Representatives from the Glasgow women's support project raised one example
of that with me: the way in which the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 can
be used by male abusers of women, because of questions of access, to create
further difficulties for women fleeing violence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that the Justice and Home Affairs
Committee, with women's organisations and other organisations supporting

topic early in the life of the Scottish Parliament. I am disappointed,
however, that the usually packed press galleries are virtually empty-not
least because of the quality of the debate, but considering the seriousness
and importance of the issue that is being debated.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All of us continue to be shocked at the
extent of domestic abuse and the real and disturbing effect that it has
on children who are caught up in such violence, as Cathy has vividly described.
Domestic abuse is not peculiar to Scotland, nor is it a modern-day phenomenon.
Sadly, the problem has been rooted in society for centuries and has an
international dimension. We have an opportunity-a responsibility-to create
a climate in Scotland that will not tolerate violence, particularly within
the family circle.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am grateful to Maureen for bringing to

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">why the Scottish
Office adopted that approach in bringing together the key agencies nationally
and establishing the partnership. We have a core group of policy advisers
in the Scottish Executive that is working alongside experts in the provision
of services to victims. That group includes the police, the judiciary,
the prison service, the health service, local authorities and victims organisations.
The partnership is chaired by Anne Smith QC, and includes representatives
from Scottish Women's Aid, Scottish Rape Crisis and Victim Support Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I assure members that the Scottish Executive
gives its full support to the work of the partnership, and believes that
it will provide us with a model for making a significant impact on service
provision to victims of domestic abuse. That model will allow us to deal
better with the effect, but we must not lose sight of the need to do more
to tackle the cause. Only then can we begin to turn round the situation
and make Scotland a safer place for women.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The remit of the partnership should put
us on that course. It has been asked specifically to develop an action
plan that is firmly located in the Government's overall strategy on violence
against women. It will, for example, recommend minimum levels of service
for women who are experiencing domestic abuse, to provide a consistent
delivery of service throughout Scotland. Particular regard will be given
to the needs of women from rural areas-a point that was strongly made by
Maureen Macmillan-as well as those from ethnic minorities and the disabled.
It will also take into account the impact of domestic abuse on children
and young people. Importantly, it will consider effective strategies to
prevent male violence against female partners and their children. I am
sure that all members will agree that that is a challenging and ambitious,
but worthwhile, piece of work.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The partnership has submitted its work
plan to Scottish ministers, which sets out the time scale for the discharge
of its remit. Since then, the work plan has been issued as a consultation
document. Responses are being analysed and will be considered by the partnership
when it meets next on 27 September. I shall attend that meeting and I look
forward to seeing the partnership in action. We anticipate that a revised
work plan will be published towards the end of October.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

work of the partnership with a domestic abuse advertising campaign that

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I now address the experience of women in
rural areas, which was highlighted by Maureen Macmillan. It is clear that
women in outlying islands and other remote areas face the greatest difficulty
in gaining access to the services that are vital to their needs. I am aware
that there is no Women's Aid provision in Orkney, and that therefore no
refuge is available, although I am delighted that the council is making
positive efforts. The nearest provision of such services requires victims
to travel to Dingwall or Inverness. The picture is the same on Shetland
and the Western Isles, specialist services being available only on the
mainland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We know there are gaps in provision and
we also know there are inconsistencies in the way such services operate.
That is why the work of the partnership is so important. In terms of service
provision, the bases of statutory services are generally found at a range
of locations throughout rural areas. Nevertheless, the very size of such
areas means that many communities will be distant from outlying services.
This makes access to emergency services very difficult for women experiencing
abuse.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know that in many rural areas few local
services are provided and transport is clearly a major factor with low
levels of service, high costs and lengthy journeys. Community issues such
as lack of privacy and lack of confidentiality bring other difficulties.
I am very concerned that in some of the remote and rural communities there
is often an acceptance and tolerance of domestic abuse, often resulting
in isolation and marginalisation of those attempting to address it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am pleased that the partnership will
specifically address the very wide range of issues affecting women in rural
as well as urban areas. I expect the recommendations they submit for consideration
by Scottish ministers will be wide-ranging but practical. I am absolutely
clear in my mind that it is incumbent on all of us-local authorities, the
health service, voluntary organisations and the Scottish Executive-to get
far better co-ordination and a level of provision that is consistent with
the needs of the victims of domestic abuse.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

for many women seeking to escape. I echo the points made by&nbsp;</font></td>

a long way short of what is needed, and I agree that is essential that
those services and refuge spaces are there.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the opportunity provided by Maureen
to demonstrate the level of priority and seriousness given by the Scottish
Executive to the battle to eradicate violence against women. I am pleased
to record publicly my gratitude to the members of the partnership for their
efforts to date, and particularly my gratitude for the services provided
by Women's Aid and other voluntary and statutory organisations in dealing
with the victims of abuse. There is still much to do before Scotland can
begin to have a feeling of pride in the way it has tackled domestic abuse.
We have embarked on a challenging and ambitious future. I want this Parliament
to make a difference.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
