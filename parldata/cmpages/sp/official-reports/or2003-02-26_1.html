for Reflection</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr Murray 
Tosh): </STRONG>Good morning. Major Alan Dixon, assistant to the Scotland Secretary 
of the Salvation Army, will lead our time for reflection.</P><P><strong>Major 
Alan Dixon (Assistant to the Scotland Secretary of the Salvation Army):</strong> 
It hardly seems conceivable that I have been back in Scotland less than a month 
since my appointment to work here began at the end of January. Since coming to 
Edinburgh, life has been busy, which is the usual understatement from a person 
moving from one job to another. We have all been there; we all know what it is 
like.</P><P>Returning to Scotland&#151;returning to anything&#151;causes us to 
look back and think of the changes that have happened since we were last there. 
I have found myself thinking about some of those changes, and about the changes 
still to come in my life. There have been changes in how the Salvation Army in 
Scotland is administered. There have been changes in our social centres; we have 
had to become more professional in pursuing our aims.</P><P>There have also been 
changes in this Parliament. When I left Scotland in 1997, a Scottish Parliament 
was still a dream. People hoped for it, some even prayed for it, but now it is 
a reality. The ways of working here have changed in the short time that the Parliament 
has existed, and no doubt they will change further in future.</P><P>Change is 
part and parcel of life. As someone observed, constant change is here to stay. 
Although some people welcome change, it places us in flux, and for others it is 
a time of uncertainty.</P><P>While I was in Brussels with other Christian and 
faith leaders last week&#151;we were paying a visit to the European Parliament&#151;I 
was given a book with the intriguing title &quot;Values, Challenges and Hopes&quot;. 
That could be a summary of what we are about. We all have values that motivate 
us, challenges that form us, and hopes&#151;and, some would add, dreams&#151;that 
keep us going. That early-day Christian visionary and leader, St Paul, reminded 
one of his congregations that was facing change and uncertainty:</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18624">18624</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Health</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding 
Officer (Mr Murray Tosh): </STRONG>The next item of business is a debate on motion 
S1M-3944, in the name of Mary Scanlon, on health.</P><P>09:34</P><P><strong>Mary 
Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>First, I should like to comment 
on the Scottish Executive's amendment to the motion.</P><P>Over the past four 
years, we have been deluged by health motions congratulating the Labour and Liberal 
Democrat management of the health service. Today, the tone has changed. The amendment 
includes phrases such as &quot;concerned about waiting times&quot; and &quot;tackling 
unacceptably long waits&quot;; it also refers to looking forward to further reductions 
in the number of patients waiting longest for treatment. We all look forward to 
those reductions. The 107,382 people on the true and deferred waiting list are 
very much looking forward to a reduction in their wait. At least the failure is 
admitted; the Executive cannot argue against its own figures.</P><P>The Conservatives 
welcome the fact that the Executive now supports the strengthening of the primary 
health care sector&#151;better a sinner who repenteth. We also agree with that 
part of the amendment that congratulates staff throughout the national health 
service in Scotland on their hard work, dedication and commitment. Providing such 
a service against the odds and lacking support has to be commended.</P><P>However, 
let us be fair. What has been done? A waiting times database has been set up, 
which, according to weekend press reports, promised one wait of four weeks, but 
which takes up to 18 months. That tool to improve patient choice and to drive 
waiting times down has resulted in one Aberdeen GP saying that most people have 
looked at the website, fallen about laughing and not looked again. Inventive as 
ever, our Scottish Executive admitted that it had filled the gaps with what it 
called &quot;historic information&quot;. Historic information, in particular from 
the Tory years, might be what patients would like to see, but, after six years, 
it is time for ministers to admit the Executive's figures.</P><P>In 1999, Labour 
promised to cut waiting lists by 10,000; instead they increased by 12,000. It 
promised to end mixed-sex wards; 36 still exist at the last count. It promised 
to reduce bureaucracy, but that has increased. It promised to reduce waiting times 
for in-patient care from 12 to nine months; 6,500 people are still waiting more 
than nine months for treatment. The average waiting time to see a consultant is 
up by 12 days.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18627">18627</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Last week in Inverness, we heard that a person could wait up to 86 weeks for 
a diagnosis of diabetes. Some 7 per cent fewer patients are seen within 26 weeks. 
Bedblocking has increased by more than 1,000, and cancelled operations are up 
by 4,000. The number of beds has fallen by 637 and the number of administrators 
has risen by 1,190. The total number of out-patients who are seen is down by 9,000 
and more than 15,000 patients were turned away from surgery last year. A recent 
Audit Scotland report found that 50 per cent of wards were understaffed, and that 
money spent on bank and agency nurses had risen by £10 million.</P><P>Another 
promise was to increase heart bypass operations by at least 500; the Executive 
has managed an increase of 67. The Arbuthnott funding was welcomed in the Highlands 
until it was discovered, as I read last week, that 30 per cent of that funding 
will pay for financial deficits.</P><P>It takes amazing incompetence to spend 
£2 billion extra and achieve longer waiting lists, longer waiting times, more 
hospital-acquired infections, more rotten teeth and the worst life expectancy 
in Europe.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_9"></A>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, 
Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD): </strong>Does Mary Scanlon agree that the delivery 
of Arbuthnott, with or without the 30 per cent, is patchy in the Highlands? Some 
bits of the Highlands are doing better than others, which is a cause for concern 
for the area that we represent.</P><P><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>The main 
cause for concern is undoubtedly in the area that the member represents&#151;Caithness 
and Sutherland&#151;and Arbuthnott is very much needed there. When we read how 
much it could help, and that 30 per cent of funds has gone into balancing the 
books, people in the area have a right to feel let down.</P><P>All is not lost; 
things can get better. Indeed, the situation was getting better under the Conservatives&#151;[<em>Interruption.</em>] 
The figures speak for themselves. General practitioner fundholding empowered GPs 
in the primary care sector to offer more services nearer to the patient's home. 
More chronic disease management could be carried out for epilepsy, asthma, heart 
disease and diabetes. The Conservatives would make greater use of Scotland's community 
hospitals instead of ignoring their potential. We would give GPs the power to 
respond to the priorities of their patients rather than to centrally imposed targets 
and directives&#151;not to mention the &quot;initiative of the week&quot;.</P><P>Only 
15 per cent of GPs believe that local health care co-operatives have improved 
the quality of care; however, small practices or LHCCs could manage budgets and 
develop services if they were only given the chance. It seems incredible that 
the primary care team is expected to provide </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18628">18628</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>access to a health professional within 48 hours while a six or a 12-month wait 
for secondary care is deemed acceptable.</P><P>Moreover, given that the whole 
world is online and that IT systems in all businesses are integrated, why does 
it take four weeks for a consultant to get an asthma patient's discharge letter 
typed and sent out to the GP? A communications system has to be a priority.</P><P>By 
making more information and choice available, the Scottish Conservatives would 
empower not only GPs and the primary care team, but the patient. We should tell 
people that flu and childhood vaccines contain mercury, inform them of potential 
side effects and the efficacy of the vaccine, and let them make the choice. Empowered 
patients will soon become the most effective standards of quality. The Conservatives 
would allow patients to choose the hospital in which they wish to be treated and 
then let the money follow the patient to reward hard work and patient care. We 
would also involve NHS staff in the decision-making process.</P><P>Furthermore, 
we would let the independent sector bid to provide health care, as long as the 
quality and the price were right. However, that approach should not be used as 
a panic measure two months before an election when the waiting figures become 
an electoral embarrassment. Instead, we would put out tenders in advance, take 
advantage of economies of scale and negotiation and allow the independent sector 
to plan ahead and the patient to plan for surgery&#151;in short, there would be 
forward planning, not crisis management.</P><P>The Scottish Conservatives would 
introduce greater autonomy for hospitals to apply for foundation status. Quite 
honestly, if such a step is all right with new Labour in England, why can it not 
be introduced in Scotland? Such hospitals would continue to be part of the NHS 
and would operate as not-for-profit companies with their own directors and with 
far greater freedom to make clinical judgments. They would be able to set their 
own pay scales, borrow money and keep the proceeds of land sales. Money would 
follow the patient, which would ensure that well-run hospitals were well-funded 
hospitals.</P><P>The single budget in community care&#151;which is a measure that 
I supported throughout the passage of the Community Care and Health (Scotland) 
Act 2002&#151;would ensure that patients were appropriately cared for in accordance 
with their needs. In the Highlands, the level of bedblocking has risen for the 
past three months. At every surgery that I hold, I see more cases of families 
at their wits' end, desperate to fight the bureaucratic system that stops elderly 
parents receiving care for their needs.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18629">18629</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>As for drug and alcohol treatments, we need better integration of services 
and access to detoxification and rehabilitation facilities where needed. There 
is no point in sending patients away for a few weeks or months and telling them 
to come back when the NHS is ready. In this case, what should count is when the 
patient is ready.</P><P>Finally, according to the British Medical Association 
Scotland, Scotland's tradition of training and exporting doctors also seems to 
be at risk. Funding for better teaching facilities is needed, and more attention 
must be given to the recruitment and retention of suitably qualified academic 
staff. Furthermore, we must address the competing demands of NHS work, medical 
research and teaching commitments. The BMA has said that unless these issues are 
addressed quickly, the future training of Scotland's doctors and medical advances 
will be jeopardised.</P><P>This devolved Scottish Parliament has always been proud 
of the country's medical history and faculties. I am pleased to have brought this 
matter to the minister's attention, and I hope that he will enable doctors to 
do their job. After all, we have been so proud of that job in the past.</P><P>I 
move,</P><P>That the Parliament acknowledges that funding for the NHS in Scotland 
has continued to increase since the Parliament was established; regrets, however, 
that this increase in funding has only come about as a result of an increase in 
the tax burden imposed on everyone in Scotland and that it has not led to an improvement 
in the service for patients, who have to wait longer for treatment and face the 
prospect of being forced to go abroad to get the treatment they need in a reasonable 
time; believes that the Scottish Executive's centralising approach is not working 
because, despite the best efforts of NHS staff, the current centralised, monopoly 
system of providing healthcare wastes too much money and therefore does not result 
in an improvement in front-line patient care, and calls on the Executive to match 
the extra investment with a sustained and coherent programme of reform that builds 
on the NHS's fundamental values of high-quality healthcare available to all, irrespective 
of their ability to pay, and seeks to realise these values by putting the needs 
and expectations of patients at the heart of the service by ensuring that money 
follows patients so that they have real choice over the treatment they receive, 
creating a partnership between the NHS and the independent sector so that all 
our facilities are used to cut waiting lists and times for NHS patients and devolving 
power to GPs and local hospitals so that NHS staff have far more say in how the 
health service is run so that it responds to the real needs of patients.</P><P>09:45</P><P><strong>The 
Minister for Health and Community Care (Malcolm Chisholm): </strong>I congratulate 
Mary Scanlon on securing the debate. Indeed, it is the first debate that an Opposition 
party has called on national health issues in this parliamentary session, although 
I accept that the SNP secured a debate on health issues in Glasgow.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18630">18630</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>However, I deplore the wording of Mary Scanlon's motion for at least three 
reasons. First, the Conservatives have created a fiction in order to have something 
to attack. For example, they talk about the Executive's centralising approach. 
If they had listened to anything that I had said about health over the past 15 
months, they would know that that was a piece of fiction. Of course, there is 
a case for having such an approach, for example in relation to national standards. 
We are the first Government to have introduced national standards and inspections 
in Scotland, and are proud to have done so.</P><P>That said, I have consistently 
believed in devolving powers to ensure that NHS staff have more say in how the 
health service is run. That approach has already been well demonstrated by the 
way in which the cancer strategy has moved forward with some success over the 
past year. Indeed, the cancer world has admitted as much.</P><P>Mary Scanlon said 
that she now supports the strengthening of the primary health care sector. I refer 
her to the debate on primary care on 25 April last year, in which every word was 
about strengthening primary health care and devolving more power and resources 
to those services. In fact, we will talk about many of those themes tomorrow.</P><P>Moreover, 
Mary Scanlon said that we do not put the needs and expectations of patients at 
the heart of the service. However, those issues are at the very foundation of 
our health policy. Indeed, we have already introduced a whole series of initiatives 
that address patient focus and public involvement. That said, I accept that more 
needs to be done, and that point will form an absolutely central theme tomorrow.</P><P>Mary 
Scanlon has said that we do not support choice. If she does not listen to what 
I say in debates, perhaps she should read the detailed interview that I gave in 
<em>The Herald</em> on 31 January, in which I make it absolutely clear that I 
believe in choice. However, choice is part of a bigger picture, because what patients 
want at the end of the day are high-quality services.</P><P>Finally, Mary Scanlon 
mentioned the independent sector. Perhaps she should have noticed the announcement 
that we made last week of £5 million for orthopaedic operations in the private 
sector. Five hundred and ninety patients will be grateful for that. I should also 
point out that that is not an about-turn; I was being criticised in my first month 
in office for my willingness to use the independent sector. Indeed, I can refer 
her to those sources.</P><P><strong>Ben Wallace (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>Why 
did the minister not allow patients on the longer waiting list to exercise choice 
three years </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18631">18631</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>ago and let the NHS purchase on their behalf spaces in independent hospitals 
or from not-for-profit providers?</P><P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I have 
already answered that point. I refer Mr Wallace to what I said in December 2001. 
[<em>Interruption.</em>]</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Order.</P><P><strong>Malcolm 
Chisholm: </strong>The second reason why I object to the motion centres on its 
claim that funding for the NHS</P><P>&quot;has not led to an improvement in the 
service for patients, who have to wait longer for treatment&quot;.</P><P>The general 
charge is that the funding has not led to improvements.</P><P>Mary Scanlon accused 
me of changing my tone. I have never changed my tone; I have always said that 
there are problems, and I have been more willing than most politicians to face 
up to that fact. However, many good things and improvements are happening in the 
health service and I object fundamentally to the fact that, in her motion and 
her speech, Mary Scanlon did not acknowledge any of those. What she said does 
not accord with the experience of patients; I acknowledge that too many people 
wait too long, but the majority of patients that one speaks to have a good experience 
of the health service.</P><P>Moreover, the relentless negativity that we have 
heard once again from Mary Scanlon demoralises staff.</P><P><strong>Ben Wallace: 
</strong>Will the minister give way?</P><P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Not 
at the moment. [<em>Interruption.</em>]</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: 
</strong>Order.</P><P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I want to deal with three 
things that Mary Scanlon mentioned. Of course we still have problems with delayed 
discharge, but she knows that the figures are coming down significantly. Frank 
McAveety will probably say more about that in his closing speech.</P><P>Mary Scanlon 
also repeated an assertion about administration. However, she knows full well 
that the number of senior administrators is down because we do not have the bureaucracy 
of the Conservatives' internal market. The administration figures include ambulance 
staff and people from the blood transfusion service. Does she want to lay those 
people off as well?</P><P>Mary Scanlon also mentioned heart bypass operations. 
We know that the median waiting time for those operations has fallen from more 
than 150 days to less than 50 days. Finally, she has the brass neck to criticise 
an in-patient wait of between six and 12 months when she knows that under the 
Conservative Government patients </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18632">18632</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>waited 15 months for in-patient treatment. Obviously, I will address waiting. 
We must look at the long waiters. The figures will come out tomorrow and I invite 
Nicola Sturgeon and others to consider the long waiters, because that is who we 
are targeting.</P><P>I have been willing to admit our failings in relation to 
waiting. I am the first to admit that we have not adopted radical enough solutions 
to out-patient waiting. That is why out-patient waiting has been my top priority 
over the past few months and why the first major task of the centre for change 
and innovation is the out-patients project, which will examine the problems in 
a far more radical and fundamental way. We cannot deal with the fundamental problems 
of waiting unless we are into redesigning services and consider how to deliver 
them differently. That is precisely what we are doing, but I accept that we have 
not dealt with the matter radically enough. I have no problem admitting that.</P><P>The 
First Minister made a significant advance on waiting last week when he gave guarantees 
that go far further than the guarantee on heart surgery that has been given in 
England, which politicians have referred to in the media. We are saying that, 
by the end of this year, if someone has waited longer than nine months for their 
in-patient treatment, we guarantee that they will get the treatment in another 
hospital or in the private sector or&#151;in extreme circumstances&#151;somewhere 
else in Europe. That shows that we are confident that we can reach the targets 
that we have established for ourselves.</P><P>There have been problems with the 
database. We knew that we did not have the information. That is why the system 
is currently being piloted; it will go fully public when all the information is 
up to date. The idea of the database is still to support patient choice. It is 
a major step forward. There are teething problems; we often get bad publicity 
about teething problems. An example of such problems was a certain group of patients 
from Glasgow at the Golden Jubilee national hospital, but the reality is that 
the fundamental story of the Golden Jubilee hospital is a good one. It is exceeding 
its targets and it is treating thousands of patients who otherwise would have 
had to wait longer.</P><P>I admit freely that there are problems, but we are focused 
on dealing with them. Let us remember the success stories of the health service 
and take a balanced approach. Politicians will not do themselves any favours over 
the next two months if they take a one-sided approach to those issues. It does 
not surprise me that such an approach is taken by the Conservative party, which 
has no policies on health except to provide fewer resources and have more people 
paying for their own health care.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18633">18633</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

There is limited private capacity in Scotland. There are three times the number 
of blocked beds than private beds. Staff shortages mean that every time that a 
consultant does an operation in the private sector, they are not doing one on 
the NHS. Of course, that is not what the Tories mean by talking about a partnership 
with the private sector. The real Tory agenda is to expand the role of the private 
sector in the health service.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18634">18634</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

Eighteen years of Tory failure have been followed by six years of Labour failure. 
In many ways, this is a debate between the Conservative party and the Labour party&#151;with 
the Liberal Democrats having to take some responsibility&#151;about who has failed 
most in the health service. Waiting times are 18 days higher than they were in 
1999. The Executive insists on tinkering around the edges. The waiting times database, 
which is tinkering around the edges, is not even accurate.</P><P>The central point, 
which is missed in the Tory motion and is the point that Labour refuses to face 
up to, is that the problem in the health service is not fundamentally one of structure, 
although structural changes should be made. For example, I want to see the abolition 
of trusts, which were created by the Tories and are now redundant to the management 
of the national health service. The fundamental problem is one of undercapacity. 
There are too few beds and too few front-line doctors and nurses. There are 600 
fewer hospital beds than there were in 1999 and occupancy rates are 85 per cent 
and above. That is crisis management. The result is that wards are frequently 
closed and operations are cancelled; 15,500 operations were cancelled last year.</P><P>The 
Minister for Health and Community Care now freely admits that we have an either/or 
health service. We can have an NHS that can deal with emergency admissions or 
one that can deal with planned admissions; we cannot have one that can do both 
to the standard that is required to meet demand. We need a planned approach to 
beds; that would start with a national review, the kind of exercise that is already 
carried out in England, the Republic of Ireland and Wales, to name a few.</P><P>The 
Minister for Health and Community Care crows about a record number of nursing 
posts. He ignores the fact that posts do not treat patients&#151;nurses treat 
patients. Three per cent of nursing posts are currently vacant.</P><P><strong>Malcolm 
Chisholm </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18635">18635</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>I am in my last minute.</P><P>Vacancies are 
at an all-time high, but the Executive refuses to deal with the problem. Nurses 
are leaving the NHS; some 2,500 have left the health service to go to England 
or further afield since 1997. We need a solution here in Scotland to deal with 
that. That is why I say that there should be an 11 per cent pay rise for nurses 
to reward them better and to give Scotland the competitive edge in nurse recruitment 
that we so badly need.</P><P>Let us have less rhetoric from the Tories and fewer 
excuses from Labour. There must be a focus on the core problems in the health 
service and some solutions to tackle them. That is what the SNP offers.</P><P>09:58</P><P><strong>Mrs 
Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West) (LD): </strong>I am pleased that Mary Scanlon 
at least acknowledges that the Scottish Executive is increasing investment in 
the NHS and our country's health. The health budget has risen from £4.6 billion 
in 1998 to £6.7 billion this year. The 1 per cent increase in national insurance 
that will be levied from April will fund unprecedented spending&#151;£8 billion 
will be spent on Scotland's health in 2005-06.</P><P>I agree that the increased 
investment must be seen to deliver real and sustained improvement and change. 
There must be a new emphasis on long-term health improvement, a greater emphasis 
on patient choice and the patient's voice, an end to restrictive working practices, 
better use of technology and a streamlined service that is stripped of unnecessary 
bureaucracy. Decision making should be devolved to front-line staff as much as 
possible and the service should put the rights and responsibilities of patients 
at its heart.</P><P>The Liberal Democrats believe in increased investment in the 
NHS and in Scotland's health; it is clear that the Tories do not. The record investment 
over the next few years would not have been available had the Tories been in power. 
On health, as on so many other matters, the Tories are out of step with the people 
of Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon is right the Tory motion is a Trojan horse. It is 
not honest about what the Tories really want to do to the health service. They 
want to privatise it&#151;not to improve patient care, but to increase private 
profit.</P><P>The Liberal Democrats took an honest approach at the last general 
election. We believe in public services and believe that those services need to 
be paid for. People care about the NHS. I am happy to defend that position, because 
we will make a difference to people's health. That is what my constituents and 
other members' constituents want.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18636">18636</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The NHS needs to invest in more than bricks and mortar; it must invest in equipment 
and staff and it must highlight health in a more general sense. Health improvement 
and illness prevention are central to Liberal Democrat thinking on health. It 
is a pity that, in the motion, the Tories are as usual concentrating on short-term 
results and issues, such as opening up the Scottish health service to the independent 
sector. The motion does not even mention the need for wider health promotion. 
I am glad that Mary Scanlon mentioned drug and alcohol treatments, but this country's 
health suffers as a result of two decades of neglect by the Tory party, which 
has been more interested in the internal market than in patient care.</P><P>The 
Liberal Democrats believe that the Scottish Executive is right not only to concentrate 
on the NHS, but to invest in health promotion and in measures to tackle health 
inequalities. We look forward to focusing on the action to improve health that 
will be outlined in the white paper that is due out tomorrow.</P><P>We applaud 
the Executive's healthy living campaign, which was launched in January. We also 
applaud the introduction of nutritional standards for school meals and the scheme 
for free fruit in schools in particular. Healthy living and a healthy diet are 
habits and it is important that we give such habits to our children when they 
are young, particularly if we want to tackle the problem of childhood obesity. 
The message is clear. If we invest in the diet of our children today, we will 
save in the long run through reduced levels of coronary heart disease, stroke, 
cancer and diabetes.</P><P>We need to balance investment with reform and we need 
to target resources. It is important that we invest properly in the NHS so as 
to reward innovation, to encourage the effective redesign of services&#151;with 
full clinical and patient input&#151;and to enforce clinical standards.</P><P>Yesterday, 
the Health and Community Care Committee heard that the Scottish intercollegiate 
guidelines network guidelines on epilepsy are being put into practice in four&#151;</P><P><strong>Ben 
Wallace </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></P><P><strong>Mrs Smith: </strong>Who are 
you? I will not take an intervention.</P><P>It is obvious that staff are at the 
heart of an improved service. Recently, there has been a nurses' settlement and 
there have been deals to begin to tackle low pay. In the past week, an announcement 
has been made about the new GP contract that has been agreed between the BMA's 
general medical practitioners committee and the NHS Confederation. If the contract 
is accepted, it will be accompanied by substantial additional resources for the 
development of primary care </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18637">18637</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>services. Payment will be linked to the quality of care that is provided to 
patients&#151;that should go a long way towards ending the current disincentives 
in the system, whereby those who provide extra clinics and services that improve 
patient care and ease the burden on the secondary health sector often find themselves 
penalised for doing so.</P><P>It is important that the contract links investment 
to the specific health needs of local communities rather than involving simple 
payments to doctors in the old one-size-fits-all approach. We want a scheme that 
rewards incentive and innovation. The primary care sector delivers 90 per cent 
of this country's health care and has a similar satisfaction rating. People believe 
that their GPs and other practice staff are doing a good job. The new contract 
will assist the primary health care team to expand its role even further and I 
hope that Scotland's doctors will accept it.</P><P>It is right to focus on the 
wider health picture and the primary care arena, but it is also important that 
we continue to invest in the acute sector. We agree that the patient should be 
at the heart of NHS decision making and that what is best for the patient should 
be the driving force behind investment. The delivery of patient care is more important 
than who delivers it. Therefore, we welcome the recent announcement that the Executive 
is putting a further £5 million into an initiative to provide 590 orthopaedic 
operations for NHS patients in private hospitals. I know that my constituents 
will welcome the £680,000 that is earmarked for Lothian.</P><P>Malcolm Chisholm 
has been refreshingly frank today about waiting times, as he has been in the past, 
and we welcome the First Minister's recent comments on the matter. We are not 
saying that there are no problems in the NHS. However, through the waiting times 
initiatives, the national waiting times unit, the delayed discharged action plan 
and other initiatives, we believe that the Scottish Executive is on the right 
track to improve our country's health care. Many of the approaches that I have 
outlined will not be delivered overnight, but that does not mean that we are not 
right to take forward a health agenda that is wide in its scope and focuses increasingly 
on the patient.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Eight members 
wish to speak in the open debate. They may all speak if members are disciplined 
about sticking to the four minutes that they are allocated.</P><P>10:04</P><P><strong>Alex 
Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>It is nice to see a Tory motion 
again provoking vociferous debate in the Scottish Parliament. It takes the issue 
of health to get temperatures up in the Parliament and I am delighted that that 
is </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18638">18638</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>again happening, especially when we consider the performance of the Minister 
for Health and Community Care, who is not in the chamber at the moment.</P><P>In 
dealing with the motion, the minister was on the defensive from start to finish. 
He admitted his guilt in respect of all Mary Scanlon's accusations and accepted 
his responsibility for virtually all the bad figures that were quoted. He realises 
only now&#151;with an election staring him in the face&#151;that the time has 
come to try to address those figures.</P><P>We need to consider seriously what 
we should do. Mary Scanlon made a positive speech in which she outlined Conservative 
policy and what the Conservatives would do&#151;many others can be criticised 
for not outlining their policies on the subject. Her proposals would genuinely 
increase the performance of the health service.</P><P>I am prepared to defend 
issues such as the internal market as an important part of the Conservatives' 
contribution to the health service. However, the issue that is most often raised 
with me is GP fundholding. GPs would like to return to that system, if possible. 
Local health care co-operatives have resulted in the centralisation of power in 
larger groups and the removal of powers from individual GPs. Malcolm Chisholm 
would deny that such centralisation has happened, but it has. GPs want that power 
back and we want to consider policies that will deliver it.</P><P>Mary Scanlon 
went to great lengths to explain our policy on hospitals, including the establishment 
of foundation hospitals. What she said is not new, even to the Labour party&#151;I 
am talking about Labour party policy south of the border. The potential for improving 
health provision in Scotland and the Labour party's policy in the south have been 
ignored in the dogmatic pursuit of what we can only describe as a pre-1979 attitude 
to health care provision.</P><P>On policy, we heard something from Malcolm Chisholm 
and we heard a great deal from Mary Scanlon, but we heard absolutely nothing from 
the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon criticised our policy and Labour's policy, but she did 
not say what SNP policy was. The SNP was not even prepared to submit an amendment 
to the motion. It makes the naive assumption that mair tax will inevitably result 
in better provision and that independence will solve all Scotland's ills, but 
we cannot accept that naivety any longer.</P><P><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles (West 
Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Alex 
Johnstone: </strong>I am afraid that I cannot, as I am coming to the end of my

<P><strong>Alex Johnstone: </strong>I cannot accept even a friendly intervention.</P><P>It 
is absolutely essential that we accept the need for greater autonomy for hospitals. 
We should allow them to apply for foundation status so that they can set their 
own pay and conditions and plan on their own behalf in response to local demand. 
That would be particularly helpful in recruiting doctors, nurses and other NHS 
staff. The minister identified problems in that respect.</P><P>We would create 
a partnership between the NHS and the independent sector so that all our facilities 
were used to cut waiting lists and waiting times in the NHS. That would not be 
a desperate response and a desperate measure that resulted simply from the proximity 
of the forthcoming election.</P><P>10:08</P><P><strong>Janis Hughes (Glasgow Rutherglen) 
(Lab): </strong>Yet again, I am truly staggered by the fact that the Tories have 
chosen to debate the health service. I cannot believe that Mary Scanlon and the 
Conservatives have not realised after four years that they are skating on thin 
ice. For a representative of a party that almost decimated our health service 
over 18 years to tell us that the Government's initiatives have not led to an 
improvement in the service is just gross hypocrisy.</P><P>The Conservative motion 
states that the NHS should have</P><P>&quot;far more say in how the health service 
is run&quot;.</P><P>When the Conservatives were in power, they thought that NHS 
staff amounted to doctors and nurses and they forgot that other NHS staff should 
have had a say in how the service was run. The Conservatives privatised the jobs 
of those staff and it is hypocritical of them to come to the chamber and say that 
NHS staff should have</P><P>&quot;far more say in how the health service is run&quot;.</P><P>I 
worked in the NHS for 18 years under Tory rule&#151;I am fed up with saying that 
in the chamber&#151;and believe in quality health care for all. I believe in a 
system that is free at the point of delivery and that caters for everyone in our 
society, regardless of ability to pay. I believe in the NHS and am proud to belong 
to a party that believes in it. The Tories do not believe, will not believe and 
have never believed in the NHS.</P><P>I am glad that the motion struck one positive 
note, in acknowledging that the Executive is investing record amounts in the NHS. 
Thanks to Labour's sound management of the economy and our commitment to public 
services, the NHS has never been in better shape financially&#151;in sharp contrast 
to the lean years under the Tories. However, Nicola Sturgeon is right to say that 
the issue is not just about money.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18640">18640</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>Will the member 
give way?</P><P><strong>Janis Hughes: </strong>I am sorry, but the Conservative 
party has nothing to say on this matter. I have heard it all.</P><P>I am only 
too willing to accept that we must ensure that reform takes place. Such reform 
is necessary because of the mess in which the Tories left us when the people of 
this country decided that enough was enough.</P><P>Mary Scanlon may remember that 
in last year's debate on the health service we focused on reform of the NHS. The 
Parliament heard how we are reforming the NHS by improving accountability and 
governance, working to reduce waiting times and improving choice for patients. 
Malcolm Chisholm was honest in saying that we have not got things right yet and 
are still working on them. However, when the Tories were in power, they did not 
manage to do the things that I have mentioned.</P><P>Would the Tories have tried 
to bring the Healthcare International hospital at Clydebank into the NHS? Of course 
not. It is infinitely more likely that they would have dispatched NHS hospitals 
to the private sector, which they believe in doing.</P><P>We must give credit 
to the Executive for daring to think outside the box. The decision to purchase 
the HCI hospital in Clydebank to create a national waiting list centre was bold, 
but I hope that time will show it to have been correct. Similarly, our commitment 
to reducing waiting times through the creation of ambulatory care and diagnostic 
centres or by allowing people to be treated in other health board areas is a welcome 
step&#151;much more welcome than anything that we have ever heard from the Tories.</P><P>I 
defy anyone to condemn the £700 million investment in Greater Glasgow NHS Board, 
which will lead to major changes in service provision across Glasgow. Although 
change is never welcomed by everyone, if we are to modernise and to continue to 
improve the NHS, change is necessary.</P><P>To be fair, the Tories tried to change 
the NHS. They introduced the internal market, which ushered in the two-tier health 
service and destroyed staff morale. I was one of the staff whose morale was destroyed 
during that time. The Tories' current planned reforms are all aimed at bringing 
about what even Margaret Thatcher could not achieve&#151;the destruction of the 
NHS and the proliferation of private health care. I will not take any lessons 
from the Tories on how to reform the NHS.</P><P>The Executive has a good story 
to tell&#151;of eight new hospitals built, of more doctors and of more </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18641">18641</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>nurses. As I have said many times, we are not complacent. Everything in the 
garden is not rosy, but it is certainly much rosier than it was during the dark 
Tory years. For that, we should all be thankful.</P><P>10:12</P><P><strong>Colin 
Campbell (West of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I am delighted that Malcolm Chisholm's 
amendment indicates that he is concerned about waiting times for out-patients. 
Recently, I was involved with the case of one out-patient, Audrey Doig, who has 
allowed her name to be used in this debate. She wanted to have a minor operation 
at the Victoria hospital. On arriving there, she&#151;along with eight or nine 
others&#151;was told that there were no beds and that she would have to be invited 
back to have the operation. She then wrote a number of letters, including to Malcolm 
Chisholm, who replied to her.</P><P>Audrey Doig was told that there was no guarantee 
that when she turned up for her next appointment she would be dealt with. Imagine 
her shock and horror when she was again told that there were no beds. On the third 
occasion, she was admitted, but she tells me that three or four other people who 
had operations scheduled for that day were not.</P><P>Audrey Doig's experience 
inspired me to ask the Minister for Health and Community Care how many operations 
had been cancelled at a day's or a week's notice in Scotland in the past 12 months. 
In his answer, the minister indicated that, unfortunately,</P><P>&quot;Information 
on the number of operations cancelled by NHSScotland is not available.&quot;</P><P>That 
is an interesting piece of information. He continued:</P><P>&quot;However, data 
is collected centrally on the number of planned admissions to hospital for in-patient/day 
case treatment&quot;.&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Written Answers</em>, 
18 February 2003; p 3015.]</P><P>Up to March last year, more than 16,000 admissions 
were cancelled. In the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area, 791 admissions to the 
Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley, 121 admissions to the Vale of Leven district 
general hospital and 173 admissions to Inverclyde royal hospital were cancelled. 
The problem is a lack of beds. In the case of the Victoria hospital, where Audrey 
Doig was treated, out-patients were being kept out by emergencies, which must 
have priority. Every day the hospital deals with an average of nine emergencies. 
Why is there no provision for that? There are insufficient beds and staff.</P><P>The 
median waiting time for out-patients in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area is 
45 days. That is five days more than the median out-patient waiting time in the 
area when the Executive was </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18642">18642</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>established in June 1999. The median waiting time for in-patients is 34 days, 
which is two days more than in 1999. Altogether, the median waiting time for a 
patient living in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area is 79 days, which is seven 
days more than the median waiting time when the Executive was established in 1999. 
There are problems with waiting times, which I know the Executive wants to address.</P><P>Two 
of the 10 national vacancies in paediatrics are in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board 
area. A work force shortage prompted the closure of maternity services at the 
Vale of Leven district general hospital in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area. 
That measure was very contentious, because maternity provision is being reviewed 
in the whole health board area, and it probably caused a great deal of anxiety.</P><P>There 
are currently 100.3 whole-time equivalent nurse vacancies that have been vacant 
for more than three months in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area. In 1999, there 
were 78.5 such vacancies. In 1997 there were only 33.3 vacancies that had been 
vacant for more than three months. The number of such vacancies has increased 
by 67 per cent since the Labour party came to power in the UK. Last year, Argyll 
and Clyde NHS Board spent £2.5 million on the whole-time equivalent of 101.5 nurses&#151;presumably 
agency nurses&#151;which is slightly more than the figure for nurse vacancies. 
That money would have been far better spent on filling the NHS vacancies.</P><P>The 
problem is one of beds and people. Much of the NHS is excellent. Emergency and 
acute services are excellent. However, until we solve the bed and staffing problem, 
there will be unnecessary, uncalled-for and unwanted criticism of the NHS. For 
the benefit of Conservative members, who think that we are naive, the SNP would 
increase nurses' pay by 11 per cent.</P><P>10:17</P><P><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles 
(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): </strong>I welcome the debate. Everyone 
seems to accept that more money than ever is available to the NHS. In particular, 
I welcome Malcolm Chisholm's pragmatic approach to bringing down unacceptable 
waiting times in Scotland.</P><P>The Tories cannot pretend that more resources 
are needed for health but at the same time advocate tax cuts. Clearly, that is 
a dishonest approach. The Tories are completely out of step with the people of 
Scotland on the NHS.</P><P>In the short time that is available to me, I would

<P>addressing the major problems of the NHS. However, in the past four years I 
have pursued two specific issues.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Health 
and Community Care (Mr Frank McAveety): </strong>Arbuthnott.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Rumbles: </strong>I am not talking about the Arbuthnott formula. I had a go at 
the Arbuthnott formula in the previous health debate.</P><P>The first issue is 
audiology. I have with me a letter from Susan Deacon dated 28 April 2000. In it, 
she stated:</P><P>&quot;Digital hearing aids are already available on the NHS 
in Scotland and we have just widened the choice available to patients by introducing 
further types of aid as from 1 April this year ... England and Wales ... are taking 
a rather different approach and have decided to pilot the use of digital aids 
in certain areas before deciding how to roll out their provision.&quot;</P><P>I 
thought that that was interesting. The minister continued:</P><P>&quot;we are 
taking a very pro-active approach to the provision of this kind of equipment for 
patients in Scotland&quot;.</P><P>I will also quote from a letter from the chief 
executive of the Grampian University Hospitals NHS Trust. He states:</P><P>&quot;I 
regret that currently we are not able to fund digital hearing aids ... we in this 
Health Board area cannot provide the digital aids despite them being available 
on NHS contract.&quot;</P><P>That letter was written nearly three years ago, but 
the situation has not improved, to the extent that patients are still not being 
given the digital hearing aids that they should be entitled to receive. I accept 
the points that Mary Mulligan has made in correspondence with me and that the 
Executive has allocated money for that purpose. After £8 million for digital hearing 
aids was announced recently, I asked Grampian NHS Board when patients in its area 
would be able to access the digital hearing technology to which they should be 
entitled. I have still received no response. I need an answer from the minister; 
I need to know what the minister will do to ensure that my constituents get the 
treatment and the facilities that they need and deserve.</P><P>In the 60 seconds 
that I have left, I will flag up the other specific health issue that needs to 
be examined&#151;access to NHS dentistry. That is a major issue. The situation 
in the north-east of Scotland is worse than it is almost anywhere else.</P><P><strong>Mary 
Scanlon: </strong>What about Highland?</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>I said 
&quot;almost anywhere else&quot;.</P><P>Many of my constituents cannot get access 
to NHS dentistry. I know that many initiatives have been launched to make money 
available for </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18644">18644</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>improving NHS dental services. There is disagreement about the fundamental 
problem, which is that, since the closure of the dental school in Edinburgh, not 
enough dentists are being trained in Scotland. We need a new dental school.</P><P>In 
September, I was the first person in the Parliament to call for a new dental school 
to be established in the north-east&#151;in Aberdeen, for example. That would 
attract trained dentists to provide training in the north-east. Those dentists 
would be able to establish businesses and practices in that area. That is one 
of the only effective ways of ensuring that we make progress on the issue.</P><P>Although 
the Executive has produced money and initiatives, there are simply not enough 
dentists. Training 120 a year is not sufficient. As I am running out of time, 
I will close on that point. I hope that Mr McAveety will address those two issues 
in his wind-up.</P><P>10:21</P><P><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) 
(Con): </strong>Malcolm Chisholm accused the Conservatives of a one-sided approach 
to health care. We are guilty of such an approach&#151;we put the patients first.</P><P>There 
has been a great amnesia over the past six years, not least from members such 
as Janis Hughes. Time after time, statistics that the NHS and the minister produce 
demonstrate that life is now worse under Labour. According to the SNP's statistics, 
life has got even worse since Labour was joined by the Liberal Democrats. We can 
rest our case. I thank Colin Campbell for his statistics. They were most helpful.</P><P>Lots 
of extra money&#151;£2 billion&#151;has gone into the health service. That is 
welcome. However, the opportunity has been wasted. Improvement without reform 
is not possible. There is no point in throwing money at systems that the staff 
do not like.</P><P>Staff morale is low. I spent Monday evening at a state registered 
nurse hustings. The SRNs told us how it was. The plain fact of life is that it 
is impossible to recruit and retain anyone in the health service. There is a shortage 
of GPs and dentists in the north-east. Why cannot they be attracted? The answer 
is that they are not given good conditions to work under and they are not given 
control over the health service. Devolution does not go beyond Executive ministers. 
Devolution does not exist outside the Executive offices.</P><P>If we want to set 
the system free to serve the patients, we should give the health boards </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18645">18645</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>responsibility. They should be accountable. They should design the services 
that are best suited to their areas. They should flag up where their priorities 
lie. It is impossible to legislate through targets on this, that and the next 
thing.</P><P>We should look at the health service rationally. We should ask, &quot;Who 
has the skill? How can we best use that? How will that improve patient care?&quot; 
Surely it is better to employ an expert nurse in asthma in a doctor's surgery, 
where she can deal with asthma in the community. Primary care is where the effort 
has to go. We must also deal with bedblocking. The use of the independent voluntary 
sector is a good way of doing that.</P><P>We would not have poured money into 
buying the building at HCI; we would have spent the money on commissioning care 
from the NHS services there. The health service can be a commissioning service. 
It does not have to own everything and it does not have to be nationalised, as 
the SNP would have us believe. It is a case of putting the patient first and saying 
simply, &quot;We have this resource. We want people to be able to access health 
care wherever they are, according to their need.&quot; Let us face it&#151;the 
most important patient is the patient who next presents. It is nothing to do with 
who has cancer and who has toothache. Everyone has a right to appropriate treatment 
in a reasonable time.</P><P>The Labour party has had four years in the Executive, 
plus the two preceding years at Westminster, to get a grip. It has failed to design 
the right system and to get the people who work in the health service on side. 
Those people must be consulted, they must be given a career path and they must 
have access to continuing professional development. In the north-east, for example, 
there are no facilities for giving dentists their practical training once they 
have done their degree. There is no money to bring in European Union dentists 
to give them that training. Such a fund does not exist. Although a new dental 
school in Aberdeen might be a solution in the long term, we are short of dentists 
now.</P><P>Why are we not playing at golden hellos, as the health authorities 
in England are? If we cannot get radiographers in Highland or in Aberdeen, why 
do we not find an efficient way of attracting them? Why do we not break down national 
pay bargaining and allow the health boards to set the levels of pay that they 
consider necessary to attract and retain people?</P><P>The health service must 
become accessible throughout Scotland. Access must not be determined by postcode 
and it most certainly should not be twisted by the Arbuthnott formula. If Glasgow 
has a problem, the minister should fix it, but he should not take money from the 
north-east of Scotland to do so.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18646">18646</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>10:26</P><P><strong>Mr Duncan McNeil (Greenock and Inverclyde) (Lab): </strong>I 
suppose that the law of averages dictates that, in such a long motion, Mary Scanlon 
was bound to make a good point sooner or later. She is right that we need to get 
the record amounts of money that we are spending on health to the front line as 
quickly as possible. She is right that a modern NHS must, in the words of the 
motion, respond to</P><P>&quot;the real needs of patients&quot;</P><P>and, like 
many of my colleagues and me, she is right not to be convinced that the centralisation 
of services will deliver that. However, it is beyond me how a Tory could speak 
to those points with a straight face. The Tories have been unable to keep a straight 
face this morning.</P><P>I wonder whether any other members choked on their cornflakes 
when they read in yesterday's business bulletin a Tory motion extolling the virtues 
of</P><P>&quot;the NHS's fundamental values of high-quality healthcare available 
to all, irrespective of their ability to pay&quot;.</P><P>Although I could go 
on at length about 18 years of Tory neglect&#151;and would be justified in doing 
so&#151;attacking the Tories' record on the NHS is like shooting fish in a barrel, 
as my colleagues Malcolm Chisholm and Janis Hughes showed.</P><P>The motion deals 
with impacts on service delivery. That is a fundamental issue, whether the Tories 
realise it or not. There are many answers to the question, but I will focus on 
what affects service delivery in my area.</P><P>We have guidelines from the royal 
colleges, European working time directives and a reduction in junior doctors' 
hours. The working time directives and the reduction in junior doctors' hours 
mean that, in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area alone, we need to recruit 25 
consultants and even more junior doctors.</P><P><strong>Alex Johnstone: </strong>Will 
the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Mr McNeil: </strong>The member 
has had a full morning's debate and I have limited time.</P><P>That level of recruitment 
is necessary not to extend the service, but simply to maintain it. Those major 
challenges must be addressed.</P><P>The guidelines focus on certain disciplines 
and address risk in very small areas. Striving to reduce such risk means that 
we constantly chase the impact on the other services, which pushes us towards 
more centralisation.</P><P>In practice, that has meant that, in Argyll and Clyde, 
we have witnessed the closure of the maternity unit at the Vale of Leven hospital, 
for the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18647">18647</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>want of paediatric cover. That closure, which took place without consultation 
with the local community, has forced mothers and young babies to travel further 
for care. That has happened in spite of the massive amount of investment that 
we are injecting.</P><P>Like many hospitals outside the cities, the Rankin maternity 
unit in my constituency has found it difficult to recruit appropriate staff numbers. 
It has to compete with university-led services in the cities. That is another 
example of the push towards centralisation that we must resist. Despite the fact 
that the number of consultants at the Rankin maternity unit has increased, there 
is once again a shortage of paediatric cover, which has threatened the unit and 
put it only days away from closure during the past year.</P><P>Finally, I want 
to mention health board boundaries. Lines on a map are not recognised by my constituents 
or by many others. We do not see a sufficient amount of working together among 
the health boards. I contend that only by using common sense and by applying flexibility 
will we ensure that the massive investment that we are putting into the health 
service improves and is seen to improve patient care.</P><P>10:30</P><P><strong>Brian 
Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I do not often agree with Duncan McNeil, 
but I agree with his analysis of the situation. Large parts of the additional 
funding are having to be taken up to address matters that are beyond the control 
of the NHS, and may even be beyond the control of the Executive. That highlights 
the fact that we cannot expect miracles overnight. Anyone who suggests otherwise 
is deceiving themselves, let alone the public. A big part of the additional finance 
will need to go on problems such as those that Duncan McNeil detailed concerning 
consultant staff and junior medical staff. We will not be able to pour all the 
additional resources into addressing the problems of patients, because we need 
to deal with the long-standing problems such as the number of hours that people 
work.</P><P>Mike Rumbles has already highlighted the problems with digital hearing 
aids and dentists in my local area. David Davidson acknowledged those problems 
and highlighted the problems associated with the Arbuthnott formula. I want to 
highlight the fact that waiting times in Grampian, like those for the area that 
Colin Campbell represents, have increased. The median waiting time for out-patients 
in Grampian is now 69 days, which is 10 days longer than the national average. 
Before the Parliament came into existence, our waiting time was below the national 
average. That change reflects the shift in resources away from </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18648">18648</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Grampian. We used to have services that were among the best in Scotland, but 
our services are now amongst the poorest in Scotland.</P><P>The out-patient waiting 
time is 18 days longer than it was when the Executive took power in June 1999. 
The in-patient median waiting time is now 34 days, which is six days longer than 
was the case in June 1999. The median wait in total for a patient waiting in Grampian 
is now 103 days. That is nine days higher than the national average and 24 days 
longer than patients in Grampian waited when the Executive took over in 1999. 
There has been a significant deterioration in service over the past four years 
in spite of the additional resource, which is clearly not being spent on addressing 
patient needs.</P><P>In the last quarter, the number of out-patients seen was 
82,022. That is the lowest number in any quarter since December 1998. That is 
also 6,727 fewer patients than were seen when the Executive took over in 1999. 
Not as many out-patients are being seen. In the last quarter, the number of day 
cases was 4,811, which is the lowest number since December 1998 and 1,803 fewer 
than when the Executive took over in June 1999.</P><P>Clearly, there are capacity 
issues in the health service. Yes, the HCI hospital has been bought over, but 
we are still using sticking-plaster solutions because of the deliberate policy 
of reducing capacity within the NHS acute sector. Some of that is clearly driven 
by the Executive's perceived need to deliver all health service improvements through 
the private finance initiative and public-private partnerships. Capacity reduction 
is a direct consequence of the PFI/PPP approach to improvements in the quality 
of bricks and mortar within the NHS.</P><P>We have significant nursing vacancies 
in the north-east. At present, the north-east has 258.1 whole-time equivalent 
vacancies for nurses, which is an all-time high since 1996. In 1999, Grampian 
had only 178.6 whole-time equivalent vacancies for nurses. The increase in vacancies 
has been greater than 30 per cent during that period. Indeed, the problem is not 
simply that turnover of nurses is being used in the short term as a way of managing 
an NHS overspend, because 55 nursing posts&#151;a fifth of the vacancies&#151;have 
been vacant for more than three months. Either Grampian is simply unable to recruit 
more nurses or the vacancies are being used to manage finances.</P><P>There are 
serious problems that are not being addressed. However, the Tory motion's approach, 
which says that the private sector is the answer, is not the answer at all. There 
simply is not the capacity and we need to be realistic about what we can do in 
the near future.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18649">18649</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>10:35</P><P><strong>Mr John McAllion (Dundee East) (Lab): </strong>The Tory 
motion admits that spending on the NHS has progressively increased since 1999, 
but it goes on to regret that the extra spending has been brought about by an 
increase in the tax burden imposed on everyone. The first point to be made is 
that any increase in the direct tax burden on Scots is certainly not the responsibility 
of this Parliament or Executive. For the past four years, the Parliament has refused 
to use the tax-varying power that the voters gave it in the 1991 referendum.</P><P>In 
any case, there are only two ways of increasing spending on the NHS or on any 
other public service. The first way is through growth in Government revenues that 
is brought about by rapid economic growth, falling unemployment, increased tax 
yields, reduced social security benefits and so on. That is the classic trickle-down 
theory, which President Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major preached for 
so many years. I know from direct experience of living through that period that 
that approach has not worked, does not work and will not work.</P><P>The only 
other way of increasing spending on the NHS is through increased taxation. Unlike 
the Tories, who complain about that at the UK level, my complaint is that we have 
not sufficiently increased taxation on the rich. We should take more off the rich 
and spend more on public services. That is the way in which we will get improved 
public services in this country.</P><P><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland 
and Fife) (Con): </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Mr 
McAllion: </strong>Sorry, I do not have time, but I will debate with Brian Monteith 
outside at any time.</P><P>My belief is that we do not have enough resources. 
The yardstick should not be how much we spend on the national health service now 
as compared with the pre-devolution period&#151;</P><P><strong>Mary Scanlon </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></P><P><strong>Mr 
McAllion: </strong>Sorry, but I do not have time.</P><P>The yardstick should not 
even be how much we spend now compared to what was spent by the previous Tory 
Government in those dark days of long ago. The yardstick should be how much we 
spend compared with what is actually needed to provide patient care at the level 
that the people of Scotland desire.</P><P>For example, the Executive's short-life 
action group on ME recently produced its report, which makes recommendations. 
ME is not a new illness. As the &quot;Report of the Short Life Working Group on 
CFS/ME&quot; diplomatically puts it,</P><P>&quot;This burden of illness is not 
well recognised at present&quot;.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18650">18650</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>In other words, the illness has been ignored for years. There is an appalling 
lack of provision for ME sufferers in this country.</P><P>The SLAG report makes 
a number of useful recommendations. It calls for needs assessment programmes and 
for each health board to develop forward plans for ME sufferers in their area. 
The report also calls for a tiered approach, so that we have primary care and 
specialist services and a regional or national service above that. The Executive 
working group makes some excellent recommendations, but they are just that. The 
responsibility for delivering the changes in the way that we deal with this illness, 
which is not new but has at long last been recognised, will be left with the health 
boards. However, the money that the health boards receive is already fully committed, 
so the money for implementing the report's recommendations will need to be found 
by taking it away from other services that are currently being funded.</P><P>No 
Government in a long time has ever spent enough on public services. We need to 
tell the people of this country the truth. The basic truth is that we do not spend 
enough on public services because we do not tax people in this country enough. 
Any party that goes into the election saying that enough money can be spent on 
public services to meet public demand while at the same time keeping taxes low 
is being dishonest. The real test of the forthcoming election is the question 
where we will get the revenues from to increase the spending on public services. 
The only real place that we can get it from is taxes. I hope that that is taxes 
on the rich rather than taxes on the ordinary workers.</P><P><strong>The Presiding 
Officer (Sir David Steel): </strong>We now come to wind-up speeches.</P><P>10:39</P><P><strong>Mr 
Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD): </strong>I will start 
by referring briefly to the main speakers for the four parties.</P><P>Quite correctly, 
Mary Scanlon referred to Arbuthnott. I am gratified that she agreed with me that, 
despite the best intentions of the Scottish Executive, delivery out there is somewhat 
patchy. As I mentioned in my intervention, in the Highlands despite the money 
that is going into the front end, what comes out at the other end varies depending 
on which part of the Highlands one is in.</P><P>Malcolm Chisholm made a robust 
speech and at one point Nicola Sturgeon said that she was thinking about holding 
the jackets. He rebutted the accusation that the Scottish Executive is taking 
a centralising approach and that is amply demonstrated by my own experience. If 
the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18651">18651</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Executive were taking a centralising approach, the minister would have been 
able to do more to help me with my problems with general practitioners packing 
up in the far north of Scotland.</P><P>The minister also made a point about the 
redesign of services. That has also been demonstrated in my constituency by the 
approach that has recently been taken to the accident and emergency service that 
is currently delivered from Thurso. That will lead me on to a point that I want 
to make at the conclusion of my speech.</P><P>The Thurso accident and emergency 
service has been reinstated. It is GP led, but the important point is that there 
is a telelink between Thurso and Aberdeen royal infirmary. The link is the first 
of its type in the Highlands and it means that the far north of Scotland can connect 
directly with the best consultancy services in places as far away as Aberdeen. 
That poses a question about structures and the way in which we do things in the 
future. It is an interesting and profound question, and one to which I will return.</P><P>Nicola 
Sturgeon rightly pointed out that the Conservative idea of partnership is the 
fig leaf that disguises an obsession with privatisation. Ultimately, that will 
always be the Achilles' heel of my good friend Mary Scanlon's argument. I am afraid 
that it will be pointed out more and more. Privatisation is deeply unpopular with 
the public and the idea will not sell very well.</P><P>Margaret &quot;Matron&quot; 
Smith was characteristically robust in her attitude. I apologise to Ben Wallace 
for her rather sharp put-down, but she is obviously on good form this morning. 
She made two points with which I associate myself: first, that the Conservatives 
acknowledge that more money is going into the NHS; and, secondly, that health 
promotion&#151;heading off health problems at the pass&#151;is extremely important.</P><P>I 
will turn to my part of the world in the time that I have left. I have talked 
about the accident and emergency situation being resolved and that is a good-news 
story. However, my constituency is still left with the GP problem. I cannot think 
how many times I have outlined that problem to ministers; the minister is only 
too well aware of it.</P><P>Despite what the British Medical Association announced 
last week, I had GPs leap at me in Thurso and tell me that I do not understand. 
Things are great for the central belt or for areas of high population, but the 
delivery of out-of-hours GP cover in the north is questionable. I do not have 
the detail on that at the moment, but I shall return to the ministers with the 
issue.</P><P>Yesterday, at the Health and Community Care Committee, we heard about 
the problem with the Office of Fair Trading report and recommendations on pharmacists. 
If we are not careful, the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18652">18652</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>proposals coming from down south could wreck community pharmacies. Those points 
have been made to Frank McAveety and I know that he has taken them on board.</P><P>However, 
that leaves me with questions in my mind. Why is it that, despite the best endeavours 
of the Scottish Executive, we sometimes see problems out in the real world? Sometimes 
ministers must feel helpless when they compare what they are trying to do with 
the outcomes.</P><P>Although I support the Executive amendment, and in no way 
question the minister's commitment to improving the health service, I await the 
publication of the white paper with great interest. I have flagged up some problems 
with delivery mechanisms and structures. We all wait with great interest to see 
what emerges tomorrow.</P><P>10:43</P><P><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) 
(SNP): </strong>Today we have had the usual story from the Tories. Everything 
was okay under them and market forces will deliver for the NHS. Of course, no 
one believes that, particularly not the public. I wonder whether some Tory members 
really believe it. Will they ever learn? The answer that we have had today is 
that it does not look like it.</P><P>Alex Johnstone made a rather peculiar speech 
that highlighted the fact that he needs to take the wax out of his ears and do 
a little more homework before engaging in debates on health. Clearly, he did not 
hear what Nicola Sturgeon was saying so, for his benefit, I will say it a second 
time.</P><P>The SNP is the only party that is committed to addressing the core 
problem in the NHS, which is the lack of capacity. That is why we are going to 
tackle bed and staff shortages by assessing the real level of acute beds that 
we require. At the moment, we do not know what that is. Clearly, we do not have 
enough or we would not have the thousands of cancelled operations that we do. 
We need to know the right level of acute beds for Scotland.</P><P>We then need 
the staff to ensure that those beds can operate. The only way we can do that is 
by ensuring that nurses and doctors want to come and work in Scotland. The only 
way we can do that is by giving the Scottish health service a competitive edge. 
That is why we are committed to an 11 per cent pay rise for nurses. Only then 
will we be able to tackle the core problems in the NHS.</P><P>If we need any evidence 
of those problems, we should note that we are falling further behind the English 
health service. Scotland has over 1,400 people waiting more than 15 months for 
in-patient treatment, whereas England has only 105. Given </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18653">18653</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the difference in population, that is quite a stark figure.</P><P><strong>Malcolm 
Chisholm: </strong>We agree with the member's point about expanding the capacity 
of the work force, which is precisely what we are doing, including significant 
increases in nurses' pay under &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;.</P><P>On the member's 
second point&#151;and there will be more about that tomorrow&#151;she knows fine 
well that no one with a guarantee is waiting longer than guaranteed, and she has 
to accept that sometimes there are very good reasons why someone has a guarantee 
exception. The tonsillectomies that had to be postponed earlier in the year for 
medical reasons is a good example. If that is the line that she is going to take 
on waiting times tomorrow, I thank her for the advance notice of the nonsense 
that she is going to speak.</P><P><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>We look forward 
to hearing what the minister has to say tomorrow.</P><P>The problem is that it 
is always jam tomorrow, but the facts speak for themselves. The Executive has 
failed to address the issue of waiting times over the past four years and it cannot 
get away from that.</P><P><strong>Mr McNeil: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>No, the member is in her final minute.</P><P><strong>Shona 
Robison: </strong>It is all very well for the Executive to say that it is trying 
its best and admitting that there is a problem, but that is not good enough. The 
Executive has failed. Moving on to the other party of failure, I say that the 
Liberal Democrats cannot have their cake and eat it. That annoys their coalition 
partners greatly, as we saw at the weekend. It annoys me greatly as well because, 
if we were to listen to the Liberal Democrats, we would think that it has nothing 
to do with them. Mike Rumbles was complaining about the situation in Grampian. 
Yes, it is terrible that people have to wait for digital hearing aids and dental 
treatment, but the Liberal Democrats' Executive is running the health service 
and they are as guilty as their Labour coalition partners.</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: 
</strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>I 
am in my last minute.</P><P>Colin Campbell gave an eloquent example of how the 
problems that we are talking about today impact on patient care, which is most 
important. He gave one example out of thousands of someone who has had their operation 
cancelled time and again. That is the reality of bed and staff shortages.</P><P>I 
will conclude by being magnanimous enough to say that many of the Executive's 
health policies </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18654">18654</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>are well intentioned. However, that is not good enough. Labour's stewardship 
of the NHS has been a failure and it has failed to use the resources available 
wisely and effectively. It is time for change. It is time for a new team to lead 
the NHS and we look forward to starting that on May 2.</P><P>10:48</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care (Mr Frank McAveety): </strong>I 
thank the member for her contribution. If it needs a definition, I would say that 
it was magnanimity qualified. Perhaps the member should have listened to her colleague 
Brian Adam when he said that there is no overnight cure for the problems in the 
NHS. Maybe the SNP members require a briefing session.</P><P>The Conservatives 
have been brave enough&#151;if not a bit foolhardy&#151;to submit that they have 
a solution for NHS problems. That solution was clearly set out during their 18-year 
custodianship when they did not deliver on many of the issues highlighted in their 
motion. The Scottish Executive is trying to pursue many of the issues that the 
Conservatives have highlighted because we want to put patients first&#151;to use 
David Davidson's words. If the Tories ever did that, it would be the first time.</P><P>I 
say to Mary Scanlon that the voters will not forget. In the words of Santayana,</P><P>&quot;Those 
who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&quot;</P><P>All that 
Mary Scanlon offers is a future with a return to the key issues that exemplified 
the Tories' approach to the Scottish health service.</P><P>In his opening comments, 
Malcolm Chisholm was being open and transparent with the Parliament about the 
challenges that we face.</P><P>If we go underneath many of the comments that members 
have made today, we can see that they recognise that there is a capacity issue 
in the NHS. That applies to the acute sector, but also concerns how we can improve 
quality and capacity in the primary care sector. I have listened carefully. Many 
members from other parts of Scotland recognise that many of the issues are about 
how to build community capacity within the primary care sector to support the 
work that is done in hospitals. We recognise that, which is why we have identified 
a whole series of strategies to increase the number of staff in the NHS. We are 
increasing the number of doctors and nurses who are in training. We have increased 
the number of accident and emergency consultants. Over the next five years, we 
will be putting in £3.2 billion of investment.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18655">18655</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>There is nothing in the Tory motion, and we heard nothing in their speeches, 
about exactly what they would spend on the NHS. That glaring omission strikes 
to the heart of the dishonesty in Mary Scanlon's speech. Nye Bevan once said that 
the importance of the NHS was that it provided security, but also serenity, for 
the people of the UK that their health needs will be met. How does that match 
up with Mary Scanlon's comment that people should repent?</P><P>Another biblical 
phrase is, &quot;You shall know them by what they say.&quot; Liam Fox was quoted 
as saying to a private audience of the Conservative Medical Society in April 2002:</P><P>&quot;We've 
got a problem in this country where the NHS and health care have been synonymous. 
We're here to break that.&quot;</P><P>That is the Tories' real intention for the 
health service. Nothing that Mary Scanlon has said today addresses those points.</P><P>As 
I said, there are more nurses and doctors in the Scottish health service than 
there were in 1999, and £3.2 billion will be going in over the next five years. 
We recognise the issue of nurse recruitment, which was touched on by colleagues 
across the chamber, the SNP and other parties. We want to increase the number 
of nurses who are training. However, as many members behind me have said, the 
health service is more than just doctors and nurses, because non-medical staff 
are an integral part of the health team. That is why we are delighted that the 
agenda that we are moving forward across the UK, which the trade unions have accepted 
as part of &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, is about improving pay for staff across 
the NHS. In some cases, that means a 16 per cent hourly rate increase for ancillary 
staff.</P><P>People have asked what we have been doing. Nothing was mentioned 
in the Conservative motion about the commitment to partnership. It does not recognise 
that we brought into public ownership the Golden Jubilee hospital, which will 
result in 3,000 patients being given support. However, that is only one part of 
the picture. A selective picture was presented by Mary Scanlon and the Tories, 
because they want people to have a selective memory of what happened in the past. 
They hope that as each year advances, people will forget the central problem.</P><P>I 
say to Mary Scanlon that people remember the important issue, from which she has 
not distanced her party. Will her party reintroduce a two-tier internal market? 
We have not heard anything on that. I ask her to address the fact that her party 
does not want to invest in primary care modernisation, to which we have committed. 
There were other commitments that she did not mention. We have committed to addressing 
cancer and coronary heart disease deaths in </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18656">18656</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Scotland. Those are central commitments of the Executive.</P><P><strong>Mary 
Scanlon: </strong>When the Parliament was set up, the commitment to GP fundholding, 
financing and incentives was taken away. The Executive promised a joint investment 
fund, which never existed. GPs never had any access to that fund, so in fact it 
was the Executive that starved GPs and primary care.</P><P><strong>The Presiding 
Officer:</strong> Before the minister replies, I say that I should not have allowed 
that intervention, because the minister is over time. Please wind up.</P><P><strong>Mr 
McAveety: </strong>The Executive recognises that there are many challenges, but 
in terms of staff, investment and partnership, we have the right approach. We 
recognise that there is an issue with bed capacity, which is why we are committed 
to the delayed discharge strategy, which is resulting in a substantial reduction 
in the number of blocked beds in our hospitals.</P><P>I conclude on this key point: 
health in isolation is worthy of debate, but health is connected to the many other 
strategies that the Executive has developed, which include investment in housing, 
improvements in education, and opportunities into employment. If we get those 
three right and match them to our health commitments, Scotland will be a better 
place. The Executive is committed to that.</P><P>10:55</P><P><strong>Ben Wallace 
(North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>It is right and proper that, in the closing 
days of the session, the Scottish Conservatives should choose to debate the health 
outcomes of the Executive. Over the six years since Labour came to power, and 
the four years of the Lib Dem pact, not only have we seen billions of pounds of 
extra money pumped into the system, but we have seen the abandonment of a Conservative 
ideology on health care in favour of a pre-Thatcherite NHS system.</P><P>That 
has meant not only that the Executive's and new Labour's manifesto rhetoric has 
been put to the test, but that the public has seen a failure of the service that 
they were promised. Nothing speaks louder than the endless list of pledges that 
the Executive has failed to meet, all the way back to 1997. For example, it is 
now six years since the pledge to abolish mixed-sex wards was made, but it has 
yet to be honoured. What about the pledge in 1997 to end waiting for cancer surgery? 
That has not been done. What about the idea of reducing waiting times from 12 
to nine months? That has still not been done.</P><P>In fact, the Executive's own 
secret polling during this session found that the public thought that the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18657">18657</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>NHS under the Executive was worse than or the same as it was under us, so the 
idea that people out there do not believe the Conservatives is wrong. All members 
have to do is spend time at a hospital to realise that people say, &quot;Well, 
I can't remember it being as bad as this.&quot; Outcomes and patients are what 
matter.</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Ben 
Wallace: </strong>No, I have to sum up.</P><P>What do we get for all the billions 
of pounds? That is important. John McAllion made a point about investment and 
the need for more money. There is no point in putting money into systems that 
do not produce results. I will put more money into any health system that produces 
tangible results. The head of Tony Blair's own delivery unit, Michael Barber, 
recognised that the NHS is consistently failing to spend the money in the right 
places.</P><P>Janis Hughes made a point about a two-tier health service. Well, 
we have one and, in fact, it has expanded under the Executive. Postcode prescribing 
has increased. Let us remember digital hearing aids. More and more people are 
opting to go private under the Executive's custodianship of the NHS than they 
ever did under us. There is already a two-tier NHS caused by the Executive's policies.</P><P>Nicola 
Sturgeon attacked the partnership approach. We want partnership to increase capacity. 
Interestingly enough, she attacks partnership, but it is partnerships with not-for-profit, 
profit-making, independent and public sector providers that have created better 
health services across Europe, where they do not have shortages and waiting time 
problems. The partnership approach should not just be attacked and thrown away.</P><P>Nicola 
Sturgeon's deputy, Shona Robison, went on to talk about how the SNP was the only 
party that tackled capacity. We talked about partnerships. She went on to say 
that we are falling behind the English NHS. The English NHS has embraced the partnership 
approach, which is why its capacity has been increasing.</P><P>Frank McAveety 
used a quote and made the point that Liam Fox wants to destroy the NHS. In fact, 
Liam Fox was saying that the NHS should not have and does not have a monopoly 
on providing health care. I stand by that belief, because the Executive's health 
care monopoly does not work.</P><P>Malcolm Chisholm's amendment shows his misunderstanding 
of the differences in ideology. We believe that the debate is about ideology, 
because the Griffiths reforms of the 1980s were about that. Those reforms were 
the only way to drive forward improvements in health care, by </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18658">18658</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>empowering the patient, the GP and the primary care staff, not only with choice, 
but with funds. We will return to that. Only when patients are able to demand 
services based on information, assisted choice and need will the NHS become as 
responsive as any other system in Europe. We do not match Germany and France, 
which we now top in health care funding. In fact, for years&#151;since way before 
Labour appeared to rewrite history&#151;Scotland's average health spending has 
been above that in Europe, yet we have worse outcomes. That should not be justification 
to carry on writing blank cheques.</P><P>In Europe, they learn. They treat public, 
not-for-profit and independent providers of health care the same, and hold them 
in high esteem, because the issue is where the patient wants to go. Here, such 
providers are not utilised because of some old socialist dogma that says, &quot;No, 
you can't go there, because we don't believe that these people should be able 
to provide.&quot;</P><P>In fact, Scotland does not have many profit-making hospitals. 
I inform those who are ignorant that BUPA is a not-for-profit organisation. Perhaps 
people should remember that when they attack such health care providers.</P><P>The 
minister's amendment reflects such a misunderstanding clearly. His view is that 
the patient should be directed to the centre, from where the Executive will dictate 
the services that will be planned for the patient but will not allow the patient 
to be the centre of service direction, funds and availability. That is a bit like 
the difference between a planned economy and a market economy. The planned economies 
collapsed with the Soviet Union, but the market economies are still here.</P><P>In 
the Conservative manifesto, we will propose ideas for empowering the patient. 
They might solve some of the previous problems of fundholding, which were by-products 
of fundholding and not problems of the system itself. We will also ensure that 
funds are used better and are moved round the system to take advantage of more 
capacity and more partnerships, so that, in the end, the patient directs services. 
Under the Executive, patients feel excluded and worried that no one listens to 
them and that they have no power.</P><P>What Duncan McNeil said about health board 
boundaries is true. Fundholding and other matters meant that health board boundaries 
did not have to be respected, because the patient and the GP could go where they 
wanted to buy the services that they needed if they were waiting too long. Under 
the Executive, such people are being prevented from doing that. That is important.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18659">18659</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Notwithstanding some initial problems with 
the waiting times database, Ben Wallace has described the reason for the database. 
Patients, with the help of their GPs, will have choice&#151;more choice than they 
had in the internal market, when block contracts did not allow patients such a 
degree of individual choice.</P><P><strong>Ben Wallace: </strong>We should examine 
that. The Executive arrived, vandalised then abandoned the internal market and 
told patients to go to services only in their areas and to take the choice that 
was on offer. After a good few years, the Executive realised that that was not 
working and that patients felt confused, so it produced another firefighting initiative. 
Instead, it should have considered how to improve fundholding and get rid of some 
of the bureaucracy. That is what Labour did in England under Alan Milburn, after 
the disastrous efforts of Mr Dobson. Labour said, &quot;Okay, sometimes practices 
are too small to fundhold. Let's empower local health care co-operatives or primary 
care groups to open and commission more services.&quot; However, the Executive 
spent its billions on vandalising an old system under which outcomes and results 
were better.</P><P>Whatever the Executive says, its figures speak for themselves. 
People vote for shorter waiting times, shorter waiting lists and the treatment 
of more people. Six years down the line, after more tax has been collected and 
more billions have been spent, Labour is still not getting it right. The Executive 
can pretend that the Tories destroyed the health service in 18 years, but the 
Tories did not. The fact is that the Executive is not imaginative about health 
care.</P><P>Margaret Smith asked who I am. I am a person who does not believe 
the spin. I listen to patients. Perhaps she should answer this question: what 
is the difference between the Liberal Democrats' health policy and the Scottish 
Executive's health policy? Perhaps the answer would show why the Liberal Democrats 
did not lodge an amendment of their own.</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer:

an election might be coming soon. I remind all of those involved and all other

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Looked-after Children (Education)</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The 
Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel): </STRONG>The next item of business is the 
debate on motion S1M-3943, in the name of Cathy Jamieson, on the educational attainment 
of looked-after children.</P><P>11:05</P><P><strong>The Minister for Education 
and Young People (Cathy Jamieson): </strong>In January last year, I made a statement 
to the Parliament on the education of our looked-after children in Scotland. I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to report to the Parliament on progress and 
to discuss again this important subject.</P><P>In March 2001, we published &quot;Learning 
with Care&quot;, which was the report of a joint inspection by the social work 
services inspectorate and Her Majesty's inspectors of schools on the educational 
experiences of looked-after young people. As a result of concerns, Jack McConnell 
wrote to ask each council leader about their efforts to improve the education 
of looked-after children. Last year, I reported wide variation in local authorities' 
performance. Examples of good practice existed, but some authorities could not 
meet any of the recommendations in full.</P><P>Therefore, I set local authorities 
the challenge of achieving, by the end of last year, three of the recommendations 
that are fundamental to improving the position of looked-after children. The recommendations 
were that all looked-after children should receive full-time education; that all 
looked-after children should have a care plan that adequately addresses their 
educational needs; and that all schools should designate a teacher to champion 
the interests of such children.</P><P>I have received reports from local authorities 
on their implementation of those recommendations and the progress that they have 
made, and I am placing a summary of those responses in the Scottish Parliament 
information centre today. Overall, all local authorities have improved on their 
position last year, which is encouraging, but the reports show that authorities 
could still do better on implementing the recommendations.</P><P>Most authorities 
reported that more than 90 per cent of looked-after children are in full-time 
education and that alternatives to mainstream schooling are used when needed. 
Local authorities have also begun to tackle the disproportionate exclusion of 
looked-after children, but concerns remain. Some authorities have not included 
children who are looked after at home, as well as those whom they accommodate. 
It is unacceptable that some still have difficulty in tracking all their looked-after 
children.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18662">18662</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Concerns about children who are looked after at home and about tracking children 
also apply to care planning for education. Progress on that has been more disappointing, 
although it is clear that the looked-after children materials have provided a 
framework that ensures that education is routinely considered in the care planning 
process. The authorities' responses also raise questions about communication among 
schools, education departments and social work departments.</P><P>All authorities 
reported that teachers have been designated in their schools, but the role of 
such teachers and whether they perform it effectively is not always clear. The 
responses describe good examples of authorities looking beyond the recommendations 
to make further improvements. For example, Dumfries and Galloway Council has produced 
comprehensive guidance on the role of the designated teacher, which enables school 
staff to engage better with the issues and ensures that young people get the most 
from their education.</P><P><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) 
(Con): </strong>I am interested to hear the news that the minister conveys to 
the chamber. She said that she would leave copies of the information that has 
been gathered from local authorities in SPICe. Is that information available from 
the SPICe desk now, so that we can see it while we listen to her speech?</P><P><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>The information should be available. Several local authorities 
provided updated information at the last minute, which will be available from 
SPICe as the day goes on. The information is a result of self-reporting by local 
authorities and is not in a Parliament publication. I have pulled the responses 
together and they have been placed in SPICe for information. Later, I will talk 
about what we will do with that information.</P><P>Western Isles Council's education 
and social work departments jointly started a new project to provide full-time 
education for children who do not attend mainstream schools. Several local authorities, 
including Argyll and Bute Council, North Lanarkshire Council and Renfrewshire 
Council, have said that they are improving data links between the management information 
systems of social work departments and of education departments. That should ensure 
that schools are aware of all looked-after children and that the progress of their 
educational attainment can be followed.</P><P>I confirm for Mr Monteith that the 
Executive will follow up on the returns with local authorities. I want to be able 
to pick up on the good practice that is out there and share it with others. I 
will also follow up on those local authorities about which we have concerns. The 
authorities will be asked to prepare an action plan to progress the issues that 
require to be addressed.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18663">18663</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Last year, I identified a number of other actions that the Executive would 
take as a result of the &quot;Learning with Care&quot; report. Three seminars, 
which were held in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness, were attended by more than 
200 practitioners and education and social work managers. As a result of the seminars, 
we have collated material and will produce a range of materials to assist us in 
developing the agenda. We will consider training materials, a looked-after children 
education report, and booklets for teachers, social workers and carers. The intention 
is for those materials to be produced by May of this year.</P><P>It is also important 
to note that the social work services inspectorate has checked on progress in 
each authority. Inspection teams have found that progress has been achieved on 
joint policies, audits and training, as well as on children's services plans, 
particularly on how authorities set targets for educational attainment.</P><P>This 
year, for the first time, we have collected information nationally on the educational 
attainment of looked-after young people. The information shows that six out of 
10 of the 16 and 17-year-olds who leave care do not achieve any qualifications. 
By contrast, only 5 per cent of all other 16 and 17-years-olds failed to achieve 
qualifications. The social justice milestone that we have set is that, eventually, 
all looked-after children should achieve at least standard grade English and maths. 
At the moment, some 30 per cent achieve that goal.</P><P>The social justice milestone 
is an important continuing test of progress. As we collect better information 
on educational achievement in the years ahead, I believe that we will be better 
able to measure improvements, including those that result from the initiatives 
we have taken following the &quot;Learning with Care&quot; report; from the £10 
million that the Executive invested in educational attainment last year and, indeed, 
the further money that was allocated in the spending review; and from the inspection 
of schools and local authorities by the social work services inspectorate and 
Her Majesty's inspectors of schools. However, we must be clear that we are talking 
not only about inspections, bureaucracies or money but about young people's lives. 
We must look ahead from the &quot;Learning with Care&quot; report to the practical 
actions that will continue to improve educational attainment.</P><P><strong>Dr 
Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab): </strong>Does the minister agree that Ballikinrain 
School in my constituency is not only a model school but one in which an integrated 
approach to outreach work helps children to get back into mainstream education?</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18664">18664</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I visited Ballikinrain School and was impressed 
with the way in which the school adapts its work to the continuing agenda for 
change. The school is particularly interested in raising young people's aspirations. 
That is very important: we must demand such a change of culture and ambition for 
our looked-after young people&#151;we should not settle for second best on their 
behalf.</P><P>Most important, we need to continue to seek the views of the young 
people themselves. It is for that reason that we commissioned Who Cares? Scotland 
to undertake a survey on the educational attainment of looked-after children. 
We will receive its findings within the next few months and they will tell us 
about the ambitions of young people. The findings will also tell us where, why 
and when young people become disengaged from the education system. Crucially, 
they will also tell us what young people believe will make a difference.</P><P><strong>Mrs 
Lyndsay McIntosh (Central Scotland) (Con): </strong>On what we can do to help 
children, I am interested in the progress and the achievements that are being 
made in certain areas, but does the minister agree that the one thing that looked-after 
children desperately miss out on is the support of a family? They miss having 
somebody who is there for them, to supervise their homework for example. Every 
parent in the chamber will have sat down with their children, read with them, 
gone over their homework, helped them to forward plan and so forth. Sadly, the 
system lacks someone who takes a continuing interest in the children and helps 
them to plan for the future.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I agree with 
Lyndsay McIntosh on that point. I will talk about that important area in a couple 
of minutes.</P><P>It is important to recognise that, as a result of previous work 
by Who Cares? and the Scottish Throughcare and Aftercare Forum, we know about 
some of the factors that cause problems for young people. First, frequent placement 
moves can have a damaging effect on young people, especially if a change of school 
is also involved. The stability that school can give can be enormously important. 
Secondly, we know that young people should not leave care at too young an age. 
At the moment, many young people do so at 16 or 17, which is precisely the time 
that they need the most support to help them to concentrate on their exams. If 
we are serious about wanting more young people to move on to higher and further 
education, we need to get the whole support package right.</P><P>We must encourage 
young people to see education as something that is relevant to them and which 
will benefit them in future. In response to Lyndsay McIntosh's question, I agree 
that looked-after children deserve to have somebody who is interested in their 
education, in the same </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18665">18665</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>way that other young people have such a person. Social workers or carers need 
to attend parents evenings, read their report cards and take a real interest in 
their education.</P><P>I have many memories of young people who might have moaned 
at me at the time, but who in later years said that they were grateful to me and 
others for caring enough to get them out of bed in the morning so that they would 
go to school. We nagged them about their homework and pushed them to aim for more 
in exactly the same way as we did and do for our own children. Lyndsay McIntosh 
recognises the nagging that parents do.</P><P><strong>Mrs McIntosh: </strong>I 
am familiar with the concept.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>We should 
also recognise that young people in the care system might need extra support. 
Study support groups in schools, for example, are a welcome resource and, for 
many looked-after young people, a quiet place in the children's home and access 
to a computer can make all the difference. Art materials or sports equipment, 
which some other young people take for granted, can motivate young people to stay 
involved in education, and additional support to help them to catch up if necessary 
can give confidence. Those are the kinds of things that are made possible by our 
allocation of £10 million.</P><P>I want to mention one innovative new scheme that 
provides a young person with a personal webspace for study and the storage of 
personal documents. It is important that looked-after young people have such provision. 
I recently attended the launch of the virtual schoolbag project, a pilot that 
is supported by the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland and Microsoft. 
I look forward to seeing how the pilot develops, as the young people involved 
are very positive about it.</P><P>I spoke earlier about the low number of looked-after 
young people who move on from school into university. I know that those young 
people have the capability to move on. I have seen young people who were brought 
up in the care system successfully make that transition. However, at the moment, 
less than 1 per cent of looked-after young people go on to university. We must 
do more to address that.</P><P>We are introducing education maintenance allowances 
across Scotland to help young people to stay on at school or college. Support 
is also being offered through the Executive's enterprise and lifelong learning 
department. As part of the lifelong learning strategy, Iain Gray recently announced 
his commitment to improving access to lifelong learning for particular groups 
of people whose education has been disrupted. Young people leaving care will be 
the first group to benefit. That move is very welcome.</P><P>My time is now up. 
I finish by restating my belief </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18666">18666</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>that for too long our ambitions for looked-after young people have been far 
too low. I want to see that culture change. We must ensure that such a change 
is the responsibility not only of the few people who are directly involved in 
working with looked-after children, but of everyone involved in education and 
social work. We must also ensure that everyone in the chamber works alongside 
local authorities to deliver such change.</P><P>I am committed to the partnership 
approach, which is why I am not in a position to accept the Scottish National 
Party's amendment. It misses the point about all of us working together, which 
is where I am coming from. This is not about giving local authorities a hard time, 
but about working alongside authorities to ensure that we all deliver collectively 
for our looked-after young people.</P><P>I move,</P><P>That the Parliament recognises 
that young people looked after by local authorities require support to enable 
them to have the best possible educational opportunity; welcomes the use made 
of the £10 million allocated to local authorities to support educational attainment 
of looked after children, and notes that, while progress has been made on implementing 
the recommendations made in <em>Learning With Care</em>, continued effort must 
be made to ensure that every looked after child has an appropriate care plan, 
including a plan for education, and is in full time education provision appropriate 
to need and that staff in social work and education work together to support all 
looked after children to reach their full potential.</P><P>11:19</P><P><strong>Irene 
McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>As the minister reminded the chamber, 
it was more than a year ago that she made a statement to Parliament announcing 
plans and setting out the minimal requirement that all looked-after children should 
receive full-time education and have a care plan that addresses their educational 
needs. Those are the same plans and requirement that are reiterated in the Executive 
motion today.</P><P>The deadline for delivering the targets passed two months 
ago, but they have not been met. The educational situation of looked-after children 
remains grim. The most recent statistics confirm the severity of the problem: 
the majority of young people who leave care&#151;60 per cent&#151;do so without 
qualifications. Of 16 and 17-year-old care leavers, six out of 10 do not achieve 
qualifications and only 27 per cent get English and maths at standard grade.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Monteith: </strong>Will the member tell me how those statistics compare with the 
previous statistics?</P><P><strong>Irene McGugan: </strong>To the best of my knowledge, 
they have not improved.</P><P>Most 16 and 17-year-old care leavers have experience 
of truancy and exclusion. Less than 1 per cent of them go to university.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18667">18667</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I remind the chamber of the comments I made 
in my statement: this is the first time that we have collected such statistics.</P><P><strong>Irene 
McGugan: </strong>But one year later, are they satisfactory? We must focus on 
the problem. We heard almost the same thing a year ago&#151;we discussed the same 
issues and the same problems that looked-after children face. Why do we need to 
hear the minister restating plans with add-on bits and new initiatives that have 
so little result?</P><P><strong>Dr Jackson: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Irene 
McGugan: </strong>I would like to move on a little bit.</P><P>The minister made 
it fairly clear in her contribution that she places at least some responsibility 
for the situation on local authorities. Last year, local authorities were offered 
no new resources to implement the plans.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Surely 
even Irene McGugan accepts that the £10 million was an additional resource for 
looked-after children.</P><P><strong>Irene McGugan: </strong>The £10 million was 
specifically about providing materials and resources to help with homework; it 
was not specifically about helping children to receive full-time education or 
to have a care plan that addresses their educational needs. There were entirely 
separate announcements about entirely separate issues.</P><P>It seems that the 
minister does not accept that local authorities&#151;especially social workers&#151;are 
understaffed and under-resourced. They are struggling to deliver services.</P><P>If 
members do not believe anything that I have said, I suggest that the &quot;Learning 
with Care&quot; report to which the minister referred and which was announced 
in March 2001, has the answer. It stated:</P><P>&quot;The majority of social workers 
said that they did not have sufficient time to address fully the educational needs 
of looked after children.&quot;</P><P>They were too busy dealing with other pressures 
that impact on family life&#151;education was not their priority. With social 
work under greater staffing pressure than ever before, how can the situation have 
improved?</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Does the member accept that, 
as I outlined in my speech, the issue is not simply for social work departments? 
Looked-after children are the responsibility of the local authority. Therefore, 
does she accept that they are also the responsibility of the education department 
and that there is a role for people other than qualified social workers?</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18668">18668</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Irene McGugan: </strong>Absolutely. I have no difficulty with that. 
However, it remains the case that social workers are generally the lead workers 
in any group of workers who support looked-after children.</P><P>I remind members 
that local authorities reported to us last year vacancy rates of 50 per cent in 
child care teams. There are very few applicants for jobs and posts remain unfilled 
for 18 months. That is not good. Initiatives cannot be delivered if adequately 
qualified staff are not in place to carry them out.</P><P>We also need foster 
carers. Foster carers look after 4,500 children in Scotland, which might seem 
a lot, but it is widely accepted that there is an urgent shortage of carers. There 
are things that the Executive could do to help recruitment and to attract more 
people to become foster carers. In fact, the Fostering Network suggested in a 
recent paper 11 action points to bring about those improvements, the most pressing 
of which was a national allowance scheme to end the variation in payments. In 
her responses to parliamentary questions on the specifics of those points, the 
minister has made absolutely no commitment to implementing any of the suggestions, 
even though one of the points makes specific reference to helping carers to support 
children better in their education.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Does 
the member accept that foster carers were among the people who received additional 
support through the looked-after children money? Does she also accept that I have 
already met representatives of the Fostering Network and have asked them to continue 
to work with us on some of the points they raised so that we can make progress? 
It is not the case that nothing has happened.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_13"></A>Irene 
McGugan: </strong>I am pleased to know that the minister will continue to meet 
foster carers, but I know some foster carers who were insulted to receive, as 
their share of the £10 million, a little pack with pencils and colouring paper. 
There was wide variation in how the money was used. Some of the carers did not 
feel that they received the best support they could have received to help the 
educational attainment of the children in their care.</P><P>We know the kind of 
measures that have a positive impact&#151;the minister alluded to some of them. 
Children need to live in a care environment where learning is valued, where they 
have space and quiet and where they get loads of praise and encouragement to motivate 
them. They need to know that their social worker and their teacher are focused 
not only on the problems, but have an expectation that the children will achieve 
and that they can and will go on to higher and further education if they want 
to. When things go wrong, they need strategies to help to re-engage them. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18669">18669</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>We know that those simple yet effective measures work. They have been tried 
and tested and form the basis of delivering progress.</P><P>We welcome the specific 
funding and, indeed, any initiative to improve the attainment of looked-after 
children. We fully support integrated working.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_15"></A>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Irene McGugan: </strong>I 
am in my final seconds.</P><P>We recognise that if social workers and teachers 
work together, they will deliver a better outcome for children. There is an implication 
in some of the Executive's statements that, somehow, local authorities are wilfully 
not complying, but I have no doubt that social workers and teachers endorse the 
principle individually. However, we also need a commitment to resourcing the core 
statutory services and to supporting fully&#151;with no hint of criticism, bullying 
or decrying&#151;the staff who deliver them.</P><P>I move amendment S1M-3943.1, 
to leave out from &quot;the use&quot; to end and insert:</P><P>&quot;funding and 
other initiatives to improve attainment of looked after children; regrets, however, 
that progress has been so slow, particularly as the Scottish Executive has brought 
this and associated issues with regard to looked after children to debate in the 
Parliament on no less than four previous occasions; recognises that the issues 
cannot be resolved without adequate qualified staff in the system; supports wholeheartedly 
better integrated children's services but suggests that the Executive desist from 
blaming local authorities and local authority staff for the problems caused by 
its own and previous governments' policy failures, and therefore urges the Executive 
to acknowledge and address the financial and staffing pressures that local authorities 
face every day in attempting to meet their statutory duties.&quot;</P><P>11:26</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_17"></A>Mr 
Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>As sure as eggs are eggs, 
the minister will recall that members on the Conservative benches have supported 
the Executive's efforts where we have thought them to be justifiable. Today is 
one of those occasions.</P><P>If anything, the difficulty with the debate is that 
it is a tad premature&#151;no doubt because we are moving towards an election 
and we are running out of time. I admit to feeling a tad uncomfortable about defending 
the Executive's position. Perhaps that is because of my aching feet or because 
the SNP amendment is so off-beam. The truth is that there is not enough evidence 
available for any of us in the chamber, including the Executive, to be able to 
measure how successful the £10 million has been.</P><P>The report, &quot;Learning 
with Care&quot;, produced by Her Majesty's inspectors of schools and the social 
work services inspectorate, laid the foundation for </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18670">18670</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>progress&#151;there is no doubt about that. However, the investment of funds 
still has to show the direct effect of improving attainment. One might expect 
it to make a difference, and we are all hopeful that it will.</P><P>The key has 
been the decision to start measuring the attainment of looked-after children as 
a group. We await the next results so that we might compare them with the horrific 
revelation that 60 per cent of looked-after children do not achieve any qualifications, 
and then try to reduce the percentage to 40 per cent or 50 per cent. That is what 
we are all working for. When the new figures are available, we will be able to 
decide whether the £10 million has worked and whether any of the other changes 
have been delivered. Subsequently, I hope that we will be able to move on to further 
recommendations.</P><P>I draw some points from the &quot;Learning with Care&quot; 
report, about assessment in particular. Paragraph 1.8 states:</P><P>&quot;It was 
unusual for any form of assessment to have been carried out on the 50 sample children 
at the time they became looked after. It was even more unusual to find an assessment 
which addressed educational needs.&quot;</P><P>Although care plans have been a 
statutory requirement since 1997, they were in place for only a minority of children 
in two of the authorities that were inspected. Where there were care plans, they 
did not usually address educational needs and goals in any detail. Schools were 
not normally supplied with a copy of the care plan.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: 
</strong>There is a danger that consensus might break out between Brian Monteith 
and me, which is unusual. Does he accept that, despite the fact that we want to 
work in partnership with local authorities, where they do not meet their statutory 
requirements for care plans, it is right that I should take strong action?</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_19"></A>Mr 
Monteith: </strong>The minister can safely predict that, if strong action is required 
to be taken with local authorities, she will have the backing of the Conservatives, 
and my backing in particular. Haud me back.</P><P>Will the minister tell me what 
progress has been made on assessment and on the use of care plans, and whether 
those are now standard practice? In summing up, will she or the Deputy Minister 
for Children and Young People say what impact the draft education (additional 
support for learning) bill will have on the educational aspect of care plans?</P><P><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>I am happy to reassure Mr Monteith on that issue. The draft 
proposals on additional support for learning will ensure that a greater number 
of young people are assessed for the additional support that they require to ensure 
that they get the best out of their education. That </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18671">18671</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>will be a helpful move for young people who are looked after and accommodated.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Monteith: </strong>That response is interesting. There is a worthwhile debate 
to be had on that topic, but I hope that it will not be rushed and that we will 
have adequate time to consider all the factors, particularly parents' concerns.</P><P>My 
colleague Murdo Fraser will say more about how partnerships between the public 
sector and the independent sector, which includes private and charitable schools 
and voluntary sector organisations such as Barnardo's Scotland and the Church 
of Scotland, are crucial to improving the service. I, too, have visited Ballikinrain, 
which is an exemplary model; I only wish that the Church of Scotland had more 
schools of a similar standard. I have also visited Lecropt, the Barnardo's school 
in Bridge of Allan, with which I am suitably impressed&#151;so much so that I 
often take shadow education ministers from down south to show them how things 
are done in Scotland. It is a lucky school indeed.</P><P>Without the help of the 
independent sector, standards of care and educational attainment would be far 
worse. By using the independent sector, we can lever in an additional 20 per cent 
to 30 per cent of resources. That message should be taken on board not only in 
the education sector, but in the health sector, as my colleagues suggested in 
the preceding debate.</P><P>There is no doubt that every child deserves a quality 
education and the chance of a positive future, and we commend the Executive for 
taking action on the issue. We see no partisan gain in disputing what is being 
done, but we must have the evidence before we analyse progress. There is more 
to do. Standards in local authorities must be improved, which might involve finance, 
but there must also be a rigorous inspection regime to provide quality assurance. 
We look forward to a fuller progress report from the two inspectorates and to 
a further debate on the matter.</P><P>11:32</P><P><strong>Ian Jenkins (Tweeddale, 
Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD): </strong>&quot;Learning with Care&quot; is an important 
document. Published almost two years ago, it contains a series of recommendations 
on courses of action to improve the way in which looked-after children are cared 
for. The report outlined strategies for improving the educational opportunities 
for, and educational attainment of, such vulnerable youngsters.</P><P>When we 
debated the document previously, I was pleased that the minister picked out three 
targets as the benchmarks of progress. I believe that those targets are appropriate 
and attainable, which is not always the case with targets. I am </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18672">18672</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>glad to hear that progress is being made on all three, although I agree with 
the minister and other members that much remains to be done. I am also pleased 
to hear and read that local authorities are using the £10 million injection of 
funds in a variety of ways to enhance and enrich educational opportunities for 
looked-after youngsters, who face serious obstacles in their personal lives and 
for whom a stable and enriching experience of education is vital.</P><P>The minister 
outlined the benchmark targets. First, we aim to ensure that all looked-after 
children are in full-time education. Of course, that will be problematic in unique 
or special cases, but it is absolutely essential that such youngsters have a full-time 
place in the system. The conventional school environment might be inappropriate 
in some cases, but the children have a right to full-time educational opportunities. 
We must provide an environment in which they can grow as individuals, gain confidence 
and self-respect and develop their talents in the most appropriate direction. 
We hear about youngsters who leave school without qualifications; to remedy that 
problem, they must be firmly in the system.</P><P>The second aim is for local 
authorities to designate a teacher in every school to be the overseer of the school's 
work with looked-after children. Some schools might have no such pupils, but the 
authorities must recognise the importance of having a leader who is responsible 
both for the care of the youngsters and for liaison with other professional staff 
and agencies, such as social workers. Examples of excellent good practice should 
be highlighted and made available to allow them to be implemented throughout the 
country.</P><P>Central to the issue is the need for a care plan for each pupil, 
to which Brian Monteith referred and which is outlined in &quot;Learning with 
Care&quot;. A core element of such plans should be consideration of the educational 
needs and planned provision for that individual. In some circumstances, I am wary 
when politicians advocate individual learning plans for pupils because I know 
that producing them can be more complex than it sounds and more difficult than 
non-teachers might realise. However, such a comprehensive overview is vital if 
we are to enable looked-after children to maximise their potential.</P><P>If we 
read the documents, we find cases in which the sensitivities surrounding young 
people's emotional and personal problems have not been handled sensitively. The 
co-ordinator, guidance teachers and school pastoral system are important in handling 
joint working in a way that best helps the pupil. There is a real need for training 
and professional development, and local authorities must continue to promote positive 
joint working. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18673">18673</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The ethos in the new community schools is a good example that should be rolled 
out further.</P><P>The minister referred to the targets for educational attainment 
as a &quot;social justice milestone&quot;. We hear that many looked-after children 
leave school with no qualifications and that only a tiny percentage of them go 
to university. I welcome the minister's illustrations of high ambitions and the 
extending of opportunities for such youngsters. The statistics are sad and serious&#151;I 
cannot remember the word that Brian Monteith used.</P><P><strong>Mr Monteith: 
</strong>Horrific.</P><P><strong>Ian Jenkins: </strong>The statistics are horrific, 
but I counsel ministers, and politicians in general, not to become hung up on 
what can be narrow, paper-based measures of achievement. We should be wary of 
using such statistics to berate political opponents or to make adverse judgments 
about particular schools and local authority education systems.</P><P>Traumatised 
youngsters who are taken into care need a safe environment and a domestic situation 
in which they experience sympathetic care and understanding and are treated with 
respect and affection as individuals. They need an environment in which they can 
learn to respect themselves after having traumatic experiences in their young 
lives. They need a domestic and educational setting that enriches them and allows 
them to develop socially and personally. They must be equipped with the skills 
and personal resources to allow them to move into the wider world with confidence.</P><P>In 
truth, our well-intentioned target that all such children should attain standard 
grade English and mathematics might, rightly or wrongly, not be high on those 
children's personal agendas. The Who Cares? Scotland review will help to explore 
that issue. In the meantime, we must resist the temptation to force children into 
boxes for certificates gained that simply allow us to tick them and say, &quot;Willie's 
got a foundation award at standard grade English&#151;he's sorted and he won't 
appear in the statistics as leaving school with no qualifications. Job done.&quot; 
That is not what we are about.</P><P>The matter involves complicated situations 
for individuals who have complex needs, and it is difficult but vital for us to 
try to meet those needs. Those individuals deserve the best that we can give them. 
We must ensure that we treat them as individuals and not as statistics, and I 
know that the minister is committed to that. I support her motion and I look forward 
to further progress on what is an important issue and to the practical actions 
that were outlined and promised for the future in the minister's speech.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18674">18674</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>11:38</P><P><strong>Scott Barrie (Dunfermline West) (Lab): </strong>I welcome 
the debate and the opportunity to contribute to it. I am sorry that the amendment 
in Irene McGugan's name seems to regret that we are having another debate on the 
educational attainment of looked-after children. I know that Irene McGugan has 
a commitment to and knowledge of the subject, so I thought that she would welcome 
the opportunity to advocate on behalf of those in the section of the population 
who are in child care, who are often the most marginalised and disadvantaged in 
society. We must be honest: if it were not for the debates that we have had on 
the issue, particularly those on the poor educational attainment of looked-after 
children, many members would not know how serious the issue is and would not see 
it as requiring the political action that it clearly requires.</P><P>Today and 
in previous debates we have heard about the poor outcomes for looked-after children. 
Too few of them leave school with formal qualifications; too many of them do not 
go on to higher education; and too many end up in young offenders institutions 
almost immediately after leaving care. We must do better&#151;by increasing educational 
attainment, we can increase expectations and opportunities in later life.</P><P>For 
too long, our education system tended to discriminate against looked-after children, 
particularly youngsters who were in physical care. Nothing used to depress me 
more as a social worker and social work manager than when youngsters were removed 
from their homes and placed in a residential school&#151;allegedly following the 
best-interest principle&#151;only to leave at 16 with no formal qualifications, 
with little to look forward to and with the stigma of not attending a mainstream 
school. I am not saying that residential care can never work; however, if it does 
not improve a youngster's educational attainment and life opportunities, what 
is it about?</P><P>That brings us neatly to something that the Conservatives have 
said in the past. In previous debates, they have expressed in warm words their 
empathy for looked-after children. I heard such expressions earlier and we will, 
no doubt, hear them again later. However, in other education debates the Conservatives 
have berated the Executive for setting targets for reducing the number of school 
exclusions. Do they not realise that the two issues are interconnected? Looked-after 
children are disproportionately more likely to be excluded from schools and are 
especially likely to be excluded temporarily on a semi-regular basis. That disrupts 
their schooling and makes it more difficult for them to have a continuous education, 
even if they have been fortunate enough to be able to remain at their catchment 
school following their placement away from home.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18675">18675</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Unfortunately, the same depressing statistics also apply to those under home 
supervision requirements. We must be clear that we are not talking about one issue 
or another: the two issues are closely linked. We must be careful not to assume 
that we can have a debate about looked-after children one day and say positive 
and warm things about them, and have another debate on another day about the level 
of school exclusions but not tie the issues up and recognise that they are connected.</P><P>However, 
there is cause for cautious optimism. Proper implementation of the Children (Scotland) 
Act 1995 means that all looked-after children must have a proper care plan of 
which education is a key element. Although there is a lack of child and family 
social workers in some local authorities, I am glad that most local authorities 
are fulfilling their statutory requirements. It is a tribute to the hard work 
and dedication of the staff in those local authorities that they are achieving 
that. The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 did not introduce care plans&#151;we had 
them before it was passed&#151;but the act made them a statutory requirement. 
Nevertheless, too often in the past, those care plans did not address the children's 
educational needs. I was glad to hear the minister say that the situation is improving, 
and I look forward to further improvement in that area.</P><P>I believe that better 
integration of child and family social work and education, together with other 
local government services, is necessary if the corporate parenting role that is 
embedded in the 1995 act is to be achieved. That would be the key to improving 
the children's educational achievement and, equally important, their personal 
and social development. The point was previously made that we should not measure 
the success of our young people just on their educational achievement, but on 
how they are progressing in other areas, especially in social and personal development. 
By focusing on those areas too, we will improve the life chances of all looked-after 
children. That is what some of us were always seeking to do in our professional 
practice, and I know that it is what most members want to see.</P><P>11:43</P><P><strong>Kay 
Ullrich (West of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I ask members to cast their minds back

and put on the wall for all to see and admire? What about the praise that was 
given to homework jotters when they were adorned with that very important gold 
star? I even remember the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18676">18676</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>excitement of bringing home a good report card&#151;although I admit that my 
report cards could best be described as mixed. I remember trying to convince my 
parents that the words &quot;Kay creates her own diversions&quot; meant that the 
teacher thought that I was in some way special. However, mum and dad soon sussed 
that one out.</P><P>Whether my reports were good or bad, my memories are of parents 
who cared about me. For looked-after children, we should be a society that cares. 
Sadly, that has not been the case in the past, and we have failed those children 
miserably. Today we have heard the statistics, which speak for themselves. Less 
than 1 per cent of looked-after children go on to university, and the figures 
show that up to 50 per cent of homeless young people were once children in care. 
I would be interested to learn how many of those children, as adults, find their 
own children taken into care. I suspect that one of the tragedies of the system 
has been that generations of young people have left local authority care totally 
ill equipped for family life and parenthood. Being a parent is a skill that is 
best learned at one's mother's knee.</P><P>I welcome the minister's recognition 
of our past failures and I will be the first to applaud when the changes take 
place. We have to start now. Too many young lives have been blighted for far too 
long. The bottom line is that we must make life for children living in residential 
care as near as possible to life in a family home.</P><P><strong>Johann Lamont 
(Glasgow Pollok) (Lab): </strong>Does the member agree that the problem for a 
lot of our children is their experience at home, which has led to their being 
in the care system? She seems to be making a false distinction between the experience 
of children who are looked after and the experience of those who are not. Some 
of our most troubled and damaged children are those who are not fortunate enough 
to have been recognised as having a problem, taken out of their circumstances 
and put in a system that meets their needs. There is a danger in implying that 
it is the care system that damages the children&#151;what brought them into the 
system in the first place is what damaged them.</P><P><strong>Kay Ullrich: </strong>As 
an ex-social worker, I agree. We are dealing with children who are received into 
care because their family circumstances have led to their being damaged children. 
That is why we have to make life in the residential units as near as possible 
to life in a family home.</P><P>However, no matter how well we succeed&#151;and 
succeed we must&#151;the problem remains that staff work shifts, need days off

<P>address the shortage of foster carers in Scotland. Only 27 per cent of children 
who are looked after by local authorities are in foster care.</P><P><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>I welcome and value the role that foster carers play. However, 
does the member accept that some young people, especially teenagers, who still 
have contact with their extended families may choose to be in a residential care 
setting rather than in a family setting?</P><P><strong>Kay Ullrich: </strong>I 
agree with that. However, the vast majority of children who are currently in residential 
care would benefit greatly if they were placed with a foster family.</P><P>A number 
of things could be done to achieve that. There could be a national recruitment 
drive for foster carers, and a national allowance for them to end the postcode 
variations and perhaps attract more people into foster caring. In short, foster 
parents should be recognised as a vital part of the child care team. It is also 
essential that we address the drop-out rate among foster carers. In my experience, 
the pay scale is not the main factor in people giving up fostering: it is the 
lack of support that they receive from the social work department after a placement 
has been made.</P><P>That brings us back to the recruitment and retention crisis 
in social work departments throughout Scotland. Like it or not, the reality is 
that looked-after children&#151;whether they are in residential or foster care&#151;are 
a low priority in an overworked social worker's case load.</P><P><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Kay Ullrich: </strong>I 
am just finishing.</P><P>I welcome the announcement that has been made today. 
At the risk of ruining the minister's career, I have to say that, on this issue, 
we are on the same side. However, let us have no more debates on the subject; 
let us just get on with doing what needs to be done.</P><P>11:49</P><P><strong>Donald 
Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>My colleague, Ian Jenkins, dealt well 
with the school aspect of the looked-after children problem, so I will deal with 
the out-of-school aspect. I will concentrate on the issues of self-esteem and 
expectation, including the expectation that a young person has of himself or herself 
and the expectation that those round them have of the progress that they will 
make.</P><P>We must start earlier. Early intervention must be very early intervention. 
Our task should be to ensure that nobody becomes a looked-after child, as we will 
have sorted out the problem at an earlier stage. I understand that there is an 
almost complete study in Edinburgh on the issue of </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18678">18678</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>putting a great deal of resources into tackling the problems of two to four-year-olds 
within their families by helping the families and the children to sort themselves 
out. That is a good way to proceed and I hope that more effort, money and other 
resources can be put into what is a resource-intensive method. If that method 
turned around two to four-year-old children, it would save an enormous amount 
of money that otherwise might have been spent later on, and would give the children 
and their families happier futures. I urge concentration on the issue of the earliest 
possible intervention.</P><P>Johann Lamont pointed out that problems often arise 
at an early stage in families. The Justice 1 Committee went round listening to 
people who are involved in alternatives to custody and the phrase that the committee 
heard most commonly was &quot;chaotic lifestyle&quot;. Many families are totally 
disorganised. In relation to that, we were given the excellent statement that 
an appointment is a bourgeois concept. To me, that was a revelatory remark. We 
must help disorganised families to sort themselves out.</P><P>We must also consider 
providing more staff to help such families. There is a shortage of well-trained, 
specialised social workers. We should consider the analogy of classroom assistants, 
who have helped greatly in our schools. If there were out-of-classroom assistants 
who could provide some of the maternal&#151;if that is the right word; it is probably 
a sexist one&#151;or parental support to which Lyndsay McIntosh referred, that 
would be helpful.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I do not disagree with 
the points that have been made about ensuring that the most vulnerable families 
get support as early as they need it and I welcome and value the work that social 
workers do. However, we must stress that the problem, or issue, is not just for 
social workers in a local authority, but for the local authority as a whole. A 
range of skills in schools, from those of nursery nurses to those of classroom 
assistants and support staff, plays a vital role. We can and should make more 
of those skills.</P><P><strong>Donald Gorrie: </strong>That is helpful. I agree 
that a local authority as a whole should tackle the problem of looked-after children 
because it affects many local authority departments. However, based on the example 
of classroom assistants, people of the right calibre, who need not necessarily 
have social workers' extensive technical and professional training, could make 
a good contribution to providing young people with one-to-one help in their homes 
or residential accommodation.</P><P>We are moving in the right direction. If we 
could get council departments to co-operate better&#151;in </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18679">18679</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

tackling children's problems at the earliest possible age, we would make a huge 
difference to young people's lives and ultimately save ourselves a huge amount 
of hassle. I commend the minister and I hope that she will take account of what 
I have said.</P><P>11:54</P><P><strong>Colin Campbell (West of Scotland) (SNP): 
</strong>Kay Ullrich's speech has encouraged me to wander down memory lane, as 
I sometimes do.</P><P>The minister wondered at what stage children become disengaged. 
One of the more depressing experiences of my previous existence was that every 
year, when I supervised the lunch queue on day 1 of the school session, I found 
that two or three children just starting secondary 1 would come up to me and say, 
&quot;When's my leaving date, sir?&quot; They brought that message, or attitude, 
from primary school, which was a little discouraging all round.</P><P>Looked-after 
children have always been with us. Let me go down the historical route. In the 
1950s, my mother-in-law taught briefly as a supply teacher in the Quarriers home 
in Bridge of Weir, which is no longer a children's home. She came back from that 
experience rather worried about the attitudes that she saw there. For example, 
when they went to church, everybody behaved utterly perfectly, with no pins dropped. 
The other matter that disturbed her was that, when she walked up and down the 
classroom rows, the children ducked to the left or the right as she passed. There 
was a strong, implicit message in that.</P><P>However, I know that all sorts of 
people with all sorts of talents came from that place. For example, an Edinburgh 
minister and a leading educational light came from there, as did a man I know 
who did not want just an ordinary job when he left, which was guaranteed in those 
days. He went out and negotiated an apprenticeship for himself. There were people 
there who, despite the worst circumstances, did the best that they could for their 
lives. Ian Jenkins was right when he talked about the need to discuss and remember 
the individual, which is why I gave those individual examples. Of course, many 
others fell by the wayside or were exported to Canada to work on farms, which 
was by no means an ideal solution.</P><P>I agree with Ian Jenkins that we must 
keep the individuals in mind. We talk about looked-after children as a body of 
people, but within that body are people who have a life and they are entitled 
to make the best of it. They need stability and a great deal of encouragement.</P><P>It 
is unfortunate that the problem is increasing. For example, in 2001-02, there 
were 10,960 </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18680">18680</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>admissions to residential establishments, which was a 13 per cent increase 
on the previous year. That is not good news for anyone.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: 
</strong>If we consider only the figures, we are in danger of not seeing the lives 
that are behind them. Individual children could have needed each of the admissions 
to residential care to which Mr Campbell referred.</P><P><strong>Colin Campbell: 
</strong>That probably takes us back to Johann Lamont's point, which was that 
many problems could be dealt with before children reach the point of having to 
go into residential care.</P><P>Another factor is that a third of looked-after 
children experienced four or more placement moves during their most recent care 
episode. What hope does that statistic hold for continuity of supervision and 
care, and for building relationships between staff and a child so that the child 
feels that they matter a great deal? Studies into such areas give the results 
that one would expect. For example, one study found that looked-after children 
with more standard grades were likely to have experienced fewer placement moves. 
However, statistics on placement numbers are not held centrally.</P><P>On foster 
carers, there are 4,500 foster children in Scotland and there is a shortage of 
650 foster families. In Edinburgh, a foster parent gets £59.80 a week, but in 
East Renfrewshire they get £116.16. We need a standard rate throughout the country. 
A survey by the Fostering Network, to which half of Scottish local authorities 
responded, found that 94 per cent of foster carers were paid below the recommended 
minimum weekly allowance. That issue must be addressed.</P><P>We all know that 
there is a shortage of social work staff. For example, in 1996, there were 38,300 
social work staff but, in 2001, there were 34,600. That is a 9.5 per cent fall 
in staffing levels.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Would Mr Campbell accept 
that the number of qualified social work staff and the number of people applying 
to get into social work training are rising? There is no doubt that there is an 
increased demand for social work staff. However, the number of qualified workers 
is rising.</P><P><strong>Colin Campbell: </strong>If it is rising, it is not rising 
quickly enough to deal with the individual problems that we care about. The number 
of whole-time-equivalent social work services fieldwork staff has fallen by 6 
per cent from 9,530 in 1998 to 8,979 in 2001. The number of day care staff in 
services for children has also fallen, from 703 in 1996 to 600 in 2001, which 
a 15 per cent fall.</P><P>The critical aspects that must be addressed are continuity 
in payment for foster parents and the problem of social work recruitment. The 
Executive </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18681">18681</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>is trying to address those issues, but it is too little, too late. Looked-after 
children merit, and must have, as much support as possible. We do not want another 
40 or 50 years to pass and this problem to go with them.</P><P><strong>The Deputy 
Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </strong>We have time in hand, therefore members 
may treat themselves to an extra minute if they so wish in their winding-up speeches.</P><P>12:00</P><P><strong>Karen 
Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab): </strong>I welcome the opportunity to continue to examine 
this issue and to consider how to make improvements.</P><P>I will begin by reference 
to a person I know. Sarah came to live with her foster carers at the age of 12. 
By the time that she was placed, she had been in residential care with her two 
brothers for six years. There had been numerous residential care placements that 
ended in a large residential care home. Before Sarah went into care, she lived 
with her mother and various &quot;uncles&quot; or &quot;dads&quot;, and was subjected 
to physical and mental abuse. The abuse took varied forms, one of which was having 
cigarettes stubbed out on her body. Mental abuse included watching her brothers 
being abused.</P><P>It is little wonder that when Sarah came to stay with her 
foster carers, she could not write her name, count or read the most basic words. 
For her, the care system was to keep her alive; education was somewhere much further 
down the spectrum of needs. She had very complex needs. She had little if any 
self-confidence and had severe behavioural problems, as did her brothers.</P><P>However, 
Sarah was lucky, because as a result of her placement and of her foster home setting, 
she went to a small secondary school. She was able to receive the support she 
needed from a dedicated member of staff who liaised with the family and with the 
school and provided support at difficult times. The member of staff drew up a 
learning plan that was relevant to Sarah's needs, which did not fit in with the 
five-to-14 curriculum because when she got to S1, the first secondary school class, 
she would not have qualified for P1, the first primary class.</P><P>By the time 
that Sarah left school, she could read, count, write and had some basic Scottish 
Vocational Education Council modules. She has gone on to find a job and to set 
up home for herself.</P><P>Sarah's experience is an example of the complex needs 
of children in care. For many of those children, education is not seen to be important. 
Therefore, we need to begin to work hard at a starting point for those children.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18682">18682</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Kay Ullrich is right; for many children in care, a foster care placement would 
be a good thing, but that brings with it other challenges. For someone who has 
only ever had a negative experience of family, fitting into a family environment 
is not easy and the process sometimes causes problems for the foster care family 
and their children. That results in a much more serious situation, because the 
children are then returned to residential care, having lost their belief in families 
and foster care. That is why it is important that, in placing for a foster care 
setting, foster carers are aware of the situation that they will be involved in 
and are fully briefed about the child who is coming to them. Foster carers must 
be supported in meeting the needs of that individual child.</P><P>In residential 
care, continuity of placement is important but is not always easy. Individuals 
are complex and sometimes they do not fit into the care situation in which they 
find themselves. We need to explore how to maintain their education, even when 
they move from one residential care placement to another. That is possible and 
can be beneficial.</P><P>We must study why the aftercare from school is not as 
effective as it should be. We need to examine why children and young people who 
are in care are not given the support that they need to do their homework, to 
find the space that they need or to be involved in extra-curricular activities 
that would help to improve their educational attainment and self-confidence. If 
they do not have self-confidence, they will not learn to the best of their ability.</P><P>The 
situation is complex, but I welcome the progress that has been made, particularly 
by my own local authority, South Lanarkshire Council, which has made progressive 
steps. All schools in that area now have dedicated staff members and home link 
workers who work in the community to try to bridge some of the gaps. Those are 
the kind of examples that we need to continue to develop. At the heart of the 
debate, however, we must always remember that we are talking not about statistics 
or about a group, but about individuals with complex and often difficult needs. 
For those individuals, the system up till now has failed them and the people whom 
they trusted most have failed them. The system that we put in place must not continue 
to fail them.</P><P>12:06</P><P><strong>Murdo Fraser (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): 
</strong>This has been a good debate, and we have heard some well-informed speeches 
from all sides of the chamber. The Conservatives will support the Executive's 
motion today, and we agree with much of what has been said by the minister&#151;which 
I am sure will disturb her. However, I echo what my colleague Brian Monteith said: 
that it is perhaps </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18683">18683</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>premature to be holding this debate on the basis of the information that is 
before us. We will not support the SNP's rather carping amendment, because there 
is not really enough evidence at the moment to support what the SNP is saying. 
Perhaps if we have a debate on the subject in a year's time, that will be the 
time to make the points that Irene McGugan made today.</P><P>As the minister acknowledged 
in her speech, educational attainment among looked-after children is poor; six 
out of 10 of those children leave school with no qualifications, compared with 
a national figure of around one in 20. That is not good enough, and I am pleased 
that the minister has acknowledged that. Looked-after children need stability; 
constant changes in their circumstances lead to low attainment levels, as Colin 
Campbell said in his speech.</P><P>Fewer than one in seven looked-after children 
live in residential care accommodation. Most are with relatives or friends. Of 
those who live away from home, a quarter have had more than three placements. 
That cannot be good, and the figures suggest that there is a link between poor 
attainment levels and instability in the home environment. We must do more to 
provide stability.</P><P>I want to respond to what Scott Barrie said in his rather 
bizarre argument about school exclusions. I am sure that we can debate school 
exclusions in more detail on another occasion, but there has been a sevenfold 
increase in violent incidents in the classroom since 1997. We would argue, and 
have argued, that that is a direct result of the policy of having targets to reduce 
school exclusions. If discipline in school is breaking down, as it seems to be, 
it is rather strange to suggest that we should tolerate violence in the classroom 
just because it is being carried out by looked-after children.</P><P><strong>Scott 
Barrie: </strong>That is not what I was saying. My point was that, disproportionately, 
looked-after children face a series of short exclusions. That is a matter of fact 
and it contributes to their education being disrupted. We cannot dissociate children's 
poor educational attainment when they are looked after and the fact that they 
are also, disproportionately, excluded from school.</P><P><strong>Murdo Fraser: 
</strong>I am obliged to Mr Barrie for clarifying his remarks. That was not what 
I took him to be saying earlier, but what he is saying is not necessarily an argument 
for changing the exclusion policy. His argument may, in fact, suggest that, if 
looked-after children have a series of temporary exclusions, they may perhaps 
be in the wrong environment to start with. Perhaps there are other, more appropriate, 
school settings for them to be placed in, rather than those in which they have 
that series of temporary exclusions.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18684">18684</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I want to make two specific points on other issues, the first of which concerns 
the use of schools in the independent sector. A number of local authorities, for 
reasons of scale, do not have the necessary provision within their area. They 
are happy to buy into provision from the independent sector, which provides a 
combination of pastoral care and an holistic approach to teaching that is not 
always reflected in local authority schools. I can think of two schools where 
there is such provision. One is the new school at Butterstone in Perthshire; the 
other, to which Sylvia Jackson and Brian Monteith referred, is Ballikinrain school 
near Balfron, which is run by the Church of Scotland's board of social responsibility&#151;the 
largest provider of care in Scotland outside the state. Those schools are run 
not for profit, but by charitable bodies to a high standard of service. I hope 
that the Scottish Executive will reaffirm its support for such institutions and 
the standard of care that they provide.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>When 
members are referring to specific schools or facilities, it is important to remember 
that we should work to ensure that the best facilities are provided for all young 
people. The Executive has always made it clear that for young people with complex 
needs, there will be a continued requirement for specialist provision.</P><P><strong>Murdo 
Fraser: </strong>I am obliged to the minister for that clarification.</P><P>Secondly, 
we must address why we need a debate about looked-after children in society. We 
cannot have the debate without considering the primary causes, one of which is 
family breakdown. My colleague Lyndsay McIntosh referred to the importance of 
the family unit. Government, in its broadest form&#151;I am referring not only 
to the Scottish Executive, but to the Government at Westminster and local authorities&#151;must 
ensure that we have policies that promote family life and try to keep families 
together. That means promoting marriage. We know that children who are brought 
up by married couples are nine times more likely to be with that couple at the 
age of 16 than those who are brought up by a couple who are not married to each 
another. Politicians must recognise that statistic. We should shy away from policies 
and stances that undermine family life and parental rights&#151;we saw some of 
that during the consideration of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill last week.</P><P>We 
shall support the Executive's motion, and we shall await developments and new 
statistics with interest. We look forward to revisiting the subject in the future.</P><P>12:12</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>There has been an outbreak of consensus 
in the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18685">18685</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>chamber this morning, in particular between Mr Monteith, Mr Fraser and the 
minister. Although I am always happy to welcome consensus, we should wait to see 
what the consensus is.</P><P>The consensus seems to be based&#151;I shall put 
it charitably&#151;on mistaking concern for action. The consensus in the chamber 
should be one of anger and outrage at the situation that exists in Scotland today, 
and about which we have heard. It should also be based on taking action and making 
progress.</P><P>This debate shows, as previous debates and reports have shown, 
that it is possible to have consensus as long as we recognise the key elements 
of the problem. In all those debates and statements&#151;there have been five, 
plus one that we introduced last year that dealt partially with the issue&#151;concern 
should have been expressed about the crisis in social work and the inability to 
build the social work profession in a way that makes a difference. That was the 
burden of the speeches from Irene McGugan and Kay Ullrich, both of whom have considerable 
experience, and it should focus where we are going.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: 
</strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>No; 
I shall finish what I have to say. The minister intervened on every speech and 
I do not doubt her genuineness for a moment, but her actions are lacking. We have 
to draw attention to that. The reality is that actions are lacking throughout 
the policy.</P><P>The Parliament could have agreed to make major progress on the 
matter, but it has not. One of the problems is that we do not have the statistics. 
I do not regard it as sufficient for a Government to say that, four years into 
its term, it does not know the nature of the problem. Such a comment is, however, 
marginally better than what Mr Jenkins said. He seemed to think that it did not 
matter whether we had the statistics; he just agreed that we still do not know 
the nature of the problem.</P><P>However, we know how awful the problem is because 
the statistics are in every report and statement. For example, we know that this 
Government said in its programme for government that it would reduce the take-up 
of residential accommodation by 10 per cent. However, we know that between 2000 
and 2002 the figure fell by half of one per cent. In fact, the number of admissions 
actually rose. We know that two thirds of those leaving care had no standard grades, 
whereas the equivalent figure for those who are not in care is 4 per cent. We 
know that 83 per cent of looked-after children had experience of truancy and 71 
per cent had experience of exclusion. We know that less than 1 per cent of looked-after 
children go to university. Finally, we know that 45 </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18686">18686</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>per cent of young offenders in custody in 2000 had spent some time in residential 
care. That is probably the most worrying statistic of all. Although we have known 
all those things for some time, apparently we do not know whether we are making 
any progress on them.</P><P>We have some other figures. For example, the number 
of social work staff has fallen by 9.5 per cent since the Tories left office. 
As Colin Campbell pointed out, the number of day care staff is down by 15 per 
cent.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell: </strong>No.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The member should 
let me explain.</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>The minister can explain 
it to the voters.</P><P>We know that some child care teams have 50 per cent vacancy 
rates; that there are vacancy rates of 10 per cent in children's services; and 
that there are vacancy rates of 12 per cent in residential services.</P><P>The 
minister has not just dropped in from Mars on this issue; in fact, she has a long 
and distinguished history of working on it. She has been an MSP since 1999; she 
was briefly a member of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee; she is the 
deputy leader of the Labour party; and she has been the Minister for Education 
and Young people since November 2001. Indeed, since 1997, she has been the fifth 
minister in this and the previous Administration with responsibility for this 
issue. However, we know that the statistics that I mentioned are true.</P><P><strong>Johann 
Lamont: </strong>What would Mike Russell do?</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>I 
will tell members what I will do. The pressure is on for us to take action, not 
to have words. The pressure is on for us to recognise the problem, which my colleagues 
have outlined. For example, we have problems with the existing social work situation 
and with retaining and recruiting social workers. The pressure is on for us to 
ensure that we get the statistics and that there is delivery.</P><P>There is consensus 
in the chamber for something effective to be done.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: 
</strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>No, 
I will not.</P><P>Although I think that such consensus exists throughout the chamber, 
it is not enough to mistake concern for action. Unfortunately, most of the debate 
has centred on expressing legitimate and deeply felt concerns that I have no doubt 
exist and on highlighting the feelings of outrage that we </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18687">18687</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>have such a situation in Scotland. However, we have still had no progress on 
this matter. We need that progress; after all, we have had five debates on this 
issue and people are depressed by the lack of progress. All we have are words. 
They might be warm words and they might be words of concern, but they simply fail 
those who have been failed for generations and are still being failed.</P><P>12:18</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Education and Young People (Nicol Stephen): </strong>Despite 
making some very personal remarks against the minister, Mike Russell failed to 
take a single intervention from her, even though she repeatedly asked him to give 
way. Moreover, he failed to make a single constructive suggestion about what he 
or his party would do to tackle the problems in question. Until that speech, the 
debate had been genuinely constructive and had contained some pertinent and knowledgeable 
speeches from members who care deeply about the issue. I regret the fact that 
we went so far off track during the shadow spokesperson's winding-up speech.</P><P>Cathy 
Jamieson highlighted the current position and the work that is going on to improve 
unacceptable outcomes for many of our young people. I will pick out some examples 
from the work that has been done to improve the situation over the past year and 
a bit and show how young people believe that it has made a difference to them. 
The work should not be seen as a one-off exercise. Instead, it is about putting 
in place principles of good practice and continuing to improve the situation year 
after year. We have a long journey ahead if we are to turn round the situation 
in Scotland.</P><P>The poor outcomes for young people show that we must start 
to provide good-quality help, support and care early and that we must continue 
to provide support right through their education. There must be a way of ensuring 
early support and, when necessary, early intervention so that young people do 
not lose faith in education and in the system and do not become lost in bureaucracy 
and inadequate management. When, as is the case, some local authorities have difficulty 
telling us basic information about the number and location of the looked-after 
children in their areas, what hope is there for the care of those children?</P><P>Some 
of the statistics that have been quoted by Brian Monteith, Irene McGugan, Cathy 
Jamieson and others are&#151;as has been said repeatedly&#151;unacceptable. It 
has been made clear that we will take action if local authorities are not delivering. 
The next step will be to meet the local authorities that are failing, in order 
to discuss their shortcomings and ensure that an action plan is in place.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18688">18688</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>We will not let up or let go on this matter. If it takes a fifth, sixth, seventh 
or eighth debate in the Parliament, we will hold those debates. Surely there is 
not a member of the Scottish Parliament who believes that the issue would have 
received elsewhere the scale of attention and focus that we have been able to 
bring to it over the four years of this new Parliament.</P><P>We know the statistics, 
because we are now gathering them&#151;some of them for the first time. We are 
gathering the statistics not only to have them and publish them for a debate in 
Parliament, but because we are determined to take action and turn the situation 
round.</P><P>Colin Campbell and Mike Russell should not exaggerate the situation&#151;they 
do not need to do so, as some of the statistics are bad enough. However, there 
have been improvements. If members read the report that has been put in SPICe 
today, they will see that there have been some improvements in local authority 
areas. From 1999 to 2001, the number of fieldwork staff for children and families 
has risen in Scotland by 30 per cent. There were 200 more new social work students 
in 2002 than there were in 1998.</P><P>The investment of £10 million that we made 
to improve the educational attainment of looked-after children was designed to 
kick-start the process. The young people who have benefited from that money have 
told us that it has worked for them. When a young person is given the tools that 
are necessary to learn, their focus changes and their ambition can grow. Many 
local authorities chose to purchase, for example, computers and educational software 
for their looked-after young people. Young people have said that they have found 
that equipment very helpful; it encourages them to do their homework and to continue 
course work out of school. Clackmannanshire Council used part of the money to 
provide an educationally rich environment in their residential unit. The importance 
of making access to books and quiet working areas a natural part of growing up 
cannot be underestimated and the new environment has proved popular with young 
people.</P><P>Cathy Jamieson said that the issue was about more than academic 
achievement. Some councils looked to boost young people's self-confidence and 
self-esteem, in the way that Ian Jenkins mentioned, to enhance life skills. Aberdeen 
Council paid for theatre and cultural events and paid coaching fees for dancing 
and swimming. The sadness is that looked-after children do not get some of those 
things already as a matter of course.</P><P>We said on publication of the report 
that local authorities had invested the money wisely to benefit children who are 
being cared for and, in the main, I believe that to be the case. If the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18689">18689</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>examples that Irene McGugan gave of the disappointment in some areas are accurate, 
I would share that disappointment and join the criticism, and take action in the 
future.</P><P>Local authorities recognised that different age groups have different 
needs and targeted the money where they believed that it would be most effective. 
Midlothian Council provided every looked-after child with a schoolbag pack so 
that they could go to school properly equipped. In the older age range, Perth 
and Kinross Council bought equipment to help a young person attend a further education 
course. Those are things that should be happening, but have not been happening 
in the past few years. They can make a real difference and&#151;allied to the 
&quot;Learning with Care&quot; recommendations&#151;should lead to real improvements 
in educational outcomes for young people in Scotland.</P><P>To achieve real improvements, 
we need to ensure that all the recommendations in &quot;Learning with Care&quot; 
are implemented, not only the three that Cathy Jamieson mentioned and on which 
the document that is now in SPICe reports. The examples that have been mentioned 
show that some councils are taking practical steps to implement the recommendations, 
but more should follow. Early support and early intervention in tracking the education 
status of young people are vital if those young people are not to fall by the 
wayside. We will keep a close interest in progress in all authorities and we expect 
year-on-year improvements, which we will report on to the Parliament. That there 
have been four debates on the matter already is a great advantage of having the 
Parliament; today's debate is the fifth. There is a real determination to achieve 
results. Prior to 1999, we would not have devoted the attention to the subject 
that we are devoting now.</P><P>As Cathy Jamieson said, our ambitions for looked-after 
young people have been too low for too long. Looked-after young people have been 
viewed as young people with problems from whom too much cannot be expected. That 
is simply the wrong approach and grows the problem. Every young person has potential, 
abilities, skills and a spirit that requires encouragement and nurturing. Every 
child deserves the best in education and life. Currently, we are not doing enough.</P><P>This 
morning, we have debated stark statistics that should force us to think hard when

(Mr George Reid): </STRONG>The first item of business this afternoon is the stage 
3 proceedings on the Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill. For the first part of the 
stage 3 proceedings, members should have with them the bill as amended at stage 
2, the marshalled list, which contains all the amendments for debate, and the 
groupings list.</P><P>Before we start, I draw members' attention to an error in 
amendment 171, which is on page 34 of the marshalled list. The first line of the 
amendment reads:</P><P>&quot;In schedule 12, page 92, line 2, at end insert&quot;.</P><P>However, 
it should read: &quot;In schedule 12, page 91, line 40, at end insert&quot;.</P><P>I 
will allow an extended voting period of two minutes for the first division following 
the debate on the first group of amendments. Thereafter, I will allow a voting 
period of one minute for the first division after a debate on a group. All other 
divisions will be 30 seconds.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Section 1&#151;The

and Minister for Justice (Mr Jim Wallace): </strong>Amendment 1 paves the way 
for a large number of amendments that are designed to make the text of the bill 
more coherent and accessible. The amendments will give a formal recognition to 
a category of burdens, to be called &quot;personal real burdens&quot;. Those are 
burdens that are held in a personal capacity rather than in relation to benefited 
land. For example, they include conservation burdens, which are to be held by 
a designated conservation body. The number of personal real burdens has increased 
since the bill was introduced&#151;indeed, some of the subsequent amendments this 
afternoon devise more of them&#151;and many sections contain unwieldy lists of 
each of the burden types. Defining them under the umbrella term &quot;personal 
real burdens&quot; will make the bill easier to understand&#151;although I accept 
that the word &quot;easier&quot; is used in a relative sense.</P><P>Amendment

<P>discharge burdens under the sunset rule. Amendments 211 and 212 simply reflect 
the fact that there might be no benefited property owned by an objector to a compulsory 
purchase order under the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) 
Act 1947.</P><P>As I have indicated, the other amendments implement the basic 
point of having a category of personal real burdens.</P><P>I move amendment 1.</P><P><strong>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I should register my interests, 
as I am an unpaid executor, an unpaid trustee and an unpaid director of a small

for alerting me to the purpose and effect of the Government's amendments. We consider 
that the clarity of the bill will be much enhanced by the use of the generic term 
&quot;personal real burden&quot;.</P><P>In relation to section 110, I have concerns 
about whether the term &quot;maintenance&quot; will cover the fees of architects, 
quantity surveyors and solicitors. If the minister is not able to give his view 
on that now, it would be helpful if he could write to me with the answer in due 
course.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I am grateful for the support that 
Lord James has given to the amendments. I understand what he says about maintenance 
costs and will try to get a response to him either in writing or when we discuss 
another amendment today, if I have the answer by then.</P><P><em>Amendment 1 agreed

housing burdens. Amendment 2 is grouped with amendments 10, 11, 183, 94, 197, 
198, 97, 77 and 215 to 217.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>Amendment 2 is 
designed to create a new personal real burden. In this case, the burden is a personal 
pre-emption burden, to be called a rural housing burden.</P><P>The amendments 
in this group have been lodged in response to amendments that Maureen Macmillan 
lodged at stage 2. She proposed that certain housing bodies that sell land in 
the interests of providing local community housing at affordable prices should 
be allowed to control the subsequent sale of the land by creating a burden over 
the property.</P><P>I am keen to support the work of such bodies and decided, 
following consultation, that the best way forward would be through the creation 
of a new personal pre-emption burden that would allow such housing bodies the 
first opportunity to buy back a property when it is to be sold. However, the use 
of the pre-emption will be limited to bodies on </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18692">18692</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>a list designated by Scottish ministers under subordinate legislation. The 
main purpose of those bodies will have to be the provision of housing in rural 
areas.</P><P>Personal pre-emption burdens that are held by rural housing bodies 
will be treated differently from other pre-emptions in two respects. First, instead 
of having 21 days in which to accept an offer, a body would have 42 days. As the 
Parliament will recognise, it can at times be difficult for such bodies to put 
together a financial package, so the 42 days will allow them additional leeway. 
Secondly, the body will not lose the right of pre-emption if it is not exercised. 
It will be available for later sales so that the body can step in if the land 
is being sold at a high value for private gain rather than for affordable local 
housing.</P><P>The pre-emption will be freely negotiated with the purchaser and 
could detail the terms under which, and price at which, the property could be 
bought back. It is possible, in the creation of a pre-emption, to specify the 
price at which the property can be repurchased. That provision could be used in 
these circumstances to allow the rural housing body to buy back the property at 
a similar price to that of the original sale. Clearly, it would be inequitable 
to force a body that had sold property at a deflated price, such as £30,000, to 
pay a market value of perhaps up to £80,000 for using the pre-emption.</P><P>I 
am confident that the new category of personal burden will facilitate the provision 
of affordable rural housing and address the concerns that Maureen Macmillan expressed 
at stage 2.</P><P>Amendments 10, 11, 77, 94, 97, 197, 198 and 215 to 217 make 
technical and consequential changes that arise from the main amendment, which 
is amendment 183.</P><P>I move amendment 2.</P><P><strong>Michael Matheson (Central 
Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I welcome the amendments. I have one question for clarification. 
Will the minister outline how he intends to compile the list of prescribed bodies 
that will be entitled to create rural housing burdens? Will those organisations 
have to apply to ministers directly, or will ministers send out some type of notification 
to interested parties so that they can flag up whether they wish to be on the 
order that the minister plans to lay at a later date?</P><P><strong>Lord James 
Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>A rural housing burden will give the rural housing 
body a pre-emption right when selling land. We welcome the provision. It is a 
step forward and is altogether reasonable.</P><P>Some of the amendments in the 
group meet the points that the Law Society of Scotland made. I place on record 
my gratitude to the minister for </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18693">18693</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>meeting the Law Society to go through some of the details about which it was 
concerned. As a result of that meeting, the amendments will greatly improve the 
bill. I express my thanks to the minister for having lodged them.</P><P><strong>Maureen 
Macmillan (Highlands and Islands) (Lab): </strong>I add my support to amendment 
2. I am grateful to the Executive for taking on board my concern. It was raised 
as a result of the Highlands Small Communities Housing Trust asking me whether 
I could help it to keep its right to control what happens to land that it has 
banked in remote areas with a view to giving that land to people who will get 
a rural grant to build a house. The trust was concerned that, if it was not able 
to impose a feudal condition, such houses could be sold off outside the community. 
The object of the trust is to keep housing in remote communities for people who 
live there permanently.</P><P>I am grateful to the Executive for considering the 
matter and finding a way forward. I was on the phone to the Highlands Small Communities 
Housing Trust only a few minutes ago and it asked me to express its appreciation.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Wallace: </strong>I welcome the general support expressed by Michael Matheson, 
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton and Maureen Macmillan. Amendment 183 is an illustration 
of how the Parliament works&#151;and works well. A genuine point was raised with 
an MSP by a group with an interest. The matter was brought to the Parliament and 
there was a willingness on the part of Justice 1 Committee members and the Executive 
to identify a way in which to meet what the committee recognised at stage 2 to 
be a genuine concern.</P><P>Michael Matheson asked how the list of prescribed 
bodies would be compiled. We intend to publish a draft list before the appointed 
day, so people will be able to make applications. It is important to hold proper 
consultation with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and with the 
trust that, with Maureen Macmillan, initiated the amendment.</P><P>Subsection 
(6) of the new section that amendment 183 will introduce states:</P><P>&quot;The 
power ... may be exercised in relation to a body only if the object, or function, 
of the body ... is to provide housing on rural land or to provide rural land for 
housing.&quot;</P><P>I hope that that will satisfy Mr Matheson.</P><P><em>Amendment 
2 agreed to.</em></P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> Group 3 
is on health care burdens. Amendment 3 is grouped with amendments 29, 64, 214, 
75, 150, 151, 153, 155 to 158, 220, 159, 162, 168 and 171.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: 
</strong>This group of amendments </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18694">18694</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>includes amendment 171, which, as you intimated at the start of proceedings, 
Presiding Officer, has been revised to take account of an error.</P><P>Amendment 
3 will introduce a health care burden as one of the exceptions to the general 
rule that burdens must benefit other land. The health care burdens are similar 
to the economic development value burdens that are available for local authorities.</P><P>Amendment 
29 is the main amendment in the group and introduces a new section. That new section 
provides for a new category of personal burdens on land, which will require no 
benefited property. National health service trusts will be able to create health 
care burdens in circumstances where they wish to sell land while ensuring that 
that land continues to be used for the purposes of health care. That could apply, 
for example, where land is being sold to a developer to build accommodation for 
hospital staff and nurses. The new health care burden should allow the health 
body to ensure that the land is developed for that purpose and to secure compensation 
if another type of development occurs. That could be achieved by imposing a burden, 
including a clawback condition, if there is likely to be a windfall increase in 
the value of the land as a result of the change in use. The new section specifically 
provides that the burden may comprise or include an obligation to pay money.</P><P>It 
is intended that health care burdens will also be available for the Scottish ministers 
to use in their property ownership role in relation to health boards. It will 
be possible for a body other than a health trust or the Scottish ministers to 
create a health care burden, but it would be necessary for that body first to 
obtain the consent of the trust or the ministers whom they intend to have the 
right to enforce the burden.</P><P>Amendment 214 builds on amendment 29 by allowing 
a feudal burden that was imposed in the past for the same purposes and that is 
enforceable by a health trust or the Scottish ministers to be converted into a 
health care burden. The remaining amendments in the group are consequential on 
amendments 29 and 214.</P><P>There is a strong public interest in the protection 
of public funds. The amendments in this group are motivated by the compelling 
argument that, when the public sector is selling or giving land for health care 
purposes, there should be the means of protecting the purpose of the transfer 
of the land and the public funds involved.</P><P>I move amendment 3.</P><P><strong>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>We support the amendments. The measure clearly 
favours NHS trusts or the Scottish ministers and the burdens would be available 
only for the purpose of </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18695">18695</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

of the NHS and we are glad to support the amendments.</P><P><em>Amendment 3 agreed

<strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</STRONG> Group 4 is on community burdens. 
Amendment 4 is grouped with amendments 177, 178, 19 to 22, 179, 25, 26, 180 to 
182, 63, 202 and 139 to 146.</P><P>14:15</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>This 
group contains technical amendments to the provisions relating to community burdens. 
Amendment 4 clarifies that, where a deed of variation or discharge is granted 
under section 32, there is no need for each and every person with the right to 
enforce a title condition to sign a deed of variation for that variation to take 
effect.</P><P>Amendments 177, 178 and 202 will ensure that a majority can impose 
a new burden in addition to being able to vary or discharge community burdens. 
That reflects no change in policy.</P><P>Amendments 19, 20, 22, 25 and 26 relate 
to provisions on the variation and discharge of community burdens by the owners 
of units within a community. The amendments simply make it clear that the units 
in question are units in a community of mutually enforceable community burdens, 
which are subject to the rules on variation and discharge under part 2 of the 
bill. Amendment 21 is a drafting change.</P><P>On amendments 179 to 182, section 
32 allows a majority to vary or discharge burdens applying to the community as 
a whole. However, a dissenting owner can apply to the Lands Tribunal for Scotland 
to stop the change. A successful objection would mean that the burden would be 
varied or discharged only by the owners who signed the deed trying to make the 
change&#151;that is, the majority. Those who did not sign should not be affected. 
The bill already provides for that in respect of a minority owner's right to enforce 
a burden, but it is possible that the language used means that a modified burden 
could be enforced against them. That is not desirable and amendments 179 to 182 
remove that possibility.</P><P>Amendment 63 will allow the granters of a deed 
of variation or discharge under section 34 to register the relevant deed. Amendments 
139 to 145 are largely technical drafting amendments to simplify the notes for 
schedule 4, which sets out the form of notice to be used to intimate a proposal 
to register a deed of variation or discharge under section 33 of the bill.</P><P>I

Deputy Presiding Officer: </STRONG>Group 5 is on the development management scheme. 
Amendment 5 is grouped with amendments 62, 87 to 93, 192, 204, 208, 127 and 73.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Wallace: </strong>Members will recall that the development management scheme, 
which was introduced at stage 2, is an optional example of good practice that 
owners will be able to adopt or adapt. The scheme was originally recommended by 
the Scottish Law Commission as a set of general principles. It can therefore be 
fine tuned to allow for circumstances of particular developments.</P><P>This group 
of amendments clarifies the operation of the application of the development management 
scheme. The amendments make it clear that the scheme, which will be set out in 
an order under section 104 of the Scotland Act 1998, will be the only scheme to 
be applied by deed of application under section 65A. That will avoid the possibility 
that rules may be applied by reference to a document that was not registered in 
the property registers. The amendments will mean that any additional rules to 
form part of the scheme&#151;permitting only residential use or prohibiting alterations 
or the parking of commercial vehicles, for example&#151;must be set out in the 
deed of application.</P><P>Amendment 88 makes it clear that the deed of application 
may vary the scheme as specified in the deed, but only in so far as the terms 
of the section 104 order permit. Amendment 90 is the principal amendment in the 
group. It will add a new subsection that specifically relates the development 
management scheme to the section 104 order to be made in consequence of section 
65A.</P><P>Amendments 62 and 92 are intended to confirm that the default rules 
in section 59, on the appointment and dismissal of a manager, do not apply to 
a manager appointed under a development management scheme. The scheme may be disapplied 
by registration of a deed of disapplication. It is possible for such a deed to 
create new burdens for the management of the development in future.</P><P>Amendment 
192 ensures that new burdens will not be imposed if there is an outstanding application 
to the Lands Tribunal for preservation of the scheme. Amendment 204 is largely 
technical, relating to the acquisition of land by agreement in circumstances in 
which it could have been acquired compulsorily.</P><P>Amendment 208 provides in 
section 93 that an order of the Lands Tribunal preserving a development management 
scheme may be registered in the property registers. The remaining amendments in 
the group are consequential.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18697">18697</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I move amendment 5.</P><P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>Most 
of the amendments in the group clarify that the development management scheme, 
and not any other scheme, will benefit from the provisions of the bill. That is 
entirely appropriate and we welcome the amendments.</P><P><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson 
(Stirling) (Lab): </strong>I welcome the development management scheme. The Sheltered 
and Retirement Housing Owners Confederation, with which I have been closely associated, 
has long been concerned about the issue. It is most welcome that transparency 
is to be brought to the accounting system and management of sheltered and retirement 
housing.</P><P>I would like the minister to confirm that owners of units will 
be responsible, possibly under the contract arrangements for the managing company, 
for using the new scheme or framework, which Westminster will develop and which 
will not be mandatory.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace:</strong> I do not want to anticipate 
every detail, but it would certainly be the case that the owners of a unit would 
require unanimity to get a development management scheme. However, even without 
a development management scheme, it would still be possible under an employment 
contract for accounting to be transparent, because the owners employ the manager. 
I know how important transparency in the accounts of such schemes is to the owners. 
I hope that Sylvia Jackson will be assured that the transparency that she seeks 
should be facilitated not only by the development management scheme, but by provisions 
in the bill as a whole. I welcome Lord James Douglas-Hamilton's support.</P><P><em>Amendment

Group 6 relates to specification of the amount payable in respect of an obligation. 
Amendment 6 is grouped with amendments 173 and 174.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: 
</strong>Amendment 6 is intended to clarify the operation of section 5(1). It 
distinguishes between an obligation to pay the whole cost of, for example, maintenance 
or repair and an obligation to contribute only a share or proportion of the cost.</P><P>If 
a real burden imposes an obligation to pay for the maintenance of a facility, 
the cost cannot be specified in the burden because it is impossible to know what 
the cost of maintenance will be at any point in the future. Some deeds may stipulate 
that the obligation is to pay for a specific share of the maintenance cost. Others 
may base the obligation to bear a share of the cost on feu duty or rateable </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18698">18698</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>value. In such cases, the burden sets out the way in which the proportion of 
the costs payable is to be arrived at.</P><P>The intention behind section 5(1) 
was to remove doubt in the existing law that it should not be necessary to specify 
an amount payable towards an obligation to pay some cost, as long as some method 
is provided for calculating liability.</P><P>Amendment 6 clarifies the distinction 
between a situation in which a real burden imposes an obligation to pay the whole 
of a cost and a situation in which the burden imposes an obligation to pay only 
a proportion or share of the cost. It distinguishes between the expressions &quot;defray&quot; 
and &quot;contribute towards&quot; to make it clear that an obligation to defray 
relates to paying the whole cost of an obligation, whereas an obligation to contribute 
towards relates only to an obligation to pay a share or proportion.</P><P>Amendment 
6 also makes it clear that a share or proportion of the cost can be arrived at 
in a way specified in the deed. By contrast, where an obligation is to pay the 
whole amount, there is no need to refer to the way specified in the deed by which 
a proportion can be arrived at.</P><P>I propose not to move amendments 173 and 
174. Having considered the matter with the benefit of advice from the Scottish 
Law Commission, we believe that the amendments are unnecessary. The common law 
already allows for rights of pre-emption as set out in the amendments. If the 
amendments were agreed to, that might cast doubt on deeds that are already extant 
and operating normally.</P><P>I move amendment 6.</P><P><em>Amendment 6 agreed

6&#151;Further provision as respects creation</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The Deputy 
Presiding Officer: </STRONG>Group 7 relates to the right of ownership held pro 
indiviso and the right of pre-emption. Amendment 175 is in a group on its own.</P><P><strong>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>I have lodged amendment 175 on behalf of the 
Scottish Law Agents Society as a probing amendment. The amendment is intended 
to support part-owners.</P><P>At present, real burdens, including rights of pre-emption, 
are incompetent in relation to pro indiviso shares. Section 4(6) of the bill restates 
the existing law. It has been recognised that rights of pre-emption continue to 
serve a useful purpose and should be retained. A right of first refusal is to 
be conferred on one owner over the property of another. If it is useful for one 
owner to have that </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18699">18699</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>right over another property, it could be even more useful for a pro indiviso 
owner to have it over the other pro indiviso shares.</P><P>Where title is taken 
in joint names, such a device could be usefully employed to prevent one owner 
from selling his share to a third party. I gave the minister notice of the case 
of Smith v MacKintosh, which appears on page 148 of<em> The Scots Law Times</em> 
of 1989. In that case, a daughter sold her property to live with and nurse her 
mother on the understanding that the mother's house would be put into joint names. 
However, while the mother and daughter were living together, the mother made over 
her share to a son and defeated the daughter's reasonable expectations.</P><P>Communities 
Scotland and its predecessor, Scottish Homes, have promoted shared ownership for 
many years. The complex shared ownership agreements that are necessary might be 
simplified by permitting pre-emption rights between owners. Amendment 175 could 
benefit arm's-length, pro indiviso proprietors. It might also be of use in time-share 
developments, although those are usually intermediated through trusts. Time-shares 
of salmon fishing, where titles are taken directly, might also benefit. I look 
forward to hearing what the minister has to say on the issue.</P><P>I move amendment 
175.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I thank Lord James Douglas-Hamilton for 
explaining the intention behind amendment 175. It appears that he seeks to allow 
the creation of rights of pre-emption over pro indiviso shares of property. As 
he indicated, the principal effect of that would be to give one pro indiviso owner 
the first option to buy the other share in the event that it came up for sale.</P><P>I 
have no objection in principle to the concept, although the cases in which the 
proposed provision might be necessary are few and far between. It is not clear 
whether a mother and daughter, or a husband and wife, for example, would want 
to put such an arrangement into a deed when everything was going swimmingly.</P><P>The 
difficulty with amendment 175&#151;and the reason why I ask Lord James Douglas-Hamilton 
to consider withdrawing it&#151;is that it is technically flawed. Section 6 does 
not appear to be the appropriate part of the bill for amendment 175 to seek to 
amend. Section 6 refers to the creation of burdens by importing them from a deed 
of conditions, which would have to have been registered before the appointed day. 
That means that any right of pre-emption that was caught by amendment 175 would 
have to have been set out in a deed of conditions that had been registered before 
the appointed day.</P><P>It is unlikely that many such pre-emptions exist, not 
least because it is unclear whether it is </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18700">18700</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>possible to create them under current law. Because of that uncertainty, the 
Scottish Law Commission recommended that it should be made clear that burdens 
could not be created over pro indiviso rights. I do not believe that it was Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton's intention to restrict pre-emption rights to those that 
were created after the appointed day by reference to pre-appointed day deeds of 
condition.</P><P>Amendment 175 is also flawed in the language that it uses. The 
insertion that it proposes would mean that the pre-emption would be treated as 
a right of ownership that was held pro indiviso. That cannot be the intention. 
The right of pre-emption is the burden, not the burdened property. The pro indiviso 
share would be the burdened property and the pre-emption would be created against 
that land.</P><P>Although there is some merit in the principle of Lord James's 
proposal, amendment 175 cannot be supported for serious technical reasons. At 
some stage in the future, legislation might be introduced that would allow the 
issue to be dealt with but, at present, I do not see how the proposal could work 
as intended. Therefore, I ask Lord James to withdraw amendment 175.</P><P><strong>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>If we assume that amendment 116 will be agreed 
to, the minister will have the power to make incidental or transitional provisions 
and to amend the bill. Therefore, it would be appropriate for me to withdraw amendment

<strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </STRONG>Amendment 7 is grouped with amendments 
8, 9 and 80.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>The amendments in this group seek 
to alter the rules on acquiescence in section 16. They arise from concerns that 
were expressed during the first two stages of the bill's progress. In his evidence 
to the Justice 1 Committee at stage 1, the solicitor Mr Bruce Merchant raised 
such concerns. Maureen Macmillan and Lord James Douglas-Hamilton took up those 
concerns and Lord James asked me to meet the Law Society of Scotland to discuss 
them. I can confirm that a productive meeting took place and that amendments 7, 
8, 9 and 80 are the result of it.</P><P>The effect of the changes will be that, 
where the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18701">18701</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>owners of benefited properties give consent to a breach of a burden, there 
will be no requirement for the consent of any tenant, any non-entitled spouse 
or proper life-renter.</P><P>14:30</P><P>The amendments will also clarify that 
only those who would actually be able to enforce the burden are required to give 
their consent. That means, for example, that consent is not needed from owners 
of a distant property who, in spite of having a title to enforce, would not have 
any interest in doing so because the particular breach would not be to the detriment 
of their property. In this case, a burden could be extinguished, but only to the 
extent of the actual breach, without the consent of that distant owner.</P><P>Amendment 
80 is a technical amendment to the provisions of section 111(1)(a). The amendment 
will mean that the meaning of the expression &quot;owner&quot; is applied to section 
16, which deals with acquiescence. That means that &quot;owner&quot; will be defined 
for the purposes of a section 16 consent in the same way as it is for a section 
15 discharge.</P><P>I move amendment 7.</P><P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: 
</strong>We welcome the amendments. I thank the minister for meeting the Law Society 
and for dealing with the matters so effectively.</P><P>I want to ask one question 
about amendment 9. If I may say so, it is not entirely clear what would happen 
to a burden in the event of the death of the person who has the interest to enforce. 
For example, is it envisaged that executors will, on the death of the person, 
be vested with an automatic interest to enforce? If the minister does not have 
the reply now, I would be most grateful if he could write in due course.</P><P><strong>Maureen 
Macmillan: </strong>I am not sure that I ever understood quite what was going 
on in this bit of the bill, but I know that solicitors in Inverness were extremely 
anxious that changes should be made. They felt that the bill would complicate 
conveyancing in a small number of cases if somebody had breached a burden. The 
solicitors were worried that the bill would mean more expense for their clients. 
I am pleased that the issue has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion and 
I thank the Executive for its interest in the matter.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: 
</strong>I thank Lord James and Maureen Macmillan for their support. Maureen Macmillan 
said that she was never quite sure of all the detail that lay behind the solicitors' 
concerns, which, it would be fair to say, were forcibly and firmly pressed. I 
can confirm that our meeting with Mr Merchant and with other members of the Law 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18702">18702</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Society's conveyancing committee was stimulating. Alasdair Morgan's laugh suggests 
that he does not believe that, but I can assure him that it was quite a good joust. 
We tried to tease out some of these difficult technical issues. I know that the 
concerns were motivated by the need to deal with the practicalities of the issues.</P><P>The 
Executive's policy is based on the principle of equal treatment for property owners. 
Although it may have been simple to operate, the old system of obtaining consent 
from a feudal superior to the breach of a burden had fallen into widespread disrepute. 
It is self-evidently more equitable to allow those with the most immediate interest 
in title conditions to enforce them.</P><P>The Executive's proposals will simply 
put communities with limited enforcement rights in the same position as those 
that already have full neighbour enforcement. It is worth emphasising that those 
schemes work perfectly well at the moment and that we are not aware that there 
is any problem with them. We are now extending that principle to other schemes. 
We expect the system to continue to operate satisfactorily in all communities.</P><P>In 
response to Lord James's question, title and interest in these real burdens&#151;as 
distinguished from the personal real burdens that we discussed earlier&#151;rest 
in the property rather than with the individual. Therefore, the real burden does 
not extinguish with the death of any owner. Those who, on the owner's death, step 
into the owner's shoes would certainly have a title. The interest would obviously 
depend on the particular circumstances of the case.</P><P><em>Amendment 7 agreed

Executive accepts that retirement housing should be expressly defined in the bill.

avoid or ignore the provisions of the bill by trying to persuade residents in

no express reference to retirement housing in the bill, it did not apply to those 
developments. As a result of what we intend to do to the bill, I hope that that 
scenario will not now arise.</P><P>I hope that members will be satisfied that 
the Executive has responded positively to representations that it has received 
on the definition of sheltered and retirement housing, as well as on other aspects 
of the bill that impact on forms of sheltered and retirement accommodation. In 
other amendments to be considered today, we are seeking to reduce the maximum 
period of manager burdens in sheltered housing to three years, and to introduce 
a requirement of prior consultation before burdens are varied or discharged. In 
addition to the other provisions of the bill&#151;particularly the introduction 
of majority voting rights&#151;we intend to introduce a substantial </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18704">18704</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>package of help for people who live in sheltered housing.</P><P>In conjunction 
with the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Act 2000, the bill will make 
a substantial change to prevailing arrangements for the management of such complexes. 
That will allow residents in sheltered and retirement housing to exercise a much 
greater degree of control over the developments in which they live.</P><P>The 
purpose of amendment 18 is therefore to revise the words that were inserted at 
stage 2, and to give effect to them.</P><P>I move amendment 18.</P><P><strong>Michael 
Matheson: </strong>I particularly welcome amendment 18, which introduces the term 
&quot;retirement&quot;. The minister will be aware that, at stage 1, the Justice 
1 Committee was persuaded by the Executive's argument that the term &quot;sheltered 
housing&quot; would suffice to ensure that retirement accommodation was included.</P><P>However, 
at stage 2 it became clear that concern remained about whether there was a possible 
loophole to be addressed. There was always the possibility that unscrupulous property 
managers or developers might try to use the term &quot;sheltered housing&quot; 
as a loophole, by saying that the bill did not apply to retirement accommodation. 
Amendment 18 closes the loophole and reduces the possibility of someone exploiting 
it.</P><P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>The clarification is important 
for those in sheltered and retirement housing. It is a response to legitimate 
representations and we welcome the amendments.</P><P><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central 
Scotland) (LD): </strong>The section in the bill that deals with sheltered housing 
has been greatly improved. It is welcome that the minister has improved it and 
made certain concessions. There are a couple of relatively minor issues coming 
up on which there is some dispute, but, as a package, the amended bill benefits 
the community in sheltered and retirement housing and is to be welcomed.</P><P><strong>Brian 
Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>It is comforting to see that the Executive 
has moved on the issue, in spite of the fact that it took the initial view that 
the word &quot;retirement&quot; did not need to be inserted. The Executive has 
recognised that that is a significant wish and has seen the merit in it, and it 
is to the great credit of the Executive that it has lodged amendments 18, 24, 
43 to 47, 61, 109 and 78. The changes that they will make will go a long way&#151;if 
not almost all the way&#151;to satisfying the wishes of those who have made representations

<P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I thank members for the welcome that they have 
given to the changes. It is right to say that we have changed, which is a tribute 
to those who identified an issue, persisted with it and persuaded ministers that 
to put the matter beyond doubt and to give reassurance&#151;which clearly was 
not given by the initial wording&#151;we needed amendments, which were initially 
introduced by Sylvia Jackson, and which are now clarified by the amendments in 
the group. It is an example of how what has sometimes been seen as a technical 
piece of legal legislation can bring some practical benefit to an important section 
of our community.</P><P>I pay tribute to the efforts that were made by the Sheltered 
and Retirement Housing Owners Confederation, and I also thank Age Concern Scotland 
for the advice that was provided to the Executive on this area.</P><P><em>Amendment 
18 agreed to.</em></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Section 28&#151;Power of majority 
to instruct common maintenance</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</STRONG> 
Amendment 176 is in a group on its own.</P><P><strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh (Eastwood) 
(Lab): </strong>I lodged amendment 176 to highlight the situation that faces pensioners 
who might enjoy only shared ownership of their flat in a retirement complex. The 
Executive clarified at stages 1 and 2 that the majority owner of a flat can exercise 
the unit's voting rights. However, my colleague Sylvia Jackson, through the Sheltered 
and Retirement Housing Owners Confederation, has highlighted that although some 
shared owners might own only 70 per cent or less of the equity, they are invariably 
responsible for 100 per cent of the maintenance and service charges. It would 
seem to be only fair that co-owners should divide the bill according to their 
share of the property. I would welcome clarification on that point from the Executive.</P><P>I 
move amendment 176.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>We do not believe that 
amendment 176 is necessary, because payments from co-proprietors are already dealt 
with in the bill. Section 11(5) contains a similar provision on the situation 
in which property is owned by more than one person. That section states:</P><P>&quot;If 
two or more persons own in common a burdened property as respects which an affirmative 
burden is created then, unless the constitutive deed otherwise provides&#151;</P><P>(a) 
they are severally liable in respect of the burden; and</P><P>(b) as between (or 
among) themselves, they are liable in the proportions in which they own the property.&quot;</P><P>If 
the title deeds, however, provide for a different split, the title deeds are given 
precedence. I think that Parliament would agree that it would not be </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18706">18706</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>appropriate to impose a mandatory rule across the board. It seems to be preferable 
to allow individuals to agree specialist arrangements for particular circumstances.</P><P>Section 
11 also provides for several liability in respect of burdens for payment, the 
advantage of which is that where neighbours seek payment in contribution of some 
common repair, they need not hunt down all the absent owners of a particular unit, 
or try to obtain information, or settle disputes as to each co-proprietor's share.</P><P><strong>Dr 
Jackson: </strong>I suppose that this is the same issue that I asked about previously, 
which is how the bill will be implemented. How would owners of a unit move so 
that 30 per cent of the maintenance were paid by the manager?</P><P><strong>Mr 
Wallace: </strong>The presumption is that the manager is liable for 30 per cent, 
or at least that the division is a 70:30 split. That is the first requirement. 
The second requirement is that there is nothing in the title deeds or contract 
between the parties that would declare otherwise. If, having voluntarily entered 
into an agreement, the title deeds reflect a figure of 100 per cent, the provisions 
in section 11(5) would not apply. That is, in some respects, the default position. 
If nothing else is said, and the parties have not reached an agreement, they will 
be liable in the proportions in which they own the property. Sylvia Jackson's 
example was a 70:30 split.</P><P>One would hope that in such circumstances, where 
the liability was clear, the manager or the person with the 30 per cent liability 
would pay up, because the alternative would be court action to recover the sum. 
That would be a further waste of time and money if it were evident that the sum 
was due.</P><P>14:45</P><P>If a party has no liability under the community burdens, 
section 28(2)(b) cannot require them to deposit any money. If the deeds set out 
the respective liabilities of the common owners, the owners can be required to 
deposit only the share that is specified in the deeds. Co-proprietors should settle 
that among themselves. When a formal shared equity arrangement has been made, 
the matter is likely to have been provided for in the contract. As section 11 
makes more comprehensive provision, I hope that Kenneth Macintosh is prepared 
to withdraw amendment 176.</P><P><strong>Mr Macintosh: </strong>I welcome that 
clarification. I understand that, unless co-owners sign a deed that binds them 
to pay 100 per cent of the maintenance and service charges, the default position 
is that they are liable for their own share. I welcome that and seek agreement 
to withdraw amendment 176.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18707">18707</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

under section 32. Consultation will take place by prior notification to all owners 
of sheltered housing before a deed of variation or discharge can be granted. The 
notification will be called a community consultation notice. Amendment 86 will 
have a similar effect to that which an amendment that Kenneth Macintosh lodged 
at stage 2 would have had. At stage 2, the Executive agreed to consider the points 
that were made in the debate on that amendment, so I am happy to have lodged an

147, which outlines the form of the notice that will be provided to residents,

authorities' plea for </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18709">18709</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>a special case to be made for them to be allowed to have development value 
burdens as economic development burdens. That category of burden was created and 
is to be found under section 42A of the bill. Typically it will permit an uplift 
in the price on the occurrence of a subsequent event, which one suspects will 
be the grant of planning consent for a particular development.</P><P>The view 
of the Scottish Law Agents Society is that that is a type of pecuniary real burden, 
which would more appropriately be dealt with by way of a standard security. However, 
the point at issue is that, at common law, pecuniary real burdens are ranked according 
to their recording date. Section 42A, however, is silent as to ranking.</P><P>The 
proposals that are set out in amendment 184 make explicit the ranking rules between 
an economic development burden and a standard security or floating charge. In 
respect of floating charges, we have anticipated the reform of the time of creation 
of a floating charge, which is presently the date of execution. The Scottish Law 
Commission's discussion paper &quot;Registration of Rights in Security by Companies&quot; 
proposes a change to the date of registration, which is consistent with Scottish 
theories of the creation of real rights by registration and publication.</P><P>I 
lodged amendment 184 as a marker to allow the issue to be examined before legislation 
on floating charges is introduced and before the Scottish Law Commission has examined 
rights in security. I look forward to hearing what the minister has to say on 
the subject.</P><P>I move amendment 184.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I 
am grateful to Lord James Douglas-Hamilton for airing the issue. Amendment 184 
seeks to treat a clawback arrangement that is set out in the economic development 
burden as if it is a debt that is secured by standard security. The payment that 
may become due under the economic development burden is not heritably secured 
on the land. It is therefore not appropriate to attempt to arrange a ranking between 
it and a standard security, which is a heritable security.</P><P>One of the purposes 
behind section 42A(3) is to allow local authorities to put in place clawback provisions 
without having to resort to standard securities. The ability of a local authority 
to tie to the land the personal obligation to pay, rather than to rely on a personal 
contract backed by a standard security, is exactly what is represented by the 
innovation in the law that has been made under the provisions of the bill.</P><P>It 
is therefore no accident that there are no provisions to rank the obligations 
that are set out in the burden with obligations that are secured by standard securities. 
Amendment 184 seeks to equate two types of obligation, which are&#151;and are 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18710">18710</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>intended to be&#151;quite different types of legal obligation.</P><P>Furthermore, 
amendment 184 is both unnecessary and unlikely to achieve its aims. It is unnecessary 
because only one party, which will be the local authority or Scottish ministers, 
will ever be entitled to payment in terms of the economic development burden. 
That is because section 42A(4) prohibits assignation of an economic development 
burden, which means that it is possible for the creditor to enter with complete 
confidence into contractual relations with the local authority in order to regulate 
what is to happen in particular circumstances and on occasions when the local 
authority would be obliged to discharge the burden. There is no need for a provision 
in the bill to allow the local authority to enter into such contracts.</P><P>Amendment 
184 is unlikely to achieve its aims, because the debt constituted by the economic 
development burden runs with the land and will not be extinguished on the sale 
of a burdened property by heritable creditor. It is therefore of little use to 
the creditor to have a security ranked ahead of the obligation to pay the local 
authority, because no purchaser is likely to accept the continuing obligation 
to pay the local authority unless that obligation is reflected in the price. I 
hope that that explanation will allow Lord James Douglas-Hamilton to seek to withdraw 
amendment 184.</P><P>The other amendments in the group are technical amendments. 
The purpose of amendment 38 is to make it possible for the holder of an economic 
development burden to discharge the burden, even in circumstances in which the 
holder has not completed the title to the burden in the property registers.</P><P>Amendment 
213 makes it clear that a local authority or Scottish ministers will have title 
to enforce, and will be presumed to have interest to enforce, a converted economic 
development burden that has been the subject of a notice registered in the property 
registers.</P><P>Amendment 67 will incorporate the terms of sections 41 and 42 
of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Act 2000 on registration of a 
notice to convert an appropriate feudal burden into an economic development burden. 
Section 41 of that act requires the superior to give notice to the burdened proprietor 
of the proposal to re-allot the burden. Section 42 of that act stipulates that, 
where the superior has a choice of the procedures under the 2000 act that may 
be used to save a burden, the various courses open to the superior are mutually 
exclusive.</P><P>Amendment 74 clarifies the definition of economic development

that the word &quot;constitutive&quot; might be too restrictive and that it might 
exclude some cases where the so-called constitutive deed&#151;in this case, typically 
a deed of conditions&#151;does not impose the burdens, but instead sets out the 
terms of the burdens that are subsequently imposed by a conveyance that refers 
to the constitutive deed. The amendments will remove that problem.</P><P>Amendment

is that all common schemes should receive equal treatment under the bill and that

aim is to have a consistent and coherent pattern of enforcement rights for common 
scheme burdens.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18713">18713</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Amendment 190 will further that principle and make some technical changes that 
will ensure that every scheme in which it has been attempted to impose burdens 
will, in the future, be a community for the purposes of the bill. That will be 
achieved by breathing life into burdens that the original seller tried but failed 
to create because of deficiencies in the technical conveyancing language that 
was used in the deed. A burden will be treated as having been imposed and a property 
will be treated as being subject to a common scheme if that would have been the 
case had a benefited property been expressly nominated.</P><P>Amendments 190, 
55 and 56 will ensure that rights will not be created accidentally in respect 
of breaches that occur before the appointed day. Amendments 39, 41 and 57 are 
consequential amendments.</P><P>A burden that gives a power to appoint a manager 
can be considered to be a facility burden in that it regulates the management 
of facilities that are of benefit to other land. Amendment 53 will exclude manager 
burdens from the category of facility burdens for the purposes of section 51. 
That is because a manager burden confers on a specified person the power to act 
as, or to appoint, a manager&#151;it is a personal real burden. The effect of 
section 51 is to give rights of enforcement of facility burdens to all owners 
of land whose property benefits from the facility or constitutes that facility.</P><P>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton seeks to delete section 48A, the purpose of which is to 
ensure that amenity burdens in all housing estates or tenements should be mutually 
enforceable by the owners of houses in the estate or flats in the tenement. A 
large majority of respondents to the consultation were in favour of amenity burdens' 
being treated in the same way, irrespective of whether rights had been granted 
expressly to owners in the original deeds, or had arisen by implication under 
existing law. Section 48A also creates rights for neighbours in schemes where 
at present only the feudal superior can enforce.</P><P>The law in this area is 
exceptionally difficult and complicated and the question whether neighbours can 
enforce burdens in common schemes often relates to the particular legal language 
that an individual solicitor adopted. When the feudal system is abolished, there 
might be many estates where there could be burdens but no one to enforce them. 
The conditions play a valuable role in protecting the amenity of housing; without 
them, the quality of the housing stock might be eroded. That is a particular issue 
in mixed-tenure estates, where council tenants have expressed their right to buy. 
The Executive regards as highly unattractive the prospect of housing estates in 
which none of the amenity burdens are </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18714">18714</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>enforceable. It is important to remember that many so-called amenity burdens 
impose a duty to maintain properties.</P><P>Because of the uncertainty of the 
existing law, the almost arbitrarily different treatment of similar schemes and 
the danger of having schemes in which there are no enforcement rights, we decided 
to treat in the same way all properties that are related to one another and that 
are subject to a common scheme. The idea is to allow each neighbour in a scheme 
of related properties to enforce the conditions that affect the community, regardless 
of the particular conveyancing language that was used at the time of sale. That 
is what section 48A will achieve.</P><P>Amendment 185 would remove section 48A, 
which would perpetuate some of the inadequacies of the existing law. The amendment 
would continue the confusion over whether, and by whom, burdens in a scheme are 
enforceable and it would result in there being communities in which nobody could 
enforce the title conditions. The arguments behind amendment 185 concentrate too 
much on the perspective of an owner trying to avoid a burden that affects his 
or her property&#151;from that point of view, burdens might be regarded as a nuisance 
that should be made easy to remove. That is one reason why some people argue against 
an extension of enforcement rights to all owners in common schemes.</P><P>Our 
position is that those obligations can play a valuable role in protecting the 
amenity of housing estates. It is dangerous to assume that a benefited proprietor 
trying to enforce a burden is always acting unreasonably. In fact, the burdened 
proprietor agreed to the burden when the property was purchased. The bill therefore 
adopts a balance between treating burdens as useful rights and allowing ways for 
them to be removed if appropriate. It is not difficult to think of circumstances 
in which neighbours would have a real interest in enforcing burdens that, if they 
were breached, might have a seriously detrimental effect on the value and enjoyment 
of their property.</P><P>Section 48A simply applies the position for the large 
number of schemes where rights already exist to the minority of communities where 
there will be no rights following feudal abolition. Those schemes will be put 
in the same position as the majority of housing estates; I cannot readily see 
why that should pose a problem. It is not as if the burdens do not already exist; 
it is just that enforcement lies solely with the superior. It is clear to me that 
neighbours are the most appropriate custodians of those rights.</P><P>As a corollary 
to the extension of rights, the bill will introduce a wide variety of tools to 
assist in the legitimate discharge of unnecessary burdens. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18715">18715</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Amendments 7, 8, 9 and 80 will also simplify the obtaining of consents in relation 
to breaches. I remain committed to the policy of treating amenity burdens in housing 
estates in the same way, irrespective of how they came into being. I fail to see 
how the alternative that is proposed by amendment 185&#151;a patchwork of housing 
schemes, some with amenity burdens and some without&#151;is in any way preferable.</P><P>I 
conclude by pointing out that amendment 185 would have a particularly unfortunate 
effect on tenements and sheltered housing complexes. From its inception, the bill 
has provided that, in those cases, the rights of a feudal superior should pass 
to the neighbours. If section 48A were deleted, the owners of many flats in tenements 
and of some units in sheltered housing would find that there was no one to enforce 
the amenity burdens from which their properties benefited. I am fairly confident 
that that is not the intention of amendment 185. I hope that, in speaking to the 
amendment, Lord James will reflect on what I have said and be prepared not to 
move it.</P><P>I move amendment 39.</P><P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: 
</strong>Presiding Officer, I had prepared a substantial speech. However, in view 
of the minister's having replied before I gave the speech, it is unnecessary for 
me to go into detail. This is an area in which even the specialist practitioners 
are not certain as to the interpretation. On the basis of the decision in the 
case of Pepper v Hart&#151;that authoritative statements made by a minister can 
be relied on in court and by practitioners in practice&#151;will the minister 
please confirm that everything that he has just said can be relied on as being 
entirely authoritative and that practitioners will be absolutely safe if they 
stick to the guidance and the interpretation that he has just given?</P><P><strong>Mr 
Wallace: </strong>That is a challenge. I confirm that what has been said has been 
said in good faith and to the best of my ability on the advice received. It is 
my interpretation of what is proposed not only by the bill as it stands, but by 
the amendments to which I have spoken. I repeat one statement that I made in the 
context of amendment 190, which was that a burden will be treated as having been 
imposed and a property will be treated as being subject to a common scheme if 
that would have been the case had a benefited property been expressly nominated.

there seems to me to be an element of double standards because the rules for the 
owners of sheltered housing units are different from the rules for the owners 
of other units in a community. If the latter want to appoint a manager or seek 
a variation or discharge of community burdens, a simple majority in favour will 
be required. However, the owners of sheltered housing units will require a two-thirds 
majority. I would be grateful if the minister would explain those double standards.</P><P>I 
would also be grateful if the minister would explain exactly how a simple majority 
or a two-thirds majority are to be measured. Would that be done through a secret 
ballot? Alternatively, would it require the written consent in the case of a simple 
majority of more than half the owners or, in the case of a two-thirds majority, 
of at least two thirds of the owners? Could it be calculated by simply counting 
heads at a public meeting that was specifically called to decide the matter? If 
a majority is to be measured by a ballot, would a two-thirds majority be calculated 
as two thirds of the valid ballot papers that were returned, or would it be calculated 
as two thirds of ballot papers issued, which would mean that the measurement would 
be of two thirds of those who were eligible to vote?</P><P>All that reminds me 
of Roseanna Cunningham's dreadful namesake&#151;but not relation&#151;George Cunningham,

a majority of those who voted in the referendum supported the proposal, but the 
40 per cent hurdle was not overcome. The consequence was that the people of Scotland 
were robbed and had to wait 20 years for a Scottish Parliament to end the democratic 
deficit that we had to suffer.</P><P>I want sheltered housing residents to have 
the maximum say in the running of their own affairs, including the appointment 
and, if necessary, dismissal of a manager. In some cases, a two-thirds threshold 
might be difficult to achieve if a high proportion of sheltered housing residents 
were unable to vote because of illness or other circumstances. I understand that 
the bill as drafted required a three-quarters majority and that the Executive 
was persuaded to lower the threshold to two thirds. I welcome that step, but I 
ask the Executive to consider my amendments 186 and 188, which would require a 
simple majority rather than a two-thirds majority.</P><P>I move amendment 186.</P><P><strong>Michael 
Matheson (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I have some sympathy with Dennis Canavan's 
amendments 186 and 188. The minister will be aware that the committee considered 
the issue carefully at stages 1 and 2 and acknowledged that the threshold of 75 
per cent, which the bill as drafted set, was too high. However, I acknowledge 
that core burdens play a fundamental part in the service that is provided within 
sheltered and retirement accommodation.</P><P>The committee received evidence 
from SHOC, which detailed a case in which a complex had been able to achieve, 
with considerable effort, a majority of 74 per cent in favour of change. That 
example illustrated clearly that the threshold of 75 per cent was too high. If 
my recollection is correct, at stage 2, Kenneth Macintosh lodged an amendment 
that sought to reduce the threshold to 60 per cent, whereas I lodged an amendment 
to reduce the threshold for changing core burdens to a two-thirds majority. The 
Lord Advocate, who represented the Executive that day, accepted my amendment. 
I believe that the two-thirds majority strikes the right balance, given that core 
burdens affect fundamental services within an establishment. Those burdens are 
different from other burdens that have been referred to. The two-thirds majority 
is in line with what the committee broadly recommended at stage 1 and I hope members 
continue to support that position.</P><P>15:15</P><P><strong>Mr Macintosh: </strong>I

<P>discussion of the issue at stage 2 is the inappropriate behaviour of certain 
property developers who exercise control over retirement complexes against the 
wishes of the residents. The bill introduces several safeguards to try to prevent 
that from happening in future, but there remain concerns, particularly over voting 
rights. In many cases, developers retain flats within a complex specifically to 
benefit from the votes conferred by those units.</P><P>At stage 2, the committee 
voted unanimously to support one amendment&#151;there was one abstention in the 
vote on another amendment&#151;on preventing the developer from exercising votes 
against the wishes of retirement home owners. It is fair to say that members of 
the committee endorsed the principle that retirement complexes should be run in 
the homeowners' interests, not as income-generators for property companies. Of 
course, what happens in practice is not that the developers own half of a complex&#151;they 
need only to control half a dozen or so votes effectively to dominate the complex.</P><P>Older 
people living in retirement flats are looking for security. They do not want to 
battle with the management company or to make a fuss&#151;they want to agree, 
not to challenge. In the words of one resident, &quot;Some will sook up to the 
warden and keep in their good books&quot;&#151;in other words, they will not complain 
because they do not want to think that when they pull the alarm cord, the warden 
might be a little slow in responding.</P><P>I do not wish to imply that most management 
companies or wardens do not do an excellent job or that they do not go out of 
their way to look after residents, because they do. However, we should not delude 
ourselves that the more unscrupulous will not, and do not, take advantage of this 
vulnerable group. Recently, I have discovered that certain companies are going 
round my constituency, buying up flats in retirement complexes and subletting 
them. Their motives for doing so are unclear, but I believe that residents have 
every right to be suspicious. Not only does that practice turn the complex into 
a source of income for the very people who will be running it, but we know from 
past and present experience that it will be used as a back-door method of retaining 
control and preventing home owners from making decisions in their own interests.</P><P>I 
certainly do not wish any discriminatory provisions to scupper the benefits that 
would flow from the bill. However, I want to hear how the Executive intends to 
tackle the real anxieties and concerns of retirement home owners throughout Scotland 
and to empower them further to take full control of their own affairs.</P><P><strong>Donald

<P>argument was not along party lines but was about how we addressed the specific 
issue of introducing real democracy into sheltered housing. Dennis Canavan has 
a strong argument for pure democracy, with his proposal of a majority based on 
51 per cent of those voting. On the whole, the committee felt that, as Michael 
Matheson argued, because the provision refers to the core burdens, the threshold 
should be slightly above half of those voting if such vital changes in the essential 
running of the complex are being made. Democracy involves a bit of protecting 
minorities as well as giving free range to the voice of the majority. Like other 
members of the committee, I settled&#151;arbitrarily, I suppose&#151;on two thirds 
as a reasonable majority.</P><P>I have considerable sympathy with Kenneth Macintosh's 
arguments. Some awful tales were given to the committee&#151;I had previously 
heard tales from pressure groups as, I am sure, other members have done&#151;of 
the bad behaviour of some management companies and managers. There is a serious 
concern about preventing the owner of a whole block from dominating the proceedings 
by subletting and using those tenants' votes. I would be interested in the minister's 
response as to why he does not accept that point. It is perhaps one of the few 
points on which there is still a need to put pressure on the Executive to make 
a concession.</P><P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>I have considerable sympathy 
with the position that Dennis Canavan has spoken of today. Having attended a number 
of meetings at which people who live in sheltered and retirement housing complexes 
were also present, I can say that that position has been expressed forcefully 
by those people.</P><P>The Cunningham amendment to the Scotland Act 1978 ensured 
that everyone who was eligible to vote was counted as part of the result. Achieving 
51 per cent under such a system is quite difficult, as those who do not bother 
to take part will be counted as voting against the proposal. I cannot picture 
a situation in which hordes of militant retired people would try to overturn the 
core burdens brought in to protect their rights.</P><P>I fully support Kenneth 
Macintosh's amendments 187 and 189. I, too, expressed concerns during stage 2 
about managers or other interested parties buying up a small number of units in 
a complex to maintain control over the complex from a minority position. I am 
grateful for the fact that the minister recognised those concerns and reduced 
the threshold from 75 per cent to 66 per cent. However, as Donald Gorrie said, 
although the offer of a 66 per cent threshold was gratefully accepted, it does 
not go far enough. The 66 per cent threshold is too high, especially given that 
everyone who is eligible to vote will be counted in </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18720">18720</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the final result.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>The policy that underlies 
the criteria behind the voting percentage that we are discussing is, as Donald 
Gorrie, Kenneth Macintosh and Michael Matheson have indicated, to do with the 
fact that there are certain elements to sheltered housing that are so fundamental 
to the operation of that kind of housing that they should not be removed or changed 
merely by a simple majority. That proposition was put forward and strongly supported 
during the consultation stage.</P><P>The Justice 1 Committee also considered the 
matter and concluded that a 50 per cent majority was not enough but that a 75 
per cent majority was too high. Indeed, paragraph 29 of the stage 1 report says:</P><P>&quot;The 
Committee believes that certain burdens regulating a sheltered housing development 
are so fundamental that they require a higher level of protection than simple 
majority voting to ensure the development does not wholly lose its character as 
a sheltered housing development. However, it is not clear to us that a 75% majority 
is the appropriate majority.<STRONG>&quot;</STRONG></P><P>The Executive gave an 
assurance that we were prepared to revise the 75 per cent majority downwards. 
I believe that, to that end, an amendment in the name of Michael Matheson was 
accepted at stage 2 by the Lord Advocate on behalf of the Executive.</P><P>As 
has been indicated, the bill as drafted stipulated a three-quarters majority. 
As a result of the consultation process, I believe that the two-thirds majority 
is appropriate. Amendment 186 aims to reduce that to a simple majority and amendment 
188 would allow a simple majority of owners to vary or completely remove some 
of the most important aspects of sheltered housing. Many people buy into sheltered 
housing for some specific services that give that accommodation its character, 
such as alarms, intercoms, medical rooms and wardens' flats. I do not see why 
it would be in the interests of owners to alter those rights except in exceptional 
circumstances. If a change were felt necessary, it would seem to be a sensible 
precaution to provide for a special majority to ensure that there was a sufficient 
body of owners in favour of that change. That is why&#151;to answer Dennis Canavan's 
direct question&#151;there is a difference between the provisions for sheltered 
housing and those for other housing developments.</P><P>Our proposal is not a 
matter of treating the owners of sheltered housing in a patronising way; rather, 
it is a way of ensuring that people who have bought into a complex specifically 
because of the special facilities that it offers do not see those features removed 
except in circumstances in which there is substantial support for change.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18721">18721</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>As the Justice 1 Committee considered those provisions fully and supported 
the amendments that introduced them, I hope that Dennis Canavan will accept that 
the matters have been gone into in detail, that an effort has been made to strike 
the right balance and that that balance is at two thirds. The special majority 
provisions apply to core burdens. There are no such provisions for the appointment 
of managers.</P><P>With regard to how the votes are to be counted, section 50(5) 
sets out that the majority shall</P><P>&quot;be construed as a reference to the 
owners of at least two thirds of the units in the development&quot;.</P><P>The 
majority is two thirds of the units, not of those who vote.</P><P>On procedures, 
the bill is not prescriptive. It would be for those in the development to come 
to their own arrangements as to what kind of procedures they wish to pursue.</P><P>Amendments 
48 and 49 seek to reverse Kenneth Macintosh's amendments 23 and 24, which were 
agreed to at stage 2. As we have heard, those amendments essentially remove the 
rights attached to units that a developer owns in respect of decisions about conferred 
powers of a manager or about the variation or discharge of a core burden in sheltered 
housing. I recognise the intention that lay behind the provisions of stage 2 amendments 
23 and 24, but after considerable consideration, I believe that they cannot remain 
in the bill.</P><P>The provisions do not comply with the principle of majority 
rule. Within a majority decision-making process, the legitimacy of a decision 
derives from the fact that everyone has a say and that the will of the owners 
of a majority of properties within a community prevails in deciding what is best 
for that community. It does not seem fair to exclude some owners or to allow for 
the possibility of a minority deciding what is best for the community as a whole.</P><P>However, 
the main reason for seeking the removal of the provisions is the Executive's view 
that they are incompatible with the European convention on human rights. To deny 
a developer who owns units in a complex rights while other owners retain theirs 
is to interfere unfairly with the developer's property rights and to discriminate. 
The bill cannot be left as it stands because of that failure to comply with the 
ECHR.</P><P>I listened to what Kenneth Macintosh said and I understand that he 
has addressed the ECHR problem by lodging amendments 187 and 189, which also attempt

<P>I readily acknowledge that Kenneth Macintosh is trying to devise the best scheme 
for residents in sheltered housing accommodation, but I am unable to support his 
alternative proposal. It seeks to deny a particular group of people their property 
rights without sufficient reason. The mere fact of an owner having rented a property 
out does not remove their interests. The provisions of amendments 187 and 189 
seem to be designed to catch not only developer landlords but others who buy into 
retirement accommodation that, for example, they may let out to their parents. 
Such owners would be treated less favourably than owner-occupiers for very little 
reason.</P><P>I never like to rest cases on the drafting of amendments, but there 
are other drafting problems with amendments 187 and 189 because of the use of 
the term &quot;sublet&quot;. Its use means that the amendments do not catch all 
units that are let out to tenants, as only units that are sublet would be affected. 
By definition, a property cannot be sublet until it is first let, but the developer 
who retained units or bought them back to let would not be subletting them; he 
would be letting them and therefore entitled to a vote. It would seem odd to treat 
someone who was letting property differently from someone who was subletting it.</P><P>That 
does not mean that I do not sympathise with the concerns expressed by Kenneth 
Macintosh that a developer who has retained a large number of units might seek 
to abuse that position. I stress, however, that the bill provides extensive safeguards 
for the minority in any majority decision making. Indeed, at the committee's request, 
amendment 86 inserts a new section on the requirement for prior consultation.</P><P>As 
I have indicated, the bill will represent a major change for owners of sheltered 
accommodation, who will have much more say in their own affairs. We have tried 
to listen to the points that have been made to us and have further strengthened 
the position of those who live in sheltered homes at each stage of the bill's 
progress.</P><P>However, in acknowledging the particular concerns that have been 
raised in the debate and which underlie Kenneth Macintosh's amendments, we believe 
that it is right and proper for the Scottish Executive to examine the issues further 
on the basis of the evidence and for that examination to inform the development 
of policy. On that basis, I inform members that the Executive will commission 
a study into the issues that Ken Macintosh has raised. We will be happy to consult 
him on the terms of reference for that study, and my officials and I will be happy 
to meet him to begin that process as soon as possible. Therefore, I hope that 
he will be prepared not to move amendments 187 and 189</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18723">18723</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>15:30</P><P><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>I listened carefully to what the 
minister and other members said, particularly Michael Matheson and Donald Gorrie. 
Having heard the arguments, I accept that there is a case for a two-thirds majority 
in the matter of a variation or discharge of core burdens.</P><P>However, I do 
not accept that the same argument applies in the case of the appointment of a 
manager. The minister has said that a two-thirds majority is not required for 
the appointment of a manager. He may correct me if I am wrong, but my reading 
of the bill is that it is. Section 50(5) begins:</P><P>&quot;In relation to a 
sheltered housing development ... section 27 of this Act applies with the following 
modifications&quot;.</P><P>It then specifies</P><P>&quot;a majority ... of at 
least two thirds&quot;.</P><P>Section 27 is headed &quot;Power of majority to 
appoint manager etc.&quot; Unless the minister can tell me that my interpretation 
of the bill is wrong, I am inclined to push amendment 186 to a vote. As I said, 
I accept that there is a case for a two-thirds majority in the event of a variation 
or discharge of core burdens.</P><P><strong>Mr Macintosh: </strong>Perhaps I can 
be of help. Only paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 27(1) apply under section 50(5). 
The appointment and dismissal provisions, which are specified under paragraphs 
(a) and (d), do not apply in this instance, which is why a simple majority will 
decide on the appointment or sacking of a manager.</P><P><strong>Dennis Canavan: 
</strong>I invite the minister to intervene to confirm that that is the correct 
interpretation.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I am grateful to Ken Macintosh&#151;what 
he says is the case. I refer Dennis Canavan to section 50(5), which he is trying 
to amend through amendment 186. The subsection says:</P><P>&quot;section 27 of 
this Act applies with the following modifications ... in subsection (1), the reference 
to the owners of a majority of the units in a community shall, for the purposes 
of paragraphs (b) and (c) of that subsection,&quot;</P><P>require a two-thirds 
majority.</P><P>Section 27 makes an exception. Under paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
section 27(1),</P><P>&quot;Subject to section 50(5)(a) ... the owners of a majority 
of the units in a community may ... confer on any such manager the right to exercise 
such of their powers as they may specify&quot;</P><P>and</P><P>&quot;revoke, or 
vary, the right to exercise such of the powers conferred under paragraph (b) above 
as they may specify&quot;.</P><P>Paragraph (a), which covers the power of </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18724">18724</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>appointment of a manager, and paragraph (d), which covers the dismissal of 
a manager, are not covered by the special majority arrangements. Rather, they 
are covered by a simple majority.</P><P>With the Presiding Officer's indulgence, 
I will, while I am on my feet, confirm what I said earlier that I would confirm. 
My memory was indeed correct: the manager burden will cease to be exercisable 
either once the developer in whose favour it is constituted does not own a unit 
in the development or after three years. Therefore, a manager burden created before 
November 2001 will be extinguished on the appointed day.</P><P><strong>Dennis 
Canavan: </strong>I am grateful to the minister for that explanation. I now see 
that there is a distinction between the appointment of the manager, and the conferring 
on that manager of the right to exercise certain powers and the revocation of 
those powers. However, the minister has still not given an explanation as to why 
a two-thirds majority is required in order to confer the powers on the manager 
or to revoke the exercise of such powers on the part of the manager.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Wallace: </strong>Section 50 in effect amends the operation of section 27 in the 
way that Dennis Canavan describes, with the result that powers can be conferred 
on a manager only under the terms of section 27(1)(b), or revoked or varied under 
the terms of paragraph (c) with a majority of at least two thirds. It is not possible, 
even under section 27(1), for such a two-thirds majority to confer a power on 
a manager to sign a deed under section 32 that could vary or discharge core burdens. 
Any such power could only be to sign a deed to vary non-core burdens. That takes 
us back to the important point about ensuring that what people have bought into&#151;including 
the special nature of the accommodation and all that goes with that&#151;is not 
diluted by a simple majority decision. Rather, given the nature of the accommodation, 
the higher threshold has to be passed before there can be a change. The arrangement 
has been arrived at to protect those people's interests.</P><P><strong>Dennis 
Canavan: </strong>We could have a situation where the owners of the units in a 
sheltered housing complex were dissatisfied with the way in which the manager 
was exercising certain powers that they had given them and, as a result, wanted 
to revoke the powers. If as many as 65 per cent of the owners want a revocation 
of the powers from the management and 35 per cent want the management to retain 
the powers, why on earth should the 35 per cent be dictating to the 65 per cent? 
I think that I should push amendment 186 to a vote, but I am prepared not to move 
amendment 188, because I accept that there is a case for a two-thirds majority 
regarding variation or discharge of core burdens.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18725">18725</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

</STRONG>Group 18 concerns the power to dismiss the manager. Amendment 191 is 
in a group on its own.</P><P><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>I will be brief, 
because the principles of amendment 191 are very similar to those of amendment 
186. If the residents of a sheltered housing complex are not satisfied with the 
standard of service that a manager provides, they should have the power to sack 
that manager and to appoint someone else. Under the bill, as many as 65 per cent 
of the residents might want to change the manager, but they would be powerless 
to do so because the other 35 per cent wanted no change. The 35 per cent minority 
might be pals of the manager or might have been intimidated by them, but why should 
35 per cent of residents be able to dictate to 65 per cent?</P><P>I move amendment 
191.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I will try to be equally brief. Where 
the title deeds make no provision for the dismissal of a manager, a simple majority 
of 51 per cent may dismiss them under section 27(1)(d). However, where the title 
deeds specifically make provision for the dismissal of a manager, the Executive 
does not in general propose to disturb </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18728">18728</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>an arrangement into which parties have entered freely. However, the Executive 
accepts that it would be unreasonable for developers to include in title deeds 
a provision that required a very large majority&#151;for example, of 80 per cent&#151;to 
seek a manager's dismissal. In that case, the manager could not be dismissed if 
79 per cent of residents were opposed to and only 21 per cent were supportive 
of him. If such a large majority were required, it might be impossible to dismiss 
a manager.</P><P>For that reason, the bill contains a provision that&#151;quite 
exceptionally&#151;will override the provisions in the title deeds. Section 59 
provides that, irrespective of what the title deeds say, a two-thirds majority 
of residents will be able to dismiss their manager. A two-thirds majority is given 
as the highest acceptable limit for the dismissal of a manager; it is not the 
routine requirement. If there is no such provision in the title deeds, the simple 
51 per cent majority will apply.</P><P><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>I am not 
at all impressed by the minister's argument. Sometimes people have no choice about 
title deeds: things are done on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. The Parliament ought 
to ensure higher standards of justice than those that are in the title deeds. 
The minister has already accepted that principle by including section 59 in the 
bill.</P><P>As we have accepted the principle of having higher standards than 
those that are in the title deeds, I hope that we will accept the provision for 
a simple majority. Otherwise, the will of the minority may prevail over that of 
a substantial majority of residents. For example, an incompetent, crooked management 
could continue to hold sway simply with the votes of a 35 per cent or so minority.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Wallace: </strong>Section 59 does not provide that there must always be a two-thirds 
majority, even when there are title deeds. It overrides the title deeds to impose 
an upper limit of two thirds. Therefore it limits what the developers can put 
into the title deeds. The limit can be lower if they choose, but it cannot go 
beyond two thirds.</P><P><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>I still think that there 
is a case for having a simple rather than a two-thirds majority. Will the minister 
explain what happens in the case of existing title deeds? Will the provision be 
retrospective? Will existing title deeds be overridden? The minister is nodding 
his head.</P><P>15:45</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>The intention is to put 
a ceiling on the majority that is required. I am fairly confident that the provision 
applies retrospectively.</P><P><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>I am grateful

<P>for that explanation. However, I still think that if a simple majority of the 
owners of units in a sheltered housing complex are very dissatisfied with the 
management, they ought to be able to do something about it. We should remember 
that we are talking about reasonable people who will not just hire and fire managers 
at will. The proposed dismissal stage is a last resort, which will apply only 
if a manager has proven to be so incompetent that the majority of the people who 
live in that sheltered housing complex want a change of management. They ought 
to have maximum opportunity to bring about such a change. Therefore, I intend

<P>the church or manse where more than one person is entitled to enforce the right.</P><P>Amendment 
172 is consequential. The amendments address the problems that Maureen Macmillan, 
Donald Gorrie and the Church of Scotland raised. The church has told us that it 
is satisfied with what is proposed and we will be discussing with it the terms 
of the statutory instruments that are to follow.</P><P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: 
</strong>Is the minister absolutely certain that all the Church of Scotland's 
concerns have been addressed and that all relevant matters can be dealt with by 
statutory instrument?</P><P><strong>Maureen Macmillan: </strong>I thank the Executive 
for responding to the concerns of the Church of Scotland General Trustees over 
the problems they experienced when trying to sell redundant parliamentary churches 
that were built about 200 years ago with public money. The title deeds for those 
churches were granted by the heritors who gave land at the time. Those deeds gave 
adjoining landowners the right of pre-emption over the church when it fell out 
of use.</P><P>The negotiated price was usually in the landowner's favour and discussions 
about when the deal would be concluded were open ended. That meant that there 
were times&#151;as still happens today&#151;when churches remained in a state 
of disrepair for many months while negotiations took place.</P><P>The conditions 
were therefore out of date for a long time. As the Deputy First Minister said, 
there could now be more than one adjoining proprietor and fairness would dictate 
that the price paid should reflect the market value. The church should be able 
to indicate a closing date for offers rather than have negotiations drag on for 
as long as two years, as they did in a recent case.</P><P>A letter that I received 
today from the Church of Scotland General Trustees said that they appreciated 
that the Executive had dealt with the matter to their satisfaction and I add my 
thanks to theirs.</P><P>16:00</P><P><strong>Donald Gorrie: </strong>One of the 
great attractions of politics is that one is always learning new things. As a 
result of the Church of Scotland approaching Maureen Macmillan and me on this 
issue, I discovered all about parliamentary churches, which I knew nothing about 
before. I will not bore members with that now. There is an issue, and the minister 
has addressed it reasonably. The issues are complex, and they cannot all be adjusted

Wallace: </strong>I welcome the fact that members recognise that we have been 
able to address the concerns that were expressed at stage 2. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton 
asked whether the Church of Scotland is wholly satisfied. The church had sought 
a statutory direction to identify one property as that which benefited from the 
reversion. It has not been possible to allow that, because it would remove without 
compensation the property rights of other proprietors. However, as we heard from 
the letter to which Maureen Macmillan referred, we have been able to provide a 
mechanism to facilitate the identification of one property and to fix a price 
for the land. In the procedure, it is likely that each possible pre-emption holder 
will be allowed to make a bid, with the right going to the highest bidder. The 
Church of Scotland has indicated that it is content with that proposal. As I have 
indicated, we will discuss with the church the terms of the statutory instrument

<strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</STRONG> Amendment 81 is grouped with amendments 
82 to 84.</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>It will be widely recognised in the 
chamber that the bill contains a number of complicated and technical issues. I 
pay tribute not only to my officials, but to the work of the Scottish Law Commission, 
which has pored over the bill at every stage to try to ensure that all points 
are picked up and that there is consistency throughout, but inevitably there is 
a risk that some small drafting faults have been overlooked, which could have 
unintended consequences. A small deficiency in language may create major problems 
in interpreting legislation.</P><P>The bill will create a new system of land regulation 
in a post-feudal Scotland, and is likely to be used daily by conveyancers. It 
is important, therefore, that any problems that are identified should be resolved 
quickly. As a result, amendments 81, 82, 83 and 84 will allow Scottish ministers 
to make consequential and corrective amendments by subordinate legislation to 
the bill once it becomes an act. That power, of course, is intended only for minor, 
technical amendments. The proposed changes build upon a provision that was made 
at stage 2 to allow ministers to make necessary changes to other legislation as 
a consequence of the bill. Such a power has been taken in other acts. Parliaments 
should be cautious about such a power, so any change under it would be subject 
to an affirmative resolution of the Parliament.</P><P>I move amendment 81.</P><P><strong>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>The amendments are necessary. They provide a 
power for the Scottish ministers to make corrective amendments. Because of the 
enormous complexity of some of the issues that are involved, it is conceivable 
that matters might come to light that the bill does not properly cover. In such 
circumstances, it is justified that the minister proceeds as proposed.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18739">18739</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Donald Gorrie: </strong>Any parliamentarian must be cautious about 
giving powers to ministers to mess about with bills that they are passing, but, 
as the minister said, the bill is complex and enters new territory in trying to

errors will need to be put right. Despite having a suspicious mind, I see no ways

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr Murray Tosh): </STRONG>The next item of business 
is the debate on motion S1M-3777, in the name of Jim Wallace, that the Title Conditions 
(Scotland) Bill be passed.</P><P>16:08</P><P><strong>The Deputy First Minister 
and Minister for Justice (Mr Jim Wallace): </strong>As was said when we discussed 
the last group of amendments, the bill is highly technical. It deals with complicated 
terms in the title deeds of property and uses detailed legal language. Despite 
that, the bill will be an important piece of legislation that has a striking impact 
on the way in which property in Scotland is treated.</P><P>From 28 November 2004, 
Scotland will have a completely new system of land tenure. The feudal system will 
be abolished, and the bill makes a major contribution to that new system. It will 
be a modern system that will replace an outdated and discredited system. It is 
worth dwelling on that for a moment, because the bill is not glamorous; it has 
not hit the headlines. However, it is a classic piece of law reform. It has examined 
the common law with a cool eye. Where the law was sensible and useful, it has 
been reproduced in the codes that are set out in the bill's opening sections. 
Where the law was uncertain, it has been clarified. Where the law was poor, it 
is being replaced.</P><P>Often, the Parliament takes criticism, but it would have 
been difficult for any Administration to find the time to pass such a bill at 
Westminster. The bill will be a piece of sensible, measured legislation that will 
affect most of Scotland's citizens and have a wide-ranging effect on how people 
live for many years.</P><P>As is obvious, it has taken some time to craft the 
bill. The issues are complicated and the Executive is grateful for the comments 
and suggestions that it received. The bill was proposed by the Scottish Law Commission 
in 2000 and was amended before introduction in response to the Executive's consultation 
exercise in 2001.</P><P>The delay between stage 3 of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure 
etc (Scotland) Act 2000 and today is the result of the need to consider every 
aspect of the legislation in painstaking detail. I recall the suggestion that 
was made in the stage 1 debate that the two bills should have been combined. However, 
I think that that would have resulted in a monstrously enlarged and complex piece 
of legislation.</P><P>Taking each bill separately has allowed us to distinguish 
between the removal of feudal tenure and the creation of replacement rules. Once 
the appointed day is passed, the Abolition of Feudal </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18742">18742</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Tenure etc (Scotland) Act 2000 will have served its purpose and the Title Conditions 
(Scotland) Bill will be the legislation that conveyancers use on a day-to-day 
basis.</P><P>The Executive endeavoured to respond to comments that were made by 
interested parties and to accommodate their concerns. We amended the bill at stage 
2 to reflect several recommendations from the Justice 1 Committee. The recommendations 
were primarily concerned with time limits in general and, specifically, with the 
voting threshold for changing fundamental characteristics in sheltered housing. 
We included provisions to allow for the introduction of a development management 
scheme to act as a best-practice tool for developers in creating housing communities. 
We also provided for local authorities to protect land that they sell cheaply 
for economic development.</P><P>Further amendments have been agreed today. We 
have introduced a health care burden to assist national health service trusts 
when selling land. Following consultation with the Law Society of Scotland, we 
have simplified the process of obtaining acquiescence to a breach of a burden. 
We have introduced a new type of burden to assist the providers of affordable 
rural housing. A large number of technical amendments were also lodged, and I 
express my gratitude to members for their forbearance as we have gone through 
each of those amendments.</P><P>Quite properly, a number of amendments were lodged 
on the issue of sheltered housing. Although the bill is not the appropriate vehicle 
for a general reform of the law on sheltered housing, I am confident that the 
bill should facilitate greater accountability and empower owners of sheltered 
housing complexes to take their own management decisions if they so wish.</P><P>The 
continued and detailed additions to the bill as it has progressed reflect the 
tremendous effort that has gone into its passage. With that in mind, I pay tribute 
to the Justice 1 Committee. The committee may have been somewhat daunted at the 
size and technical nature of the bill, but it dealt tirelessly with a large number 
of technical amendments at stage 2 and, having taken evidence, produced an excellent 
report at stage 1, as a result of which we were able to make further amendments 
to the bill.</P><P>I also record our appreciation of and thanks to the Scottish 
Law Commission. The commission, some of whose representatives may be in the public 
gallery, conducted a comprehensive review of Scots property law over the past 
decade. The Scottish Law Commission's involvement continued beyond the submission 
of its reports. During the passage of this bill and the Abolition of Feudal Tenure 
etc (Scotland) Act 2000, the commission </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18743">18743</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>continued to provide detailed advice and support to my officials and me, which 
we valued greatly. The Scottish Law Commission's efforts have led directly to 
the abolition and replacement of the feudal system. The commission has also proposed 
reforms to the law of the tenement, upon which the Executive intends to consult 
as soon as possible.</P><P>I express my gratitude to all others who made suggestions. 
I very much believe that the wide array of changes that have been made as a result 
have resulted in an improved bill, which will fill the vacuum of feudal abolition, 
remove defects in the current law and provide a firm foundation for a modern system 
of property law in Scotland. I am grateful in particular not only, as I said, 
to members of the Justice 1 Committee and its officials and advisers, but to the 
officials in my department. From the volume and technicality of the amendments 
that we have seen today, it is obvious that officials made considerable and strenuous 
efforts to ensure that the bill is a piece of legislation on which we can lay 
solid foundations for a modern future system of property law in Scotland.</P><P>I 
move,</P><P>That the Parliament agrees that the Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill 
be passed.</P><P>16:14</P><P><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland) (SNP): 
</strong>I will be brief. The bill proved to be one of the most complex pieces 
of legislation that we have dealt with in my three and a half years on the Justice 
1 Committee and its predecessor committee, the Justice and Home Affairs Committee. 
I am particularly grateful that my colleague Roseanna Cunningham gave me the opportunity 
to take responsibility for the bill on behalf of the Scottish National Party. 
I have thoroughly enjoyed monitoring its progress through the committee stages 
and in the chamber today.</P><P>I agree with the minister that the bill is a complex 
piece of legislation that will have a significant impact on property law in Scotland. 
To those who say that the bills that the Parliament passes do not affect them 
in their daily lives, I say that this is a bill that will affect the many people 
who purchase property throughout Scotland.</P><P>I, too, place on record my gratitude 
to the clerks to the committee, who, as ever, have been first class in preparing 
papers for members. I give particular recognition to Scott Wortley, who was special 
adviser on the bill to the committee. He has considerable expertise in the field 
and I am amazed that he can be so enthusiastic about such a complex subject. His 
support, assistance and guidance to committee members, where appropriate, were 
invaluable.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18744">18744</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>As the Deputy First Minister stated, along with the Abolition of Feudal Tenure 
etc (Scotland) Act 2000, the bill is one in a series of pieces of legislation 
to reform property law. A number of changes were made to the bill at stage 2, 
as well as this afternoon&#151;I mention in particular changes to the provisions 
for sheltered and retired accommodation, which enhance the bill considerably.</P><P>The 
bill is a good illustration of the process. Organisations made representations 
to the Justice 1 Committee and to members directly, and the Executive was prepared 
to listen, acted accordingly and changed the bill, which was to organisations' 
benefit. I warmly welcome that action.</P><P>Members might be interested to note 
that, if we pass the bill this afternoon, we will repeal several enactments. One 
of those is the Registrations Act 1617. It will be repealed only in part, but 
the Redemptions Act 1661 will be repealed completely. Those must have been some 
pieces of legislation, because they have lasted so long, but one would expect 
that, coming as they did from a time when Scotland was formulating acts as an 
independent nation. I am sure that none of us will be around to find out whether 
the bill lasts as long as those two acts have.</P><P>I hope that members will 
support the Executive and pass the bill this afternoon.</P><P>16:17</P><P><strong>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I, too, thank the clerks to 
the Justice 1 Committee and Scott Wortley for the excellence of their work.</P><P>We 
welcome the bill for a number of reasons. We believe that it will achieve far 
greater clarity in the law. It will reduce the number of outdated conditions. 
At the same time, it will have the benefit of enabling solicitors acting for clients 
in land transactions to ascertain the law relating to real burdens from a single 
source.</P><P>For those who wish to alter the conditions relating to the ownership 
of their property&#151;such as a burden that obliges the owner to maintain or 
contribute to the maintenance of a common facility, conveyancing will be much 
simpler.</P><P>The overall purpose has been to achieve clarity in the law and 
to restate the law in codified form. That has been welcomed in general by the 
Scottish Law Agents Society. It considers that redefining the perimeters of real 
burdens and servitudes is a welcome and sensible proposal.</P><P>Similarly, the 
Law Society of Scotland's working group has welcomed the bill, and considers that 
when it is enacted, there will be significant </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18745">18745</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>improvements to the law of real burdens in Scotland. It considers that clarification 
of the law of real burdens is helpful, since the area is currently, in many respects, 
uncertain and complex. The bill seeks to make substantial improvements.</P><P>Members 
have received a number of complaints about the management of owner-occupied sheltered 
housing developments, primarily relating to owners not being consulted on proposals 
for the maintenance of properties, service charges and the appointment of wardens. 
The general effect of the bill is to remove control from the developer and give 
it to the owners. That is a welcome change.</P><P>The only omission from the bill 
is the reform of the law on tenements, although I note the intention to consult 
on that. I hope that legislation will be introduced in the next session of Parliament.</P><P>I 
have one reservation about the bill. The subject is enormously complex and is 
reminiscent of dusty documents, wigs and gowns. In the process of modernisation, 
the Executive saw fit to lodge more than 100 amendments for Parliament to consider 
within a limited time scale. As I mentioned earlier, the issues are so complex 
that even specialist lawyers are less than totally certain in every case about 
the possible interpretations.</P><P>I would like to put down a marker: if the 
act turns out to be deficient in a number of detailed respects, the Parliament 
and the Executive&#151;which is accountable to the Parliament&#151;should revisit 
the subject. We have no second chamber and it will be some time before all the 
implications are known, which is why we have not opposed what I would describe 
as the Henry VIII provisions in section 116, which gives ministers enormous powers. 
If I may say so, the measures are illiberal ones for a Liberal Democrat minister 
to introduce, but they are justified in this case because they give us the certain 
knowledge that the bill will not be the final word if there is specialist evidence 
that it should be amended in the public interest.</P><P>We are content and, indeed, 
happy that the bill should proceed.</P><P>16:20</P><P><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander 
(Paisley North) (Lab): </strong>As others have said, the bill is certainly the 
most technical bill with which many members of the Justice 1 Committee have been 
involved, which is why we are rather glad to have got through it. I echo the congratulations 
and thanks that Michael Matheson, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton and the minister 
offered to the various people, including the clerks and advisers who assisted 
us in trying to make sense of the bill's complex detail.</P><P>Members will be 
glad to know that I will not rehearse any of that detail. Instead, I will use 
my </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18746">18746</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>time to commend the Executive for the way in which it has responded to the 
issues that back benchers raised at every stage, of which I will give a couple 
of examples. Considerable safeguards for sheltered housing tenants have been sought 
and won by, among others, Ken Macintosh and Sylvia Jackson. Although neither of 
them are members of the committee, they took up the interests of their constituents 
and, even though the European convention on human rights intervened at the last 
moment, progress has been made.</P><P>Maureen Macmillan and Lord James Douglas-Hamilton 
doggedly pursued the issues about acquiescence that were raised at the committee, 
and, ultimately, the Executive listened. Maureen Macmillan sought to ensure that 
bodies that sell land to provide affordable social housing do not find that those 
houses are subsequently sold on, which might threaten small communities. Finally, 
Donald Gorrie and Maureen Macmillan championed the concerns of the Church of Scotland 
and tackled the issue of rights of pre-emption over the sale of parliamentary 
churches and manses. The list goes on.</P><P>In the area of health care burdens, 
the Executive's decision to make it possible for health boards to decide on appropriate 
sites for future buildings&#151;whether on an existing health board site or elsewhere&#151;is 
a welcome step. I also want to mention the Executive's decision to create the 
illiberal powers to which Lord James Douglas-Hamilton referred. I do not say this 
out of self-interest, but although those powers might be illiberal, the decision 
takes the matter away from the Justice 1 Committee's agenda and sends it back 
to the Subordinate Legislation Committee. If members of that committee want to 
receive some hints and tips, we would be happy to oblige.</P><P>As members have 
said, the bill is detailed, but the big picture is that it will create a new system 
of land regulation for the post-feudal Scotland that the Parliament has inaugurated. 
Whatever the dryness of the legal language, the bill will be used daily by conveyancers 
up and down the country.</P><P>There is one outstanding big-picture issue that 
members of the committee from all parties want to leave with the Executive to 
tackle. Away back in the 15<SUP>th</SUP>, 16<SUP>th</SUP> or 17<SUP>th</SUP> century, 
when some of the laws that we are updating were first conceived, perhaps by a 
former Scottish Parliament, the purpose was no doubt to identify people's obligations 
to their neighbours in relation to the property in which they lived. The committee 
felt that the bill does not address fully our obligations to our neighbours, particularly 
those that relate to shared services and common grounds. Although the bill is 
a huge step in the right direction, there was a universal desire among committee 
members to take the next step in rebuilding </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18747">18747</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>communities, and to consider, through the housing improvement task force, how 
mixed-tenure estates might be better managed. We must also consider how, in the 
21<SUP>st</SUP> century, we can take our obligations to our neighbours as seriously 
as they were taken when the issue was first debated more than 400 years ago.</P><P>I 
end by simply commending the Executive for listening. The bill process has been 
everything that the consultative steering group hoped for from the Parliament. 
It is a huge step forward in modernising property and land legislation in Scotland.</P><P>16:25</P><P><strong>Donald 
Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>Other members have covered the ground 
well. It is interesting to hear from what Wendy Alexander said that what appears 
to be a dry and technical bill is all about creating communities. We still need 
such things as the law of the tenement, but the bill is a major step towards the 
creation of real communities. It should also encourage members of future committees 
that are landed with very technical bills. Most of the committee members started 
knowing nil about the subject, but by bringing together ministers' explanations, 
the useful lobbying by particular groups with specific problems, the advice of 
our excellent adviser, who understood the subject very well, and negotiation with 
the minister, we have produced a good bill.</P><P>I am sure that changes will 
be made to the bill in due course. Nonetheless, it shows that the committee system 
can work even in dealing with a very technical bill that people might think a 
bunch of politicians would not be skilled to deal with. The minister deserves 
great credit, as do the other people who have been mentioned. I hope that we have 
done a good day's work today.</P><P>16:26</P><P><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) 
(Lab): </strong>I begin by reiterating the comments that I made at stage 1. I 
whole-heartedly welcome the bill, especially as it addresses the issues that were 
raised with me by my constituents and through the Sheltered and Retirement Housing 
Owners Confederation. In particular, I thank Marie Galbraith, who was in the public 
gallery earlier with some of the SHOC members, and John McCormick, who among others 
met a cross-party group of MSPs at the Parliament during the passage of the bill.</P><P>Since 
the stage 1 debate, substantial steps have been taken to address the issues that 
SHOC raised. Those include the extension of the definition of sheltered housing 
to include retirement housing; the reduction of the maximum five-year duration 
for manager burdens to three </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18748">18748</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>years; the introduction of majority decision making with respect to real burdens; 
special two-thirds protection for burdens that provide sheltered housing with 
its special character; and an undertaking to consider the question of prior consultation 
before burdens are altered. Today, we also talked about shared equity regarding 
maintenance charges.</P><P>The only outstanding issue, which we have not been 
able to address today for reasons relating to the European convention on human 
rights, is the issue that was raised by Ken Macintosh regarding the letting of 
property by developers, whose powers could increase if that was taken to excess. 
We will need to keep an eye on that issue, and I welcome the on-going study that 
the minister mentioned.</P><P>Another matter that was raised at stage 1 was the 
development management scheme, which we whole-heartedly support. We are working 
with the Westminster Government on that scheme, which will be a good step forward 
in providing accounting systems for owners. I asked the minister for clarification 
of the scheme and its implementation. As the Lord Advocate indicated at stage 
2, when the development management scheme is applied, it will bind all the properties 
in the development. Therefore, the terms of the scheme will be binding on each 
of the owners, regardless of how many properties they own. A manager's&#151;or 
a management company's&#151;responsibility will be outlined in the terms of appointment, 
and the scheme will provide terms for his or her appointment and duties. That 
is good news.</P><P>Finally, I thank all the MSPs, including Ken Macintosh, Dennis 
Canavan, Brian Adam, David Davidson, Margaret Smith and John Young, who came along 
to the meetings that we had with SHOC throughout the passage of the bill. I also 
thank the minister for being so receptive to the recommendations that we made. 
As he said, the bill is more a property law reform measure than a bill about sheltered 
housing, but I hope that the approval of the bill will please SHOC members. I 
am sure that it will. The bill will give them a much greater say in their affairs 
and will empower them as owners. The bill is important.</P><P>16:30</P><P><strong>Dennis 
Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>I welcome the bill, especially the added protection 
that it will give to owner-occupiers in sheltered housing developments. However, 
I have specific questions about the proposed development management schemes for 
sheltered housing developments. I understand that the schemes will be introduced 
by secondary legislation at Westminster, under section 104 of the Scotland Act 
1998 and that that will be the first application of that section. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18749">18749</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Therefore, the matter is important. The Executive has apparently indicated 
that the secondary legislation that Westminster will pass will have a commencement 
date that will coincide with the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003's commencement. 
However, questions must be asked to clarify certain aspects of that procedure, 
particularly because it will be used for the first time.</P><P>What consultation 
will there be in respect of the development management schemes and the secondary 
legislation that will introduce them? What input will there be from the Scottish 
Parliament? Will we leave the matter entirely to Westminster? What input will 
there be from interested parties, especially those such as residents of sheltered 
housing accommodation and the organisations that represent them? What status will 
the development management schemes have? Will they be mandatory or will they be 
left to the discretion of the managers? In other words, will they be optional 
rather than mandatory? What details will be included in the schemes in respect 
of accountability and reporting mechanisms?</P><P>It is essential that, in order 
to ensure adequate accountability, the status of the management schemes should 
be mandatory rather than optional. There is currently no obligation for sheltered 
housing managers to provide a report on how residents' moneys have been used. 
I had correspondence from constituents from the Springbank Gardens complex in 
my constituency on a referendum that was organised not just at that particular 
complex but in a total of seven different developments that are&#151;or are supposed 
to be&#151;managed by a company called Sheltered Housing Management Ltd.</P><P>I 
will read to the minister the wording of the referendum:</P><P>&quot;Do you, as 
owner, consider that it is both unacceptable and impracticable for SHM Ltd to 
manage your complex, without consultation to budget for services, changes to services 
provided, and without the provision of annual accounts to explain how your monies 
are being disbursed, and to verify that sufficient funds have been properly set 
aside to meet ongoing commitments such as repairs, refurbishment etc? If you are 
in agreement with these aims, please append your signature below.&quot;</P><P>I 
am informed that there was a 78 per cent response to the referendum, with 83 per 
cent of respondents in favour of mandatory accountability. However, the referendum 
result was ignored by the arrogant people who are in charge of SHM Ltd. Such arrogance 
must be stopped&#151;by legislation, if necessary. I hope that the proposed development 
management schemes will address the important concerns to which I referred and 
that they will lead in time to better, more efficient and more accountable management 
for the benefit of sheltered housing residents.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18750">18750</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>16:34</P><P><strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh (Eastwood) (Lab): </strong>The bill, 
when enacted, will improve the quality of life for many people throughout the 
country and will allow people of all ages to take greater control of their own 
property.</P><P>I want to mention one particular group, which is people who live 
in retirement housing. Several factors might provoke the decision to buy into 
a retirement complex, but many people are influenced by the prospect of security 
and peace of mind. That is how such flats are marketed, so it is easy to assume 
that the developer, the factor or the manager who runs the complex will have the 
residents' best interests at heart and will look out for them. Unfortunately, 
and as far too many people have discovered for themselves, all too often that 
is not the case. Examples show that instead of security, at worst, residents face 
a culture of bullying and intimidation and, at best, are in the unacceptable situation 
of owning their own homes and paying additional costs for services, but are not 
consulted on those services, have no power to control them and have no method 
of holding management companies to account.</P><P>The bill addresses those concerns. 
In simple terms, it will remove control from the developer and give it to the 
owners. The owners will be able to appoint or dismiss a manager and to vary regulations 
that govern the complex. In the future, a retirement housing complex will be treated 
as one community. The owners of a complex will be able to control what happens 
to it and they will be able to do so by majority rule, counting one vote for each 
unit within the complex.</P><P>The bill is primarily about property rights, rather 
than the rights of individual retirement homeowners. It is very welcome, but it 
does not address all the concerns that affect that strong-minded but potentially 
vulnerable group of older people. I welcome the minister's commitment to further 
research and study into the anxieties that have been highlighted, and his recognition 
that despite the progress we are making today, the issue remains live. I also 
pay tribute to the work of Mrs Galbraith, Mrs Reid and the other members of SHOC. 
They have not only opened my eyes and those of many of my colleagues to the dubious 
practices that go on in some retirement complexes, but have persuaded and convinced 
the Executive to radically redraft a section of the bill to address specifically 
the concerns of retirement homeowners. I thank them for their work. I also thank 
the members of the Justice 1 Committee, my colleagues Sylvia Jackson, Brian Adam, 
Margaret Smith and others. I also commend the efforts and patience of Joyce Lugton 
and the Executive bill team.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18751">18751</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The bill, coupled with the abolition of feudal superiority and the forthcoming 
development management scheme, offers retirement home owners the opportunity to 
take control of their own affairs. I commend the bill to members.</P><P>16:37</P><P><strong>Christine 
Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>The Scottish Parliament information 
centre's overview of the bill states:</P><P>&quot;The Bill represents an important 
piece of property law reform and is arguably of greater practical significance 
than the Feudal Act that preceded it.&quot;</P><P>That is certainly true. The 
next sentence goes on to say:</P><P>&quot;Yet it is also a complicated and technical 
Bill that can appear daunting for the layperson to tackle.&quot;</P><P>How very 
true. The jury is out on whether it is more daunting than the Leasehold Casualties 
(Scotland) Act 2001, but I thank the expert advisers and witnesses who came before 
the committee and led us through the legal maze. That is important when there 
is such confusion about what burdens exist, what they mean and who can enforce 
them.</P><P>When I get lost, I think of my own extant title deeds, which prohibit 
me from keeping pigs, sheep and other farm animals, but allow me to bleach linen. 
I have found the latter quite useful. I think that those title conditions were 
breached during the war, when somebody kept hens and ducks for food. Unfortunately, 
we did not know who could take me to court if I breached the conditions and kept 
a few pigs at 6 Baronscourt Road; however, I found out that it was the Earl of 
Willowbrae. I do not know whether he still exists, but he is on my title deeds. 
To be serious, the previous situation meant that no one knew who could enforce 
burdens against whom.</P><P>The Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill was therefore 
essential when we got rid of feudal superiority; people know where they are now. 
They know what a burden is and the bill tells them who can enforce a title condition 
and what rights they have. It represents a modernising of the Scottish legal system, 
in keeping with the fact that we now have planning regulations to prevent people 
like me from setting up little farms.</P><P>However, the issue of sheltered accommodation 
is important and has been highlighted by several members. I am delighted that 
the minister will monitor what happens with regard to title that is still retained 
by developers. That is a good example in support of the argument for having post-legislative 
scrutiny by the Justice Committees. If we can envisage a problem like that, we 
should be able to examine whether an act is doing what it was intended to do when 
it has been running for some time.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18752">18752</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>16:39</P><P><strong>Maureen Macmillan (Highlands and Islands) (Lab): </strong>Christine 
Grahame's account of what she is not allowed to do under her feudal conditions 
reminds me of my feudal conditions. I live in a former manse of the Church of 
Scotland and am not allowed to sell strong drink. If that burden were converted 
to a neighbour burden, my neighbours might quite like my selling strong drink 
because the nearest pub is three miles away. I might pursue that later.</P><P>I 
thank the clerks and the adviser to the committee for the help that they gave 
me in drafting the amendments that I lodged for stage 3. Not having any legal 
training, I had no idea how to write amendments that would reflect the concerns 
of the people and organisations that had approached me. On one occasion, Scott 
Wortley had to phone the secretary of the Highland Small Communities Housing Trust 
to find out from him what he wanted an amendment to be about. I am pleased that 
the amendments were well enough drafted to be accepted by the Executive, and that 
they have been included in the bill today.</P><P>One of the daunting aspects of 
the bill was the number of organisations and people whom the bill would affect. 
As time went on, those people came out of the woodwork to voice their concerns 
about what was happening; I commend the Executive on the extent to which it was 
able to address those concerns.</P><P>I thank everyone who was involved in the 
process for making it a worthwhile experience, if one with a steep learning curve.</P><P>16:41</P><P><strong>Mr 
Wallace: </strong>I thank members who have taken part in the debate for the warm 
welcome that they have given to the bill which, as Michael Matheson said, will 
have an impact on the daily lives of the people of Scotland.</P><P>I share with 
Maureen Macmillan a provision in the title deeds of the old manse in which I live 
that bars me from selling drink for profit. I feel compelled to add that we are 
probably not allowed to sell it for no profit, either.</P><P><strong>Dennis Canavan: 
</strong>Is the minister allowed to consume drink in his house?</P><P><strong>Mr 
Wallace: </strong>I hope that I am, otherwise I have been in breach of the title 
conditions for some time.</P><P>Such examples underline the way in which title 
conditions impact on people. As technical as the bill might be, it will have an 
effect on people's lives and it is right to recognise the impact that it will 
have on sheltered housing. Being a technical property-law reform measure, the 
bill's primary </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18753">18753</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>function was not to deal with the law on sheltered housing. However, as many 
members have said, it will contribute significantly to allowing those who live 
in sheltered housing to have more say over their housing arrangements, and more 
transparency, including transparency in relation to accounting and charges.</P><P>Dennis 
Canavan asked whether the development management schemes would be consulted on. 
It is perhaps worth rehearsing that the development management scheme was in the 
original Scottish Law Commission draft bill and the draft bill that we consulted 
on before presenting it to Parliament. There has, therefore, already been quite 
extensive consultation on the scheme. We were unable to proceed in that regard 
at stage 1 because of a technical problem with regard to the nature of a development 
management scheme, which would almost certainly have put the matter beyond the 
competence of the Scottish Parliament. That is why we went down the road of using 
a section 104 order, which allows to be brought into effect a provision that everyone 
accepted was good. It is worth putting on record the co-operation that we received 
from United Kingdom Government ministers in doing that. I understand that there 
is no formal procedure for the presentation of a section 104 order&#151;it is 
a normal Westminster order. However, I hope that the fact that the order has already 
been consulted on and that members will have been able to have sight of it before 
it is debated at Westminster will satisfy them.</P><P>The development management 
scheme is not mandatory, nor should it be mandatory: it is a provision to which 
the people in a development can sign up. However, it is widely acknowledged as 
being a helpful tool in&#151;as Wendy Alexander said&#151;trying to ensure that 
there is an obligation on residents to respect their neighbours' property, in 
developments in which there is a large number of individual units. Such mutual 
obligation is&#151;as are rights&#151;necessary. That will also be the theme of 
the third leg of the property law reform in reform of the law of the tenement, 
on which we hope to consult soon.</P><P>I welcome the fact that all parties in 
the Parliament support the bill.</P><P><strong>Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian) 
(Lab): </strong>Will the minister spare a thought for an absent friend who would 
have loved the debate? It was often said that Donald Dewar's idea of heaven would 
have been a law reform (miscellaneous provisions) (Scotland) bill committee stage 
without limit of time. Am I right in thinking that he would have approved of the 
bill?</P><P><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>He would undoubtedly have approved of 
the bill. It is a lawyer's paradise, not only in its debating, but possibly in 
its application. I </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18754">18754</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Point of Order</strong></P><P>16:47</P><P><strong>Phil 
Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>On a point of order, Presiding Officer. 
I thank you for the reply that you gave to the points of order that were raised 
on Thursday on First Minister's question time. I acknowledge your judgment on 
the raft of points of order that were raised about First Minister's question time, 
but will you determine whether, during question time, the First Minister responds 
for the Executive or the Labour party? If, as I suspect, he responds on the Executive's 
behalf, does not he therefore respond on behalf of his Liberal Democrat colleagues 
who form part of that Executive? On that basis, do you consider that your words&#151;that 
the First Minister does not comment on</P><P>&quot;the policies of the SNP, the 
Liberal Democrats or the Conservatives&quot;&#151;</P><P>are perhaps just a little 
wide of the mark?</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel): </strong>I 
am grateful to Mr Gallie for giving me notice of the question, but I am surprised 
that he needs to ask it at all. It is clear to me that the First Minister is responsible 
for the entire Executive, including its Liberal Democrat members&#151;that is 
obvious. However, the First Minister is not responsible for policy statements 
by the other political parties&#151;including policy statements on Iraq, for example. 
I am sure that he is relieved to hear that. He is certainly not responsible for 
Liberal Democrat policy on that or anything else. That was the point of my ruling 
this morning.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18759">18759</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Ethical Investment</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The Deputy 
Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </STRONG>We come to our members' business 
debate, on motion S1M-3723, in the name of Angus MacKay, on ethical investment.</P><P><em>Motion 
debated,</em></P><P>That the Parliament notes the work of Edinburgh University 
People and Planet group and the decision of the Edinburgh University Students' 
Association to endorse overwhelmingly a motion on ethical investment during its 
general meeting; congratulates students that have chosen to highlight the issue 
on the university campus by campaigning that the University of Edinburgh's investments 
of £160 million should be invested only in ethical companies that do not flout 
human rights, exploit workers, pollute heavily or irresponsibly sell armaments; 
welcomes the decision of the University Court to make available previously confidential 
information about investments as a first step in achieving these aims but considers 
that the University of Edinburgh should go further by developing a fully accountable 
ethical investment policy, and believes that other universities in the United 
Kingdom should develop similar policies based on the shared values of their staff 
and students.</P><P>16:54</P><P><strong>Angus MacKay (Edinburgh South) (Lab): 
</strong>I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise the issue of ethical 
investment in the chamber today. The fact that I am able to do so is testimony 
to the hard work and perseverance of the People &amp; Planet group at the University 
of Edinburgh. I put on record my thanks to it for the work that it has done in 
campaigning in and around the university on ethical investment.</P><P>The University 
of Edinburgh faces a number of important challenges. We should congratulate Professor 
Tim O'Shea on the work that he has done recently and on his recent announcement 
on opening up the university to ensure that those who have the capacity to take 
advantage of educational opportunities will not fail to find them because anything 
is found wanting on the part of the university.</P><P>The University of Edinburgh 
faces a further challenge in regard to its funding position compared with its 
main UK counterparts now that we have had the decision at Westminster on student 
fees, which will bring additional funding to its competitor universities.</P><P>The 
university's investment policy is the third leg to the challenges that it faces. 
It is an important issue not only for the students but for the academic staff 
and people of Edinburgh, for whom that academic institution is so much a part 
of Edinburgh life.</P><P>In February 2002, the student association's annual general 
meeting took place. It had unprecedented attendance, as around 550 people </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18768">18768</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>took part. They passed a motion from the People &amp; Planet group to lobby 
for ethical investment on the part of the university. The level of participation 
in that meeting was unique in the university's many-year history.</P><P>By the 
time we reached November 2002, the university announced that it would make its 
investment portfolio public, for which we should commend it. The university agreed 
to publish a list of the companies in which it invested, and its board of finance 
agreed to that.</P><P>It is right that, as the university said, it decided to 
pursue issues around socially responsible investment through engagement with companies 
in which the university's funds were invested by the fund managers. That was certainly 
a step forward, but more work has to be done.</P><P>By February 2003, the ethical 
investment policy document had been produced by the People &amp; Planet group. 
It takes political and social aspirations a step further and starts to document 
how an institution with a substantial investment portfolio can genuinely adopt 
ethical investment practices and can genuinely reflect the wishes of the people 
working in and around that institution.</P><P>The main points of the strategy 
document are quite clear. It calls for a properly established and written ethical 
investment policy. It states that the university should seek to use its social 
and economic status to influence positively public policy and corporate social 
behaviour. It goes on to say that the university's behaviour must be consistent 
with those values. It is difficult for anyone to disagree with that.</P><P>The 
document goes on to say that the university should actively lobby companies in 
the investment field. For example, the pension fund for university staff throughout 
the UK is already an ethical investor. There are certainly opportunities for the 
university's £160 million of investment funds to be used alongside the funds of 
other organisations in discussing and agreeing corporately what the investment 
strategy should be, to secure not just ethical investment with the university's 
funds but a degree of leverage on the major companies that other pension and investment 
funds use as investment vehicles. A number of companies have been singled out, 
such as tobacco and oil companies or those operating in the tobacco or oil sector, 
as companies that the People &amp; Planet group wants to encourage to operate 
in a more socially responsible manner.</P><P>The next demand is that the university 
should establish a committee that would include student participants as well as 
those who could give expert advice, to help guide the ethical investment policy 
and to examine closely the investments and exclusions about which decisions will 
have to be taken as part of the policy.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18769">18769</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The University of Edinburgh's image and reputation are at stake. It faces tough 
competition from its main UK competitors and from abroad and there is no doubt 
that that competition is about not just admissions policy and investment but the 
reputation and image of the university.</P><P>Although the university is trying 
to ensure that that it is not seen as an elitist institution and attempting genuinely 
to build on the success of the Lothians equal access programme for schools to 
broaden its access base, ethical investment and being seen to invest ethically 
are an important part of developing and upholding that reputation. There is no 
doubt that ethical investment can be as profitable as regular investment. The 
Ethical Investment Co-operative has produced five indices of ethical investments 
that exclude companies involved in a range of activities&#151;for example, tobacco, 
gambling and alcohol.</P><P>Those indices have shown that it is possible for ethical 
investments to match the performance of the FTSE all-share index over a period 
of time. Since 1996, the FTSE4Good index&#151;an index of companies that are defined 
as socially responsible on environmental development and human rights issues&#151;has 
risen in value and has matched the performance of the all-share index. Even in 
the current investment climate, ethical investments have fared no worse than have 
general investments.</P><P>In the context of a university that is seeking a return 
on its investments to fund investment in infrastructure and research and to attract 
staff, it would be difficult to argue the case for ethical investment if it were 
not demonstrably possible to secure very good returns on such investment as compared 
with traditional investment vehicles. However, it is possible to show that such 
returns can be secured.</P><P>The University Superannuation Scheme, which is the 
investment fund for all UK university pensions, has already committed itself publicly 
to an ethical investment policy. It examines major oil, gas and pharmaceutical 
companies and has discussed issues with those companies, as well as with non-governmental 
organisations, the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations. All 
have endorsed the scheme's approach and have agreed that it is ethically sound 
and is producing good yields on investment.</P><P>I realise that I have overstepped 
slightly the time allocated to me. In conclusion, I emphasise that both the motion 
that we are debating and the policy that People &amp; Planet is pursuing at the 
University of Edinburgh have widespread support from across the political spectrum. 
I hope that the university's approach of continuing dialogue with People &amp; 
Planet and those who are concerned to secure an ethical investment strategy will

<P>continue. I hope that it will yield a written policy that makes clear the university's 
commitment not just to ethical investment of its funds but to being socially responsible 
in an interventionist way in the marketplace alongside other ethically motivated 
investment funds.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Six members 
have indicated that they would like to take part in the debate. That will allow 
speeches of about four minutes.</P><P>17:03</P><P><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) 
(Green): </strong>I must declare two interests. First, I am rector of the University 
of Edinburgh and will be for another 10 days. Secondly, my entire investment portfolio, 
such as it is, is in ethical investments.</P><P>I was glad when People &amp; Planet 
asked me whether I would back it in this campaign. As chair of the university 
court, I am supposed to stay clear of university issues and to be as objective 
as possible, but this is one of three or four issues about which I was happy to 
make my support very clear. I also took part in a debate in the university with 
the then principal, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, on this very subject.</P><P>People 
&amp; Planet is one of the most successful and best-attended societies in the 
entire university. In fact, I owe my position as rector to that society because 
it supported my candidature three years ago.</P><P>The importance of this matter 
goes beyond universities. Members may recollect that in the early days of the 
Parliament I lodged a motion calling on the Executive to investigate the possibility 
of the Executive and local authorities with surplus money investing it in ethical 
investment. However, it fell on stony ground at the time and never made it to 
the chamber. Therefore, I am even gladder about the debate and congratulate Angus 
MacKay on bringing this motion on the same subject to the chamber.</P><P>I cannot 
guess what the Executive's response to the debate might be. I hope that it recognises 
that not just universities can benefit from a policy of ethical investment. Encouraging 
such a policy would have a knock-on effect throughout the world.</P><P>Nearly 
four years ago, I said that the colour of politics of this century must be green, 
whatever one's party. There is no doubt that ethical investment can be described 
as a green policy. I sometimes think that, when I speak in favour of renewables 
or recycling, I should also state my interest in ethical investments. I hope that 
much of that money is invested in recycling and renewable energy companies.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18771">18771</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>You have one minute.</P><P><strong>Robin 
Harper: </strong>I will not need even one minute, Presiding Officer.</P><P>I congratulate 
Angus MacKay on his motion, I congratulate the People &amp; Planet group and I 
congratulate the University of Edinburgh on taking on the issue in the way that 
it has.</P><P>17:06</P><P><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab): </strong>I 
congratulate Angus MacKay on his success in securing the debate. At this stage 
of the parliamentary session, it is increasingly difficult to get a motion on 
the evening's agenda.</P><P>The motion is an excellent example of grass-roots 
campaigning by People &amp; Planet. I want to add my support for the work that 
it has already carried out in raising awareness of the power of the major institutions 
in our society to make a statement about their values and principles and to use 
their investment powers wisely. The People &amp; Planet group has encouraged the 
deliberate use of such power, in a way that influences the financial sector and 
business.</P><P>It is appropriate that Angus MacKay has brought the issue to the 
Parliament. As parliamentarians, we can add our weight and our voices to the issues 
that have been raised at the University of Edinburgh.</P><P>The motion raises 
vital issues, such as the transparency of the way in which firms and major institutions 
conduct their business. It is appropriate for major institutions such as the University 
of Edinburgh to ask questions about firms' records on human rights, on the exploitation 
of workers and on pollution or irresponsible arms sales. If they get the wrong 
answers to those questions, they have the power not to invest in those companies. 
However, they need to obtain that information in the first place.</P><P>I hope 
that the debate will help to progress matters. We should encourage companies to 
adopt positive, proactive policies and to have a positive investment strategy. 
Angus MacKay highlighted the benefits that firms and companies that work towards 
socially responsible investment can gain. Such institutions attract investors. 
They have attracted the investments of individuals, as Robin Harper has said, 
and of major organisations that have serious financial clout.</P><P>Adopting a 
more ethical or socially responsible approach to the environment or to human rights 
can be good for business. It is good for a company's public relations and its 
reputation. Companies' adoption of such policies can help to shape the investment 
strategies of more conventional and mainstream companies.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18772">18772</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I am particularly glad that the debate is being held tonight, as the European 
Committee is considering corporate social responsibility. We have looked at how 
we in Scotland can encourage companies and major public sector institutions to 
develop the concept of corporate social responsibility. Although the committee 
is near the end of its inquiry, I would like to make members aware of why it took 
up the issue in the first place. I suspect that there are similarities between 
our approach and what generated the interest of People &amp; Planet.</P><P>The 
European Committee investigated the issue because it is highly conscious of the 
impact of global restructuring and the price that Scottish workers have paid for 
that. The inquiry was also inspired by our visit to the European Commission in 
Brussels last year. The Commission asked us to look at Scotland's contribution 
to generating employment, to consider issues such as equal opportunities, women's 
rights and access to the labour market for disadvantaged groups and to think about 
whether there was a Scottish approach to corporate social responsibility.</P><P>We 
started our inquiry against the backdrop of the work that was being done in Johannesburg 
at the world summit on sustainable development. The need for the environmental 
accountability of firms was highlighted as well as the need for firms to report 
annually on how they impacted locally and globally on the environment. We also 
highlighted how firms should try to say what steps they are taking to lessen the 
adverse impact of their company's work on the environment. One key issue that 
the European Committee considered is the role of major public sector organisations, 
such as the Scottish Executive or the University of Edinburgh, and how such organisations 
can lead the way.</P><P>I am glad to be able to support Angus MacKay's motion, 
and I am glad that he has brought the issue to the Parliament. I hope that by 
debating tonight's motion we can learn the lessons that have been learned at the 
University of Edinburgh and encourage other institutions to take a similar view. 
We need champions; we need people who are prepared to do their homework; and we 
need people who are prepared to raise the issue and campaign on it. I support 
Angus MacKay's motion and I hope that others will take the issue further, beyond 
the University of Edinburgh.</P><P>In his summation, I hope that Lewis Macdonald 
will give us some insight into how the Executive can further promote the debate.</P><P>17:11</P><P><strong>Fiona

<P>debate. In addition, we should extend our congratulations to People &amp; Planet 
on its campaign and we should welcome the University of Edinburgh's decision to 
embrace and participate in the dialogue and debate to ensure that there is ethical 
investment. The Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning 
may find some challenge in responding to tonight's debate given the great deal 
of consensus about the importance of ethical investment and what has been achieved. 
I await his comments with interest.</P><P>I want to touch on several points. The 
fact that 500 students turned out at a meeting shows that the idea that young 
people do not care about the things that matter, such as human rights, is misplaced. 
It is clear that people care and that it is important that they be given a forum 
and an opportunity so that they can do something practical. The success of that 
meeting shows that campaigning of whatever form&#151;whether it be political with 
a small p or otherwise&#151;can achieve results. People &amp; Planet provides 
a good example of how well-informed grass-roots campaigning can achieve a response, 
and a very positive response at that.</P><P>When, in a former life many years 
ago, I worked in financial services, ethical investment and green funds were seen 
as being something that only those who fitted a certain stereotype would want 
to take part in. However, over the years, ethical investment issues have increasingly 
become part and parcel of the fabric of investment. As Angus MacKay pointed out, 
just because money is ethically invested does not necessarily mean second-class 
investment returns. Indeed, ethical investment is becoming part and parcel of 
modern investment practices.</P><P>The point that was made about leverage is important. 
The days when investment was just about profit and when no interest was taken 
in whether the investment conflicted with human rights or promoted arms sales 
have long gone. Corporate governance, in whatever shape or form, is here to stay. 
Ethical investment is not just about consumer choice; it is now part of the fabric 
of our investment choices. Such investments are no longer simply a nice charitable 
thing to do but are very much something that is here to stay.</P><P>It is vital 
that we raise the issue of ethical investment, and perhaps especially at this 
time, when we reflect on the importance of human rights and on what is happening 
in countries such as Iraq. We must also consider what the Government itself has 
done and whether its ethical foreign policy has perhaps disappeared from sight.</P><P>Whenever 
we pontificate, congratulate, comment on or debate the policies of other bodies 
and organisations such as the University of Edinburgh, we also need to look at 
ourselves and </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18774">18774</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>consider the policies of the Scottish Parliament and the Westminster Parliament. 
I therefore ask the Presiding Officer that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
Body consider what the Parliament itself is doing, to ensure that it makes ethical 
investments and promotes corporate social responsibility, so that we are not simply 
commenting on others in isolation.</P><P>One offshoot that might come from People 
&amp; Planet's achievement is that it might make us all look more closely at what 
we do. I hope that we can ensure that this worthy and important debate continues. 
The debate is not only about how people can use their right to demonstrate to 
achieve change at the University of Edinburgh but about how we need to highlight 
the importance of fulfilling our global responsibilities. We can do that by starting 
at home.</P><P>17:14</P><P><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con): 
</strong>The normal custom is to congratulate the member who has secured the debate, 
but tonight I would rather congratulate People &amp; Planet, which obviously has 
tremendous political clout if it got Robin Harper elected. I may be accused of 
being cynical, but I wonder how many members from the Edinburgh area are seeking 
the student vote by attending the debate.</P><P>I congratulate the University 
of Edinburgh on its openness. However, a debate is about questioning and expressing 
different views. I do not think that anyone can argue against ethical investment, 
as we all have a conscience and the responsibility to know, as a deliberate policy, 
how our money is being spent.</P><P>The University of Edinburgh court has a duty 
to get a return on its fund. It uses professional fund managers, so presumably 
merely gives an indication of the area and type of investment that it would like 
to make and leaves the matter to the fund managers.</P><P>I take issue with Angus 
MacKay. I do not think that the University of Edinburgh's international reputation 
will be greatly affected by its ethical policy for a fund of £160 million. More 
important for the university's reputation is the quality of the education that 
it gives to those people, young and older, who study there. It is important that 
the university receives support so that it can continue to be a world-class centre 
for education.</P><P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Lab): 
</strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>One 
moment, please.</P><P>I came to the chamber with a blank sheet of paper just to 
listen, because I am puzzled about what the minister will say when he sums up. 
The </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18775">18775</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>policy area is not quite one for the Executive&#151;unless it is internal. 
Moreover, I do not think that the Parliament has enough money to invest in the 
stock markets&#151;it all seems to be going down the road into a new building.</P><P>I 
know the oil industry well. It is important to get across the message that the 
oil and chemical industries are keen on pursuing environmental and people-based 
activities with part of their profits and on encouraging their staff to propose 
such projects. Oil and chemical companies, particularly those that are based in 
the United Kingdom, are becoming more ethical. They are concerned about the environment 
and about doing good for the local population by setting up medical projects, 
for example. It is important that members acknowledge that many multinational 
corporations take that side of life very seriously.</P><P>Did Mr Fitzpatrick want 
to say something?</P><P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick:</strong> The member seems to 
subscribe to the old paradigm that an ethical investment policy is contradictory 
and that the only ambition of the university should be to produce good graduates. 
Is it not possible to do both?</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Both can be 
done together quite successfully. However, the international reputation of the 
University of Edinburgh&#151;or the decision of a student who is desperate to 
get a high-quality education in a particular subject to go to that university&#151;will 
not be based on whether it has an ethical investment policy. Such a policy is 
an add-on; it is not the major issue. I was just responding to a comment made 
by Mr MacKay.</P><P>I welcome the fact that student movements are being recognised. 
Young people should be concerned about the state of the world and they should 
be prepared to campaign, to give their views and to open minds&#151;theirs and 
ours&#151;because we can get into ruts of behaviour. It is vital that we recognise 
the work that People &amp; Planet and student bodies do around the country. Some 
groups are political and some are social and so it goes on. University life is 
about young people coming together to work for a common goal. If that goal can 
benefit society, that is all to the good.</P><P>17:18</P><P><strong>Susan Deacon 
(Edinburgh East and Musselburgh) (Lab): </strong>I will return to the convention 
of congratulating the member who has secured the debate, not least because constituency 
members are lobbied about issues and bombarded with demands and it is significant 
when one of us brings such an issue into the heart of the chamber. Angus MacKay 
is to be congratulated on bringing the issue to the fore.</P><P>I also congratulate 
People &amp; Planet and my </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18776">18776</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>alma mater, the University of Edinburgh, on their progressive stance. Whether 
we are in the Parliament or in our leading higher education institutions, it is 
vital that, as well as focusing on our day-to-day activities, we think about the 
world in which we live and take actions that will influence the world for the 
better. The efforts that the University of Edinburgh has made in that regard are 
genuinely to be congratulated.</P><P>It is worth stating why the principle of 
ethical investment is important. To use a much maligned phrase, I will go back 
to basics. It is important to remember that much of what we do in our lives&#151;arguably 
all of it&#151;is governed by a set of values and beliefs; if it is not, it ought 
to be. How much more important is it that decisions about money are governed by 
values and beliefs, whether those decisions are for us as individuals or for corporate 
entities? Money can and does talk and money makes a difference. When a major corporate 
entity such as the University of Edinburgh, with its £160 million wealth, decides 
to direct that resource in a way that is driven by a particular value base, that 
makes a difference.</P><P>I say to those who are involved in campaigning about 
ethical investment that I am conscious that sometimes much of what we all do in 
politics and more widely can feel like a thankless task&#151;sometimes it can 
feel as though our actions do not make a difference. However, some members can 
remember being involved in comparable campaigns and activities 20-odd years ago. 
In my case, at the University of Edinburgh, we campaigned with some success for 
the university to take investment decisions based on values and beliefs. The aim 
was to avoid companies that invested in the apartheid regime in South Africa. 
That regime is no more. I believe that the campaigns and investment decisions 
of the time played a part in delivering that result, albeit along with myriad 
other small activities across the country and the world. Those who are involved 
in the current campaign should be encouraged. I hope that the experiences that 
some of us had in the past&#151;I am starting to feel old&#151;will provide encouragement 
for the work that they are doing.</P><P>I wish to say a few words about the wider 
issue of ethical investment, which is an idea whose time has come. It is growing 
in popularity. In the brief research that I did for the debate, I was struck to 
read that in the UK there are now more than 40 unit and investment trusts with 
ethical criteria and that those trusts are valued at more than £2 billion. The 
graphs show that there has been steady growth in the demand for ethical investment 
over the past decade.</P><P>I am also struck that the demand for ethical investment 
products is now such that it is unmet. That is encouraging. It shows that, in 
a world </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18777">18777</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>where materialism undoubtedly speaks loudly and has great influence, many individuals 
and corporate entities are prepared to think beyond simple financial criteria 
about values and beliefs. The work that the University of Edinburgh is doing in 
that regard is to be encouraged and welcomed and I am happy to give it my support 
tonight.</P><P>17:23</P><P><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>Those 
who have pricked our conscience with the motion are to be congratulated. We could 
all examine our own activities. I have modest, ethical individual savings accounts 
that have actually gone down marginally less than most of the stock exchange recently. 
That shows that ethical investments need not be worse.</P><P>Most investment is 
made by pension funds. I could never understand why people who invested money 
from their pay in the pension fund had so little say in what happened with it. 
When I was a regional councillor, I was involved in the committee that oversaw 
our pension fund. We managed with great difficulty to get the pension fund managers 
to cast a vote on a motion that expressed concern about the way in which some 
of the companies that they invested in paid extortionate sums to their top brass. 
The fund managers were reluctant to do that, but we got it done. Several council 
pension funds took the same action, which created quite a satisfying stushie. 
We should consider taking such action far more often.</P><P>We subscribe to a 
pension fund, but what is it invested in? At Westminster and in this Parliament, 
an additional voluntary pension fund can be subscribed to. Each fund was cunningly 
invested in Equitable Life, which shows that the financial acumen that is around 
is not always great.</P><P>We should examine our situation and encourage other 
people&#151;whether they are teachers, bus drivers or whoever&#151;to examine 
what their pension contributions are invested in, because many people would be 
horrified at some of the investments that are made.</P><P>The fund managers say 
that they must obtain the highest possible return. I do not doubt that that is 
legally correct, but ethical companies offer just as many good options as do non-ethical 
companies. It would be reasonable for the people who have ownership of a pension 
fund to put more pressure on fund managers to invest ethically.</P><P>Ethical 
investment might be a reserved matter&#151;I am not sure&#151;but the debate should 
spark some interest. We should pursue how we can have our pensions and other funds 
in which we are involved invested ethically. Success will be achieved if we </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18778">18778</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>can create momentum in that direction. I congratulate the people who started 
off the debate.</P><P>17:26</P><P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick (Strathkelvin and 
Bearsden) (Lab): </strong>I, too, congratulate Angus MacKay on lodging the motion, 
which I am happy to support. I suppose that I should get the niceties out of the 
way and refer to my entry in the register of members' interests. I confess that 
I am a graduate of the University of Glasgow, but it is always nice to see a younger 
institution doing well.</P><P>I am pleased that David Davidson introduced some 
politics into the debate, because the issue involves political differences. Sometimes, 
members' business debates end up being nicey-nicey and do not get to the point. 
In listening to David Davidson, I was reassured that I still have to wonder sometimes 
what planet some people are on.</P><P>Angus MacKay is to be congratulated on raising 
ethical investing, because that is not just do-goodery or an add-on. It is a different 
way of doing business and of living in the world and in society. It represents 
a different way of making use of one's funds and involves our saying as citizens 
or consumers, &quot;I'm sorry&#151;I don't want you to do that. I would rather 
that you did this.&quot;</P><P>Choices must be made. For Labour members, poverty 
and exploitation are a zero-sum game. We are against that game and think that 
a better game can be played. Ethical investment can be good business. It can make 
sense for the community, the country and the investor.</P><P>Susan Deacon was 
right to mention the fact that, throughout the student movement in the 1970s, 
1980s and 1990s, campaigns were undertaken&#151;matching campaigns in the trade 
union movement&#151;about what was done with people's money and with universities' 
funds. I remember that we were told, &quot;You can't do anything about South Africa. 
Don't think that you can change a powerful country such as South Africa.&quot; 
In Glasgow, Edinburgh and other places, we wanted to aid the African National 
Congress. We stood with the ANC, said that we would do something and campaigned. 
We should be proud of and celebrate that. That process has not ended; it continues 
wherever there is injustice in the world. That is why some of us entered politics. 
We aim not only to interpret the world, but to change it.</P><P>Ethical stances 
mean that some political leadership is required. We cannot tell the developing 
nations of Africa, Asia or Latin America to change, build their markets, develop 
their services and increase their products if we maintain our trade barriers and 
use public subsidy to keep </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18779">18779</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>out their products or to distort or destroy their markets. We cannot say one 
thing and do another. An advocacy role in how investments are made is an important 
aspect of keeping the debate going.</P><P>Fiona Hyslop mentioned the interface 
of ethics and foreign policy, which is the subject of a legitimate, if sometimes 
difficult, debate. Politicians can find it difficult to look beyond their local 
or national interest towards a global interest.</P><P>I think that some particularly 
brave steps have been taken in that respect. I am sure that politicians around 
the chamber could work together to support the millennium goals, which are probably 
the most ambitious global development goals that we will see in our lifetime. 
By our actions we can inform decisions and support the making of different decisions.</P><P>As 
I said earlier, we can change the world rather than simply interpret it. I do 
not accept that the subject that we are debating is just a reserved matter. The 
minister can tell us what the Scottish Executive will do in some small way to 
change the world.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Indeed 
he can. To respond to the debate, I call Lewis Macdonald.</P><P>17:30</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning (Lewis Macdonald): 
</strong>I am pleased to join those who have welcomed the lodging of the motion 
and who have congratulated Angus MacKay on securing the debate.</P><P>Ethical 
investment is rising up the agenda and, as members have said, is part of the wider 
corporate social responsibility agenda. It is moving up the agenda for private 
business as well as for other institutions, which is to be welcomed.</P><P>Clearly, 
Scotland's universities are autonomous bodies, and it is up to them to take decisions 
about how to spend and invest their money. Ministers cannot tell universities 
what to do or how to do it, and we would not seek to have that power. That said, 
universities make an important contribution to the delivery of the Executive's 
priorities. They provide key services in education and training, which underpin 
our skills base. As Angus MacKay rightly said, the universities help us to close 
the opportunity gap. University research generates new knowledge and is key to 
our economic strategy of generating wealth on the basis of skills, excellence 
and the knowledge economy.</P><P>In return, the universities receive significant 
public funds. By 2005-06, higher education in Scotland will receive more than 
£800 million in public funds, which is around 60 per cent of their income. That 
represents a huge public investment by any standard, so it is right and proper 
that there </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18780">18780</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>should be public interest in what the universities do with their money&#151;I 
am talking about public interest as opposed to Government direction.</P><P>The 
Scottish Higher Education Funding Council is required to encourage universities 
to maintain or develop funding from other sources. Indeed, our universities have 
a good track record in competing for research funding from both the United Kingdom 
research councils and the private sector as well as in winning money in the wider 
marketplace. However, tonight's motion refers to funds that are principally the 
universities' endowment funds. Those are funds that have been donated by benefactors 
over many years, and they are of particular importance to all of Scotland's older 
universities&#151;even the youngest of Scotland's older universities. Like other 
universities, the University of Edinburgh must maximise the returns on those funds 
to ensure that the income generated meets the aims of the endowments.</P><P>On 
the face of it, a tension could be seen to exist between maximising those investment 
returns and circumscribing the areas in which funds can be invested. However, 
the co-operative movement, for one, has shown over many years that there is no 
contradiction between the pursuit of a policy of ethical investment and making 
money to reinvest in local communities or, indeed, in education and research.</P><P>The 
University of Edinburgh is not alone among universities in grappling with the 
issues and in seeking to address them. My own university, the University of Aberdeen, 
has followed a policy that it should not invest in any company that is substantially 
involved in the tobacco industry or in companies whose activities are known to 
be conducted in an environmentally unsound way.</P><P>Like others, I will mention 
the origins of that policy. They go back to my student days when many of us campaigned 
against investments in companies that were linked to the apartheid regime in South 
Africa. There is clear evidence that making one's views known can make a difference 
not only in the short term, but in the longer term. Like the University of Edinburgh 
and others, the University of Glasgow has decided on an ethical investment policy 
that concentrates in particular on avoiding investment in tobacco-related companies.</P><P>It 
is clear that it is up to individual universities to take decisions on such matters, 
including decisions on whether to put details of their investment portfolios into 
the public domain. All universities already publish a considerable amount of information. 
One example is their annual reports, which give details of what they have done 
over the year and how their income has been distributed. Indeed, in the era of 
electronic information, it is remarkable just how much </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18781">18781</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>information can be gleaned from universities' websites about their governance, 
their court, committee proceedings and financial policies. The information that 
we are discussing relates to universities' private income as opposed to the public 
funding that they receive, and that is a matter for each university court to decide 
for itself.</P><P>As others have done, I welcome the decision by the University 
of Edinburgh court to pay heed to the concerns of the People &amp; Planet group 
and of the wider student body. The court has decided to publish details of its 
investment portfolio in the interests of transparency and of providing a channel 
of communication for views on investment policy. I know that other institutions 
will observe with interest, and I will watch with interest to discover how universities 
respond.</P><P>Ethical investment is not an issue for universities alone. I have 
mentioned the long-standing and outstanding example of the Scottish Co-operative Society and other co-ops. I am delighted to report that such an approach increasingly 
attracts support from the private sector. Corporate social responsibility has 
been embraced by many businesses and essentially addresses issues of corporate 
behaviour and standards. The Department of Trade and Industry has lead responsibility 
for the matter at Whitehall. It already has a comprehensive framework for corporate 
social responsibility and Scottish ministers are happy to work with the DTI in 
that area.</P><P>We have been thinking about what more needs to happen in Scotland, 
over and above what is going on in Whitehall, Europe and the wider international 
community. In the Executive, as in the Parliament's European Committee, we have 
been thinking about the characteristics of a socially responsible business or 
public body. Ethical investment is part of that, but it is only one strand. Responsiveness 
to a range of stakeholders, to staff, to investors and to the general public is 
another strand, as is being good to work for&#151;encouraging and not exploiting 
the work force&#151;and working in partnership with trade unions instead of opposing 
trade unionism. Those are features of a responsible corporate approach.</P><P><strong>Brian 
Fitzpatrick: </strong>Does the minister accept that he and his ministerial colleagues 
have their hands on a number of key policy drivers? They can support some of the 
largest employers in Scotland, as well as the further and higher education sectors, 
by way of the prompts that they may give to the funding councils and, indeed, 
to the tentative lifelong learning advisory forum that is to be created. Those 
are ways in which ministers can give support and encouragement to those making 
efforts around these aims.</P><P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Absolutely. 
I want to emphasise that, in developing our approach to </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18782">18782</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>corporate social responsibility and continuing to promote it, we already have 
a number of instruments to hand, such as regional selective assistance, public-private 
partnerships, local economic forums and the promotion of community planning, which 
we are also undertaking. We will seek to promote corporate social responsibility 
via existing programmes in higher education as well as in the other areas that 
I have mentioned, and to take a co-ordinated approach to how we proceed. I expect 
that my colleagues will have more to say about how we make that progress.</P><P>The 
students of the University of Edinburgh have done a service to their university 
as well as to the wider Scottish public by drawing attention once again&#151;as 
has been done several times over the years&#151;to the desirability of ethical 
investment, to the desirability of greater openness about the accounts of public 
and other bodies and by raising debate about such important matters.</P><P>The 
Executive welcomes the University of Edinburgh court's decision to place information 
about the investment portfolio of the university in the public domain. That is 
very much in keeping with our general approach of supporting openness and transparency, 
and is in line with the emerging approach to corporate social responsibility. 
I look forward to others choosing to follow that good example.</P><P><em>Meeting
