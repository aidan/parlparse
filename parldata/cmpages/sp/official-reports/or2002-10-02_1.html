Rev John Crook (Bishop of Moray, Ross and Caithness, Scottish Episcopal Church):</strong> 
I am sure that members will have heard of the prolonged thunderstorm with torrential 
rain that caused localised flooding in the city of Inverness over a weekend last 
month. On the Sunday morning, I walked around the cathedral looking up at the 
rones and down pipes, as I am sure that that is the best time to note the leaks 
and blockages.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is only 
when you look up that you notice two small carvings, high up on one of the walls. 
One is of a horse and the other is of a wheel. Why are they there? The guidebooks 
tell us that, when the cathedral was built in the 1860s, two men were responsible 
for its construction. They were one of my predecessors, Bishop Robert Eden, and 
the local architect, Alexander Ross. Both were remarkable men, but not even they 
could have done all the work on their own. There would have been stonemasons, 
carpenters, plumbers, slaters and glaziers and a variety of skilled artists, craftsmen 
and tradesmen, not forgetting the strong labourers. The large stones were lifted 
by means of pulley wheels, using the strength of horses pulling on the ropes attached 
to their harnesses. The two carvings remind us that many&#151;both man and beast&#151;laboured 
to build the beautiful cathedral.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God 
gives to each of us a wide variety of different gifts and abilities. Some of those

in Scotland Bill: Stage 1</strong></FONT></P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel): </strong>Our main item of business today is the 
stage 1 debate on motion S1M-3128, in the name of Andy Kerr, on the general principles 
of the Local Government in Scotland Bill. I call Peter Peacock to speak to and 
move the motion.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14:35</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services (Peter Peacock): </strong>The Local 
Government in Scotland Bill is significant and forms part of the reforming agenda 
that we share with local government in Scotland. The bill gives new powers and 
new duties, including broad new powers to advance community well-being, new duties 
to secure continuous improvement through best value and new responsibilities and 
duties to bring about better-integrated and responsive public services through 
community planning. The bill contains a range of other tidying provisions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
engaged in a lengthy consultation process on the bill. I am pleased that we have 
moved into the detailed parliamentary phase, during which the Executive and the 
Local Government Committee have work to do to refine the proposals. I pay tribute 
to the Local Government Committee's work. The committee has shown a detailed interest 
in the bill and the stage 1 report shows that that interest will continue. I am 
pleased that other parliamentary committees have contributed their thoughts to 
the process. I am also pleased that, for the most part, the Local Government Committee 
strongly endorses and supports the principles of the bill. I look forward to dealing 
with many of the detailed points that the committee raised as we move through 
today's debate and the committee meetings in the weeks ahead.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Along 
with many other members, I was a councillor and council leader prior to entering 
Parliament. It is a particular pleasure for me to have a hand in bringing about 
many changes&#151;for which I argued as a councillor&#151;to the environment in 
which local government operates. My time in local government was predominantly 
during the Tory years&#151;those awful dark days that dominated the country for 
such a long time. I see that even the Conservative members agree with that point.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
those awful times, local government was consistently under attack and, as many 
members know, was seen as the enemy within. Restriction after restriction was 
put in place to constrain local government, to tell it what to do and to limit 
its freedom. During those dark days the poll tax emerged; there were spending 
guidelines and </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14266">14266</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">penalty regimes; there was capping 
and grant clawback; and compulsory competitive tendering emerged in its most ruthless 
form. That Tory regime considered the cost of everything, but the value of nothing. 
It required local authorities to come to particular conclusions on service delivery, 
whatever their democratic preferences or service delivery requirements. CCT largely 
prevented the joining up of local government and the balancing of quality with 
cost.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thankfully, since 
1997, the sun has begun to shine again on local government and more enlightened 
times have emerged. We want to develop trust in local government and give it more 
responsibility than it had in the past.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
bill must be considered in the context of a much wider reforming agenda. That 
agenda has already abolished spending guidelines; got rid of the prospect of expenditure 
capping; provided three-year budgets to councils to give them more time to plan 
services and make changes; secured guaranteed minimum grant increases; reintroduced 
a four-year term for councils to give more continuity and a greater planning horizon; 
and secured a bill to allow the piloting of new forms of election administration 
to encourage voter turnout. We have recently announced plans to make progress 
on our renewing local democracy agenda.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Local Government in Scotland Bill is about demonstrating trust, allowing local 
leaders to lead and giving them the tools to do their job, and working with other 
agencies and the communities that they serve, all within a clear framework of 
what is expected. The bill is an important part of the more general drive towards 
better public services and is geared towards delivering effective, efficient, 
high-quality and constantly improving services. Through the bill, we want to imbed 
a culture of continuous improvement in service delivery and a culture of quality 
and equality.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Partnership 
working between the Executive and key stakeholders has helped to develop the policy 
and shape of the bill. Many people have been involved&#151;too many to mention&#151;but 
thanks should be given to them all. The process has been more than simply a consultation; 
there has been on-going dialogue to develop polices that will deliver the results 
that we want. An important benefit of the bill is that its three key elements&#151;the 
power to advance community well-being, best value and community planning&#151;are 
deliberately presented in an integrated way. We plan significant guidance to support 
the bill, which will bolster it and reinforce its joined-up and interlinking nature.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Local 
authorities are already working in ways that are consistent with what the bill 
is trying to </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14267">14267</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">achieve. Best value is a management 
tool familiar to local authorities and community planning is beginning to make 
a real impact in all sorts of communities throughout Scotland. However, the measures 
in the bill are designed to ensure that those processes happen consistently, everywhere 
and over time. The issues are too important to allow them to be optional extras. 
The concept of best value is not new; it is already a reality for councils. Local 
authorities that are familiar with best value have claimed ownership of it, and 
much good practice has emerged. The duty of best value in the bill reflects and 
builds on existing practice and repeals the foundations of the CCT regime.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
its stage 1 report, the Local Government Committee makes the point that it wants 
best value to apply across the whole of the public sector. That is exactly in 
tune with our policy. Indeed, we have used the powers that are available to us 
under the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000 to apply best 
value to all accountable officers throughout the wider public sector. However, 
the committee points to the fact that, at some future time, those instructions 
to accountable officers could change without reference to the Parliament. I recognise 
that point. The Executive is considering how we might meet the committee's preference 
for a new statutory duty of best value throughout the public sector. Prior to 
the start of stage 2, we will explore a range of options to see how that matter 
might best be advanced. We will keep in close touch with the committee about how 
it may be possible to progress matters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
committee has also raised the question of sustainable development being a consideration 
in the making of best value decisions. We have been considering that. As Parliament 
knows, the promotion of sustainable development is at the heart of the Executive's 
thinking. Embedding sustainable development in statute is something with which, 
in principle, the Executive has no difficulty; the question is what is practical. 
What can we reasonably do in the bill to embed that principle meaningfully so 
that it drives improvement in a way that can be demonstrated? We will explore 
a range of possibilities, prior to the start of stage 2, to see how sustainable 
development might be advanced in the bill, and we will keep in close touch with 
the committee on that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
matters of enforcement, the committee suggests that it would be appropriate to 
subject any ministerial intervention to the negative procedure, or at least to 
ensure that Parliament has a power to annul ministerial direction. However, we 
do not think that there is a distinction between the negative procedure and annulment 
in this context&#151;the effect is the same in both cases. A direction that was 
made by the minister would </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14268">14268</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">be vulnerable to a motion to annul 
it in the Parliament. That is a complex area and one that we must get right. I 
plan to write to the committee, explaining in detail why we do not agree with 
its suggestions. I will be happy to discuss the matter with the committee through 
the normal channels, as we move to stage 2.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nonetheless, 
we are proposing to amend the bill in relation to intervention. As a small amendment 
at stage 2 will make clear, there will be two routes to an outcome involving ministerial 
intervention. The first will be via the independent Accounts Commission and will 
depend on its recommending possible actions after detailed consideration and a 
public hearing. The second route for interventions will be when&#151;in wholly 
exceptional circumstances&#151;ministers have to take action without having received 
a recommendation from the Accounts Commission. In the bill, we suggest that Parliament 
should tightly fetter our discretion to take any such action and the power is 
clearly intended for emergencies only. In essence, we are anxious that any actions 
that Parliament takes on the bill do not undermine the authority or independence 
of the Accounts Commission. Further, we are anxious to ensure that any emergency 
action that may exceptionally be required is not compromised by the effect of 
a potential annulment, however such an annulment might be achieved. As I said, 
I will write to the Local Government Committee fully on that matter, and I am 
happy to give further clarification in summing up, if members want to press me 
further on that today.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
committee also recommends that we repeal all existing considerations that are 
deemed to be non-commercial for the purposes of contract negotiations under CCT, 
as well as voluntary tendering exercises. However, best value is about decisions 
that are made on the basis of objective business criteria, and we expect prejudice 
and discrimination&#151;matters that are covered by non-commercial considerations&#151;to 
have no place in those decisions. There are no measures within best value that 
explicitly prohibit prejudice and discrimination in the same way that the non-commercial 
considerations list does. For those reasons, we are reluctant to go further than 
we plan and remove the list entirely. The committee feels that it is a matter 
of tone rather than substance, but we believe that there is substance to the point.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
turn now to community planning. No organisation in today's context can work in 
isolation if it is to meet complex, modern needs. The complexity of tackling crime, 
improving health and stimulating enterprise means that agencies must pull together. 
We also want services to be responsive to the needs of people and communities. 
That means listening and reacting to </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14269">14269</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">what people and communities have 
to say to us.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We need to 
ensure the effective delivery of shared objectives through continuing co-operation 
and long-term commitment. Local authorities, other bodies and communities have 
worked well in developing joint visions and agreeing joint objectives. The bill 
will ensure the continuing engagement of key participants in community planning, 
maintain the momentum that has been built and support the difficult decisions 
that need to be taken to improve the planning and delivery of services.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
am pleased to say that the Local Government Committee strongly supports community 
planning, and made pertinent recommendations. The Committee commented on the bill's 
provisions concerning the engagement of communities in the planning process. The 
importance of effective community consultation and engagement in community planning 
is not in question. Community planning will work well only if the views of the 
people who use the services are properly taken into account in planning and providing 
those services. We must get better at taking account of those views.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
also need to engage with and support those within our communities who do not traditionally 
engage in these kinds of debates. People want a real exchange of views and a chance 
to share their experience of local services. They also want those views to make 
a difference to the design of services.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Bruce 
Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP): </strong>The minister and I were local government 
leaders when the community planning pathfinders were introduced some six years 
ago. I am glad to see that there are community planning provisions in the bill. 
However, does the minister share my concern that not enough organisations have 
given credence to the democratic legitimacy of local councillors pulling together 
local plans? Does he agree that other organs of government in Scotland need to 
accept that democratic legitimacy? What can the minister do&#151;for example, 
in terms of amendment at stage 2&#151;that might strengthen that democratic legitimacy?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_4"></A>Peter 
Peacock: </strong>We have already recognised that point in the bill, which gives local 
authorities the role of facilitating the community planning process and ensuring 
that it happens. The bill also places a requirement on other bodies to participate 
in the process. We put local government at the heart of community planning by 
giving it that clear, new responsibility because we recognise the point that Bruce 
Crawford made. Local authorities are uniquely multifunctional in their local community 
and have a democratic legitimacy that others cannot claim at the local level.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14270">14270</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the point that I was developing 
prior to Bruce Crawford's intervention, I will look further at what the Local 
Government Committee suggests about community involvement, but even its suggestions 
depend on guidance to bring that to life. We are not convinced at this stage that 
the bill should prescribe to local authorities the detailed arrangements that 
they should use in the planning process. Diversity and breadth of interest within 
Scotland's communities means that such decisions are best taken locally. That 
is part of the trust that we should place in local authorities as facilitators 
of the process.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will 
continue to work with voluntary and community bodies and their importance will 
be highlighted in and underlined by the statutory guidance that will accompany 
the bill. However, it must be remembered that we have proposed a duty for local 
authorities on behalf of the community planning partnership, not only to consult 
with community bodies and others, but to ensure that that extends to continuing 
co-operation. The bill is clear on that point.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
welcome the committee's acceptance that the list of bodies with a duty to participate 
in community planning need not be added to at present. The list is intended to 
capture the core community planning partners in any area and, as the committee 
recognised, there are other means of engaging. We have constantly made the point 
that the success of community planning will rely on a wide range of public, private 
and voluntary bodies working together. That will be reinforced in guidance.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
have also listened to consultations and recognise that the Executive should lead 
by example on community planning. That is why we intend to lodge an amendment 
at Stage 2 that would introduce a duty on ministers to promote and encourage community 
planning, thereby giving it strength and recognition.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
also note the committee's desire particularly to secure the commitment of Communities 
Scotland. I can assure the Parliament that Communities Scotland is engaging and 
will continue to engage in community planning. The general duty being placed on 
ministers also covers Communities Scotland, as an Executive agency, and will support 
its involvement.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Local 
Government Committee also considered evidence that suggested that provision should 
be made to allow the incorporation of community planning partnerships. I said 
in stage 1 evidence that I was sympathetic to the idea of incorporation, but only 
if the partners thought that that was the right way forward and were ready to 
take that step.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That remains 
my view. There is no basis for </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14271">14271</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">forcing incorporation on community 
planning partnerships. In moving forward, we must make it clear that incorporating 
CPPs cannot be about duplicating existing duties. We must be aware of issues of 
accountability. However, in some areas an incorporated body may perform a valuable 
co-ordinating function between agencies. As the committee recognised, a number 
of details need to be worked out. We will consult further before proposing an 
enabling power at stage 2.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ultimately, 
community planning is about achieving specific outcomes that can make a difference 
to people's lives and communities. That is why the bill emphasises community planning 
partnerships' reporting progress to communities, rather than making the production 
of a plan or submission to ministers the focus of their reporting activity. We 
are clear that the duty to report should rest with local authorities, as the facilitators 
of community planning. However, I recognise that other key partners must participate 
in that reporting arrangement. I am willing to consider whether there is scope 
to clarify that at stage 2, and in guidance.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
has been suggested that the statutory basis for community planning should include 
the production of a plan. I have always made it clear that the focus of community 
planning should be the process of better planning and the delivery of services. 
There is no doubt that as part of that process most, if not all, community planning 
partnerships will want to produce a plan. We will strongly encourage them to do 
that. However, we must not see the production of a plan as the statutory purpose 
of community planning. That concern was borne out in consultation. I am not persuaded 
that a duty to produce a plan is needed. Indeed, I fear that any such duty would 
divert attention from the primary purpose of community planning as a process.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
committee made the important point that any plan could serve as a basis for assessing 
performance. We think that such provision can be made effectively in the statutory 
guidance that we plan to produce, which we will share with the committee as we 
move forward.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is clear 
that community planning should lead to greater efficiencies in the way in which 
public services are delivered. Community planning cannot be about more bureaucracy 
or more staff. However, we are aware that when setting challenges for community 
planning to bring about more effective partnership, we may need to provide resources 
to assist the process of changing the working practices between agencies that 
community planning requires. That has been a recurring theme of the work of the 
community planning task force. I am willing to investigate the possibility of 
providing limited initial match funding </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14272">14272</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">to assist that process.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
many cases we should seek the better integration of existing and new funding packages, 
instead of setting up entirely new mechanisms. The Executive has key responsibility 
in this area. For example, we have decided that the outcome of the consultation 
on community budgeting is that community planning partnerships should be the vehicle 
for developing our approach. My colleague Margaret Curran will make an announcement 
shortly on how community budgeting is to be progressed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
proposed new power to advance well-being was widely welcomed in the consultation 
and in the committee's work. It is clear that it is seen as a power of first resort 
and an important tool to encourage creativity and innovation. The power to advance 
well-being is a real power of general competence, as recommended in the McIntosh 
report and talked about for years before that. I am pleased that the committee 
supports the new power.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
of the committee's recommendations on the power to advance well-being relate to 
guidance, rather than to provisions in the bill. The committee noted that the 
power would be restricted in circumstances where its use would duplicate unreasonably 
the functions of other agencies. Although the committee accepted that principle, 
it pointed out that the prior consent of another agency would not amount to unreasonable 
duplication. I am sympathetic to that point. We will consider how to clarify the 
matter at stage 2.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Bruce 
Crawford: </strong>The bill would give local authorities</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;power 
to do anything which it considers is likely to promote or improve the well-being 
of&#151;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(a) its area and 
persons within that area; or</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(b) 
either of those.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does 
the minister support a development that has taken place in Germany, where Aschaffenburg

Bruce Crawford makes an interesting point. In the past, the practice was for local 
authorities not to do things unless they were empowered specifically to do them. 
We are trying to remove that limitation on the work of local authorities. When 
I was a council leader, I found that before doing something I had to consult lawyers 
several times. I had to rephrase my </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14273">14273</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">question until I received the answer 
that I required. I had to explore all sorts of statutes to find the powers that 
enabled me to do things. I am sure that Bruce Crawford and others have had the 
same experience. We are trying to reverse that to give a power of first resort 
so that if a council believes that something is for the well-being of its area

to repeal the section 94 borrowing consents that exist and move to an entirely 
new regime of how we deal with the public-sector financing of capital projects. 
That will give councils much more latitude to make decisions. Within the power 
of well-being it will be possible for councils to make decisions that would require 
financing in some way or another. The section 94 powers that I referred to, and 
the new powers, will give councils much more flexibility on those matters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I

it addresses some of the issues in local government today, it does not represent 
the kind of reform that could have been introduced and which would revitalise 
Scottish local government. The Local Government in Scotland Bill was to be the

bill that covers best value, community planning and the power of well-being, but 
goes no further.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was

nor is there mention of proportional representation for local government, which 
would be a significant measure that would renew local government and release its

them all and that the matter is not left to interpretation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
also appears to be uncertainty over whether the powers and duties of the Auditor 
General in relation to the Scottish Executive and public bodies have been modified 
to take best value into account. An element of confusion has been introduced, 
but that confusion could be remedied easily if the bill were to provide for common 
guidance, audit and enforcement.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is also a lack of clarity around the duty to secure best value and the duty in 
relation to community planning. It has not been considered necessary to use primary 
legislation to place on accountable officers a duty to secure best value, whereas 
it has been considered necessary to do so in order to place a duty on them to 
participate in the community planning process. That apparent double standard calls 
into question the Executive's commitment to best value. Although I welcome the 
minister's comments, I would still like the bill to include a statutory framework 
for best value that would be applied throughout the public sector. If best value 
and community planning are to work and if they are to give local authorities the 
impetus to develop policies, the bill must include that statutory framework.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Local

would be useful if the deputy minister would indicate&#151;before stage 2&#151;what 
the guidelines are likely to include. If it appears that the Executive's proposals 
for statutory guidance are insufficiently robust, members of the Local Government

that the principal accountable officer could remove best value without the approval

officers must fall under the scrutiny of the Parliament, and the Parliament must 
have the power to scrutinise any binding directions to councils on what they do

is a question mark over that. We understand that lowest cost is not necessarily 
the only criterion that should be taken into account and that quality, too, must 
be taken into account, but we have doubts about the best-value criteria. They 
look loose and do not seem firm enough. We think that things should be considered 
in practice.&quot;&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, <I>Local Government Committee</I>, 
11 June 2002; c 3051.]</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
will mention the three main provisions of the bill in turn, so that we can analyse 
the need for statutory codification. First, the bill proposes a statutory duty 
of best value&#151;a bureaucratic system that is already entrenched in local government 
and which, as I said, may not prove to be as effective as compulsory competitive 
tendering. Secondly, the bill proposes a statutory footing for community planning, 
which better councils already successfully undertake. Community planning should 
be decided by individual councils because of local variation; it should not be 
subject to national interference and direction. Community planning is yet another 
Conservative initiative that has been adopted by new Labour. Our policy was based 
on Conservative values of partnership work with the voluntary and private sectors. 
Councils that do not practise that should face the backlash of the electorate, 
not threats from the centre.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thirdly, 
the power of well-being is just a sop to local government. Councils sought, and 
the McIntosh commission recommended, a power of general competence in line with 
most other European countries. The Scottish Executive does not trust local councils, 
however, so what has been proposed is a watered-down version of that power. I 
am still waiting to hear what councils will be able to do that they cannot already 
do. Some Labour council leaders may have experienced difficulties; I certainly 
did not experience any in Stirling&#151;we did everything that I tried to do.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
power of well-being makes no practical difference to councils' powers, because 
authorities will still be under the constraint of having to avoid acting ultra 
vires, as is the case now. The Scottish local government information unit&#151;SLGIU&#151;agreed 
with that. In fact, I am getting concerned </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14278">14278</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

which the SLGIU agrees with me and on which I agree with Labour members about 
that. In its February 2002 bulletin, the SLGIU stated:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
proposed 'power of wellbeing' falls far short of the Power of General Competence 
recommended by McIntosh and supported by most local authorities and the SLGIU. 
Although the power of well-being is an advance on the current legal situation 
it will not provide a fundamental change in the character of local government. 
It is merely a strengthening of the existing power given to local authorities 
to incur expenditure which might benefit their area ... The proposals to give 
Ministers the power to modify the meaning of well-being through statutory instrument 
devalues the significance of that power&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
we have sympathy with the general principles of the bill, we see no need for such 
practices to be enshrined in statute. We also have concerns that the overall message 
that the Executive gives to local councils in wishing to pass the bill is that 
it does not trust them and that it wishes to assert greater central control. How 
can the Executive possibly say that it supports the institution of local government 
while proposing a bill that totally demeans the concept of local democracy and 
accountability? The two simply do not match.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let 
me reiterate that the Scottish Conservatives support the principles that are enshrined 
in the bill, but we want councils to have the choice whether to implement them. 
The consequence of not doing so should be rejection by the electorate. We believe 
in local democracy, but the Executive believes in central imposition.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
bill represents a lost opportunity in the drive towards local government modernisation. 
If the bill is passed, 2002 will have seen the passing of two bills that relate 
to recommendations from the McIntosh committee. The first bill confirmed the Executive's 
view that local government is simply an extension of the centre by rendering its 
elections subordinate to the Parliament's. The second bill, as I have shown, is 
a waste of time and demeans democracy by imposing central initiatives at a local 
level.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is be one 
more bill to come that will deal with the McIntosh committee's remaining recommendations,

fragile of coalitions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within

compulsory competitive tendering was also introduced. All those things led to 
a diminished role for councils in responding to the needs and aspirations of the

Smith: </strong>I was talking about how local government's powers were stripped away 
when the Conservatives were in power. The bill is the first step towards moving 
back to a situation whereby local government's powers can be enhanced. Community 
planning is important in dealing with issues such as tourism, economic development 
and working with further education colleges. Those are important aspects; the 
fact that many of our further education colleges are having financial problems 
may be a reflection on the unfortunate way in which they were set up in the first 
place.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This bill starts 
to address some of the issues that local government has faced over the years. 
There are other areas where more needs to be done, which will be covered in future 
legislation. The Local Government Committee has carried out an extensive survey 
into local government finance. That survey showed clearly that local government 
needs more control over the money that it raises and spends. We need a reduction 
in ring fencing and we need&#151;I am sure that Tricia Marwick will be happy to

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">committee. The bill and the committee's 
report have been widely welcomed by just about everyone, apart from the Conservatives. 
That is perhaps not a surprise&#151;the Conservatives do not want to see the powers 
of local government enhanced; rather, they want to see them further destroyed. 
For example, the Conservatives want schools to be funded directly by central Government, 
which would mean that decisions about whether the local village school will close 
would be taken not by local councillors who were accountable to their local communities, 
but by civil servants in St Andrews House. Decisions on whether to have a new 
secondary school in the north of Fife would be taken not in Fife but in Edinburgh. 
The Conservatives want social work budgets to be removed from elected councils 
and given to unelected health boards, and they want to see more and more services 
privatised. In fact, as far as I can see, the only thing the Conservatives want 
local government to deal with is dog fouling.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Local Government Committee has made a number of suggestions on how the bill can 
be improved and I am sure that&#151;in the constructive way in which our committee 
and ministers have had dialogue throughout this session of Parliament&#151;the 
minister will lodge some of the amendments that the committee suggests. I will 
refer to some of those suggestions during my comments on the different parts of 
the bill.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us consider 
best value which is, of course, a response to the need to replace CCT, which was 
imposed by the Conservatives. Ostensibly, CCT was meant to improve public services 
by subjecting them to competition. In reality, it was about privatising services 
and destroying direct labour organisations, although it failed to deliver on those 
objectives. CCT has done little to improve public services. It put cost before 
quality and it developed a sophisticated industry inside councils to devise contracts 
in ways that favoured in-house bids. It reduced, rather than increased, councils' 
flexibility in providing services and it stifled rather than encouraged innovation. 
I have never been opposed to exposing public services to competition or market 
testing, but that should be done only where it is fair and about improving service 
to the public. The death of CCT will not be mourned.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Best 
value is not about artificial competition, but about continuous improvement. That 
allows for factors to be taken into account other than price: for example, quality 
of service, innovation, equal opportunities and value for money. The Local Government 
Committee, as Tricia Marwick mentioned, believes strongly that sustainability 
should be an additional driver of best value. Surely, in examining how a service 
is provided, a council should take account of the service's environmental impact. 
It should ask, for example, </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14282">14282</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">whether a proposed method uses virgin 
or recycled materials. That is the kind of important issue that we should consider 
and I hope that the Minister will accept the recommendation of the Local Government 
Committee to amend the bill to include sustainability as a factor in the best-value 
regime.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Best value must 
apply throughout the public sector if community planning is to work effectively. 
The Local Government Committee remains unconvinced that the present statutory 
framework is sufficient to ensure consistency across all the public agencies that 
are involved as community planning partners. Community planning is an important 
development in ensuring that all public agencies work together to benefit the 
community. There have been too many examples of public agencies failing to do 
that in the past, which has led to poor service to the public, waste of resources, 
duplication and bureaucratic inertia. For example, health boards and social work 
departments have been too precious about who controls budgets to get on with delivering 
services, and local enterprise companies and councils have been competing on economic 
development and regeneration without proper prioritisation of how money should 
be spent.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important 
that there is a lead organisation. That organisation needs to be democratically 
elected and accountable, which is why local government is in the ideal position 
to play that role. However, it is essential that all public agencies that have 
significant roles in providing services to people and communities be involved. 
That is why I echo the call of the Local Government Committee that Communities 
Scotland be clearly named as a body that is involved in community planning.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
community planing is not only about the agencies. It must not become planning 
for the community but planning by the community. That is why I support strongly 
the proposed amendment that is mentioned in paragraph 46 of the committee's report.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paragraphs 
52 and 53 relate to a proposal from the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives 
and Senior Managers that community planning partnerships should be able to apply, 
subject to the agreement of all the partners, for incorporation so that they may 
directly access cross-cutting funding. The committee gave cautious support to 
that proposal, recognising that it might bring advantages in some instances. However, 
as the committee recommends, any incorporation must be on the basis that the accountability

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1980s and 1990s. I remember in particular 
the demands that local government be represented on quangos. However, that representation 
does not address the accountability issue, because the traditional incorporation 
model places a primary duty on the board members of the body, not on the body 
that nominates them. Thus, a councillor who is appointed to a local enterprise 
company or a health board cannot be held accountable for his or her actions on 
that body to the council that nominated them. If community planning partnerships 
are to retain public confidence, it is essential that the partners remain accountable. 
Incorporation should not be a way of avoiding accountability.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
power of well-being has long been an aspiration of local government. Traditionally, 
it is described as a power of general competence. It would reverse the UK tradition 
that a council can do only what it has specific statutory powers to do and will 
result in a situation in which councils may do anything that is in the community's 
interest unless there is a specific statutory bar to them doing so. Clearly, that 
has to be subject to certain safeguards, such as preventing duplication. It must 
also be subject to best value criteria. Critics claim that calling it a power 
of well-being, rather than a power of general competence, downgrades the power. 
However, I prefer to look at what the power does rather than what it is called. 
The minister made it clear to the Local Government Committee that the power of 
well-being was a power of first resort. It will mean an end to law officers spending 
endless hours searching through statute to see whether a council can do something: 
the assumption will be that it can.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keith 
Harding has often claimed that, because there are no examples of how the power 
of well-being can be used, it is meaningless and unnecessary. My answer is that 
how the power of well-being can be used will become apparent only when a council 
finds something that it wishes to do but which, at present, it is barred from 
doing. For example, if a rural post office closes and no one applies to take it 
over&#151;which often happens because rural post offices are rarely a long-term 
career option&#151;the power of well-being may enable the council to work with 
the post office to provide a service, perhaps through the local school. Similarly, 
the innovation of the private sector can sometimes be stifled because it needs 
to work with the local authority but, at present, councils do not have the power 
to assist. The power of well-being will be invaluable in driving community planning 
because it will allow innovation and cross-cutting work to proceed in ways we 
cannot even imagine.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is right that the power of well-being is broadly defined. I welcome the intention 
of ministers to ensure that it remains so by lodging amendments </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14284">14284</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

freedoms of councils and one that I hope will allow councils the scope to explore 
new and innovative forms of funding investment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
welcome the bill. Its full potential can be delivered only with a package of reforms 
to local government finance that will give councils the added flexibility that 
they need to utilise fully the powers that the bill will give them. In turn, that 
added responsibility needs to be accompanied by electoral reform to ensure that 
councils are properly representative. With those longer-term provisos, I commend 
the bill to the Parliament.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Government was the subject of the 
Scottish Parliament's first debate in 1999. As others have said, the Local Government 
in Scotland Bill is another step in the process of addressing the recommendations 
in &quot;The Report of the Commission on Local Government and The Scottish Parliament&quot;&#151;the 
McIntosh report. The bill seeks to provide a framework to enable councils and 
their public sector partners to provide better and more responsive public services.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
bill is in three parts. The first provides for a duty to secure best value in 
local government service provision. The second part provides a statutory basis 
for community planning. The third part establishes a power to advance well-being, 
to allow local authorities greater flexibility to respond to the needs of their 
communities. I intend to give an overview of the general principles; other members 
of the committee will go into more detail.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
four principles of best value are accountability, transparency, continuous improvement 
and ownership&#151;all to be considered with an eye on the public purse. The committee 
took evidence from many witnesses about the restriction of the duty to secure 
best value to local authorities. We were not convinced by the position of the 
Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services that new primary legislation was 
not necessary to place a duty to secure best value on other public bodies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
committee believes that that is necessary. As Tricia Marwick said, there is a 
major difference between using existing statute to modify the responsibilities 
of accounting officers and placing a statutory duty on those organisations. If 
a permanent secretary can change the terms of reference of accounting officers 
to include best value, surely he or she could remove it without recourse to Parliament. 
Therefore, parts 1 and 2 of the bill are inconsistent. If it is not necessary 
to use primary legislation to place a duty of best value on accounting officers 
or permanent secretaries, why is it necessary to legislate to place a duty of 
community planning on them?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Achieving 
best value will be difficult if different public bodies in the partnership are 
subject to separate and different guidance and I am pleased that the minister 
addressed that issue in his opening remarks. I hope that he will lodge an amendment 
at stage 2.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Community planning 
is designed to ensure long-term commitment to effective partnership working with 
communities, local authorities and other key public bodies. Those partners, in 
consultation with the voluntary sector, the private sector and communities, should 
agree a strategic vision for their area. Although guidance will be provided, the 
committee would like communities' rights in respect of community planning to be 
defined </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14286">14286</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">clearly in the bill. We believe that 
consulting and involving communities should be a duty on all community planning 
partners, not only councils. Surely that must be within the spirit of the bill.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who 
are the partners? They are the health boards, police and fire boards, Scottish 
Enterprise, the Scottish Passenger Transport Authority and Highlands and Islands 
Enterprise, all of whom capture the care of the community planning partners in 
any one area of Scotland. The committee accepted that other partners could be 
added. We took the view that Communities Scotland should be included because of 
its role in social housing and regeneration across Scotland. Again, I am pleased 
that the minister said in his opening speech that there might be a way to make 
that happen.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The committee 
was supportive of the idea of the partnerships being able to incorporate themselves 
and receive cross-cutting funding from the Executive. Iain Smith has spoken about 
that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The power to advance 
well-being would give a specific statutory form to the principle of subsidiarity 
between Parliament and local government. It would be a way of expressing in statute 
the fundamental purpose of a council&#151;to be the voice of its people and to 
promote their interests. We welcome the deputy minister's assurances that that 
is a power of first resort, or a can-do power. We also accept the point that, 
if the bill specified particular uses for the power, it might be interpreted that 
provisions that are not specifically mentioned in the bill are not permitted. 
I ask the minister to spell that out in guidance.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have not taken my six minutes, but I have touched briefly on some aspects of the 
bill. As I said, other members will speak in detail about other aspects. Although 
I have been critical of some parts of the bill, I am convinced that once it is 
amended along the lines that the committee has recommended, it will be welcomed 
by local authorities, other public bodies and the communities that they serve.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
regret that the report on the bill was one of the few times when the committee 
has produced a report that is not unanimous. One member was against it. The Tories 
claim that there is no need for the bill; however, that is not the case. Everyone 
who gave evidence to the committee welcomed the bill, although with reservations. 
That said, I am not surprised that the Tories are against the bill, given their 
hostility towards local government. Indeed, members have already made that point. 
As a supporter of local government and the principle of subsidiarity, I recommend 
the bill's general principles to the Parliament.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15:31</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ms

could have encompassed all the good aspects of local government. However, I will 
speak to the areas that the bill covers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
bill contains three main themes: best value; community planning; and the power 
of well-being. Iain Smith, Trish Godman and the minister have all mentioned best 
value. I am pleased that the minister has at least recognised that councils must 
be allowed to compete on a level playing field. It is absurd that councils will 
be restricted by legislation and guidance when other public agencies are not. 
How can councils go out into the big, bad world and compete against such bodies 
under such terms? If we are to work in partnership&#151;to use a famous Labour 
party word&#151;there must be common legislation and guidance. I ask the minister 
to consider the matter again.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
community planning, I endorse all the committee's recommendations on Communities 
Scotland. The minister's assurance that he will lodge new amendments on that part 
of the bill shows that he has at least taken heed of that section of the committee's 
report. As Trish Godman pointed out, community planning is an important part of 
the bill. Only yesterday, we were in my old hunting ground of Paisley, where I 
was a councillor. I will not bore the chamber with details of the 10 years that 
I spent there. We visited the town not to take evidence on the bill but to ask 
people for their thoughts on various aspects of local government. In the workshop 
group that I chaired, community planning was discussed in great detail. It touches 
everyone from the local authority to local people, and forms one of the bill's 
most basic aspects.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am 
intrigued by some of the minister's remarks about co-operation among various agencies.

committee's stance on the provision for prior consent between agencies being written 
into the bill. We do not know how the process might work if prior consent is not 
included, for example if a particular agency says, &quot;The health board wants 
to do this,&quot; and two or three agencies think that it is a good idea but one 
does not. Without provision for prior consent, there would be great confusion. 
It is important to clarify the situation not just for the Local Government Committee 
or for Parliament, but for councils.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
his summing up, I would like the minister to expand not on the wine lakes or on 
the various extra moneys that were mentioned, but on the use of the power of well-being 
by councils to supply agencies with various services. I asked the minister about 
that matter in the committee, but did not get a reply. I asked the minister about 
deprived areas and he did not deny or confirm my point. The example was of a particular 
council that decided&#151;and the people agreed&#151;that it would be a good idea 
for the community if the council supplied inexpensive fruit to a deprived area. 
Would that be allowed for under the power of well-being? In a rural area, cheaper 
fuel could perhaps be provided under the power of well-being. The introduction 
of the power of well-being will give councils the power to benefit communities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Local

national aims and targets at a local level? It would be interesting if the Liberal

said that in front of Henry McLeish at a chamber of commerce breakfast in Aberdeen, 
which many people from the north-east attended. Aberdeenshire Council did not 
like the direction that the Government has taken on funding, pushing and pulling 
for what it wants and generally interfering. Basically, the Executive is wrapped 
up in something called new burdens, and I know that my colleagues in the Convention

see that in the Executive's proposals at all. One of the difficulties that community 
councils face is that some councils are good and others are not. I compliment 
Stirling Council. It is a Labour council, but it did listen to good advice from

important for local government, Scotland and the Parliament. The power to advance 
well-being, which the minister mentioned and which has been derided by the Conservatives 
on my extreme right, is about more than simply creating the circumstances to do 
more in local communities. As Trish Godman rightly said, the power encapsulates 
the principle of subsidiarity, as it allows local government to take responsibilities 
that it should have and allows the Parliament to extend the devolution process 
beyond this chamber and ensure that that process continues down or up&#151;depending 
on one's perspective&#151;to local government. The Parliament should applaud that 
important principle.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Iain

that that applies in my Shetland constituency. I will give two small examples 
of community planning working in practice in Shetland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Shetland Welfare Trust provides care services for elderly people. Last Friday, 
it celebrated its 10<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary in Whalsay and I was pleased to 
attend the celebration. The trust has created six excellent care centres, which&#151;I 
grant&#151;has been done on the back of available resources that flowed as a result 
of oil revenues to the council. It has done that because the community was brave 
enough to say that it values people and wants to ensure that they can be given 
the best things possible in life and that they are respected. It wanted to create 
the circumstances in which people could have a happy life. I believe that the 
community shows self-confidence and believes in working with agencies and different 
organisations to achieve its aims.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
current developments and measures that the minister proposes are exciting. Initiatives 
such as the joint future initiative formalise processes between health boards 
and local authorities to ensure that in community care, for example, there are 
significant advances. That simply did not happen under the previous Tory Administration. 
Indeed, I remember well when community care was introduced&#151;as I was a researcher 
at Westminster at the time&#151;and the chaos that was created overnight. The 
joint future initiative is the kind of measure that will make a real difference 
to local authorities and to national health service boards in delivering for local 
people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second example 
relates to enterprise companies. Orkney and Shetland have worked extremely hard 
in pursuit of a fibre optic cable, to give the local business community and domestic 
customers the opportunity to take advantage of the e-business world&#151;I pay 
tribute to Peter Peacock's role in that respect. In addition, the community has 
considerable advantages&#151;as do much of the Highlands and Islands and the Western 
Isles&#151;in respect of renewables.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All 
those aspects of community development can come together through community planning, 
because the local authority has a logical position in leading the initiatives 
and leading the consortiums that pull together the projects for fibre optic cables 
and energy cables. That is the epitome of community planning. It uses the local 
enterprise company, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, some of the bodies to which 
Trish Godman referred and the local authorities to pull together funding and also 
ensure that a bid for European funding can be successful. That kind of work across 
agencies is crucial and the bill develops that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My

that will be useful for councillors in Shetland Islands Council. The minister

The councillor for Unst, who must be the most northerly serving councillor in 
Scotland, Mr Mark Ritch&#151;who is a friend and colleague of mine&#151;will now 
be able, through various mechanisms, to take part in council meetings in Lerwick 
from his home in Baltasound. That is a welcome measure, not least because it takes 
two hours to travel between Unst and Lerwick. I suspect that the provision could 
improve considerably the lives of councillors in Peter Peacock's old stamping 
ground, the Highlands, as it is a vast area.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There

aspects will play in ensuring that the bill is accepted in Parliament today.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15:52</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Elaine 
Thomson (Aberdeen North) (Lab): </strong>I am a fairly recent recruit to the Local 
Government Committee. Initially, some of its discussions seemed labyrinthine. 
However, in the short time that I have been a member of the committee, the importance 
of local government has come across to me strongly. Local government is the first 
port of call for most people in the community on matters that relate to housing, 
education, care in the community and transport. Local government has to deliver 
many of those services and people tend to go to local government first.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Local 
government is also important in providing a high-quality environment in all our 
communities. A recent example of that in Aberdeen is the introduction by the local 
council of a byelaw that has banned drinking in public. That is another small 
step that has been taken to improve the environment for people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is vital that local authorities provide services and carry out the strategic thinking 
that they need to do for their communities as effectively as possible. The bill 
will empower local authorities. For example, part 1 of the bill removes the constraints 
of compulsory competitive tendering and makes it a duty for all local authorities 
constantly to seek to improve local services through best value. That duty is 
important.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When considering

requirements.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was 
pleased that the minister said that he wanted to apply best value across the public 
sector. Many people said to the Local Government Committee that they did not think 
that best value should apply only to local government.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consideration 
of environmentally sustainable development should be one of the requirements for 
best value. Looking after the quality of our environment, in terms of biodiversity 
and freedom to live in clean, unpolluted surroundings, will become increasingly 
important. For example, air pollution is a problem in many of our cities. That 
cannot be divorced from proposals in local and structural plans for transport 
improvements, which are often delivered by local government.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Increasingly, 
councils use partnership working when trying to develop strategic thinking and 
to engage and involve local communities in deciding on their future and the way 
forward. Community planning will underpin that process and make it easier for 
local authorities to organise that way of working. The community planning part 
of the bill gives a structure and a way forward for local authorities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
councils engage voluntarily in community planning. Aberdeen City Council, for 
example, has completed a large-scale consultation with the city's citizens and 
many organisations in the city, both private and public, to develop the Aberdeen 
community plan, which is called Aberdeen futures. That plan has many key ideas 
and will undoubtedly point the way forward for the city in the coming decades. 
The community planning part of the bill will make such plans mandatory for all 
communities. We cannot afford to have different parts of the public and private 
sector developing plans in isolation. Planning must be holistic and make best 
use of resources in the public sector. It is increasingly important that the parts 
work together.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tavish Scott

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">most important part of the bill. 
COSLA and most local authorities have argued for a long time for a power of general 
competence and they welcome that aspect of the bill. In many communities, the 
power will make a real difference by allowing local authorities to act proactively 
in favour of local areas, rather than constantly being restricted by, for instance, 
planning legislation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
Aberdeen, there has been growth in many new communities, such as the Bridge of 
Don. In that area, a backlog in the provision of community amenities such as schools, 
pharmacies and sports facilities has been a constant complaint. That might not 
have happened if Aberdeen City Council had had the power of well-being when the 
community was being built.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rundown 
or closed retail developments are a problem for many deprived communities in Scotland. 
Such places are sometimes left to moulder away or are not run well. Despite the 
best attempts of local authorities and social inclusion partnerships, it is often 
difficult to renovate such developments or turn them into something useful such 
as grocery shops and pharmacies, rather than off-licences and bookies. The bill 
and the power of well-being should be able to assist with that problem. I ask 
the minister to consider whether the bill has enough teeth to be effective on 
that issue.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15:59</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Colin 
Campbell (West of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I was a councillor for four years and I 
am heavily committed to the idea that councils and community councils, which formed 
another part of my past, should have as much power as possible. Before I was translated 
to the European Committee, I served on the Local Government Committee for the 
first 18 months of my time in the Parliament. Much of what we have heard today 
came from evidence that was presented to the Local Government Committee at that 
time.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I welcome the power 
of general competence, which is now described as the power to advance well-being. 
That is a good example of subsidiarity. Although Trish Godman believes in subsidiarity, 
I would like even more of it, because I want all the powers that are reserved 
to the United Kingdom to be in Scotland. However, the subsidiarity that is represented 
by the power to advance well-being will enable councils to make important decisions 
on their own initiative in areas that were previously closed to them because of 
legislation. It would be good if councils had sufficient money available to them 
to carry out initiatives beyond their statutory obligations, but that is unlikely.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There

the community. I hasten to add that I am not suggesting that we do that here&#151;I 
am too much of a Calvinist. I am simply recording the fact. Whether that was the 
norm or whether it had been done under a special power in Namibia, I do not know, 
but it might be possible to run the idea past those who are drafting the bill 
and the lawyers. Peter Peacock might also like to comment on it at the end of 
the debate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I was 
on the Local Government Committee, we heard many presentations on alternatives 
to the first-past-the-post electoral system. The conclusion was that the single 
transferable vote system was probably the best bet. I suppose that I am also speaking 
partly on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, whose lips are probably well sealed 
by coalition glue, when I say that I am deeply sorry that proportional representation 
is conspicuously absent from the bill. The reason for that is not difficult to 
understand. Research has revealed that many councillors&#151;whether they are 
in power or proportionally representative by accident&#151;are quite happy with 
the status quo.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Electoral 
reform is about even-handedness and sensible solutions. It also means that vested 
interests have to step aside&#151;there are some classic examples of people who 
are unwilling to step aside. PR is one way of making electors feel that their 
vote is worth while and of engaging them in politics. It is a way of energising 
the electorate, which we have been endeavouring to do for many years. The absence 
of PR in the bill represents a democratic deficit.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Equally, 
I am disappointed on behalf of my former colleagues and councillors everywhere 
that there is no talk in the bill of the remuneration of councillors. People become 
councillors for a vast variety of reasons: some are enthusiastic about being councillors; 
some want to serve their party; some want to fill a gap that needs to be filled; 
and some become involved because councillors have annoyed them so much that they 
make the switch from being ordinary citizens to getting involved with politics.

In the chamber&#151;and certainly in the reporting of events in the chamber&#151;the 
tendency is to take the view that, if the debate is not about fox hunting, section

is not terribly important. I tend to think that, occasionally, some kind of inverted

know that Keith Harding is a humorist, because he also described his belief in 
local democracy. We are grateful to him for that wit. He said that the Conservative 
philosophy was to give local government the ball and to let it run with it. I 
think that the experience of most members in the chamber is that the Conservatives 
tend to give local government the ball and then puncture it. That is a slightly 
different approach from the one that he advanced.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keith 
Harding described himself as being bitterly disappointed by the bill. I was studying 
him closely and I do not think that he was bitterly disappointed at all. I do 
not think that he could honestly even aspire to describing himself as being slightly 
miffed by the bill. He looked vaguely woken up by it, but not much more than that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
are three important strands to the bill. One is best value, which of itself would 
be enough to merit parliamentary consideration and legislation, given that it 
finally ends the discredited regime of CCT&#151;the pointless delivery of cheapness 
rather than value&#151;and replaces it with the relentless pursuit of excellence 
in value.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyone who has 
worked in a council as an employee or as a councillor knows the value of properly 
structured and managed direct labour organisations and direct service organisations 
delivering important services to the local community and turning an honest buck, 
which then comes back into the council's budget and helps to pay for other services. 
If best value, in replacing CCT, does anything to support DLOs and DSOs&#151;in 
particular, to support the culture of quality management in those organisations&#151;it 
is worth having.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bill 
is not simply about best value. It also outlines a system of community planning. 
From my experience of working with drug action teams across Scotland, I know the 
value of bringing together different bodies that play important roles in the community&#151;health 
boards, police boards, local authorities, service delivery organisations and individuals. 
If community planning fosters anything like the culture that drug action teams 
have begun to foster in order to bear down on the drug problem in Scotland, the 
time that has been put into the bill will have been worth while.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14301">14301</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

to empower local authorities. The Executive has gone a long way down that path. 
The minister mentioned the ending of capping, the reduction of hypothecation and

have not been dealt with. Some of those were mentioned in previous speeches. The 
bill fails to deal with the iniquitous system of tagging local government elections 
on to Scottish Parliament elections, like poor relations. As I mentioned, a number 
of MSPs are former local councillors. I am sure that Trish Godman, with whom I 
served for a number of years on Glasgow City Council, would not have been happy 
if at that time municipal elections in Glasgow had been tagged on to Scottish 
Parliament elections. In those days, Trish Godman was a calm, placid soul, but 
she would have been enraged by such a measure.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
question of which electoral system should be used for local government&#151;in

fudging of the matter. We expected the well-known trio of Mike Rumbles, Donald 
Gorrie and Iain Smith&#151;nicknamed the wilting political violets&#151;to storm 
the barricades for PR. I have not heard any storming of the barricades this afternoon, 
although it may come when Donald Gorrie speaks. It is more than likely that Jim 
Wallace had a quiet word in their ears along the lines of, &quot;Charles wouldn't 
like it.&quot; That is Charles Kennedy, not Prince Charles. Jim Wallace probably 
said, &quot;Look chaps, we have not been in real government as a party for 87

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">local government with contempt is 
something that the Tories did exceptionally well in the 18 years for which they 
were in power. Local government in Scotland at that time protected the most vulnerable

Executive acknowledges the vital role that local government plays. I welcome the

other issue that I want to raise relates to the debate. Are we honestly saying 
to people out there that local government cannot function until the great new 
dawn of electoral reform comes upon us? Local government provides vital services 
day in, day out, and will continue to do so. The tone of some of the debate has 
devalued the vital role that local government workers play every day as they provide 
those services. Employees are at the heart of local government&#151;elected members 
may make the policy decisions, but the employees implement the policies and work 
extremely hard.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I ask the 
minister to clarify two specific points that were raised by the Education, Culture 
and Sport Committee on section 29, which is in part 5 of the bill. First, COSLA 
indicated that there may be slippage in the timetable for the job-sizing exercise. 
I ask the minister to indicate the steps that will be taken to address that slippage, 
should it occur. Secondly, the Educational Institute of Scotland brought to the 
committee's attention the fact that section 87B of the Education (Scotland) Act 
1980 places certain obligations on local authorities with regard to the appointment 
of staff. It is assumed that there is no conflict between the suspension of section 
87A of that act and the Self-Governing Schools etc (Scotland) Act 1989.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
many local authorities, community planning is carried out well and has been placed 
on a good footing. However, that is not the case in other local authorities. We 
must consider placing community planning on a statutory footing. As Angus MacKay 
said, we should ensure that we pull together the good examples that exist. To 
me, there is no sense in the bland interface that takes place in the community 
care field to deal with people who are stuck in hospitals and who the authorities 
are unable to move into the community because they cannot get the resources that 
they need. My constituents face being unable to get the services that they want 
or to leave hospital when they want to. Good community planning that involves 
the community and all the other sectors may overcome such difficulties.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14305">14305</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

doubts that were expressed by the Society of Local Authority Lawyers and Administrators

are certainly different patterns throughout Europe. We expect a lot of all our

in the position of some poor person who lives in a country where there is a lot

I am afraid that Scottish local government is not in that league.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
want to make one or two points about the bill, which I hope are constructive. 
First, the bill does not give enough attention to the voluntary sector. It mentions 
community bodies and other bodies that may include the voluntary sector, but I 
believe that the voluntary sector should have a major part. Along with local authorities, 
health boards and quangos, the voluntary sector should be a major player in providing 
best value, in community planning and in the power to advance well-being. If my 
information is correct, the Executive's best-value task force did not include 
anybody from the voluntary sector. That is very foolish. We must harness the huge 
talents of our colleagues in the voluntary sector.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Robin 
Harper (Lothians) (Green): </strong>Does Donald Gorrie agree that, given just a little

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">undervalued. The Golspie community 
recycling project is one example that could be repeated all over Scotland with 
ease.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Donald Gorrie: 
</strong>Yes, I agree entirely with that. That is a good example of how a bit of help 
from the council can mean that best value can be achieved by working through a 
voluntary sector body. There can be a lot of advantage to the community as well.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like 
the Local Government Committee, I believe that best value should cover quangos 
and central Government. I do not see why the civil service, Government departments 
and quangos should be excluded from the duty to secure best value. Whatever their 
faults, local authorities are more democratic than quangos and&#151;I am trying 
to find the opposite of &quot;inscrutable&quot;&#151;more capable of being scrutinised. 
To exclude quangos from such a duty seems a bit bizarre. I think that quangos 
should be included.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I welcome 
the committee's enthusiasm for having sustainability as one of the criteria for 
best value at the beginning of the bill. In Britain and in many other countries, 
public affairs are run far too much on a short-term basis. We must encourage everyone 
to look at the longer term. Recognising that, the Parliament and the Executive 
have produced quite a good set of proposals, but other bodies may not yet be quite 
up to speed on that. Sustainability should be laid down clearly as a criterion.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Personally, 
I would have far preferred that local authorities were given a power of general 
competence than a power to advance well-being. The power of general competence 
is a well-established concept all over the continent. If the bill provided a power 
of general competence that allowed councils to do anything that was not illegal 
and was not specifically the task of somebody else&#151;so that they could not 
set up a hospital or something&#151;that would get over the issue of possible 
duplication. However, the powers that be have obviously decided something different.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
may have missed it, but the part of the bill that deals with the power to advance 
well-being contains nothing about consulting the local community, although such 
consultation is required for community planning. The need for consultation should 
be made absolutely clear. That would mean that any councillor who had some slightly 
hare-brained idea could not go off without consulting people. Consultation might 
bring better ideas.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It

Young spoke about proportional representation. The Tories would be more credible

vote against it and, at the moment, most or all of the Labour party would vote 
against it. The only way of making progress will be to persuade the Labour party 
to adopt PR, and that will be a slow process. Getting any party to have a major 
change of policy is not easy, but that is the process that we are undertaking 
in this coalition Government. We will see what happens in the next Government.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There

simply follow the recommendations of McIntosh, who said that there should be a 
power of general competence? I was not persuaded by Iain Smith's little story 
about the post office. I would have thought that local authorities already have 
the powers to deal with the situation that he described. I accept that it might 
be a matter for dispute, but I would have thought that the estates department 
of Glasgow City Council would have been able to cope quite adequately with the 
problem. Again, that demonstrates why the legislation is unnecessary.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

unnecessary.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16:42</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Tricia 
Marwick: </strong>Keith Harding and Bill Aitken have said that the power of general 
competence is unnecessary. Keith Harding said that, as leader of Stirling Council, 
he could do anything that he needed to do without such a power of general competence. 
However, the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland, chaired by Lord 
Wheatley way back in 1969, concluded that there should be a power of general competence 
for local authorities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

the concept of local government having substantial freedom within the limits of

Government at that time did not believe that a case had been made for the need 
for the UK to adopt an international agreement. However, that same Conservative 
Government, accepting in 1996 that a clear signal should be given that it recognised 
the value of local government, recommended the creation of a new statutory power 
of local competence. That power is indeed the power of well-being. It might not 
go as far as the power of general competence that McIntosh supported, but it is 
an incremental step in that direction.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
am surprised by the comments of the Conservatives today. When they are in Government, 
they say one thing and when they are out of Government, they say something else.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr

council could do anything that it wanted to do.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is strange that the Conservatives support the provisions in the bill but will 
not vote for the general principles of the bill.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tavish 
Scott talked about milk and honey in response to Bruce Crawford's comments about 
wine and local authorities. Perhaps Bruce Crawford was referring to the fact that

the Gothenburg in Cardenden. We might still need an investigation into that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I

the minister to respond to that point and to say that he will lodge an amendment 
that will achieve that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
the Local Government Committee has suggested, there should be a duty on local 
authorities, and on all of their partners who have a duty to participate, to report

that it is not within the scope of the bill to discuss what those regulations 
might be, but the minister must give a clear indication as to whether he accepts 
the suggestions about what those regulations should include. That will impact 
on possible amendments at stage 2. He owes it to the chamber to give an indication 
of what he is thinking.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
minister said that the power of well-being should be seen as a power of first

Local authorities must be free to act for the well-being and the good of their 
area where they are not specifically forbidden to so do.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
Angus MacKay rightly said, we will support the bill. The bill is incremental change. 
It is not the kind of change that local government in Scotland needs; local government 
needs much more radical change. It certainly needs bolder change, in the words 
of the Prime Minister. The bill represents a very timid attempt to change local 
government.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Robin Harper:

a bill without PR in it is hardly worth voting for?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Tricia

will support the bill because it is incremental change, but it is not the radical

local government in Scotland. It is the one thing that would renew local democracy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
SNP makes two pledges. First, the local government elections that the Executive 
has combined with the Scottish Parliament elections will be separated again. Secondly, 
the Scottish National Party will introduce proportional representation for local

the detailed amendments at stage 2. I am grateful to members for making all their 
points firmly. I will deal with individual points first and then pick up on the 
common points that have been made by a number of members. Those points will be 
more substantive because so many members have touched on them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
her opening remarks, Tricia Marwick clearly indicated that the SNP supports the 
bill's principles. I welcome that. However, if my welcome sounds grudging, that 
is because the way in which she expressed support was also extremely grudging. 
She claimed that people are disappointed with the bill. However, that is not what 
the evidence suggests. If she speaks to local authorities, which are the main 
beneficiaries of the freedoms contained in the bill, and to their community partners 
such as health boards, local enterprise companies and the police, she will find 
that the bill has received a very warm welcome across Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Tricia 
Marwick: </strong>I actually said that the bill's provisions are welcome, and indeed 
have been welcomed throughout Scotland. Local government will particularly appreciate 
the power of well-being. However, I also said that people are disappointed with 
the bill's scope. They feel that it does not go far enough and that it does not 
include many of the provisions that the Executive's consultation paper in 2001 
said that it would include. It certainly does not cover PR in local government.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Peter 
Peacock: </strong>I will address some of those points in a moment. However, I should 
say that I am glad that Tricia Marwick has corrected the record and that she unreservedly 
welcomes the bill's provisions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tricia 
Marwick also raised a number of points about the miscellaneous provisions in the 
bill. Those are principally tidying-up measures; there will be nothing substantive 
in them, nor will they shock anyone. We are still in the process of tidying them 
up, and I will write to the committee as soon as possible to indicate the range 
of the various provisions. However, we are still checking out various ideas that 
might require to be included in that part of the bill. We will also lodge a range 
of purely technical amendments relating to drafting problems that were highlighted 
in evidence or by other means. We will let the committee know how we have tidied 
up those matters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In her 
opening remarks, Tricia Marwick wondered why we were not following the McIntosh 
commission's recommendations on the power of well-being. In fact, we have done 
so. After all, McIntosh explicitly recommended such a power, although he described 
it as a power of general competence. We have included the substance of that proposal 
in the bill.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14315">14315</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Every SNP speech mentioned PR, which 
shows that they were obviously part of the standard script that was issued before 
the debate. The issue of councillors' terms and conditions was also raised. The 
Labour party and the Liberal Democrats made it very clear at the outset of the 
partnership Executive that we would make progress on the issue of electoral reform. 
That is exactly what we are doing. We have indicated that we will introduce a 
bill by early next year. However, it will not be the sort of narrow bill that 
Tricia Marwick has proposed. It will be a wide local governance bill that will 
address the issue of councillors and indeed all the other issues that have been 
raised. The bill will also see the renewal of local democracy as something much 
wider than the issue of PR.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of 
course, the purpose behind Tricia Marwick's limited and narrow member's bill on 
PR is purely to cause mischief and to divide the partnership. She has singularly 
failed to do so.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>John 
Young: </strong>Is there a timetable for PR? Has the Executive decided&#151;without 
necessarily telling the Liberal Democrats&#151;to accept PR in the next session 
of the Parliament, or even in the session after that? If not, does that mean that 
the Labour party may well sever its links with its coalition partners at some 
point?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Peter Peacock:

Smith highlighted the strong support for the bill not just throughout Scotland 
but within his own party, because it is a pro-local government bill. It gives 
back to local authorities the freedoms and responsibilities that the Conservatives 
systematically tried to strip away when they were in Government. Iain Smith, Angus 
MacKay, Karen Gillon and other members properly pointed out that the CCT regime 
that the Conservatives introduced was far too narrow. It forced councils to go 
down a particular route and to come to particular conclusions, irrespective of 
what was in the interests of their communities. The move towards best value moves 
us decisively away from that regime to create a new system of accountabilities 
and a new method of determining what is in the interests of communities as far 
as service delivery is concerned. The bill will create best value, but also balance 
quality and cost within the same framework. That is an important development.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Iain 
Smith also mentioned the move to incorporation and, in particular, the need for 
accountability in that respect. Both of us have had experience of how people who 
were put on joint boards became loyal to the joint board rather than to their 
council. We must consider the whole question of accountability, if we move to

Godman rightly pointed out many of the questions that her committee addressed 
in the course of examining the bill. Essentially, her comments were about freeing 
up local government and giving back to it responsibility, powers and rights to 
do things in the interests of the community that, hitherto, it has been unable 
to do.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sandra White asked 
about the funding that I indicated would become available. I make it clear that 
we are talking about the outcome of the consultation on community budgeting and 
about the resources that are available from public sources within a community. 
The outcome of that consultation is that we will advance our work on community 
budgeting through community planning partnerships. Margaret Curran will make further 
announcements about that in due course.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Further 
thinking in the Executive concerns capacity building in communities to allow them 
to participate in community planning. Again, Margaret Curran's portfolio has much 
to offer in that respect.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sandra 
White talked about the power of well-being and illustrated her point with the 
example of supplying fruit to particular communities. That is the kind of power 
we want to liberate councils to use if they think it is right. Such a use of the 
power would be subject to the question whether the council was duplicating the 
provision of another organisation and that would have to be resolved. It would 
also be subject to questions of best value. However, that is exactly the kind 
of freedom that we want to provide.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I

the mechanism to do that and, if at all possible, we will make progress on that

good faith, we hope to make progress.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
was stunned by the sheer, breathtaking nerve and audacity of Keith Harding. Not 
only did he keep a straight face during the speech&#151;which must have been difficult 
to do&#151;but he called the bill an affront to democracy which, when one considers 
the record of the Tories during the 18 years for which they were in power, is 
simply breathtaking.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Tory Government was the most centralising Government of the last century. The 
Tories were the people who imposed guidelines on councils&#151;if we spent one 
ha'penny more than what was in the guidelines, we lost grant. They were the people 
who imposed capping on local authorities to restrict the council tax levels that 
could be imposed to meet direct council services. They were the people who took 
back grant from councils if they overspent. They were the people who introduced 
the poll tax of all things&#151;centrally imposed by the Tories. They were the 
people who cut the term of office of councillors to make it more difficult for 
councillors to do their job and to plan for the future. They were the people who 
introduced the ill-thought-out reorganisation of local government that nobody 
wanted&#151;another attempt to undermine local authorities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
top of that, the Tories introduced compulsory competitive tendering, which I have 
dealt with. They removed functions from local authorities. They brought in more 
than 200 instruments to constrain local government in one form or another. They 
squeezed local government through the section 94 controls. For them to lecture 
us about the bill, which seeks to empower councils and give back freedoms, is 
simply ludicrous. They will be left behind in the debate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr

the Parliament notes that BAA Lynton has earmarked the former RAF Turnhouse site 
or &quot;Airwest&quot; for medium-to long-term commercial development in support 
of the expanding cargo operations at Edinburgh Airport following the grant of 
outline planning consent in June 2000; further notes that the entire site is currently 
being marketed to potential commercial occupiers for a variety of airport-related 
uses; expresses its concern that Home Office plans for a possible accommodation 
centre for asylum seekers on that site are creating uncertainty and thus the site 
is in danger of becoming blighted, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive 
and the City of Edinburgh Council should ask the Home Office to state clearly 
that it has no interest in the site and thereby permit BAA Lynton to proceed with 
its plans which are in the best interest of jobs and economic development in Edinburgh 
and the east of Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:04</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>In proposing the motion, I wish to 
highlight the needs of the expanding commercial international airport in Edinburgh. 
We have already debated and agreed on the need for a railway link with the airport. 
Edinburgh is one of the fastest growing capitals in Europe, and its success is 
essential for the economy, jobs and commerce in the Scottish lowlands and the 
east of Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The airport 
has already undergone &#163;100 million of redevelopment and it is set to benefit from 
that expansion. It follows that the needs of the cargo centre should not be neglected. 
BAA Lynton owns the site, which used to contain the buildings that belonged to 
RAF Turnhouse. For a considerable time, it has actively taken forward plans for 
the redevelopment of the site for cargo warehouses. As part of that programme, 
it has had discussions with the City of Edinburgh Council about plans to improve 
the Maybury roundabout, to allow better access to Turnhouse.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
underestimate the need for Edinburgh airport to expand its cargo warehousing capability 
at our peril. In the past nine years, there has been a colossal increase in the 
amount of cargo that has come into Edinburgh airport. In 1993, excluding mail, 
1,212 metric tonnes of cargo came through the airport; by 2000, that figure had

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">soared to 18,094 metric tonnes. Furthermore, 
the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions has estimated that 
UK air cargo will double by 2010. It is therefore imperative that Edinburgh airport 
expands its cargo operation if it is to fight its weight as a world-class competitive 
airport in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr 
Richard Jeffrey, who is the managing director of BAA Edinburgh, has written to 
me. He said:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If the 
site were lost to the proposed asylum seekers centre the effects would perhaps 
be twofold:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. The north 
site is included within the long-term development plans for Edinburgh airport. 
If lost, this may put pressure on our remaining land supply in the cargo area 
and constrain operational development and cargo growth.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. 
The location of an asylum seekers centre may simply deter third party investment 
in the location, albeit for no sound reason.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
use of this land for the proposed development of cargo operations, airport related 
business space and other airport ancillary needs would have a much greater net 
benefit for the local economy than any other use.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Home Office is, of course, aware of BAA Lynton's plans, which have received outline 
planning permission. Apparently, it is still considering whether the site should 
be compulsorily purchased as an accommodation centre for 750 asylum seekers. BAA 
Lynton's position is that protracted delay on behalf of the Home Office is giving 
rise to a mood of uncertainty that could result in the site's becoming blighted. 
It is clear that that would be contrary to the best interests of Edinburgh and 
the east of Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
a letter to me dated 5 September, Neal Franklin of the new policy directorate 
of the Home Office said:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
Home Office is currently in discussion with the Department for Transport regarding 
its consultation document published in July, which included plans to expand Edinburgh

that Scottish Executive ministers must also&#151;rightly&#151;be consulted.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr

that connection, the results of a survey that was carried out earlier this year 
revealed that approaching 90 per cent of those who live close to the airport on

and frequently expressed concerns were about security, as the site is adjacent 
to Edinburgh </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14325">14325</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

are having the debate against a background of continued uncertainty and public

met local residents in the area and representatives </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14326">14326</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">of the BAA to discuss their concerns. 
Both groups have lived and functioned with what amounts to planning blight and 
uncertainty since the announcement. I call on the Home Office to make a speedy 
decision not to go ahead with Turnhouse as an accommodation centre site. That 
view is shared by local residents, the City of Edinburgh Council&#151;as Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton outlined&#151;BAA and local representatives of all mainstream 
parties, who I believe have handled the issue with the necessary sensitivity and 
care.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few years ago, 
before I entered politics, I was the Scottish organiser for the United Nations 
Association and was involved in fundraising for the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees. I had above my desk a UNHCR poster. It had a photograph of Albert 
Einstein and the caption, &quot;Einstein was a refugee.&quot; I believe totally 
in our country's responsibilities under the UN charter for refugees and I believe 
totally in our responsibility as human beings to those who are fleeing persecution. 
Those responsibilities extend to ensuring that when asylum seekers enter this 
country we treat them with respect and give them the services they require in 
the best possible location.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why 
have I consistently opposed the siting of an accommodation centre at Turnhouse? 
Because I believe that it is wrong for local residents and for asylum seekers 
alike.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, although 
the accommodation centre would have an impact on the local community and services, 
the Home Office failed to consult and engage with the City of Edinburgh Council, 
elected representatives and local residents prior to making the statement. The 
Home Office has cancelled meetings with me and it has failed to consult people 
properly. It has failed to do the work that is necessary&#151;with the council, 
with the national health service, with the police and with other service providers&#151;to 
evaluate the impact that such a centre would have on local services, particularly 
housing provision, policing and the local NHS.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have raised the issue of the pressures there would be on social housing in the 
city if, each year, 2,000 people were given leave to remain and stayed in the 
area. The Home Office responded to me in March, stating:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We 
have yet to resolve the practical details of what happens when a resident is granted 
status.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those sorts 
of issues should have been discussed with the City of Edinburgh Council prior 
to an announcement.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, 
I am opposed in principle to 750-bed accommodation centres, particularly if they 
are in semi-rural areas such as Turnhouse. That is not the best way to integrate 
people into our country. </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14327">14327</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Refugee organisations, charities 
and churches have all voiced similar concerns. Nick Hardwick, chief executive 
of the Refugee Council, stated:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We 
are very concerned about the proposed accommodation centres. The experience of 
similar centres on the continent which are away from urban centres and where everything 
is provided on site is that the asylum seekers become very isolated and institutionalised 
and those who are allowed to stay have huge problems properly integrating.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
number of children's charities have raised specific concerns about children and 
families being included in pilot centres, given that 80 per cent of the centre 
population would be young males.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Crucially, 
I believe that this is the wrong location because it would limit the expansion 
and continued success of Edinburgh airport. The eight hectare site in question 
has secured outline planning consent for airport and ancillary uses in the medium 
and long term. BAA Lynton and Edinburgh airport have both made it clear that its 
use for anything else would have a seriously detrimental impact not only on the 
airport but on the economy of the city and Scotland. It is clear from the aviation 
consultation document and the draft west Edinburgh planning framework that the 
continued expansion of Edinburgh airport is of great national importance.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have raised the matter with the Home Office on several occasions and I know that 
other colleagues have done the same. I am pleased to report that at least the 
Home Office has confirmed to me in the past week that the minister responsible 
will not consider the siting of an accommodation centre in isolation and has liaised 
with the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions about the 
recently published aviation consultation document. The Home Office has assured 
me that that document and the expansion of the airport will play a part in the 
minister's assessment of whether to go ahead with the accommodation centre. It 
is a pity that such liaison between Westminster departments did not take place 
in advance of the February announcement.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Edinburgh 
airport is the fastest-growing airport in the United Kingdom. It has enjoyed 12 
per cent year-on-year growth in passenger numbers as well as rapid growth in freight 
carried. The airport supports Edinburgh's economy and tourism industry. Given 
that the Executive supports plans for a rail link and a transport interchange 
at the airport&#151;and that BAA plans a major cargo strategy&#151;it is clear 
that jobs in the local economy would suffer if expansion were curtailed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton outlined, BAA has made it clear that the site is included

hope that the Scottish Executive will do all it can to secure a change of mind 
by the Home Office and an early response. I hope that the Scottish Executive will 
agree that we want a Scotland in which people of all cultures and backgrounds 
live together in mutual respect, and one in which Edinburgh continues to thrive. 
Neither of those aims will be brought about by a misguided development at the 
site in question.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:16</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>I congratulate James Douglas-Hamilton on 
securing the debate and I subscribe to many of his and Margaret Smith's points. 
The debate is important for two reasons. First, there is the issue of how we treat 
asylum seekers and whether accommodation centres are the best method of assimilating 
them. Secondly, there is the issue of the economic expansion not only of the airport, 
but of Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do not 
believe that accommodation centres are the best way in which to integrate people. 
The debate is ironic, given that, this week, the census figures have revealed 
the potentially cataclysmic decline in the Scottish population. There has been 
talk of the return of the expatriate community and Professor Wright from Stirling 
mentioned a need for immigration. We must assimilate people into the country. 
There is a labour shortage in key sectors in Edinburgh, not only in the highly 
skilled sectors, but in hotels, which are at the lower end of the food chain, 
if I may put it that way. Without Kiwi and Australian students working away, many 
major hotels in the city would have great difficulties. We need the labour that 
those people provide to assist the growth of our community. Fiona Hyslop will 
deal further with asylum seekers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
must consider separately the issues of economic development and the expansion 
of the airport. The expansion of the airport is fundamental. I do not want to 
be pedantic about one of the points Margaret Smith made, but Edinburgh airport 
is not the fastest-growing airport in Scotland or the UK; it is the fastest-growing 
BAA airport. The growth at Prestwick surpasses that at Edinburgh, but BAA spin-doctors 
have put a spin on the matter. However, I do not denigrate the growth at Edinburgh 
airport, which has benefited the city and individual citizens such as me.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fiona 
Hyslop has visited the cargo facilities. No doubt Margaret Smith has done the 
same. There is a need for expansion. The current facilities are antediluvian and 
they must be improved. Given </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14329">14329</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">what already exists at Ratho and 
Newbridge, the site provides an opportunity to create a greater intermodal interchange 
and hub that would add value not only to the airport's cargo operations, but to 
Edinburgh, given the M8 and M9 access and the road network.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
am glad that BAA Lynton seems to be returning to being an airport rather than 
a retail developer. It has given up and sold out in the McArthurGlen outlet, although 
I think that it retains ownership of its Livingston outlet. BAA Lynton should 
concentrate on the important hub that I mentioned.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Edinburgh 
is naturally constrained to the north by the River Forth and to the south by the 
Pentland hills. Only a set area is available for economic development. The site 
we are discussing is a key area and has always been cherished. We must consider 
carefully any extension that breaches the green belt, but we have an opportunity 
to allow Edinburgh to grow through rail links to the airport and cargo facilities, 
which will add value to the city.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
also have to accept the fact that there is room for expansion not only of cargo 
facilities. Park-and-ride facilities are a proposed method of addressing traffic 
congestion. I know that the preferred park-and-ride facility is not exactly adjacent 
to RAF Turnhouse, but it is not that far away, down towards the Newbridge area, 
at the end of the footprint of the runway there.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
area must be preserved for the growth of the airport and for the expansion of 
the city's economic development. Such opportunity does not exist to the north 
or the south, and the possibilities for moving eastwards are constrained by Musselburgh, 
Port Seton and all that other area. The only other natural land bank for the city 
of Edinburgh is the brownfield site that is controlled by the Forth Ports Authority. 
That is being addressed, correctly, by the waterfront development. We must keep 
it together for the benefit of all our citizens and the economic progress of our 
city in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:20</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Bristow

issues that have been mentioned. It is to those issues&#151;economics and transport&#151;that 
I now turn.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is clear 
that the west Edinburgh area is important not only to the city of Edinburgh, but

as a key transport corridor for tourists who are moving into or out of the country

accept Mr MacAskill's point that Edinburgh airport is perhaps not the fastest-growing 
airport in Scotland, but it is one of the fastest-growing airports in the UK. 
Its future expansion is desirable and is being examined as part of the Government 
consultation that was launched in the summer. I have been in contact with BAA 
officials on many occasions and have visited the airport many times, and I am 
confident that, once the airline industry settles down following the shock of 
11 September, Edinburgh airport will grow even more strongly than it has over 
the past year.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The growth 
in air freight is of central important to the east central Scotland economy. Much 
of the freight that is moved in that way is the high-value, low-volume freight 
that is involved in some of the industries that we are trying to develop, such 
as the electronics and biotechnology industries. To help support the Executive's 
plans to develop those high-knowledge, high-wage parts of the economy, we need 
a robust air freight system. The proximity of many key Scottish financial institutions 
to Edinburgh airport also underlines the continuing need to develop the airport.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
future of RAF Turnhouse must be considered carefully in that economic context.

The indecision has been like a ball and chain fastened to BAA Lynton and is seriously 
hampering its plans to expand the airport and its cargo capacity. We must now 
cut free from that ball and chain and conclude the matter once and for all. As 
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton stated, it is perilous to underestimate how much Edinburgh

the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
commercial ambitions of BAA are important to its development at Edinburgh of a 
dynamic, efficient and modern airport that has facilities to rival its competitors

the further investment of a cargo centre and other commercial developments at 
the airport, we could finally see developments&#151;as Kenny MacAskill pointed 
out&#151;such as the rail link from the city centre to the airport, to which the 
Executive aspires and which is supported by members of all parties in the Parliament. 
Apart from the rail dimension, there is a further advantage in terms of the proximity 
of the airport and its site to the roads network in Scotland, with the M8, M9 
and M90 all being within a mile of the airport.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is also an employment impact because the airport is, directly and indirectly, 
a major employer and supports more than 7,000 jobs in Scotland. If we have the 
opportunity to expand the cargo industry, with the general expansion in aviation 
throughout the world, that jobs figure could rise significantly over the next 
decade and bring more employment to people living in the Edinburgh and Lothians.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
all those reasons&#151;the economic reasons to which we have alluded and the many 
other reasons that were cogently presented by Margaret Smith in her speech&#151;the 
Home Office needs to go back to the drawing board and abandon any plans that it 
might still harbour to use the Turnhouse site as an accommodation centre for asylum 
seekers.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14332">14332</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I take slight issue with Bristow 
Muldoon because I do not think that it is inappropriate for us to discuss asylum; 
it is an issue that straddles the devolved-reserved divide. I have no doubt that 
the general principles of policy should be a matter for Her Majesty's Government 
at Westminster, but we would have to deal with the consequences of the accommodation 
centre and the dispersal policy, and of the impact that those would have on local 
services and communities. Therefore, it is appropriate that the asylum seekers 
aspect is also referred to in the debate on the suitability of the Turnhouse site.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
do not think that any of us seriously disputes that accommodation centres are 
necessary or that the country as a whole should be involved in the dispersal programme 
while asylum seekers' claims are investigated and processed. I hope that that 
can be done a good deal more quickly than is currently the case, so that applicants 
need not be housed in such centres for longer than is necessary to conduct proper 
determinations of their applications.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is clear from members' speeches from all sides of the chamber that the Turnhouse 
site is manifestly unsuitable for accommodating asylum seekers and that there 
exists the option of an alternative development that will be of considerable economic 
benefit to Edinburgh and the Lothians and, indeed, the wider Scottish economy. 
The time has come for the fog of indecision that hangs over Turnhouse to be lifted 
by the Home Office. I hope that the minister, on behalf of the Executive, will 
forcefully communicate that point of view to the Home Office.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:29</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Fiona 
Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>I agree with many of the remarks that have been made. 
However, I would like to draw attention to what I see as two separate but related 
debates in the terms of the motion. I think that everybody in the chamber agrees 
on the importance of Edinburgh airport to the economy of the Lothians and Scotland. 
Remarks along those lines have been well made. I think that we all stand and will 
stand together&#151;cross-party&#151;in ensuring that the best case for Edinburgh 
airport will be presented in the future.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only 
10 days ago I was taken on a tour of the perimeter of Edinburgh airport, because 
I wanted to find out more about the area's growth needs and where the cargo base

had concerns about the development of park-and-fly facilities there. It is essential 
that we acknowledge the economic importance of the expansion and development of

the City of Edinburgh Council, but for West Lothian Council, because of the developments 
around Ratho and beyond.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
acknowledge that any development to the east of Edinburgh airport would have an 
impact on the economic viability of the cargo base and any other business development 
at the airport&#151;it is right that we pay attention to that issue. However, 
I am concerned when people link it to the case for setting up accommodation centres 
for asylum seekers. I disagree with David McLetchie's claim that no one disputes 
that accommodation centres are necessary. I do, for the same reasons that the 
City of Edinburgh Council suspended its discussions with the national asylum support 
service. The best way of dealing with asylum seekers and of ensuring that they 
are well cared for is to have a genuine dispersal process that allows councils 
to accommodate asylum seekers in the community. The children of asylum seekers 
would then be able to attend local schools, receive the support that they need 
and have their health needs met. I know that because almost two years ago, in 
response to a petition, the then Social Inclusion, Housing and Voluntary Sector 
Committee visited Sighthill to examine the consequences of siting many asylum 
seekers in one location.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>David 
McLetchie: </strong>Does Fiona Hyslop subscribe to that view because the current lengthy 
process of dealing with applications makes the approach that she has outlined 
appropriate? If applications were dealt with much more speedily&#151;within two 
months, rather than 18 months&#151;would she still argue that there should be 
no accommodation centres?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Fiona 
Hyslop: </strong>There are two problems. The first relates to how we deal with people 
who are fleeing persecution. Secondly, I agree with David McLetchie that the process 
of dealing with applications is too lengthy and that they should be dealt with 
much more speedily.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I turn 
to the proposed accommodation centre at Turnhouse. Although Turnhouse was earmarked 
as a possible site for an accommodation centre, it was not included in the first 
batch of centres. Four sites were announced, but they were all located in England. 
Amid widespread public concern, a number of councils in England have refused to 
grant permission for development of accommodation centres. The Westminster Government 
is having difficulties with the whole concept of accommodation centres, let alone 
its proposal for a centre at Turnhouse.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">do not think that that will happen. 
The City of Edinburgh Council was willing and able to negotiate with NASS about 
genuine dispersal within the community in Edinburgh. That is the route that we 
should follow.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During consideration 
of the Housing (Scotland) Bill, I lodged an amendment that would have allowed 
local authorities to retain the control that they once had over housing for asylum 
seekers. If the Parliament had supported that amendment, we would have avoided 
the planning and other problems with which people in west Edinburgh have had to 
deal. At the time, I was accused of approaching the issue of housing for asylum 
seekers as a constitutional matter. This debate shows that my amendment was a 
practical measure that the Parliament could and should have supported. Had it 
done so, we would not be debating a proposal that would compromise the economic 
development of Edinburgh airport and prevent us from providing for the needs of 
asylum seekers and&#151;most important&#151;their children, in this place of which 
we want to be proud.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:34</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Donald 
Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>My interest in Edinburgh airport is in the 
first place historical. Like Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, I used to be the MP 
for Edinburgh West. In my new role as MSP for Central Scotland, I also have a 
vested interest in the airport. The success of Edinburgh airport in handling both 
freight and passengers is very important to many people in Central Scotland whom 
I seek to represent. For my constituents, Edinburgh airport is more accessible 
than Glasgow airport.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
the early 1970s, I was one of the great enthusiasts for a central Scotland airport. 
It is interesting that that concept is in the public domain again. At that time, 
it was a far better idea than was developing Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. However, 
that is one of the many arguments that I have lost. Although the concept of a 
central Scotland airport is still worth considering, I would be concerned if it 
were used as an excuse for not having proper developments at Glasgow and Edinburgh 
airports. The completion of any totally new airport must be 20 or 30 years in 
the future, if it happens at all. We need Edinburgh airport. It is important not 
only for Edinburgh but for a large swathe of Scotland. I support fully the necessity 
of developing it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we 
are to have a large number of asylum seekers together, away from other people 
and on the fringes of the city, we might as well put them in jail. With local

those two reasons, I urge the Home Office first to get a grip and stop the blight

at Turnhouse but instead to co-operate with local authorities to deal better with 
asylum seekers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:36</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning (Lewis Macdonald): 
</strong>I start by commending Lord James Douglas-Hamilton for securing tonight's debate, 
which offers us an opportunity to discuss the future of an area and an industry 
that are important to Scotland's future economic prosperity.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
23 July, we, together with the UK Department for Transport, published the consultation 
document on the future development of air transport in Scotland. That is part 
of the process of setting out our air transport policy for the next 30 years. 
When we discuss aviation in Scotland in the next 30 years, we will be addressing 
one of the key infrastructure issues for the future prospects for economic development. 
Therefore, I welcome this opportunity to discuss the commercial opportunities 
for Edinburgh in the air freight sector.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Along 
with the significant passenger growth that is predicted in the consultation document, 
there are predictions of dynamic growth in freight. That promises an exciting 
future for Edinburgh airport and our other major airports throughout Scotland. 
Edinburgh is already a dominant airmail centre and has great advantages for express 
parcels and airmail now and in the future. Those come from its position close 
to many destinations in the central belt, its strategic road links and its proximity 
to freight users. The consultation document predicts significant growth in freight 
at Edinburgh airport over the next 30 years. Of course, rail links to the airport 
will only add to that potential.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
possibilities are huge and the capacity of the air freight sector to deliver is 
vital to the development of many important industries, many of which, as Bristow 
Muldoon said, are of low volume and high value, for which air freight is particularly 
suitable.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As with the growth 
in passenger travel, there are many considerations to take into account, not least 
environmental factors. It is right that those be taken into account at the same 
time as we study </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14336">14336</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the benefits to the economy. It is 
also right that major developments be viewed as part of the broader picture and 
considered in the context of the planning process.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
must look ahead and ensure that we safeguard our options for the future. That 
is why the Lothian structure plan acknowledges the important role of Edinburgh 
airport in the wider economy and gives strategic planning policy support for its 
future growth.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BAA Lynton 
bought the former RAF Turnhouse site from the Ministry of Defence more than two 
years ago. It has planning policy support for the kind of development that Lord 
James has described and it has specific permission in place at the outline stage 
for redevelopment for airport-related business activity.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
would not be appropriate for me to comment on the merits of a specific future 
development proposal at Turnhouse. As members will be aware, decisions on such 
matters could arrive on the desk of Scottish ministers, so, as a minister, I can 
say nothing that might prejudge any such decision. However, I can advise members 
that the Executive has been considering the long-term strategic future of the 
area through the preparation of a national planning policy statement on west Edinburgh.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">West 
Edinburgh, which is centred around the airport, is of huge importance to Scotland's 
economy. It is also regarded as being of national significance in transport and 
environmental terms. For that reason, on 23 August 2002, the Scottish Executive, 
the City of Edinburgh Council and the local enterprise company jointly issued 
a draft planning framework for public consultation. I know that Margaret Smith 
and others have been closely involved in that consultation process already.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
our view, providing that congestion problems can be overcome and issues of accessibility 
and environmental quality addressed, west Edinburgh creates a unique opportunity 
in Scotland for an internationally significant business location. The planning 
framework is intended to safeguard long-term opportunities for economic development 
and sustainable transport and to provide a sound basis for guiding investment 
and planning decisions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 
a planning perspective, the existence of a rapidly growing airport is a major 
factor. BAA, as the owner of the airport, has been involved in a stakeholder advisory 
group, which was set up to inform the work on the planning framework. We are well 
aware of BAA's aspirations and concerns and look forward to receiving feedback 
on the draft planning framework, as part of the wider consultation process.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is important that members are clear about the position of the Turnhouse site in 
planning terms. </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14337">14337</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plans for the redevelopment of the 
site for air cargo and related purposes received outline clearance in June 2000. 
An application for detailed planning permission has not yet been made, but that 
is a matter for BAA, and there is no constraint that would prevent the company 
from submitting such an application if it so wished. Outline planning permission 
is one of the considerations that face present and potential owners of the site.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
establishment and management of accommodation centres for asylum seekers are reserved 
matters, but social justice ministers in particular have been in regular dialogue 
with the Home Office and the Scotland Office on a range of asylum issues. We are 
clear about the importance of enabling asylum seekers in Scotland to feel welcome. 
Over recent months, my colleagues have discussed the issue with Home Office ministers 
and they will continue to do so. The discussions include our role as formal consultees 
on any new development of an accommodation centre in Scotland, for which the Home 
Office would be the developer. Although Government departments have Crown exemption 
from the requirement to submit formal planning applications, non-statutory notice 
of proposed development procedures are followed in such cases.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any 
proposal for the Turnhouse site would be a matter for the City of Edinburgh Council 
in the first instance. If the council objected to the proposal, the Home Office 
could then refer it to the Scottish ministers for a final decision. As I have 
said, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on proposals for development, 
as a planning application might come before Scottish ministers. It is important 
that members note that such use of the Turnhouse site would require not only that 
the Home Office decide to pursue that course of action&#151;and it has not made 
such a decision so far&#151;but that the Home Office purchase a highly valuable 
site that has existing planning permission for a different use. The Home Office 
would be required to follow the planning procedures that I have described. That 
is a matter for the Home Office to consider, but it is fully aware of the transport 
and economic significance of the site, which we will continue to discuss with 
it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: 
</strong>Is the minister saying that, in the event of the Home Office proceeding with 
a compulsory purchase order to which the council objected, the final decision 
would be in the hands of the Scottish ministers?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis 
Macdonald: </strong>Responsibility for policy on accommodation centres lies with the 
Home Office. Responsibility for planning permission&#151;whether in relation to 
a detailed planning application for the development of the site as intended by 
its present owners or for any other use by the Home Office or </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14338">14338</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

reassure all members that we are well aware of the significance of west Edinburgh 
and of the air freight industry. We are also well aware of the outline plans that 
exist for the use of the Turnhouse site. We will continue to address those important 
issues, and I am glad that we have had an opportunity to do so today.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The
