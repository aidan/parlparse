<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">be reviewed once
the conclusions of the MacLean and Millan committees are known. It is regrettable
that we did not have their detailed input but, unlike our own, their deliberations
cannot be rushed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some areas of the bill are perplexing,
but the principal concern is one of public safety. It is with relief that
we have heard the justice minister's assurances that public safety concerns
were at the forefront of his consideration. With that in mind, we served
notice that we were broadly in support of the legislation and reserved
the right to move amendments when we had had more time to consider the
matter.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There have been amendments from all sides
of the chamber. Many of the amendments were probing and sought to clarify
what was in the minds of the minister and his team of civil servants when
they were framing the bill. If ever there was a time when the phrase, "You
can't please all of the people all of the time" was appropriate, this was
it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There were outbursts of unanimity, agreement
and, although I hate to use the "c" word, consensus, notably among David
McLetchie, Gordon Jackson and Kenny MacAskill. I particularly welcomed
Richard Simpson's contribution. The distinctions that he drew were illuminating
and helpful.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Conservatives offer cautious support
to the bill. As we have indicated, we support the enactment of the emergency
legislation. We reiterate our concerns, however, about the rush that has
accompanied the bill, and hope that it will not have been prejudicial to
its content.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17:38</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>I
want to place on record the fact that</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"it is a matter of great regret to us that
a complex and difficult area is being dealt with by emergency legislation,
in a timescale which has made it impossible for us to consider the terms
of the Bill with the care that it requires."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those are Bruce Millan's words, not mine,
but I agree with them entirely. I am only sorry that the Scottish Executive
has not shown more respect for Bruce Millan, who is chairing the important
committee that is reviewing the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I take some consolation, however, from
the minister's having reiterated his commitment to ensuring that this legislation
will be reviewed and that Parliament will have the opportunity to review
the legislation in the light of the findings of the MacLean and Millan
committees. I look forward to being able to give those important reports
the consideration that they deserve.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
