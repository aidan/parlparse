<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_3"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First
Minister (Donald Dewar):</strong> With my light properly off, I would like to
make a statement on future legislation by the Westminster Parliament about
matters that are within the legislative competence of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Following devolution, the Westminster Parliament
will retain its competence to legislate about all matters. That will include
matters that are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament.
In a devolved system, it could not be otherwise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, the United Kingdom Government
has made it clear that it expects a convention to be established whereby
Westminster would not usually legislate on devolved matters in Scotland
without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. Lord Sewel made that clear
on 21 July last year during consideration of the Scotland Bill by the House
of Lords. In a memorandum of evidence to the House of Commons Procedure
Committee last November, the President of the Council indicated that the
Government expected the convention to be adopted for all public bills.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In addition, the Scottish Executive expects
that the UK Government will oppose any private member's bill that seeks
to alter the law on devolved subjects unless it is clear that the proposal
has the support of the relevant devolved body. That is also the position
of the UK Government. In its report on the procedural consequences of devolution,
published on 24 May, the Procedure Committee stated that it supported the
principles behind Mrs Beckett's statement and agreed that the House should
not legislate without the consent of the devolved legislature concerned.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Members may find it helpful if I explain
how we envisage that the process of seeking consent will work in practice.
Where the Scottish Executive and the United Kingdom Government agree that
a policy in a devolved area should be given effect by an act of the Westminster
Parliament, it would be for the Scottish ministers to put the proposal
to the Scottish Parliament, and for the UK Government to manage its business
at Westminster in a way that is consistent with the convention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The usual rule will be that legislation
about devolved subjects in Scotland will be enacted by the Scottish Parliament.
From time to time, however, it may be appropriate for a Westminster act
to include provisions about such matters. That might be the case, for example,
where the two Administrations agree that there should be one regime of
regulation with application on a UK-wide or GB-wide basis.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An example of when
we expect to introduce such a measure is that of the proposed bill to establish
a food standards agency to operate on a UK-wide basis. Earlier this year,
the UK Government published a draft bill that made it clear that the Scottish
Parliament's consent would be sought for that proposal. I do not want to
be taken on to the specifics of that case today, but let me make it clear
that the Parliament will have the opportunity to debate fully that and
other relevant issues at the appropriate time. Indeed, I expect that the
issue will be debated before the summer break.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A small number of additional measures may
also be introduced at Westminster during this session, dealing essentially
with reserved areas but with some impact in devolved areas. The Sexual
Offences (Amendment) Bill is a UK measure designed to equalise the age
of consent for homosexuals and heterosexuals, and to introduce a new offence
of abuse of trust. It was introduced to the Westminster Parliament in December
last year and defeated in the House of Lords in April this year. The UK
Government is likely to reintroduce the bill, making use of the Parliament
Acts to ensure its passage. That means that the bill that is reintroduced
would have to be identical to the one that was defeated. Therefore, even
if it were thought desirable, it will not be possible to remove Scotland
from the bill's scope if the Parliament Acts are invoked.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Until the UK Government and Parliament
have concluded the existing legislative process, it is logical to regard
it as unfinished Westminster business. However, these are devolved matters
of some sensitivity. It is essential that this Parliament should have the
opportunity to debate the Scottish provisions of the bill. We shall therefore
provide for a debate in Executive time. I and my colleagues in the Executive
will argue in that debate that the powers under the Parliament Acts should
be used if that is thought appropriate by the United Kingdom Government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have reached that conclusion in the
knowledge that this Parliament will have the power, if it so wishes, to
amend or repeal any Scottish provision enacted by the passage of the Sexual
Offences (Amendment) Bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As members are aware, there are a number
of bills currently before the United Kingdom Parliament which make provision
about matters that are to be within the legislative competence of the Scottish
Parliament. The proceedings of some of these bills will still be in train
on 1 July. A paper describing the bills that are expected to be enacted
in this way is available to members from the document supply centre. When
I finish, that document will also be available at the back of the chamber,
as will a copy of my statement.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The bills include,
for example, the Health Bill, the Water Industry Bill and the Pollution
Prevention and Control Bill. The Health Bill will enable the completion
of the reforms set out in the white paper "Designed to Care". In particular,
it provides for the abolition of general practice fundholding, for changes
in the financial arrangements for national health service trusts and for
the imposition of a duty of quality on the NHS in Scotland. In addition,
it includes measures to tackle fraud in the NHS and to require all primary
care practitioners to have indemnity cover.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Water Industry Bill will establish
the water industry commissioner for Scotland and wind up the present Customers
Council. The Pollution Prevention and Control Bill makes provision to ensure
that the EC Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control is
implemented on time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are also several bills with limited,
specific provision about matters that will be within the competence of
this Parliament. For example, the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill is largely
concerned with reserved matters, but includes provisions in the area of
family law to allow the sharing of pensions between divorced couples.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is the view of the Scottish Executive
that it is right for the remaining stages of these bills to be completed
at Westminster. They are, in the view of the Executive, necessary bills.
Not to let them proceed at Westminster would mean halting consideration
of them now, only to start again after the Scottish Parliament takes up
its full powers on 1 July. In practice, that would mean no progress until
the autumn at the earliest.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I stress that Scottish ministers are being
consulted fully by the UK Government about the progress and handling of
this legislation, and it will be for the Scottish ministers to exercise
any ministerial powers and duties within devolved competence that are conferred
by the bills. In doing so, they will, of course, be accountable to this
Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Importantly in this context, I remind members
that the Scottish Parliament will be able to amend or repeal legislation
made at Westminster in so far as its provisions fall within this Parliament's
competence. That is the case for existing legislation, for this session's
bills at Westminster that affect Scotland and for future acts of the UK
Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alasdair Morgan (Galloway and Upper
Nithsdale) (SNP): </strong>I thank the First Minister for providing copies of
his statement in advance. That was very helpful. I think that we can agree
that some of the current bills, particularly those in the House of Lords,
are non-controversial and nearing the end of their process. It is sensible
to let them&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">proceed, but we
must lay down a caveat for the future. Allowing those bills to be completed
at Westminster is not and cannot be a precedent. After the transition period
is over, that must not happen again.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That brings us to future bills. The SNP
view is that the United Kingdom Government should not legislate on devolved
matters; they are devolved precisely because it is our job to legislate
on them. The First Minister referred to the possibility of agreement between
the two Parliaments. Does he accept, however, that an agreement in principle
is not the same as the process of enacting a bill? We all know, particularly
those of us who have been in Westminster, that vast changes-usually as
a result of Government amendments-can be made to a bill before it becomes
an act. Agreement in principle is not a satisfactory substitute for our
scrutinising the detail of the legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is not good enough for the First Minister
to say that we can repeal legislation later; he knows as well as we do
that there is a great inertia factor in repealing existing statutes. It
is fundamental that the Government should say now that it is not going
to use its powers under section 28 of the Scotland Act 1998 to interfere
with this Parliament's prerogatives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to mention some of the other bills
that are going through Westminster, particularly those that deal largely
with reserved matters but that also touch on devolved matters. The First
Minister mentioned the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, but I would like
to refer to the Immigration and Asylum Bill. It has yet to receive its
third reading in the House of Commons and to go through all its stages
in the House of Lords, so it will probably not be on the statute book before
the House of Commons recess at the end of July.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We all agree that immigration is a reserved
matter, even if we do not agree with the content of the bill. It amends
some Scottish legislation in devolved areas, particularly the Social Work
(Scotland) Act 1968, which is the founding act of Scotland's social work
system. Section 12 of that act puts a duty on local authorities to assist
people in need, either in cash or in kind. The Immigration and Asylum Bill
will amend it by inserting a provision that says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;"A person subject to immigration
control is not to receive assistance because he is destitute".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that no member of this Parliament
came here to deny assistance to any category of person on the ground that
that person was destitute. Labour members spent much time yesterday saying
that they wanted to discuss what was happening out in the community rather
than what was happening in this chamber. Here is something that we can
decide for ourselves. I ask&nbsp;</font></td>

to tell his colleague Mr Straw that we in Scotland are quite capable of
deciding for ourselves our own social work rules. We were not elected here
to follow some neo-Conservative agenda to deny assistance to those who
are destitute.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I am grateful
for the first few sentences of Alasdair Morgan's remarks. It is sensible
that we should deal with the transitional provisions pragmatically. That
is what I am recommending to the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Morgan refers to the Immigration and
Asylum Bill, which is before the United Kingdom Parliament. It deals almost
entirely with reserved matters, and as such will continue its passage through
the House of Commons and presumably through the House of Lords. What its
fate will be is a matter for those two chambers and the parliamentary process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am setting out the system that will operate
in the future; what we do now is not necessarily a precedent. United Kingdom
legislation that deals with both a devolved and a reserved area of responsibility
will go through the Westminster system only if this chamber agrees to it.
That is an important safeguard. On occasion, there may be disagreements
in this Parliament about whether it is right to give such agreement, but
that is entirely a matter for this chamber. If it does not consent, business
at Westminster will have to be adapted to take account of that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Morgan seems to be asking me to say
that, as a matter of principle, we will on no occasion allow a Westminster
bill to go through, even though it is evident to all of us that it is sensible
that its provisions should apply on either a GB-wide or a UK-wide basis.
That would build inflexibility into our system. It would be counter-productive,
and I would not agree with it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Morgan refers to an inertia factor that
would prevent us from altering a provision that had come through the Westminster
machinery even though there may be a wish to use a power in a devolved
area. That is a criticism of this Parliament. The powers exist, if the
Parliament wants to use them, and it is for those who are arguing for change
to overcome any inertia. I hope that the SNP will not take this as too
much of a compliment, but the word inertia is not one that I would apply
to it. I do not know whether SNP members will win the argument, but they
are certainly entitled to put their point of view.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I
am happy to accept the principle that the Scottish Parliament should give
its consent on future bills that would apply on a UK-wide basis. Unlike

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">some acts-even
those that cover devolved areas-should be enacted uniformly across the
UK.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The establishment of the food standards
agency is a clear case in point. As we stated in our manifesto, there should
be a common standard across the whole of the UK to ensure that our producers,
processors, retailers and restaurateurs are not subject to more stringent
regulations than those that apply elsewhere in the UK. The First Minister
said that he did not wish to go into specifics, but one of the specifics
that relates to the food standards agency will be the method by which it
is funded. I give notice that we are wholly opposed to the proposal that
the agency should be funded by a flat-rate levy and we will oppose that
when it comes before the Scottish Parliament for deliberation. I hope that
other parties will support us in our opposition to that corner shop tax,
which would mean that small local shops would pay the same amount as large
supermarkets to fund the agency. The First Minister should invite the Westminster
Government to revisit the issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That issue will put the coalition parties
in some difficulty again, because the Liberal Democrats were unusually
adamant when they said in their manifesto:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We will abolish the flat rate levy on
Scottish food premises to fund the Agency."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of their candidates, Mr Mackie, was
so disappointed with that proposal that he suggested the introduction of
VAT on food as an alternative funding mechanism.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the issue of the food standards agency
and its funding, will the coalition parties be free to differ or will the
principle of collective responsibility apply to the coalition Government?
Alternatively, as with tuition fees, will we have yet another committee
of inquiry to try to get some people off the hook?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am unhappy with the arrangements that
have been announced by the First Minister to deal with current bills in
progress at Westminster. I believe that the principle that the Scottish
Parliament should give its consent should apply to those current bills
that cover devolved areas. During the election campaign, we indicated that
we were unhappy that the Health Bill-which covers one of the principal
devolved functions of this Parliament and involves the expenditure of one
third of the total Scottish Office block-was to be discussed and determined
at Westminster.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Given that this Parliament operates on
a different time scale from the one at Westminster and will resume its
deliberations in September, will the First Minister make time available
under Executive business for the Scottish Parliament to express a view
on the Health Bill and the other bills in progress? I think that it would
be arrogant&nbsp;</font></td>

he rather spoiled it with his subsequent remarks.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am grateful, too, for David McLetchie's
remarks about the handling of the food standards agency. I understand that
there is considerable controversy about the funding levy and its mechanics.
I said that I did not want to be drawn into specifics and I will hold to
that, because I hope that, before we rise, there will be an opportunity
to discuss the levy during a debate on the food standards bill. The matter
of the levy may well be revisited, but although it is easy to say that
there ought to be a graduated levy, practical problems would arise over
its definition. I will be interested to hear the Conservative party's solution
to those problems when the time comes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I proposed that the current bills to which
I referred, particularly the Health Bill, should be allowed to continue
their progress as a matter of convenience; otherwise, we will have to halt
everything and start again. The bill can be inspected when it reaches the
statute book; if something is thought to be so controversial that it is
worth changing, this Parliament can take steps. I do not believe that that
will be the view of this Parliament, but that is a matter for debate. I
do not intend to have a debate on the issue, but if David McLetchie believes
that there should be one, he should argue his case with the Parliamentary
Bureau.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

legislation to impose tuition fees for higher education and to abolish
student grants was passed by the Westminster Parliament, but those subjects
are now to be considered by a committee of inquiry under the so-called
partnership agreement. Will the First Minister give an absolute assurance
that the Scottish Parliament will be free to legislate on those matters,
given that the majority of members were elected on a commitment to abolish
tuition fees and that many of us also want student grants to be restored,
particularly for students from low-income families?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
