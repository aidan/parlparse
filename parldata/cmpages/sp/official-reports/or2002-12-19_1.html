<P ALIGN="CENTER">[THE DEPUTY PRESIDING OFFICER<em> opened the meeting at 09:30</em>]</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Budget 
Process 2003-04: Stage 2</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer 
(Mr George Reid): </STRONG>Good morning. The first item of business is a debate 
on motion S1M-3708, in the name of Tom McCabe, on the Finance Committee's seventh 
report in 2002, entitled &quot;Stage 2 of the 2003/04 Budget Process&quot;.</P><P>09:30</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_3"></A>Mr 
Tom McCabe (Hamilton South) (Lab): </strong>It is a pleasure to present the report 
on the budget, which&#151;as members will know&#151;contains excellent news for 
public services and private interests alike. The main thread that runs through 
the Executive's draft budget is very substantial increases in real-terms spending.</P><P>The 
Finance Committee met from September through to November to complete its report. 
The Parliament's subject committees also met to consider the spending plans of 
the various Executive departments. I take this opportunity to thank our clerking 
team and our adviser, Professor Arthur Midwinter, for their professionalism and 
steadfast advice and support.</P><P>Over past years, the Finance Committee has 
sought the views of communities throughout Scotland. This year it held consultative 
sessions in Orkney at stage 1 and the Isle of Skye at stage 2. Four main concerns 
were expressed in the Isle of Skye: the impact of Skye bridge tolls; the mismatch 
between the housing market and a growing population; the inadequacy of local and 
wider area infrastructure; and concern over the impact of the forthcoming Homelessness 
etc (Scotland) Bill.</P><P>The tolls on the Skye Bridge are a matter of severe 
irritation. Even when the principal issue is laid aside, there seems to be considerable 
scope for improving the administration of the scheme. I hope that the Executive 
will take strong note of the concerns expressed by local people on the Isle of 
Skye.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16522">16522</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I will move on to the substantive matters surrounding the draft budget. First, 
it is fair to say that the process is being refined year on year and that the 
financial scrutiny review, which the Finance Committee is undertaking, will shed 
more light on possible improvements.</P><P>Next year the process will be slightly 
different, for obvious reasons. We have agreed that time constraints render the 
publication of the annual expenditure review meaningless. However, the draft budget 
report will be published in time for Parliament's return from the summer recess.</P><P>The 
results of the Scottish spending review were announced on 12 September 2002. For 
the first time, the document was published on a full resource-accounting basis, 
so direct comparisons with the annual expenditure review are not possible. The 
report shows a cash increase from £20.972 billion in 2002-03 to £25.857 billion 
in 2005-06. That is a 23 per cent increase over the period. In real terms, that 
is an increase of 4.6 per cent per annum, which is slightly more than the increase 
in the UK spending review. By any measure, the increases are substantial and, 
put to proper effect, they can make significant improvements in the quality of 
Scottish public services. I stress that the figures that I am quoting relate to 
departmental expenditure, not total managed expenditure.</P><P>The United Kingdom 
spending review has clearly had a major impact on the Scottish draft budget. In 
2003-04, we have a real-terms increase of 6.3 per cent on the 2002-03 budget. 
That provides around £1 billion per annum for service development. The report 
highlights the important point that that is the highest sustained increase in 
the Scottish budget since 1975. The achievements are considerable, and the Finance 
Committee welcomes the significant growth.</P><P>We should be clear that the committee 
has acknowledged the successful nature of the budget. Therefore, it is a matter 
of regret that the Executive has chosen to adopt a cumulative approach to the 
year-on-year increases. We quote in our report the example of the further education 
budget, which is to expand by £3 million in year 1, £37 million in year 2 and 
£38 million in year 3. A £78 million increase in further education spending is 
welcome and worthy of praise, but the figures have been rolled together and announced 
as £120 million, in effect counting the £3 million three times and the £37 million 
twice. That practice misleads and it obstructs proper scrutiny. We strongly recommend 
that it should stop now.</P><P>On non-domestic rates, the Executive has given 
a clear and welcome commitment to freeze the rate poundage for 2003-04 and to 
cap it in line with inflation for the next two years. Despite that, we heard evidence 
from the Confederation of </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16523">16523</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>British Industry Scotland that Scottish competitiveness could be damaged by 
a higher rate poundage in Scotland than in the rest of the United Kingdom. The 
fact that non-domestic rate income is due to increase by 22 per cent&#151;£340 
million&#151;over the next two years has no doubt heightened those fears.</P><P>During 
our evidence session in Skye, the Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services 
explained some of the technical reasons for the increased income, some of which 
are signs of success and growth and are not reasons for concern. However, an unwelcome 
suspicion remains that we are in some way being disadvantaged in comparison with 
the rest of the United Kingdom. In order to assuage those concerns, we have recommended 
that&#151;</P><P><strong>Mr John Swinney (North Tayside) (SNP): </strong>Will 
Mr McCabe develop that point a little further? I do not follow the logic of the 
answer that the Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services gave in the Isle 
of Skye. I am sure that Mr McCabe is aware that Scottish economic growth has been 
lower than economic growth in the rest of the United Kingdom. If that trend is 
the case, how on earth can there not be further competitive disadvantage in delivering 
higher business rates in Scotland? I do not understand the relationship.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_5"></A>Mr 
McCabe: </strong>I said that some of the increased income was for good reasons. 
The explanation that the Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services gave 
in Skye is that no single, overall comparison can be made of the figures. Clearly 
there have been developments in Scotland that generate additional non-domestic 
rate income, which provides additional money to the Executive. There are a variety 
of circumstances throughout Scotland. That is what the deputy minister attempted 
to explain when he gave evidence to us in Skye.</P><P>As I said, to assuage the 
concerns, we have recommended that the Executive should provide a simple assurance 
that non-domestic rate bills will increase on average by no more than the rate 
of inflation over the period.</P><P>The committee also tried to establish how 
the budget would impact on cross-cutting priorities. Although the inclusion of 
discrete sections in the draft budget on &quot;Closing the Opportunity Gap&quot; 
and &quot;Sustainable Development&quot; is welcome, we are convinced that each 
priority should be separately reported on if proper scrutiny is to take place. 
It is the committee's view that clarity of information in the budget document 
has improved year on year. However, we found that too many uncosted and unquantified 
entries remain. We hope for improvements in future years.</P><P>We also found 
that a poor relationship remains </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16524">16524</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>between spending, outputs and outcomes. That must improve. If it is to do so, 
we believe that the provision of unambiguous baseline performance data is essential 
for proper monitoring and scrutiny.</P><P>The Parliament's subject committees 
have a vital role to play in the scrutiny of the Scottish budget. They continue 
to express concerns about the difficulty that they face in examining block allocations 
such as those for health and local government. Given the size and importance of 
both blocks, those concerns are serious.</P><P>Other committees raised a variety 
of issues. We have asked the Executive to provide a corporate response to the 
matters raised by each committee.</P><P>The Equal Opportunities Committee continues 
to seek an agreed definition of equality proofing. We noted the continued absence 
of an agreed definition and welcomed the on-going work with the Executive to resolve 
the issue. In an attempt to ensure that we continue to make progress, we have 
recommended that a cross-cutting report on budget provisions to promote equal 
opportunity should accompany the budget document next year.</P><P>The Finance 
Committee received two proposals for spending amendments, the first of which came 
jointly from the two justice committees. In short, they were concerned that the 
justice portfolio, which is an expressed priority for the Executive, is receiving 
a reducing share of the budget. We have already noted that there is a considerable 
need for better definition in cross-cutting issues and the identification of priorities, 
but the Finance Committee does not believe that it can recommend the proposed 
change. However, we have noted the justice committees' concerns and have drawn 
the matter to the Executive's attention.</P><P>The second proposed amendment came 
from Nicola Sturgeon MSP. She proposed the transfer of £89 million from the capital 
budget to the health budget over a three-year period, which would be used to compensate 
people who have been infected with hepatitis C through receiving contaminated 
blood. The committee found that the case for the proposal was well presented and 
that funding sources had been identified. While there was a broad measure of sympathy 
for the proposal, we were aware when we considered the issue that the report of 
the expert group on financial and other assistance for NHS injury was in interim 
form and that the Health and Community Care Committee still had to consider the 
report formally.</P><P>Notwithstanding those points, we do not recommend the proposed 
change for three principal reasons. First, we have no information on how the proposal 
would affect individuals who are </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16525">16525</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>in receipt of benefits as a result of clawback. It would be unfortunate, to 
say the least, if payments resulted in the loss of long-term benefits. Secondly, 
we do not know the full implications for other outstanding concerns that might 
exist in the health service. Thirdly, we are concerned that the proposal might 
lead to a no-fault compensation approach being sought, not only in health matters, 
but across a number of other portfolio areas. Given that, the decision is principally 
one for the Executive as a whole and, as such, requires full consideration of 
the effect on the Scottish budget.</P><P><strong>Alasdair Morgan (Galloway and 
Upper Nithsdale) (SNP): </strong>To clarify the Finance Committee's viewpoint, 
although Mr McCabe said correctly that the committee did not recommend the change, 
equally we did not recommend against the change. In fact, we were neutral on the 
matter.</P><P><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>I said that there was a broad measure 
of sympathy for the proposal in the Finance Committee. We were greatly influenced 
by the fact that the Health and Community Care Committee still had to consider 
fully the interim report. Mr Morgan is broadly correct to say that the Finance 
Committee decided as far as possible to stay neutral on the issue until other 
parliamentary committees had completed their work and other information had come 
to hand.</P><P>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body submitted provisional 
funding figures in March of this year. The final figures show considerable increases, 
mainly as a result of the estimated costs of migration to the new complex. The 
future Finance Committee will have to bear that in mind when assessing future 
funding requirements. The corporate body requested funding of £161.9 million for 
next year, which is an increase of £12.4 million on the provisional requirement 
that was submitted earlier in the year. It was explained to us that much of the 
increase is a result of the operational requirement to run two complexes at the 
same time. How much of that money will be required next year remains to be seen, 
for reasons to which I will come in a moment.</P><P>I preface my remarks on the 
Holyrood project with a few words about the task that faces the Holyrood progress 
group and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. The Finance Committee recognises 
fully that they face an unenviable task and were presented with circumstances 
that were not of their making. In particular, they had no say over the type of 
construction contract that was used for the project. I suspect that if a genie 
were ever to pop from a bottle and ask the construction industry to make a wish, 
it would choose that form of contract.</P><P>In that context, I hope that the 
SPCB will understand if we feel the need to make robust </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16526">16526</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>comments. The Holyrood project is of major importance to Scotland and to the 
standing of the Parliament, but it is fair to say that it is a matter of continuing 
concern that consistency and clarity are not yet attached to the information on 
costs and completion dates. Shortly after we received the most recent quarterly 
report from the SPCB, the situation with regard to the costs and estimated completion 
dates changed considerably for the worse. The committee took more evidence on 
the project this week and expressed its concerns that, at this advanced stage, 
uncertainty still seems to outweigh certainty.</P><P>All members will be aware 
of the effect on the public's perception of the Parliament of the lack of clarity 
and the consistently moving targets on cost and completion. The good work that 
is done day in, day out for the people of Scotland is overshadowed by the constant 
drip of unreliable information and the lack of confidence in the latest estimates.</P><P><strong>Fergus 
Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP): </strong>I do not disagree with 
much of what Mr McCabe says, but will he enlighten us as to whether he expressed 
similar concerns in his former role as Minister for Parliament?</P><P><strong>Mr 
McCabe: </strong>Mr Ewing knows that, as Minister for Parliament, I had no direct 
responsibility for the construction of the Holyrood complex. The Executive has 
made it clear regularly that the project is a parliamentary one. As Mr Ewing has 
taken a considerable interest in the project, he should know that.</P><P>We made 
it clear at the recent Finance Committee meeting that, when we receive the next 
quarterly report from the SPCB, we expect consistent and sustainable information 
on cost and time scales. We also considered the funding request for the opening 
ceremony, which was in the region of £400,000. We take the firm view that £400,000 
for an opening ceremony is wholly unjustified and we have recommended that the 
amount should be reduced significantly.</P><P>I commend to the Parliament the 
report on the 2003-04 budget process.</P><P>I move,</P><P>That the Parliament 
notes the 7th Report 2002 of the Finance Committee, <em>Stage 2 of the 2003/04 
Budget Process</em> (SP Paper 709).</P><P>09:46</P><P><strong>Nicola Sturgeon 
(Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>I believe that this is the first occasion on which an 
individual member of the Scottish Parliament has proposed a change to the Executive's 
budget. I do so for a good reason: I believe that Parliament has a moral obligation 
to deliver justice to people who </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16527">16527</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>contracted hepatitis C from the national health service and to do so quickly 
and decisively before many more of them fall seriously ill or die.</P><P>The Health 
and Community Care Committee shares that view, as does the independent group of 
experts whom the Minister for Health and Community Care asked to examine the issue. 
I pay tribute to the expert group, which considered financial support for hepatitis 
C sufferers and which is chaired by Lord Ross. I also praise the Health and Community 
Care Committee for its dogged pursuit of the issue in the past three years. The 
unanimity in the committee on the issue is testament to the strength of the hepatitis 
C sufferers' case. Only last week, the committee reiterated its commitment to 
the principle of justice for hepatitis C sufferers. I am proud of the committee's 
stance.</P><P>My amendment offers a way in which to turn the Health and Community 
Care Committee's hard work into practical support for those who need and deserve 
it.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_7"></A>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) 
(Con): </strong>Given that there is unanimity in the Health and Community Care 
Committee and given that we were working on what is a difficult inquiry before 
Nicola Sturgeon joined the committee, why did not she discuss her approach to 
the Finance Committee with the other members of the Health and Community Care 
Committee? Why has she broken ranks in a politically opportunistic way while we 
are considering the serious point of ex gratia payments for people with hepatitis 
C?</P><P><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>It is the responsibility of a responsible 
Opposition to propose constructive solutions to difficult issues, which is what 
I am doing today. My amendment is a way of turning the principle that the Health 
and Community Care Committee supports into practical action. I hope that, in the 
interests of hepatitis C sufferers, all members will consider my proposal on its 
merits and will avoid allowing the debate to be about politics.</P><P>It is useful 
to outline the recent history of the issue. On 6 November, the expert group published 
its report, which recommended that the Scottish Executive should establish and 
fund a discretionary trust to make ex gratia payments to all people who received 
blood or blood products from the NHS in Scotland and subsequently found that they 
had the hepatitis C virus. The group recommended that all sufferers should receive 
an initial lump sum of £10,000 to cover anxiety, stress and social disadvantage; 
that those who develop chronic hepatitis C should receive an additional £40,000; 
and that those who suffer a serious deterioration in their physical condition 
because of hepatitis C&#151;for example, liver cancer or cirrhosis&#151;should 
receive additional support that is </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16528">16528</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>calculated on the same basis as common-law damages.</P><P>The expert group 
has costed its recommendation at between £62 million and £89 million. We are here 
today because the Minister for Health and Community Care has said that he will 
not implement the expert group's recommendation in full. He has given three reasons 
for that, which I shall deal with briefly in turn.</P><P>First, the minister does 
not believe that everyone who has been infected with hepatitis C should receive 
a payment. Instead, he wants to target help at those who have suffered serious, 
long-term physical harm. There is disagreement on that point between the minister, 
on the one side, and the committee and the expert group, on the other side. The 
committee and the expert group have recommended payments for all those who have 
been infected because even those who are not suffering serious physical symptoms&#151;at 
least, not yet&#151;might be affected psychologically and practically. The very 
fact that someone has hepatitis C is devastating to them. The knowledge that there 
is a risk&#151;however small&#151;of sexual transmission affects their relationships. 
Hepatitis C also limits sufferers' ability to work and to hold down employment, 
and it makes getting a mortgage or life assurance virtually impossible. Those 
are the basic facts of life for everyone who suffers from hepatitis C, not just 
for those whose physical health has seriously deteriorated.</P><P>It is perfectly 
reasonable to expect that people who go on to develop liver cancer or cirrhosis 
should receive larger sums of money than those who do not, and the expert group's 
recommendation reflects that. However, as a fundamental principle, everyone who 
has been infected should receive a payment to cover the anxiety and stress that 
is inevitably suffered when they are told not just that they have hepatitis C, 
but that they have contracted it through routine medical treatment. To draw an 
arbitrary distinction between deserving and undeserving sufferers simply compounds 
the wrong that people have suffered. That is clearly the view of the expert group, 
and it was the minister who asked the group to consider the issue. He set the 
group up, picked its members and drew up its remit. Now that the group has come 
back with a recommendation that the Executive should pay up for everyone, the 
minister should accept that he has lost the argument.</P><P>The minister's second 
reason for not implementing the recommendation in full is his concern that making 
payments to sufferers may simply result in benefits being withdrawn under Westminster 
social security legislation. Indeed, as Tom McCabe said, that concern was expressed 
by </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16529">16529</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the Finance Committee when it considered the proposal. Clawback is a real possibility 
whether the expert group's recommendation is implemented in full or in part, and 
no matter where in the budget the money comes from. We know that from the experience 
of providing free personal care for the elderly. In that instance, the United 
Kingdom Government clawed back £23 million as a result of the Scottish Parliament's 
decision to do right by Scotland's pensioners. It would not be acceptable for 
payments that we give to hepatitis C sufferers with one hand to be taken away 
by Westminster with the other. There should be absolutely no difficulty in disregarding 
payments that are made to hepatitis C sufferers for the purposes of social security. 
Payments to HIV sufferers through the Macfarlane Trust are disregarded for those 
purposes. As a Parliament, we should make it clear that we will not tolerate attempts 
by Westminster to undermine and frustrate actions that we choose to take in devolved 
areas.</P><P>The minister's third reason for not implementing the expert group's 
recommendation is financial. That brings me to the amendment that I have lodged 
for today's debate. The minister has said that he cannot afford to make £89 million 
available from the health budget to compensate hepatitis C sufferers. I understand 
all too well the competing pressures on the health budget. That is why I have 
put forward a constructive proposal. SNP members are often unfairly accused of 
making demands on budgets without saying where the money will come from. Today, 
we are saying exactly where the money to compensate hepatitis C sufferers should 
come from, and I hope that my colleagues will consider the proposal on its merits.</P><P>I 
propose that we transfer from the departmental expenditure limit capital budget 
to the health budget £30 million, £30 million and £29 million in each of the next 
three years respectively, making available a total of £89 million. That is the 
maximum amount that the expert group estimates would be required to fund the payments 
to hepatitis C sufferers. In his evidence to the Health and Community Care Committee 
last week, Lord Ross said:</P><P>&quot;we regard £89 million as the maximum figure 
and it would be allocated over a number of years.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, 
<em>Health and Community Care Committee</em>, 11 December 2002; c 3529.]</P><P>Why 
do I think that that proposal is right? First, it would ensure that the burden 
would not be borne solely by the health budget. Making payments to those who have 
been infected by hepatitis C through the NHS is an obligation on society. It is 
right that we should all share the cost of that. Secondly, the capital budget 
could easily bear a reduction of that scale. The budgets will still rise over 
the next three years, but by 2 per cent less </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16530">16530</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>per year than is currently planned. Moreover, the underspend in the capital 
budget last year was £111 million. If it wanted to, the Scottish Executive could 
replace the money that would be taken from the DEL capital budget with money from 
next year's underspend. I considered arguing that payments for hepatitis C sufferers 
should simply be taken from the underspend in next year's budget. However, as 
decisions on that will not be made until later next year, I decided that that 
was not the right option. I believe that hepatitis C sufferers demand certainty 
of justice now, which is what my proposal will deliver for them.</P><P>As I have 
said, the Finance Committee has examined my proposal, and I thank the committee 
sincerely for the serious consideration that it gave it. The thorough way in which 
the committee went about the task was reflected in Tom McCabe's remarks this morning. 
For two main reasons, the committee felt unable to give the proposal its backing, 
although, as Alasdair Morgan rightly pointed out, it decided to remain neutral. 
The committee's first concern was the fear of Treasury clawback of benefits&#151;an 
issue that I have already mentioned. The second concern was that, by agreeing 
to pay no-fault compensation to hepatitis C sufferers, we would in effect create 
a precedent for other groups who sustain injury through the NHS but who cannot 
prove negligence. On that point, I can do no better than to quote Lord Ross again. 
He said:</P><P>&quot;The Macfarlane Trust provision was introduced in 1988 and 
it did not lead to a flood of claims from other people ... We did not feel that 
a dangerous precedent would be set in this case any more than was the case with 
the Macfarlane Trust.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Health and Community 
Care Committee</em>, 11 December 2002; c 3530.]</P><P>Although I understand the 
Finance Committee's concerns, I do not share them.</P><P>The Finance Committee 
has said that the proposal is</P><P>&quot;well-grounded in terms of being properly 
costed&quot;.</P><P>The committee also took the view that</P><P>&quot;the DEL 
capital budget would bear a reduction of 2% over the three years of the budget 
cycle.&quot;</P><P>The Finance Committee's comments reflect the fact that the 
proposal is serious, and I hope that Parliament will do the decent thing and consider 
it genuinely on its merits.</P><P>There are those who will say&#151;and have said 
already&#151;that putting forward the proposal today somehow conflicts with the 
work of the Health and Community Care Committee. Let me be clear: it does not. 
In trying to turn principle into practice, the proposal complements the good work 
that the committee has done and is doing. It offers the Minister for Health and 
Community Care a solution to what I acknowledge is a very difficult issue. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16531">16531</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

to all people who can demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that they 
received blood, blood products or tissues from the NHS in Scotland and were subsequently 
found to be infected with the Hepatitis C virus.&quot;</P><P>09:58</P><P><strong>Mrs 
Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West) (LD): </strong>At the risk of confusing members, 
I begin by addressing the work of the Finance Committee wearing my hat as the 
convener of the Health and Community Care Committee. I commend the Finance Committee 
for all its hard work on the budget and I thank the committee for the helpful 
advice that it has given to the subject committees on what is a daunting prospect 
for most of us. I welcome Mr McCabe to his new, onerous position as the convener 
of the Finance Committee.</P><P>As the Finance Committee's report notes, the Health

between baseline and additional expenditure, which we believe hinders scrutiny 
of the budget. We are also concerned about block allocations to health boards 
and the inherent difficulties in trying to follow the public pound through the 
process. I am pleased that the Finance Committee has agreed to pursue those matters 
with ministers.</P><P>We remain concerned that it is impossible to get figures 
for the amount that the Executive is spending on key priorities such as cancer, 
coronary heart disease and mental health. That makes it more than a little difficult 
to detect real increases in expenditure and to audit the effectiveness of the 
expenditure. Nonetheless, we all welcome the 14.4 per cent real-terms increase 
in the budget for 2005-06. I also welcome the fact that health continues to be 
the top financial priority alongside local government spending, both of which 
areas are of great importance to the Health and Community Care Committee.</P><P>I 
will now speak as the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson about my amendment 
to the amendment. The issue of financial support for people who have contracted 
hepatitis C from blood and blood products is of moral importance for the Parliament. 
The Parliament will be aware that the Health and Community Care Committee has 
for some time been dealing with two petitions </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16532">16532</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>that relate to hepatitis C. The committee conducted a short-term inquiry, which 
culminated in the publication of a unanimous committee report in October 2001.</P><P>Our 
main recommendations were that the Executive should give financial and other assistance 
to all those affected, whether to a lesser or a greater extent, on an ex gratia 
basis. Members should not underestimate the impact that a diagnosis has on those 
affected. It causes psychological damage, affects personal relationships and has 
an impact on their working lives and their ability to care for their families. 
We suggested that a trust be set up for those who were most seriously affected 
physically and that payments be awarded on an individual basis. We also suggested 
the setting up of an expert group to examine not only the hepatitis C issue, but 
the wider issue of no-fault compensation.</P><P>Members will be aware that, although 
the Minister for Health and Community Care did not accept our recommendations 
about financial assistance, he agreed to set up an expert group under Lord Ross. 
That group has published its interim report, which I am pleased to say echoes 
the unanimous position that the Health and Community Care Committee adopted. After 
last week's meeting, at which we took evidence from Malcolm Chisholm, Lord Ross 
and Philip Dolan from the Haemophilia Society, the committee reiterated its initial 
position and its support for the expert group's interim findings.</P><P>We welcomed 
the fact that, although the minister rejected the principle that all sufferers 
should be given financial assistance, he moved from his earlier position by agreeing 
to pay assistance to those who have experienced &quot;serious, long-term harm&quot;. 
That is the first time that a UK minister has agreed to take such action.</P><P>I 
commend the work of my committee colleagues on the issue. Our work has been characterised 
by two real strengths of the Parliament's committee system&#151;a dogged determination 
to hold the Executive to account and a belief that, as in so many other areas 
of life, unity is strength. That concept means that unanimous, cross-party decisions 
that are taken in committee give a moral authority to an argument or a cause that 
endorsement by any one political party, however well meaning, can never give.</P><P>I 
know why Nicola Sturgeon made her proposal to the Finance Committee and I know 
why she has lodged her amendment to the motion. As it is the Christmas season&#151;the 
season of good will to all people&#151;I will not dwell on that. Mary Scanlon 
has covered the issue very well.</P><P>I share the Finance Committee's view that 
proposed changes to the Executive's budget</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16533">16533</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>&quot;may have a better chance of success where they originate from subject 
committees and have cross-party support&quot;.</P><P>It is unfortunate that Nicola 
Sturgeon did not suggest her proposal as a possible addition to our budget report 
at any time, even though the expert group's interim report was published before 
we finalised our budget report and even though we have a track record of suggesting 
alternative budget proposals.</P><P>Every member of the Health and Community Care 
Committee wants justice for those who have campaigned on the issue for so long. 
Therefore, I was pleased that the minister said that he was impatient for further 
progress on the issue and I look forward to his next appearance before the committee 
in January, when we expect to hear about details of progress towards the setting 
up of a fair scheme.</P><P><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Does Margaret Smith 
accept that my proposal represents a way&#151;albeit only one way&#151;of turning 
the principle that the Health and Community Care Committee has adhered to for 
three years into practical support for hepatitis C sufferers? For the remainder 
of her speech, I ask her to concentrate on the substance of the proposal in my 
amendment. Does she support it or not?</P><P><strong>Mrs Smith: </strong>Hold 
your horses.</P><P>Although there has been unanimous endorsement of the expert 
group's interim findings, I do not think that any member of the Health and Community 
Care Committee or of the Parliament underestimates the difficulties that the minister 
faces. The minister says that he cannot afford the £89 million that the expert 
group set as the maximum amount that would be needed to make £10,000 payments 
to all those who contracted hepatitis C and £40,000 payments to those who suffer 
chronic pain. That sum would include provision for additional payments to those 
who suffer serious, long-term effects, such as liver cancer, and for payments 
to families of deceased sufferers. It was the committee's unanimous view that 
all those groups should be given financial payments of one sort or another.</P><P>We 
believe that, although there will have to be an element of front loading, scope 
exists for the likely investment to be spread across a number of years. We suggest 
that funding could come from end-year flexibility or from elsewhere in the budget. 
I strongly urge the minister to go beyond the position that he outlined to the 
committee last week.</P><P>The minister has a problem with the principle of universal 
payments and the impact that the suggested payment will have on the wider issue 
of no-fault compensation. To some extent, the Finance Committee echoed that concern. 
We </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16534">16534</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>would echo the view that Lord Ross expressed last week. He said that the establishment 
of the Macfarlane Trust for those affected by HIV did not open the floodgates 
and that it was unlikely that payments in relation to the unique hepatitis C case 
would do so either. The expert group's final report, which will deal with no-fault 
compensation as well as hepatitis C, is expected before the end of the year. On 
the wider question, we should wait for the final report's publication. However, 
on hepatitis C, Lord Ross admitted under questioning last week that there would 
no substantial differences between the interim report and the final report.</P><P>The 
minister rightly highlighted the problems that are associated with identifying 
our powers to act within the devolved settlement. Most important is the need to 
ensure in negotiations with Westminster that any payments that are made to sufferers 
will not result in an automatic clawback of benefits. We must not allow that to 
happen. It is crucial that the will of the Parliament should not be frustrated 
in that way.</P><P>In the on-going discussions among officials, it is not only 
technical issues that must be overcome. A political problem must be addressed, 
because the Executive has agreed to make some form of ex gratia payments to some 
people who have been affected, whereas Westminster has recently reiterated its 
intention not to do so. I am concerned that Westminster might not consider it 
to be in its interests if a scheme were set up whereby social security legislation 
or regulations were to be implemented on a non-UK basis; it might not be in Westminster's 
best interests to allow the Executive and the Parliament to deliver justice if 
Westminster has no intention of delivering justice.</P><P>I endorse the Finance 
Committee's view that it would be wrong to agree to Nicola Sturgeon's proposal 
while the talks continue. The conclusion of the talks will go a long way towards 
shaping not only the mechanism of the payment scheme, but the amounts involved. 
However, we note that the Finance Committee remains neutral on the substantive 
issue. It is important to note that my amendment contains nothing that would close 
off the pursuit of a fair, principled settlement that is in line with the Health 
and Community Care Committee's judgments.</P><P>I urge the Executive to do all 
that it can to find a speedy and fair solution to the issue. I welcome the Minister 
for Health and Community Care's statement that he wants to make progress between 
now and the end of the financial year and that, if no progress is made by the 
turn of the year,</P><P>&quot;we will have to consider the different avenues that 
are open.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Health and Community Care

<P>not underestimate the challenge, but we are keen for the matter to be resolved 
successfully for all concerned in this parliamentary session.</P><P>I ask the 
Parliament to support the Finance Committee's report and my amendment, which keeps 
the door open on the detail of what funding might be required in the light of 
the on-going discussions, while guaranteeing that the minister will report progress 
to the committee in January. If the Executive fails to listen to the voices of 
the Health and Community Care Committee, the expert group and the 80 MSPs who 
have signed motions on the issue, the Health and Community Care Committee will 
pursue the matter by seeking support for a fair settlement from across the Parliament. 
I ask Mr McCabe to keep his genie in its bottle for the time being, although we 
might need it in the new year, when we will continue to pursue justice for people 
who have campaigned for too long.</P><P>I move, as an amendment to amendment S1M-3708.1, 
amendment S1M-3708.1.1, to leave out from &quot;but calls&quot; to end and insert:</P><P>&quot;and, 
in so doing, commends the Health and Community Care Committee for its work in 
addressing the position of those who have contracted hepatitis C from blood products; 
endorses the importance of finding ways to help and support these people; further 
notes that discussions are in progress between Scottish Executive health ministers 
and colleagues in Her Majesty's Government on the potential implications arising 
from the advice of the Expert Group on Financial and Other Support, and stresses 
the need for the Minister for Health and Community Care to return to the Health 
and Community Care Committee in January 2003 to report on progress.&quot;</P><P>10:08</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services (Peter Peacock): </strong>I begin 
by welcoming Tom McCabe to his new role. It is somewhat unnerving when a former 
gamekeeper colleague turns poacher. He knows too many of the secrets&#151;I was 
going to say the black arts, but the fact that he comes from Lanarkshire means 
that he knows nothing of black arts.</P><P>I note that the great public interest 
in debates on the budget process continues. I do not think that there is one person 
in the public gallery. In recent years, we have been accustomed to children being 
brought to listen to deliberations on the Finance Committee's work as an end-of-term 
treat. It appears that listening to and observing the Finance Committee's debates 
on the budget has been struck from the curriculum. I am tempted to call for a 
public inquiry on that.</P><P>&quot;No elected representatives in the UK have 
ever before had the chance to participate in a process of budget development as 
pioneering as that which we are undertaking.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>,

<P>Those are not my words; they are the words of Des McNulty, the former convener 
of the Finance Committee. I thank Des McNulty for his work in that role, in which 
he made a significant contribution, and I wish him well in his new role. Earlier 
this week, he was subjected to the ordeal of giving evidence to the Finance Committee 
for the first time. I gather that he is now regretting the extra rigour that he 
brought to bear in the committee's work.</P><P>Over the parliamentary session, 
we have made considerable progress in establishing a budget process that is more 
open and transparent than any other of which I am aware. The Finance Committee 
and the subject committees have played an important part in that through their 
reports and through the changes that we have made to the process in response to 
their detailed and specific recommendations.</P><P>We have also brought the process 
much closer to the people of Scotland. Over the parliamentary session, the Finance 
Committee has held meetings in Orkney, Hamilton and Skye. My ministerial colleagues 
and I have held budget roadshows in places as far apart as Stornoway, Stirling, 
Hamilton, Galashiels, Dundee, Inverness, Kilmarnock, Fort William, Dumfries, Aberdeen 
and Greenock. Those meetings offered an important route for people to find out 
what the Government is planning and gave the public the opportunity to make comments 
on those proposals. They have played a part in shaping the allocations proposed 
in the various draft budgets.</P><P>In that context, I highlight in particular 
the quality-of-life initiatives that have been proposed&#151;£95 million from 
end-year flexibility in the current year and £180 million over the coming three-year 
period. The proposals were fashioned by what we heard at meetings and from council 
leaders throughout the country.</P><P>The meetings have also been very useful 
in confirming the priorities and direction of travel of the Scottish Executive. 
People believe that we were right to give education the highest priority when 
we came to office in 1999. They believe that we are right to give increased priority 
to health and reducing crime. They believe that we are right to give growing attention 
to transport in the coming budget period.</P><P>That is how it should be. The 
Scottish Executive should reflect the wishes of the Scottish people in determining 
the Scottish budget. It is clear that the Executive's priorities are the people's 
priorities. The people want to see us working together across Scotland's public 
services to improve those services. They want to see us working together with 
colleagues in the United Kingdom. They do not want to see us wasting time and 
resources on constitutional wrangling and the costs of divorcing our UK partner. 
The success of the devolution </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16537">16537</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>settlement is that we receive a fair share of extra spending generated by the 
strong economic management of the UK.</P><P>We get that fair share through the 
Barnett formula. The Barnett formula serves us well; it is stable, simple and 
fair and it is delivering for Scotland. It supports significantly higher spending 
per head in Scotland than in England and Wales. Crucially, we decide how our receipts 
are spent to match Scottish priorities.</P><P>As Tom McCabe set out, the draft 
budget that we are discussing today shows the Scottish budget rising to £25 billion 
by 2005-06. That unprecedented growth presents an unprecedented opportunity to 
improve life for all Scots. It will help to reduce crime, improve health, develop 
education, support jobs and growth in the economy and invest in our transport 
infrastructure. We will be able to do that in sustainable ways. We will always 
be seeking to close the opportunity gaps that exist between communities and individuals 
across Scotland. Over the first six years of devolution, resources for Scotland 
will have grown by more than 25 per cent.</P><P>In &quot;Building a Better Scotland&quot; 
and the draft budget document, we have set out in detail what we propose to deliver 
with those resources and how they should be spent. In January, we will bring forward 
the 2003 Budget Bill, seeking parliamentary approval for the first year of our 
plans.</P><P>Much of the committee's report is not so much on the details of the 
budget as on the process by which the budget is decided. Although I would not 
claim that the budget process is perfect, we have made significant improvements 
over the parliamentary session. I agree with the Finance Committee that we can 
do better still in the next session; indeed, we will seek to do so. In that light, 
I welcome the further suggestions made in the Finance Committee's report. The 
Executive will keep working with the committee in a co-operative spirit.</P><P>As 
Tom McCabe indicated, with the election coming in May, the process of consideration 
of next year's budget will inevitably be rather compressed in comparison with 
past experience. The process would normally start with the Executive publishing 
an annual expenditure report in March. Given the timing of the election, we have 
agreed with the Finance Committee that that would make little sense. We will instead 
bring forward to August the publication of the draft budget&#151;the usual second 
stage of the process&#151;to give committees longer to scrutinise our plans at 
that point. I hope that members will agree that that is a constructive solution.</P><P>We 
will write to the Finance Committee more </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16538">16538</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>fully in due course to respond to the various recommendations in its report, 
but I shall deal with some of them now.</P><P>The report refers to the Skye bridge. 
That project has brought huge benefits to Skye. It has reduced congestion and 
the queueing that used to happen at Kyle and Kyleakin, particularly during the 
summer. It has speeded up communications and access to services. Since 1999, the 
UK Government and the Scottish Executive have taken decisive action to act on 
tolls on the Skye bridge, first halving and then freezing tolls for frequent users 
so that, over time, the tolls will wither on the vine of inflation and bring a 
decent deal to local people.</P><P><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>Does the minister 
welcome the reply that I received to a parliamentary question this week saying 
that the Skye bridge is likely to be paid off as early as 2009, after which people 
will be able to travel across to Skye for free? That is something that they would 
never have been able to do on the ferry.</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>I 
very much welcome the fact that we hope to see the bridge paid off at the earliest 
possible opportunity. As Mary Scanlon says, travelling to Skye today&#151;let 
alone in the future, when the bridge is paid off&#151;is significantly cheaper 
that it was on the ferry. People also have all the convenience that the bridge 
brings.</P><P>Having said all that, we understand that there are concerns about 
the administration of the tolls. I made that point when I was in Skye giving evidence 
to the Finance Committee and I have spoken to my transport colleagues about the 
issue. The Executive is also in contact with Highland Council about the recent 
report to which Tom McCabe referred, which was brought to the Finance Committee's 
attention when it was meeting in Skye.</P><P>The committee's second recommendation 
concerns the presentation of information about end-year flexibility. I am glad 
that the committee welcomes the improvements that we have made this year. We have 
made significant efforts to categorise and filter out the individual elements 
of EYF, such as money that is kept aside for future capital spending, money that 
is within a contingency fund, money that is controlled by other arm's-length bodies 
and fluctuations on demand-led budgets.</P><P>EYF is not just the result of underspending; 
it is also about prudent management. The benefits of EYF in previous years are 
obvious to people who are accustomed to dealing with public expenditure in Scotland. 
We have seen an end to the end-year surge of spending in the public sector in 
order to get the money out of the door for fear of losing it. That money can now 
be carried forward and </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16539">16539</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>targeted on continuing priorities. That is a significant step forward in public 
expenditure management. However, as with other recommendations in the report, 
we will look again at the presentation of our EYF figures to see whether we can 
do more to provide the committee with the information that it has sought.</P><P>I 
whole-heartedly agree that we have to ensure that we get value for money from 
our spending. What matters is what we deliver in terms of better public services 
and improvements to people's lives. The size of an individual budget does not 
matter; what matters is what is done with the money to bring about improvements 
in the lives of people across Scotland. On several occasions, we have set out 
the steps that we are taking to drive up efficiency and increase value for money. 
The concept of best value is well established throughout the public sector because 
of the Local Government in Scotland Bill and through ministers' commitments to 
pursue best value in all that we do. Some of those measures will be touched on 
in response to other recommendations, so I will not run through the list now.</P><P>One 
consequence of moving to three-year budgeting is that it opens the way for showing 
the value of increased spending over that three-year period. We already publish 
the actual cash numbers and the real-terms numbers and we will continue to do 
so in our budget documents. We want people to see the totals and the year-on-year 
increases in the budgets. The totals that we put into the cash columns in the 
budget documents make clear exactly what we will be spending in each year. I believe 
that that process is fully transparent.</P><P>We will need to think carefully 
about whether the committee's proposal in that respect would increase transparency. 
By one view, it could make matters less clear. However, as always, we will do 
the committee the courtesy of fully reflecting on its concerns.</P><P>I have some 
sympathy with the committee's difficulties with the timing of information being 
made available to it during the budget round. This year in particular, those difficulties 
resulted from the rub between the Westminster parliamentary process and ours. 
In years when there is a Whitehall spending review, the size of the assigned budget 
for the following year will not be clear until June of that year. Given our commitment 
to bringing a draft budget to Parliament by 20 September, that inevitably means 
that we cannot provide fully detailed information in that document in spending 
review years. However, we are committed to providing that information as quickly 
as possible. I would be happy to discuss with the committee whether we can make 
further improvements to the process in </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16540">16540</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>future spending review years, although I believe that we made some progress 
on that this year.</P><P>On non-domestic rates, we can confirm to businesses that&#151;revaluations 
aside&#151;their rates bills will rise no faster than inflation. Every business 
will benefit from our decision to freeze rates for next year.</P><P>I welcome 
the Finance Committee's emphasis on the importance of cross-cutting issues in 
setting and examining spending proposals. I have been discussing those matters 
with the committee over the past fortnight and I look forward to seeing its report 
in due course. The committee has an important contribution to make to the question 
of how the Executive addresses cross-cutting issues. Members have been sent copies 
of published reports that set out how our two key cross-cutting themes for the 
spending review&#151;closing the opportunity gap and sustainable development&#151;were 
taken into account in the process. That was a new approach for us. We are looking 
to go further in future, but I hope that members will recognise that the progress 
that we have made so far has been real and has brought improvements.</P><P>I welcome 
the Finance Committee's endorsement of our moves to be clearer about what we will 
deliver in return for the resources that are committed in the spending review 
and in the Scottish budget that follows the review. We have set out 105 detailed 
targets along with, for the first time, detailed technical notes that set out 
how those targets are defined and how and by whom progress will be measured over 
time. That is a major development for the Executive. We will publish regular information 
on progress on those targets&#151;in future budget documents, for example.</P><P>I 
agree with the Finance Committee that we are not quite there yet in relation to 
how we measure, draft, set and monitor targets. There is more that we can do to 
link spending to outcomes and outputs. I look forward to working with the Finance 
Committee in taking that forward. I am grateful to the committee for acknowledging 
that there have been significant improvements in that aspect of our planning over 
the past year.</P><P>I am not sure that I entirely understand the Finance Committee's 
concept of &quot;new spending&quot;. I share the committee's aim of increasing 
transparency and I look forward to discussing its recommendation with committee 
members in the months ahead.</P><P>We agree with both the Finance Committee's 
recommendations on equal opportunities. We are trying to make progress on defining 
equal opportunities and I gather that further reports on the issue will be given 
to the Finance Committee in due course.</P><P>I also note what the committee says 
about </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16541">16541</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Nicola Sturgeon's proposal, which is the subject of her amendment today. I 
believe that the Finance Committee report strikes the right note; it does not 
recommend that the matter be taken forward at this time. The committee rightly 
pointed out that Nicola Sturgeon did not raise the proposal in the Health and 
Community Care Committee, of which she is a member, when it discussed the budget&#151;Margaret 
Smith referred to that, as did Mary Scanlon. Nicola Sturgeon should properly have 
done so if she really wanted to garner support for her proposal.</P><P>Of course, 
Nicola Sturgeon knows that the Health and Community Care Committee is still considering 
the matter and that, as the Finance Committee points out, her proposal could set 
a precedent whose consequences cannot be fully established at this time. Furthermore, 
as the Finance Committee points out, the interaction between the proposal and 
entitlement to benefits for those who are affected is not clear. All in all, the 
Finance Committee has taken the correct approach to the issue. The Executive is 
still in discussions with the Health and Community Care Committee over the matter, 
as the amendment to the amendment in Margaret Smith's name highlights.</P><P>Of 
course, what is really interesting in budget-process terms is that, although the 
SNP has at last recognised that it can propose amendments to the budget proposals, 
it has done so in respect of only one matter. That raises the question: what should 
we read into the SNP's approach? I suspect that the only conclusion that we can 
come to is that in every other respect the SNP regards the Executive's budget 
to be exactly right in terms of priorities and expenditure. Moreover, where does 
the fact that no other amendments have been lodged leave the spending pledges 
that the SNP has been littering the country with over recent weeks? It leaves 
the SNP precisely nowhere, with just empty gestures of the sort that we have become 
so accustomed to over recent times. I will return to those points in much more 
detail when I sum up at the end of the debate.</P><P>As I hope I have demonstrated, 
the Executive broadly welcomes the Finance Committee's report, which recommends 
a number of changes that no doubt other members will want to address during the 
debate. I agree with the report's aims of full transparency and a budget process 
that allows everyone to have their proper say. I look forward to working with 
the Finance Committee and others in Parliament and outside to make sure that those 
aims are achieved. The Executive is happy to support the substantive motion and 
we believe that Margaret Smith has lodged an appropriate amendment to Nicola Sturgeon's 
amendment.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16542">16542</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

we are again. The fourth year round and I am amazed to find that we have three 
hours to deal with this year's budget process, when this afternoon we have only 
an hour and a half to discuss land reform. I appreciate that that is not the fault 
of the Presiding Officer, but I question where the business managers were coming 
from, given that difference in the length of the debates.</P><P>I begin by congratulating 
the clerks on all the work that they have done for the Finance Committee over 
the year, particularly on pulling together this report for us. I also congratulate 
my committee members on being so diligent, on following through, and on the unanimity 
under which we tend to operate&#151;members of the committee tend not to hold 
excessive points of view. I also welcome Tom McCabe to the post of Finance Committee 
convener. He is the third convener that we have had, and I wish him every success; 
of course, we do not know what will happen next year.</P><P>Paragraph 16 of the 
report</P><P>&quot;welcomes this significant growth in the Scottish Budget but 
recognises the need for the Executive to pursue value for money in its use.&quot;</P><P>The 
only reason why there has been an increase in the allocation of money is that 
Gordon Brown and the Labour party have already taken it from the taxpayer, especially 
through the 53 stealth taxes that we have suffered. In the Conservative party, 
we believe that the Scottish Government's spending priorities are totally wrong. 
Taxpayers' money is not being used effectively. Rather than throw money at pet 
projects and meaningless initiatives and strategies, the Government should invest 
in infrastructure and reformed public services.</P><P><strong>Iain Smith (North-East 
Fife) (LD): </strong>I think that I heard David Davidson correctly when he said 
that the Scottish Executive's budget is totally wrong, but there is no amendment 
from the Conservatives that sets out how they would do things differently.</P><P><strong>Mr

<P>so why did the Government in Scotland abandon the Conservative road building 
plan that it inherited? What about broadband connectivity? We hear little about 
that now, but many people still ask for it.</P><P><strong>Elaine Thomson (Aberdeen 
North) (Lab): </strong>I am always keen to talk about Aberdeen transport issues. 
David Davidson said that the Aberdeen crossrail project would be a good thing. 
Do the Tories recognise that it is one project, among many, that the Scottish 
Executive has got absolutely right?</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>The Scottish 
Executive has failed so far to tell us whether it will pay for the Aberdeen bypass 
out of the public purse or whether we are to pay for Aberdeen crossrail in some 
other manner, and road tolls have yet to be ruled out. How those projects are 
to be paid for is still a big secret, yet every other major city in Scotland got 
its bypass from the public purse. An Aberdeen bypass is an essential requirement, 
and I would like the Labour party to tell us how it is to be paid for today.</P><P>On 
the sustainable economy and jobs, everybody recognises that there is a problem 
with the Scottish economy, yet Peter Peacock did not seem to address it in his 
speech. There is a huge skills gap, but he did not appear to say anything about 
that, either.</P><P>The public perception is that our communities are not safer. 
Only yesterday, Archbishop Conti mentioned during his lunchtime chat with a group 
of MSPs that people in the west of Scotland tell him regularly that they do not 
feel safe to go out at night. Where are safe communities being delivered by the 
budget? There is a potential standstill in the justice budget, which I am sure 
that my colleague Lord James Douglas-Hamilton will get round to.</P><P>If we are 
to get value for money in public services, we need reform that meets the needs 
and expectations of the Scottish people in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. At issue 
is the quality of services, not who delivers them. We need to have a more open 
mind about how we address that.</P><P>The fact that business rates are higher 
than they need to be has already been touched on. A key issue that has not been 
addressed is the fact that high business rates disadvantage Scotland. Merely freezing 
them for a year is insufficient. The minister has not explained away the extra 
£300 million or more a year that Scottish businesses will have to pay in non-domestic 
rates. The issue dates back to the current First Minister's decision to abandon 
the uniform business rate, which we want to bring back.</P><P>There is no doubt 
that the Holyrood project is a Government scheme that has been subcontracted </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16544">16544</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. We have seen blank-cheque budgeting 
at its extreme and the project is out of control. We use the word &quot;uncertainty&quot; 
in the committee report, which is a euphemism for &quot;shambles&quot;. The project 
is indeed a shambles, and the fact that it is being dragged out is not doing the 
Parliament any good. We need clarity about when it will be finished and what it 
will actually cost. I am pleased that the Finance Committee agreed that the Parliament 
would be throwing money aside if it spent the proposed £400,000 on an opening 
ceremony. That would not do the public perception of the Parliament any good.</P><P>What 
has changed in the few years during which we have undertaken the budget process? 
In 1999, the big issue for the Finance Committee was insufficient information 
for the subject committees and poor outcome information&#151;if such information 
was given at all. In its report of 2000, the committee expressed dissatisfaction 
with the level of information and said that level 3 figures needed to be provided 
earlier. It also noted that continued funding for some voluntary organisations 
did not appear to be planned. That approach has altered and three-year funding 
programmes have now been adopted&#151;we hope.</P><P>From the committee's cross-cutting 
work&#151;Brian Adam and I are involved in the voluntary sector review&#151;it 
is patent that nobody can trace how money reaches places, what is done with it 
and what is produced for it. That is a problem for the Executive, which must understand 
the meaning of transparency and deliver it in the budget process. For example, 
the voluntary sector has no clue where money comes from or goes to. There appear 
to be 13 Executive funding sources for one area and no one minister appears to 
be responsible for them&#151;the left hand is not operating with the right hand. 
The committee would like the Executive to take such matters on board.</P><P>In 
2001, we talked about priority-based budgeting. We asked that the source of money 
that is available for reallocation should accompany any announcement of reallocation, 
and a bit of work remains to be done on that. The Scottish Administration's costs 
should be broken down further. That problem has still not been addressed.</P><P>The 
co-ordination of responses to subject committees' stage 1 reports is a continuing 
problem. Year after year, the committees claim that they do not know what the 
information means. I am glad that the minister said that the subject committees 
will have more time to consider the budget, but time is not the only factor&#151;they 
need the detail.</P><P>The Finance Committee welcomes the improvements in dealing 
with EYF, but we are </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16545">16545</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>looking for more progress. This year's stage 2 report talks about value for 
money in the use of additional resources, but the committee condemns the Executive 
for the dishonest and misleading practice of cumulative accounting of budget increases. 
When we met in Skye, the Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services gave 
the committee a robust defence of that&#151;he closed his ears and talked the 
issue out. We need the Executive to declare that it will stop that practice. If 
an increase has been made, the Executive should be honest about that; we will 
admit that an increase has been made. However, it is misleading for the Executive 
to try to double and treble account an increase through the budgets. That lifts 
people's expectations of delivery to levels that cannot be met.</P><P><strong>Brian 
Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Does the member accept that the minister 
skirted round the issue again today? He avoided mentioning complaints about cumulative 
accounting and gave no commitment to accept the committee's recommendation, which 
has been made not once, but several times.</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>I 
think that Mr Adam would agree that we did not expect the minister to do anything 
other than what he did: he closed his eyes to the issue and ignored it, and acted 
as if the recommendation had not been made. If the minister is allowed to speak 
again, perhaps we might get some honesty from him.</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: 
</strong>Oh, come, come.</P><P><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and 
Easter Ross) (LD): </strong>Steady on.</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>I appreciate 
that I was asking for too much, but this is the Christmas season.</P><P>The committees 
have made a great call for baseline spending to be distinguished from new spending. 
We must do more work on that issue. I admit that the Finance Committee has a role 
to play in that.</P><P>I mention that the justice budget is set to decrease in 
relative terms.</P><P>I will deal with the committee's response to Nicola Sturgeon's 
request for no-fault compensation. Nicola Sturgeon spoke well, as she usually 
does on the subject, and Margaret Smith's response to her speech was good. However, 
as I said at the Finance Committee's meeting, I question why that request was 
not made as a cross-party committee exercise. The best way to change the budget 
is not through a single person going for something, but through cross-party recognition 
of, and work on, a piece of continuing work.</P><P>The Parliament is in its fourth 
year. In its relatively short existence, we have seen three First </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16546">16546</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Ministers but, more important to the debate, we have seen three finance ministers: 
Jack McConnell, Angus MacKay and Andy Kerr&#151;at least I think that he is the 
finance minister, although only Peter Peacock is present for the debate. Each 
finance minister has had the benefit of Peter Peacock playing the faithful Tonto 
to the Scottish Government fiscal Lone Ranger. He has done that diligently. He 
reminds me of a cricketer with whom I used to play in England. We often put that 
guy in, because he would never get out. He never scored any runs, but he batted 
and batted. I am sure that Peter Peacock has a similar skill.</P><P>The debate 
is supposed to be part of the transparent budget development process and to allow 
the Parliament, the committees, and most important, the public, to participate 
in that process. The process is better than that at Westminster, but it has a 
long way to go. In four years, we could have gone a bit further than we have managed.</P><P>Mist 
surrounds the multiple accounting practices. That probably starts with the performances 
down south of the member of Parliament for Dunfermline East. That school of accounting 
should not be used in Scotland. Its aim is to deceive the public and fool them 
into thinking that things are wonderful. It might fool some people some of the 
time, but it will never&#151;despite the Executive's crossed fingers&#151;fool 
all the people all the time.</P><P>Time and again, the Finance Committee has asked 
for greater clarity. I understand that ministers are keen to give themselves awards 
in their school report this year. If a school report is to be written, perhaps 
ministers should let members write it, because progress has been remarkably and 
painfully slow.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>We come to 
the open debate. There is reasonable time in hand this morning. Members can aim 
for speeches of six minutes, plus time for interventions.</P><P>10:37</P><P><strong>Bristow 
Muldoon (Livingston) (Lab): </strong>I apologise to my colleague Tom McCabe for 
missing the beginning of his speech. That was because of delays on the ScotRail 
system: frozen points in the Rutherglen area led to frozen toes in the Livingston 
area.</P><P>I will concentrate on transport expenditure. To clarify the situation 
for the more pedantic SNP members, I speak as a Labour member and not as the Transport 
and the Environment Committee's convener. Mr Russell is not in the chamber, but

<P>winter are not a new phenomenon. What rate of investment would be required 
to unfreeze our points, given that we have known about the problem for 150 years 
or so?</P><P><strong>Bristow Muldoon: </strong>The current rate of investment 
in the railways is unprecedented. I am sure that we will see rapid improvements 
in the transport system. Only time will tell whether that will eradicate the problem 
of frozen points.</P><P>In considering the Finance Committee's report, I will 
concentrate on transport issues and on some of the recommendations in the Transport 
and the Environment Committee's report. Transport expenditure will rise strongly 
during the spending review period. The Transport and the Environment Committee 
observed that some of that increase was from money that moved from one budget 
line to another. That attracted press criticism, some of which misunderstood the 
situation, because some transfers were expenditure increases.</P><P>For the railway 
industry, which we just talked about, one budget transfer was of £31 million from 
UK Government expenditure to the Scottish Executive to sustain the level of ScotRail-operated 
services. If that transfer had not been made, ScotRail might have had to reduce 
its service level, which would ultimately damage the Executive's ability to deliver 
on its transport aims.</P><P>I welcome the rail funding initiative that Iain Gray 
announced this week of investment plans to increase the amount of available rolling 
stock, which will improve services throughout Scotland, such as the Glasgow to 
Edinburgh line, services in Fife and West Lothian, and services to Aberdeen and 
Inverness. That will contribute to achieving the Executive's stated aim of reducing 
overcrowding on rail services in the spending review period. The integrated transport 
fund, which was announced by the Executive recently, includes investment to establish 
new railway lines and to investigate, through exploratory engineering work, the 
reopening of the Bathgate to Airdrie railway line.</P><P>Mr Davidson's contribution 
on the subject of roads was long on complaints about the way in which money is 
spent but contained no clear explanation about the cuts that would be required 
in the Scottish Executive's budget if Conservative plans to slash public expenditure 
ever came to fruition.</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Would the member like 
to start by cutting the £10 million that was spent on advertising and promotion? 
That figure, which relates to the Executive's administration budget, would be 
a good place to start.</P><P><strong>Bristow Muldoon: </strong>The sum of £10 
million would not go very far towards achieving the Conservatives' stated aim 
at the last general election of making cuts of between £8 billion and </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16548">16548</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>£16 billion. Little gestures such as the one Mr Davidson suggested would go 
nowhere near re-establishing the Scottish public's belief in the Conservative 
party's faith in public services.</P><P><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland 
and Fife) (Con): </strong>The member suggests that the Conservatives have no faith 
in public services. Will he tell the chamber why I am content to send my children 
to state schools?</P><P><strong>Bristow Muldoon: </strong>I welcome that. I can 
only conclude that Mr Monteith recognises the fact that parents' wise decision 
to choose the comprehensive education system is made in light of the excellent 
education that that system provides. I welcome the fact that he has faith in the 
comprehensive education system. I look forward to his support for it in future.</P><P>The 
Transport and the Environment Committee recognised that more investment is needed 
in the quality of roads, particularly local roads. I believe that Mr Morgan identified 
that area as one that requires additional expenditure. I welcome the way in which 
the Executive used its underspend last year to allocate money to local authorities 
for local road improvements.</P><P>The investment that has taken place in public 
services, particularly in transport, did not happen by accident: it happened because 
of decisions that were taken by Labour in government at Westminster and Labour 
in coalition with our Liberal Democrat partners in the Scottish Executive. All 
those plans would be put in jeopardy by the uncosted plans of the Scottish National 
Party if ever it came to power&#151;however unlikely that might be.</P><P>I commend 
the budget to the chamber and welcome the Finance Committee's report.</P><P>10:43</P><P><strong>Fergus 
Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP): </strong>I believe that Nicola

no fault of their own and Nicola Sturgeon should be commended for setting out 
the case in her usual eloquent and articulate fashion and for saying exactly how 
the maximum cost of £89 million could be funded. That issue should be taken more 
seriously by some members.</P><P>I will focus on an issue that I believe people 
outside the chamber talk most about. It is the issue that has dominated the short 
life of the Scottish Parliament so far&#151;I am talking about the Holyrood project.

<P>comprehend how the project has not been taken a grip of. From conversations 
with my constituents, I know that many of them are absolutely furious about the 
issue. I have held my view of the matter for some considerable time and have taken 
an active interest in the project since the establishment of the Parliament, although 
I have taken a particular interest in it since about spring last year.</P><P>This 
morning, I will talk about one aspect of the whole sorry business, which I will 
call the Flour City fiasco. It relates to an estimated £3.8 million, which is 
money that can, should and will be recovered for the taxpayer; I have made it 
my business to campaign to that end. In spring last year, I was contacted by members 
of the Scottish Timber Trade Association who expressed concern that an unknown 
company called Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) had been awarded a £7 million 
contract. Those Scottish businesses, some of which had previously spent a great 
deal of time trying to secure the contract that was awarded to Flour City, had 
never heard of that company.</P><P>I began to make inquiries. I obtained a copy 
of the company's file and found out that Flour City UK had no assets other than 
a £2 share capital and that it had no UK directors. The two directors listed in 
the company file were a Mr John Tang and Mr Edward Boyle. The company had no trading 
pattern and, according to the only accounts that it posted in the UK, no income. 
I asked myself how a shell company with no assets, no UK directors and no trading 
history could have been awarded a £7 million contract. Would any member present 
in the chamber contemplate doing such a thing? I made further and more detailed 
inquiries and, in January this year, made lengthy submissions to the Auditor General 
for Scotland. The Auditor General took some time to prepare a report, but a report 
was finally made to me in a letter of 5 September.</P><P>In the interests of accuracy, 
I start by saying that the Auditor General's conclusion is that the contract &quot;was 
not improperly made&quot;, but I am not sure what that means. If it means that 
there was a lack of evidence of impropriety, I accept that that is the case. Contrary 
to what Mr John Home Robertson said, I have never suggested that evidence of impropriety 
has come into the public domain.</P><P>The Auditor General concludes:</P><P>&quot;there 
were deficiencies in the selection, award and management procedures for the award 
which exposed the SPCB to avoidable and possibly significant risk.&quot;</P><P>I 
reiterate&#151;members should bear it in mind&#151;that those deficiencies</P><P>&quot;exposed 
the SPCB to avoidable and possibly significant risk.&quot;</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16550">16550</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I argue that that risk became loss.</P><P>The Auditor General went on to itemise 
particular deficiencies and said that insufficient financial information was obtained 
about Flour City and that a detailed financial appraisal of the company was lacking.</P><P>I 
have with me the pre-qualification questionnaire, which all prospective tenderers 
should have completed before they were accepted as eligible to tender. Did Flour 
City complete and submit such a document? If so, what information was given in 
response to the questions that asks prospective tenderers to state what previous 
contracts they have obtained. I have been informed that no references were obtained 
from Flour City suppliers, customers or bankers. I believe that that is tantamount 
to negligence.</P><P>I discovered that in September 2000 a bad debt judgment for 
£1,017 had been found against Flour City in a Basildon court. I got that information 
by paying £4.50. Subsequently, in a letter of 12 July 2002 from the registry of 
county court judgments, I found that the information on Flour City's bad debt 
was available in September 2000. Given that the contract was not awarded to Flour 
City until the end of January 2001 and that the bad-debt information was available 
at that time, why did not the Holyrood construction managers get that information 
before deciding to award the contract?</P><P>Concerns about the parent company&#151;Flour 
City International&#151;were not explored, but company accounts dated 31 October 
1999 show that the parent company had gone from being in profit to making a loss. 
Those accounts also show an unexplained share transaction in which the company 
paid out $1.5 million to some shareholders. It is unusual for shareholders to 
get money from a company when, according to its accounts, it is undergoing serious 
financial difficulties.</P><P>I do not have time to tell the rest of the story 
today. However, it is important that we recover every pound that we can, because 
£3.8 million is a lot of money. It could, should and&#151;if I have anything to 
do with it&#151;will be recovered for the Scottish taxpayer so that perhaps, at 
last, people will be able to see that something concrete is being done to deal 
with the fiasco of the Holyrood project.</P><P>10:50</P><P><strong>Mary Scanlon 
(Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>I want to make a quick point about Nicola

that has worked rigorously over three years to examine the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16551">16551</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>problems of hepatitis C sufferers, it is discourteous for one member to break 
ranks and hijack the issue. That is especially the case when she knows perfectly 
well that if her amendment was agreed to, the payments could be clawed back through 
social security.</P><P><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Will 
the member give way?</P><P><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>No, I will not. I have 
heard enough from the SNP today.</P><P>There must be concern that although health 
spending in Scotland has been 25 per cent greater than in England for the past 
25 years, waiting lists and times in the past five years have increased and fewer 
people are being treated. However, instead of measuring outcomes, the Scottish 
Government still measures our health by the amount of money that is spent on it. 
The budget debate should not only be about headline figures, but about placing 
more emphasis on best value for taxpayers' money and on the effectiveness of spending.</P><P>As 
a member of the Health and Community Care Committee, I assisted with the passage 
of the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002. The committee recommended 
a single budget for care in the community and it recommended, in particular, free 
personal care. I lodged amendments at the appropriate times whose purpose was 
to avoid buck-passing between the NHS and local councils, but the amendments were 
defeated. Their basis was the Sutherland commission's findings that £750 million 
that had been earmarked for care of the elderly throughout the United Kingdom 
had gone into a black hole at local council level and had been diverted to other 
budgets. Malcolm Chisholm's own care development group discovered that £63 million 
that had been earmarked for care of the elderly was also diverted to other council 
budgets. Six months into the implementation of free personal care, there is neither 
the means nor the intention to monitor local government spending on free personal 
and nursing care, which would ensure that those who are assessed as eligible for 
such care get it.</P><P>I want to draw Parliament's attention to three written 
answers that I received last week from Frank McAveety. The first one confirms 
that</P><P>&quot;Anyone assessed as needing personal or nursing care will receive 
it.&quot;</P><P>My second question was about measuring unmet need for home care, 
and the answer was:</P><P>&quot;The Executive does not measure unmet need.&quot;</P><P>My 
third question was to ask about the waiting lists for home and residential care, 
to which Frank McAveety answered:</P><P>&quot;The information requested is not 
held centrally.&quot;&#151;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16552">16552</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Written Answers</em>, 9 December 2002; p 2477.]</P><P>It 
is hardly surprising that 2,920 beds are still blocked in the NHS or that waiting 
lists are rising. We are currently debating the Mental Health (Scotland) Bill, 
which has two separate sections for NHS services and local government services. 
That represents total demarcation, and it is already clear that the commitment 
to supporting in the community people who have mental illnesses will not be achieved 
unless councils become accountable for their spending of the community care pound.</P><P>I 
raise those two issues because, last week alone, three people came separately 
to my surgeries to discuss them. One stated that their elderly parent was on a 
waiting list for free personal care, while another's parent had been assessed 
months ago for free personal care but was still in Raigmore hospital. The third 
case was a lady who had found a place for her mother in a private care home in 
Nairn, but was told by the social work department that her mother's personal care 
would not be funded because she had taken her mother out of hospital and had jumped 
the list. On top of that is Highland Council's proposal to rewrite our act of 
Parliament by changing the eligibility criteria for personal care. I am thankful 
that the council's social work convener was voted down by many decent-minded councillors, 
so the proposal was not proceeded with.</P><P>I mention those cases because successful 
implementation of acts that are passed by Parliament depends on the co-operation 
and commitment of local councils, but we have no means of openly and transparently 
holding them to account for their spending. However, when people complain that 
they cannot access free personal care or mental health services in the community, 
it will be Parliament and the Government who are blamed, not local authorities.</P><P>If 
we want successful implementation of policies and acts of Parliament, ministers 
need to ensure that local councils accept responsibility and accountability for 
spending and that they are open and transparent, as members of the Parliament 
and, increasingly, the civil service have accepted they must be. We can pass any 
act of Parliament and be as well-meaning as we like, but unless we can hold councils 
accountable for care in the community, we will not succeed with free personal 
care and mental health services.</P><P>10:56</P><P><strong>John Farquhar Munro 
(Ross, Skye and Inverness West) (LD): </strong>I welcome the opportunity to take 
part in today's debate. Mary Scanlon intervened on the minister to suggest that 
we should get rid of Skye bridge tolls by 2009. We are </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16553">16553</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>more optimistic than that; I assure her that we will attempt to get rid of 
the tolls long before 2009.</P><P>I was pleased to see that the Finance Committee 
had the good sense to visit the island of Skye recently. I know that the committee 
was royally entertained and had informal discussions with many people in the community. 
The committee took evidence from many local groups, which highlighted their concerns 
and gave their views about national spending priorities and their effect on the 
economic viability of island communities such as Skye. The comments were wide 
ranging.</P><P>I was pleased to see that workshops were organised to give organisations 
an opportunity to give evidence. Almost all sections of commerce and business 
activity on the island were represented, including education, health services 
and the fishing, crofting and voluntary sectors. As members will understand, all 
those sectors make tremendous contributions to the economic well-being of any 
rural community.</P><P>I do not think that any member will be surprised to hear 
that one of the main topics of the evidence sessions was the high tolls on the 
Skye bridge, which&#151;as was made clear at the meeting&#151;are having a detrimental 
effect on the local economy. The tolls impinge on every aspect of island life, 
as well as on the neighbouring mainland community. Highland Council previously 
commissioned a study on the effect of the tolls on the community; its report determined 
that the tolls extract between £2.5 million and £3 million per annum from the 
local economy. If that money was invested or retained in Skye and Lochalsh, it 
would have the potential to create about 250 to 300 local jobs, which would be 
a very welcome boost to the local economy.</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Will 
the member give way?</P><P><strong>John Farquhar Munro: </strong>I will. I am 
not like the member's colleague, Mary Scanlon, who said that she would not.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Davidson: </strong>Will the member give the Parliament an indication of the cost 
of the ferry compared with the cost of bridge tolls?</P><P><strong>John Farquhar 
Munro: </strong>It was always the case that the ferry was a local service that 
had to be paid for by the people who used it. The same concept was never applied 
to the bridge. The people who protested against the bridge tolls argued that, 
because the bridge is part of the highway, it should be free to the travelling 
public. However, the Government of the day decreed that that was not to be so 
and, instead of imposing a reasonable toll as most people expected it would, it 
imposed a toll that was&#151;and still is&#151;extortionate to say the least.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16554">16554</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>On tolls, we have heard only today that VAT is to be charged on existing road, 
bridge and tunnel tolls. I am not yet sure whether the level will be 5 per cent 
or 17.5 per cent; however, it represents an added charge. I am glad to say that 
the Executive has announced this morning that the travelling public will not have 
to pay VAT; that is good news indeed. I understand that, because the Parliament 
took the welcome decision of freezing the Skye bridge tolls, the Treasury will 
absorb that VAT charge. However, an interesting question for Chancellor of the 
Exchequer Gordon Brown is whether the VAT that will be extracted from Scotland 
and which will go to the Westminster Treasury will be put back into the Scottish 
economy.</P><P>The decision to impose VAT on tolls also raises an interesting 
legal question about the protesters who have been given criminal convictions for 
refusing to pay what was considered at the time to be a tax. Now that the bridge 
tolls are deemed to be payment for a service, rather than a tax, they are subject 
to VAT. What will happen to the poor protesters who were given criminal convictions? 
I have no doubt that they will be lining up at the toll-gates today as they travel 
to Dingwall to make representations to the procurator fiscal. It will be interesting 
to find out who will compensate those poor individuals.</P><P>I welcome much of 
the budget process and commend the Finance Committee for its commitment to the 
Scottish economy. However, I have always been concerned that our rural communities 
receive very limited resources, so I ask that more consideration be given to ensuring 
that initiatives in those communities get a bigger or more appropriate slice of 
the cake.</P><P>11:03</P><P><strong>Trish Godman (West Renfrewshire) (Lab): </strong>I 
take this opportunity to thank the members and the clerking staff of the Local 
Government Committee for their hard work. I also thank Ken McKay, who acted as 
our adviser on the budget process. I should also thank the Finance Committee and 
welcome Tom McCabe to his new post.</P><P>The Local Government Committee's stage 
1 report on the budget process recommended that the Scottish Executive should 
address the implications for councils of the increase in employers' national insurance 
contributions. The Executive listened to the committee and, after consultation 
with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and before the committee's second 
report was published, the matter was resolved satisfactorily by the Executive's 
funding of the full amount. We also recommended that, when distributing additional 
health resources that would </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16555">16555</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>be accrued from the increase, the Executive should have regard to the contribution 
that local authorities make to the health of the nation.</P><P>The Local Government 
Committee welcomed the flexibility that the proposed prudential framework for 
capital investment will give councils. However, we were clear that the new arrangements 
had to be matched by adequate levels of revenue funding in order to make inroads 
into the backlog of capital investment.</P><P>The local government organisations 
felt that there was a need for a more open and constructive relationship between 
the Scottish Executive and local government in relation to the determination of 
councils' spending and funding needs. Other members have raised the same point 
this morning. On the other hand, ministers assured the Local Government Committee 
that the Executive shares a common agenda with local government. As a result, 
it appears that we need more transparent joint planning at an early stage.</P><P>The 
committee was very concerned that even after three years members were unable to 
scrutinise the local government budget in any meaningful way&#151;the same applies 
to the Parliament's ability to do so. A number of steps need to be taken if we 
are to make the budget process more effective. For a start, there is no sense 
in considering proposed levels of funding in a vacuum, with one large figure for 
revenue and another large figure for capital. The committee invited the Executive 
to produce, perhaps in its annual expenditure report, information not only on 
funding but on spending levels and, if possible, outcomes. Moreover, we feel that 
the Finance Committee should review the whole process with a view to linking parliamentary 
scrutiny to spending reviews instead of annual budgets.</P><P>During questioning, 
the minister said that he believes that he had a constructive relationship with 
COSLA. Although Councillor Pentland, who is COSLA's finance spokesperson, agreed 
that such a relationship existed, he wanted COSLA and the Executive to have a 
partnership. The Local Government Committee is clear that it has no wish to undermine 
the principle that councils should be given as much discretion as possible to 
determine their spending priorities&#151;which brings us to the question of ring 
fencing. I agree with most of Mary Scanlon's comments on ring fencing and, although 
I am not sure that we should go down the road of ring fencing, we should perhaps 
consider outcomes. Mary is absolutely right to say that there is no point in agreeing 
to good policies or legislation if they are not implemented as they should be.</P><P>Until 
we have more information that allows us to put funding levels in some context, 
our task will be well nigh impossible. The committee and the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16556">16556</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Parliament must be given much fuller information about the Executive assumptions 
that underlie the budget figures.</P><P>On revenue funding, the Local Government 
Committee again received conflicting evidence from the Executive and COSLA. For 
example, the minister totally rejected COSLA's claim that there would be underfunding 
by £440 million over the full three years of the settlement. Faced with those 
arguments and lacking the information with which to make its own assessment, the 
committee was not in a position to propose any change in the level of aggregate 
external finance&#151;a decision that was honest, but disappointing. We share 
the minister's hope, which was expressed to me in a letter dated 4 November, that 
in future years the factors and assumptions that underlie the proposed local government 
budget will be made clear when the budget is first presented to Parliament.</P><P>As 
far as capital funding is concerned, the Local Government Committee was very supportive 
of the proposed prudential framework. There will be a significant increase in 
capital investment through the use of public-private partnerships, although I 
am pleased by the fact that PPP is not the only game in town and by Andy Kerr's 
statements on a two-tier work force. However, we remain concerned about the backlog 
of investment in other local authority services. For example, if Sylvia Jackson 
were here, she would highlight the issue of roads and bridges; indeed, Bristow 
Muldoon has already raised that matter.</P><P>The Local Government Committee has 
several continuing concerns. First, we are concerned about the degree to which 
local government organisations and the Executive disagree over the adequacy of 
the local government budget. That disagreement has been apparent since the first 
day. Secondly, we are concerned that attention has focused on year-on-year increases 
rather than on baseline provision. For example, debate has centred on the £586 
million increase in budget instead of on what we are doing with the remaining 
£6.751 billion. Furthermore, lack of information about the budget from the Executive 
has made it impossible to express a view on the merits or otherwise of the case. 
It is to be hoped that the Executive will listen to and act on those constructive 
criticisms and that parliamentary scrutiny of the block allocations to local government 
and health will be significantly improved.</P><P>11:09</P><P><strong>Brian Adam 
(North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I echo the remarks that have been made by 
Trish Godman and Margaret Smith about their difficulties in being able to propose 
detailed, </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16557">16557</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>constructive amendments that reflect their committees' views. Perhaps members 
of the governing parties will reflect on those remarks before they indulge in 
their standard annual criticism of the Opposition's approach to the debate. It 
is difficult to come up with detailed alternative proposals and, as a consequence, 
Nicola Sturgeon's proposal is worthy of praise and support. She has come up with 
a specific proposal within the rather narrow strictures of the Public Finance 
and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000 and the zero-sum base of the budget.</P><P>The 
Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services has adopted an interesting position. 
He seems to be deputy minister for all Administrations and all seasons. I am delighted 
that at least one member of the Government has managed to survive all the reshuffles 
so far. His presence today is most welcome, in the absence of the Cabinet minister 
with responsibility for finance. This is the second major financial debate that 
the Minister for Finance and Public Services has dodged. I do not know why, but 
perhaps he is incapable of answering questions or he does not think the debate 
important enough for him to grace the chamber with his presence. Perhaps he has 
such confidence in Mr Peacock that he is more than willing to allow him to deal 
with the debate.</P><P>Mr Peacock dodged the question about cumulative accounting, 
having attempted to defend it in Skye. He failed to make any commitment to put 
the matter to one side and never to use cumulative accounting again. He will have 
yet another opportunity to make that commitment when he sums up on behalf of the 
Executive. I invite him so to do, otherwise the successor Finance Committee is 
likely to say the same thing to whoever occupies the minister's post after the 
election.</P><P>The Parliament gave the Finance Committee the responsibility of 
scrutinising the Holyrood project and it has been a difficult job. We receive 
quarterly reports from the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the Parliament, 
in its wisdom, set up the Holyrood progress group to try to make things work. 
However, the fundamental problem was that the method by which the building work 
was procured was never going to allow successful scrutiny by a public body at 
such a great distance.</P><P>Between now and the next time that we hear from the 
SPCB, I hope that the Finance Committee will invite the management agents of the 
body to give an account of the appointment of a company with rather dubious financial 
antecedents&#151;according to the information that was provided to us&#151;and 
to explain why that company was allowed to proceed. It would be most useful to 
ask the management company directly why we cannot get any closer to a firm </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16558">16558</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>price and a timetable for completion of the project. It is interesting that 
we were advised, in responses to questions to the SPCB earlier this week, that 
the Treasury, which gives advice on such matters, no longer recommends the procurement 
method in question. I hope that it will give the same advice on public finance 
initiatives and public-private partnerships in the near future, because those 
methods also have somewhat dubious value.</P><P>The general public will find it 
as difficult as MSPs find it to get at the detail of the budget. The public have 
significant interest in the ever-increasing cost of the new Parliament building 
and in the fact that we do not appear to be able to give a firm deadline for its 
completion. I look forward to having the opportunity to hold to account the company 
that manages the project on our behalf.</P><P>I suggest that the remarks that 
were made by Mr McCabe&#151;the former Minister for Parliament&#151;about ministers' 
responsibility for the new building were inappropriate. We have failed to hold 
the Executive to account for its responsibilities, as the Executive must find 
the money for the project. I hope that we will resolve that matter soon.</P><P>11:16</P><P><strong>Mr 
Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>I apologise for not being 
present to hear the convener's opening speech, which I am sure was robust. I look 
forward to Mr McCabe's convenership of such an important committee.</P><P>The 
regional disparities in the education budget must be examined in the future, particularly 
the difference in Executive moneys for schools. The Association of Head Teachers 
in Scotland commented on the differences in levels of administration and bureaucracy 
between councils:</P><P>&quot;In a national system of state education, it may 
be imagined, and even expected, that pupils are provided for in an equal way, 
but this is clearly not the case. Pupils straddling the 'county line' would be 
better off turning right in the morning, rather than left (or perhaps vice versa).</P><P>The 
fact that such inequality of funding exists is clear to school managers across 
Scotland and is a source of on-going frustration. The sincerest principles and 
best founded practices of Devolved School Management are being increasingly compromised 
by the uncertainties and inequities of provision&quot;.</P><P>For example, Bannerman 
High School in Glasgow, with a school roll of 1,399, has spending per pupil of 
£2,720. Kirkcaldy High School, with a roll of 1,401&#151;only two more pupils&#151;has 
spending per pupil of £3,330, which is some £610 more per pupil. Rural areas are 
similarly affected. Balfron High School, with a roll of 881 pupils, has spending 
per head of £3,966, while Kinross High School, with a roll of 880, has spending 
per head of £3,267, which is some £699 less than Balfron High School.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16559">16559</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>In a study by the Association of Head Teachers in Scotland, it was found that 
because of the differing policies of council education directors, the budgets 
for similarly sized schools can vary by as much as £340,000. The effect of that 
variation can be found in numbers of teachers. Different staffing levels per 1,000 
pupils can result in some schools having 12 or 13 more teachers.</P><P>The total 
spending on schools can be calculated by adding local authority and Executive 
spending on education and stripping out the non-school expenditure. That figure 
has increased from £2.95 billion to £3.32 billion&#151;an increase of 8 per cent. 
For Bristow Muldoon's purposes, I tell him that I support that increase. However, 
if we examine the primary and secondary budgeted school running costs, which were 
posted on the Executive's website&#151;although the figures from last year have 
only just been updated&#151;we find that those figures have increased by 6 per 
cent. There is a 2 per cent difference between the money that was being given 
and the money that was actually being spent in schools. Despite the increase in 
spending, there was therefore a fall in the budgets for schools. Not only are 
the disparities between schools real and damaging, but the amount of money that 
is being retained by local authorities is actually growing. I hope that that is 
of concern to the Executive and to members of all parties. After all, if education 
spending is to increase, I am sure that we want the money to reach the classroom.</P><P>The 
way round that difficulty is for a greater proportion of funding to go directly 
to schools. The chancellor thinks that that method of funding is good enough for 
English schools, but our ministers have so far not applied it in Scotland. As 
the situation is getting worse, I ask the minister and the Finance Committee to 
examine those problems in the coming year and to establish whether the problem 
is the formula used by councils, the formula used by the Executive or both, so 
that we can remove that injustice from our schools.</P><P>11:21</P><P><strong>Karen 
Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab): </strong>Having been involved in the budget process 
for a number of years, I think that the information that we are receiving is getting 
better, but it is still not good enough. It certainly does not allow for sufficient 
meaningful scrutiny by committees, and I concur with the points that were made 
by my colleagues Trish Godman and Margaret Smith. If the process is to be meaningful 
and worth while, we need to adjust the timetable to allow level 3 figures to be 
available to the committees. Without those figures, we cannot have the detailed 
scrutiny that the committees would like to take part in. We would clearly be able 
to gauge what was happening by </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16560">16560</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>looking more closely at those figures.</P><P>I agree with some of Brian Monteith's 
points. We need greater transparency in the budget process, not just in the Executive 
but in local government and in the health service, so that we can monitor where 
the finances that are being committed by the Executive and by this Parliament 
are going and how they are being spent. There is an expectation, particularly 
when announcements are made in the chamber, that the money will be spent on what 
it was announced for. When that does not appear to happen back in the constituencies, 
people begin to ask questions of us. If we do not have the transparency that is 
required to monitor the process, we cannot give people the answers that they are 
looking for. We must continue to look at that.</P><P>I want to mention a couple 
of points that the Education, Culture and Sport Committee made in its contribution 
to the budget process. The first point relates to the budgets for agencies such 
as Historic Scotland. We must consider how we continue to monitor those budgets, 
because the underspends that have occurred in the grants budget in the past year, 
and which are forecast for this year, give the committee some concern. I hope 
that the Executive will ensure that that situation is kept under review.</P><P>Secondly, 
the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport is aware of the committee's concern 
about baseline funding of the arts. Although the minister has indicated that there 
are still on-going issues, it is the committee's view that there is a need for 
a fundamental review of arts funding in Scotland&#151;how that funding takes place, 
where the money goes and how the arts are supported in a meaningful way. I hope 
that, through his offices and with the minister responsible for the arts, the 
Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services will continue to hold discussions 
with all the agencies, so that we can move forward positively and productively 
for the arts in Scotland.</P><P>Thirdly, the committee very much welcomes the 
additional funding that has been given to sure start, because it has been recognised 
that early years intervention has positive consequences for children in the later 
years of their schooling.</P><P>My final point is on McCrone funding. Some local 
authorities have expressed concern that their funding package for McCrone has 
not been sufficient to meet their needs, while others have said that they can 
meet the McCrone provisions and have some money left over. I return again to the 
issue of transparency. The Minister for Education and Young People is aware of 
those concerns and discussions are continuing. I thought that it would be useful 
to raise those points in the chamber, but I do not intend to say more on that.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16561">16561</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>We welcome the opportunity to take part in the budget process, but I reiterate 
my point that, if our involvement is to be meaningful, we must have level 3 figures 
before we start the process.</P><P>11:25</P><P><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, 
Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD): </strong>The Finance Committee paid a visit 
to Skye, which was extremely well received. The number of people who came to meet, 
listen to and engage with the committee was very gratifying indeed. We heard the 
widest range of evidence. None of us was surprised to hear John Farquhar Munro 
talking about the Skye bridge tolls, but many other issues were covered. I want 
to flag up two of those issues in particular, which were of great concern at grass-roots 
level in Skye and which also apply to the north of Scotland in general.</P><P>The 
first of those issues, which has been touched on already, is roads. There is no 
doubt in my mind, and in the mind of every other right-thinking Highlander, that 
the condition of the non-trunk roads in the Highlands is gradually deteriorating. 
That could well be in spite of the best intentions of the Scottish Executive in 
channelling funds into grant-aided expenditure. I shall return to that point in 
a minute or two.</P><P>The second issue is one that I have raised before in the 
Parliament, and I make no apology for doing so again; it is the issue of less 
favoured areas. Despite the Scottish Executive upping the amount of money that 
is put into that form of agricultural subsidy, there is unfortunately a statistic 
that dictates that the crofters in some of the most marginal parts of the Highlands, 
such as Assynt in my part of the world, actually receive less grant than they 
did in the past.</P><P><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP): </strong>Does 
Jamie Stone agree that we need to look not only at LFAs but at the rural stewardship 
scheme to examine the balance that has been achieved between spending in lowland 
Scotland and spending in upland Scotland, where most of the LFA areas lie? Does 
he share my view that, in that way, we can start to make a real difference?</P><P><strong>Mr 
Stone: </strong>I do not contradict anything that Bruce Crawford says. I have 
to be quite honest and say that I have concentrated on LFAs because that is of 
particular interest in my constituency.</P><P>In striking the balance, it is important 
to get things right. Some of the most marginal crofts are losing up to £1,000 
per croft. Where there is no other form of livelihood, I am afraid that that will 
discourage people from that way of life, which will fundamentally undermine a 
particularly fragile part of Scotland. That is happening despite the fact </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16562">16562</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>that more money is going in.</P><P>Peter Peacock, Alasdair Morgan, Tom McCabe 
and I have been meeting to discuss the matter. The deputy minister put it rather 
nicely when he said that, although there is cross-cutting and joined-up thinking 
at the level of the First Minister and the Minister for Finance and Public Services, 
when the cash is fired down the tubes&#151;the silos, as Peter Peacock called 
them&#151;outcomes are not always what we might wish. That has been referred to 
by members all round the chamber.</P><P>In responding to the Finance Committee, 
Peter Peacock was beginning to explore the possibility of going in for community 
planning as a way of measuring outcomes. Quite how one would do that for 32 local 
authority areas, I do not think any of us knows yet. However, as a mechanism for 
the Executive to see whether we are achieving our objectives, it may be possible. 
The minister might care to comment further at this stage. If so, that is well 
and good. If not, because more consideration must be given to the proposal, I 
will understand that.</P><P>The one way out of the problem in my part of the world&#151;on 
the roads front and on the LFA front&#151;is to get back into European funding. 
The past is the past in terms of what happened to objective 1 funding for the 
Highlands, but in the years to come there will be other opportunities to get in 
there again. I urge and exhort the Executive and all right-thinking people to 
make the best possible case that we can for the Highlands, so that we get as much 
money as we can. I tell members from other parts of Scotland that that will also 
help budgets and increase the overall total, taking less money from their areas 
and giving more money to my crofters.</P><P>11:29</P><P><strong>Shona Robison

<P><strong>Janis Hughes (Glasgow Rutherglen) (Lab): </strong>I do not think that

to other members of the Health and Community Care Committee to take the matter 
to another committee without first discussing that with members of the Health 
and Community Care Committee.</P><P><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>What is best 
for hepatitis C sufferers is more important and must come first and foremost,

it is good that today's debate is happening, as it gives another opportunity to 
raise the issue and find a possible solution. If hepatitis C sufferers think that 
that is the case, that it is more important than what the member or anybody else 
thinks about parliamentary protocol or procedure. We should all bear that in mind.</P><P>I 
pay tribute to the expert group under Lord Ross. Its sterling work has provided 
the Health and Community Care Committee with a huge opportunity to reach a solution 
in respect of hepatitis C sufferers. It has provided a cast-iron case. Despite 
the fact that the group was appointed and given its remit by the Minister for 
Health and Community Care, its recommendation is clear. It is a little disappointing 
and somewhat disturbing that its judgment has been ignored by the minister. Experts 
who know about the subject have been asked for advice. Given that the Health and 
Community Care Committee has given a clear view on financial assistance and that 
the expert group has said that such assistance should be given, can the committee 
and the expert group be wrong and the minister right? I do not think so.</P><P><strong>Karen

Sturgeon's amendment is a practical and workable solution. It has been pointed 
out that, last year, the capital budget underspend was £111 million and it is 
possible to release those resources without any adverse effect on capital or revenue 
spend.</P><P>Some problems that have been identified are problems only if they 
are made into problems. The benefit clawback, for example, is a problem only if 
Westminster ministers decide to make it a problem. Of course, the precedent exists 
in the Macfarlane Trust for benefits to be disregarded. It would be a travesty 
of justice if Westminster ministers stood in the way of hepatitis C sufferers 
in Scotland getting financial assistance should the Scottish Parliament support 
such assistance.</P><P>Similarly, the issue of no-fault compensation does not 
arise. Lord Ross clearly said that giving financial assistance to hepatitis C 
sufferers sets no more of a dangerous precedent than that established under the 
Macfarlane Trust.</P><P>There are no insurmountable problems. Where there is a 
will, there is a way. Today, I hope that the Parliament will have the political 
will to find a way of giving the vital assistance that is required by hepatitis 
C sufferers. That can be done if members support Nicola Sturgeon's amendment.</P><P>11:36</P><P><strong>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I regret that I did not hear 
what the convener of the Finance Committee said, as I had meetings earlier this 
morning. However, I will concentrate on the provision for justice. We want the 
strongest possible priority to be given to law and order, the rule of law and 
the interests of justice. In practice, that will mean increased support for the 
justice budget.</P><P>I say that for good reasons. In &quot;Building a Better 
Scotland&quot;, crime is identified as one of the five priorities for action. 
However, the justice budget is set to decrease as a share of the Executive's total 
managed expenditure from 3.54 per cent in 2002-03 to 3.32 per cent in 2005-06.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16565">16565</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I draw the minister's attention to the recommendations of the justice committees 
at stage 1. They pointed out that justice should be given a larger share of the 
available spending, which would be consistent with crime being one of the Executive's 
five priority areas for action. The two committees also recommended increased 
provision for the prison service for 2004-05 and 2005-06 to assist with modernisation 
and for all secure accommodation to be brought under the justice department and 
to be overseen by it.</P><P>Police numbers may be marginally higher than in 1997 
but, according to &quot;Narrowing the Gap: Police visibility and public reassurance&#151;Managing 
public expectation and demand&quot;, at any one time only 138 police officers 
are walking Scotland's streets. Although the Executive has piled extra responsibilities 
on to the police, there is no indication that it has any genuine intention to 
provide the necessary increases in strength. Indeed, according to &quot;Building 
a Better Scotland&quot;, Labour and the Liberals intend to focus resources only 
on</P><P>&quot;maintaining the capacity of the police&quot;.</P><P>We want to 
do a great deal better than that.</P><P>I want to turn to funding for the courts, 
the administration of which is so overloaded that it has given rise to Lord Bonomy's 
review of the High Court system. He made the controversial recommendation that 
the 110-day rule should be amended. The Crown Office should be given the resources 
to make certain that deadlines are not missed. If the prosecution and the court 
service had been given the necessary resources, calls for the abolition of the 
110-day rule might never have been made. Through more appropriate provision, every 
effort should be made to remove the backlog of cases that are before the High 
Court and sheriff courts.</P><P>To coincide with the BBC's crime day in September, 
a survey was taken of the attitudes of more than 600 adults to crime and the police. 
The top choice that would make people feel safer was more police on the streets. 
More closed-circuit television cameras came second on the list.</P><P>The blunt 
reality is that the number of recorded crimes soared between 1997 and 2001. Drug-related 
crimes increased by 23 per cent, non-sexual crimes of violence increased by 24 
per cent and fire raising and vandalism increased by 17 per cent.</P><P>We need 
more police officers to be visible within communities and they should be backed 
up by a court system with sufficient resources to bring cases to justice within 
a reasonable time scale. There must also be enough resources to ensure that the 
courts dispose of criminals appropriately, that the prison service rehabilitates 
them, and that </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16566">16566</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the youth justice system provides outcomes that will discourage and prevent 
young offenders from re-offending. In short, we want more police and fiscals, 
and more resources for the courts and our justice system. We will go on campaigning 
for a better deal for people until we get it. I emphasise to the minister that 
those recommendations come not only from me, but from the justice committees. 
We call for strong policies on crime. Our purpose is to reclaim the streets for 
the law-abiding majority by tackling all ends of the justice system.</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>We come now to closing speeches. The normal 
running order has been disrupted slightly by the impact of the amendment and counter-amendment. 
I call first Keith Harding, who has six minutes.</P><P>11:40</P><P><strong>Mr 
Keith Harding (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>The debate has been interesting 
and informative. However, I want to concentrate on and highlight the concerns 
of the Local Government Committee when it considered stage 2 of the 2003-04 budget 
process. Like Trish Godman, the convener of the Local Government Committee, I 
am pleased that the Executive took on board the committee's recommendation that, 
when the Executive determined the settlement for local government, it should address 
the implication for councils of the increase in employers' national insurance 
contributions. That increase was fully funded. The move to a prudential framework 
for capital investment will give councils more flexibility, but the framework 
will enable councils to make significant inroads into the backlog of capital investment 
only if it is matched by adequate levels of revenue funding. I ask the minister 
to address that issue in summing up.</P><P>One area of great concern to councils 
that has not been addressed is how the Executive presents the local government 
settlement. The minister proudly announced a £586 million&#151;or 8.68 per cent&#151;increase 
in aggregate external finance over the 2002-03 figures and stated that, in his 
view, it was a &quot;fair but challenging settlement.&quot; Then councils had 
to raise council tax by more than double the rate of inflation and make cuts in 
front-line services. That does not add up or make sense for the electorate as 
they struggle to pay more in council tax while getting less in return.</P><P>The 
Executive must be more honest and transparent and break down the increase to show 
what new additional moneys are being allocated, rather than the mainstream Executive 
priorities from previous years and the funding for new burdens imposed from the 
centre. COSLA believes that once that so-called non-discretionary expenditure 
is stripped away, the year-on-year increase is only 2.5 per cent and core services 
are </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16567">16567</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>being underfunded by £440 million over the full three years of the 2002 spending 
review. The minister rejected that view, but it appears to be borne out by councils' 
actions. Why do councils have to cut services and increase council tax, if the 
settlement is as generous as claimed?</P><P>Trish Godman described the Local Government 
Committee's inability, because of a lack of information from the Executive, to 
come to any conclusion on the funding level. Karen Gillon, the convener of the 
Education, Culture and Sport Committee, supported that view. Karen Gillon has 
reacted to mention of her name, but I inform her that it is all right&#151;I was 
not being rude to her. Tom McCabe, whom I welcome to his new post, expressed concerns 
regarding the education budget and triple accounting. Margaret Smith, the convener 
of the Health and Community Care Committee, also pointed out the difficulties 
in identifying true new moneys in the health budget. I am pleased that the Finance 
Committee will pursue the issue of the lack of information with the Executive. 
David Davidson and others also raised that issue, but the minister did not mention 
the issue in his opening address. It would be interesting if he gave his views, 
instead of continuing to skirt around a serious concern that is continually raised 
but consistently ignored.</P><P>I commend the Finance Committee for its comprehensive 
report and I look forward to the Executive responding positively to its recommendations, 
particularly in relation to cumulative accounting and the provision of better 
level 3 spending details at an early time in the budget process.</P><P>11:45</P><P><strong>Iain 
Smith (North-East Fife) (LD): </strong>I must disagree with David Davidson's comment 
that three hours is too long for the debate, because the debate is about £23 billion 
of public spending of taxpayers' money on public services. Surely the Parliament 
should be giving that matter proper attention. The debate seems too long to the 
Opposition because it never proposes any alternative ideas for the budget. The 
debate is not about the budget process, but about the draft budget&#151;that is 
what we are dealing with.</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></P><P><strong>Iain 
Smith: </strong>I will not give way on that particular point.</P><P>It is disappointing 
that this last opportunity before the last budget bill prior to the election&#151;</P><P><strong>Mr

Smith: </strong>No, it refers not to the budget process, but to stage 2 of the 
budget process, </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16568">16568</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>which, I think Mr Harding will find, is the draft budget. We are debating the 
last draft budget before the election, but the Opposition parties will still not 
tell the Scottish Parliament or, more important, the Scottish electorate what 
they would do differently. That is a disgrace.</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>I 
wonder whether we will now hear from Mr Smith the layout of the Liberal Democrats' 
policy, because they apparently consider themselves a separate party from Labour.</P><P><strong>Iain 
Smith: </strong>We are part of the Executive that is proposing this budget. We 
will, of course, be standing in the election as a separate party. If our manifesto 
has different policies that require budgeting, we will explain those changes at 
that time. The Opposition has not proposed a single alternative budget proposal&#151;apart 
from Nicola Sturgeon's one&#151;for the past three and a half years. That is appalling, 
and if the electorate will bear that in mind&#151;</P><P><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> 
<em>rose&#151;</em></P><P><strong>Iain Smith: </strong>I am sorry, but I need 
to make some progress.</P><P>The Conservative's basic policy, of course, is to 
spend more money on roads but at the same time cut money on taxes. They will not 
say where they would find the money to spend on roads or where they would cut 
public services, such as schools and hospitals, in order to fund their proposed 
tax cuts. I will return to the SNP later, when summing up on the amendments.</P><P>On 
the Finance Committee report, I cannot add much to what Trish Godman said in relation 
to the local government budget. The Finance Committee's report perhaps slightly 
misinterpreted the points that the Local Government Committee was trying to make. 
Paragraph 33 of the report states:</P><P>&quot;The Executive's assumption of how 
much should be spent on key services should be set out in the budget&quot;.</P><P>What 
we are looking for is a clear definition of how the Executive builds up its priorities 
and how it determines its budgets. We want to know the Executive's assumptions 
about the expected outputs of local government and the health service from those 
budgets. It is not for the Executive to determine how that money is spent, but 
for local government to say transparently, &quot;We have been given money for 
this service, but we think that the local priorities&quot;&#151;which Brian Monteith 
seems to think are not important&#151;&quot;are actually something slightly different 
and we will spend the money differently.&quot; If we had more information from 
the Executive, then at least the public, the Local Government Committee and the 
Parliament would </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16569">16569</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>be able to judge whether the Executive or local government was right. It is 
important that we get that sorted out in future.</P><P>I will now consider the 
SNP. Brian Adam said that is was difficult to come up with amendments. Well, it 
certainly appears to be difficult for the SNP to come up with amendments, because 
it never does so. However, it does seem perfectly capable of coming up with spending 
commitment after spending commitment without once telling us how it will pay for 
them. In the past month alone there have been about eight or nine new SNP spending 
commitments. I will not talk about the millions that the SNP has committed over 
the years. For example, on 12 December, the SNP commitment was to additional social 
workers; on 11 December, it was to more pay for nurses; on 10 December, it was 
to more money for Inverness airport; and on 9 December, it was to more police. 
That was an expensive time because there was also a commitment to smaller class 
sizes and more money for children's hearings on 9 December. On 3 December, the 
commitment was to more pay for dentists. However, not once has the SNP indicated 
how it would pay for any of those commitments.</P><P><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: 
</strong>I apologise because I cannot remember the exact date, but I seem to recall 
that a couple of months ago the Liberal Democrats published a pre-manifesto document. 
Can Iain Smith tell us what was in that document and whether anything in it would 
require a change in the Executive's budget plans? If so, why are there no Liberal 
Democrat amendments to the motion that we are debating?</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_15"></A>Iain 
Smith: </strong>I would love to read the Liberal Democrats' priorities for government 
on to the record during the debate, but I do not think that the Presiding Officer 
will give me the time to do so. I will be happy to do so at some future date, 
if the Presiding Officer will give me a commitment that I can do so.</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>If you can do it in a minute and a half, I 
do not mind.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_17"></A>Iain Smith: </strong>It 
takes a bit longer.</P><P>The SNP, rather than telling us how it would pay for 
its commitments, is promising more tax cuts, which is rather strange. The SNP's 
budgets do not add up.</P><P>I was interested in Shona Robison's comments about 
expert groups. I seem to recollect that the Cubie committee wanted a £3,500 graduate 
endowment. We said that that was far too much and that the figure should be cut 
to £2,500. I presume that the SNP still supports the Cubie proposal of £3,500.</P><P>I 
also do not recollect the SNP ever supporting </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16570">16570</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the recommendations of the expert group called the Advisory Committee on Releases 
to the Environment. In fact, it criticised that group at all times. It seems that 
expert groups are acceptable only when they do what the SNP wants them to do, 
not when they come up with something that the SNP does not like. We are the politicians 
and we make decisions based on the advice of the expert groups. Running the country 
is the job of politicians, not expert groups.</P><P>It is typical of the SNP that 
it has focused on only a small part of the budget. The party has ignored 99.99 
per cent of the budget, choosing to examine £13 million out of £23 billion. As 
usual, the party is jumping on various bandwagons, looking for cheap headlines. 
Shona Robison's claim that the only people who matter are sufferers of hepatitis 
C is a nonsense. This budget is about everybody in this country&#151;it is about 
our hospitals, the police, the fire service and other services.</P><P>The SNP 
says that it has given details of how its proposals would be paid for but, in 
fact, it has said that it will make cuts in one budget line without saying what 
the implications of that reduction would be. It would mean that there was £20 
million less to invest in capital in our hospitals. Which hospital will bear the 
brunt of that cut? I hope that it is not the one in St Andrews. There would be 
£25 million less for our local authorities to spend on capital projects. Which 
schools would not be modernised? There would be £6 million less to spend on our 
transport infrastructure. Which road improvements would not be carried out? The 
ones on the Mallaig road, which the SNP has called for? Which rail projects would 
not be undertaken? The Borders rail link and the Glasgow and Edinburgh airport 
links, which the SNP has also called for? The SNP does not tell us that, nor does 
it tell us what would be hit worst by the £13 million that would be cut from the 
water investment plans. Which water treatment plant outside Glasgow might have 
to be closed? Nor does the SNP talk about the £2 million cuts in the police service 
budget, the £1.5 million cuts in the fire service budget, the £2 million cuts 
in the prison service budget or the £2 million cuts in the further education colleges 
budget. The SNP only makes promise after promise without telling us how they will 
be paid for.</P><P>11:52</P><P><strong>Alasdair Morgan (Galloway and Upper Nithsdale) 
(SNP): </strong>The Finance Committee debate always occurs at the climactic parliamentary 
meeting of the year. On this occasion&#151;rather unexpectedly, otherwise we would 
have a higher attendance rate&#151;we have the bonus of two speeches from Peter 
Peacock. Earlier, Peter </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16571">16571</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Peacock referred to the total lack of visitors in the gallery, but I see that 
since then, in mathematical terms at least, the number has infinitely increased 
to two.</P><P>Unusually, the nation's press was interested in the Finance Committee's 
report. It was interesting to see the spins that were put on the report by various 
newspapers. Predictably, <em>The Scotsman</em> went with the cumulative accounting 
story and gave its story the headline:</P><P>&quot;Ministers told to end budget 
figures spin&quot;.</P><P>The <em>Daily Mail</em> managed to get another spin 
on that story, focusing on the fact that Tom McCabe is the convener of the committee 
and giving its story the headline:</P><P>&quot;Sacked minister attacks Executive&quot;.</P><P>That 
was a good headline, I thought.</P><P>I will now deal with some of the committee's 
recommendations. Although the visit to Skye was not quite the junket that John 
Farquhar Munro made it out to be, we were struck by the fact, to which the report 
alludes, that there has been only an 8 per cent growth in traffic over the bridge 
since it opened. Most of us thought that such a huge improvement in the transport 
infrastructure of the area would have brought with it a much greater growth in 
traffic. That needs to be investigated. Regardless of that, however, the bridge 
remains the biggest single issue among businesses and people that we talked to 
on the island.</P><P>On the recommendations that the committee makes with regard 
to the Holyrood project, I hope that when that building is ready&#151;and I hope 
that it is a building of which generations of Scots can be proud&#151;we will 
open it with a simple and dignified ceremony. We do not need what would be portrayed 
by the media as a junket.</P><P>The committee was concerned about the building 
itself. At our meeting earlier this week, several members expressed the view that, 
while most projects seem to get more certain with regard to time and cost as they 
near their end, the exact opposite situation is developing in relation to Holyrood. 
It is no wonder that there is significant disenchantment among the public, to 
the detriment of the Scottish Parliament rather than those who landed us with 
this project.</P><P>The recommendation that the Executive assure businesses that 
their rates bills will not rise above inflation was made because of the projections 
in the budget that non-domestic rates income would increase substantially over 
the three-year period of the budget. The minister gave us a complex explanation 
about how, as all appeals were turned down, more money would come in as the back 
payments were made. However, there was also the usual ministerial explanation 
about why </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16572">16572</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Scottish businesses were not being disadvantaged by the fact that our uniform 
business rate is higher. The explanation that we are given, of course, is that 
our rateable values are lower than English ones, so the outcome is the same. That 
assumes, however, that the basis of valuation is the same north and south of the 
border, but there are certain cases where that is not so. For example, in relation 
to pubs, petrol stations and so on, turnover, not assessed rental, is the basis 
for rateable value. Given that the turnover of comparable businesses will be the 
same on both sides of the border&#151;or higher in Scotland, in the case of petrol 
stations, as the price of petrol is often higher in some parts of Scotland&#151;rate 
payments will be higher north of the border. I would also point out that, because 
of the different basis of valuation, one or two-star hotels that are too highly 
valued to benefit from the Government discount to those with a small rateable 
value will have to pay higher rates than similar establishments in England. Tony 
McRitchie, who is a caterer and hotel keeper and a spokesman for the Royal Institute 
of Chartered Surveyors, says:</P><P>&quot;Currently, it is my estimate that such 
hotels, as a result of the separate Scottish valuation scheme, produce values 
10% to 15% higher than for equivalent hotels in England and Wales.&quot;</P><P>Such 
hotels are paying much more than equivalent businesses south of the border because 
they have a higher rateable value and a higher uniform business rate. The minister 
must examine those discrepancies and say what he is going to do about the problem.</P><P>On 
the matter of cumulative accounting, the minister may well be mathematically correct&#151;in 
fact, I am sure that he is&#151;but those figures are used for one purpose alone: 
to make the Executive appear better. They are mathematically correct but presentationally 
dishonest. It is the unanimous view of the committee that cumulative accounting 
should stop. It is not a party political matter. The minister should at last do 
the decent thing and give way on the matter.</P><P>On the increases in expenditure, 
the committee has welcomed the growth in the Scottish budget. However, we stress 
that we need value for money. In that context, it is what we get out of the budget 
and whether the targets that are set are met that is important, rather than the 
total amount of money. It is disappointing, therefore, that quite a few of the 
targets in the budget are vague and unquantifiable. For example, the first target 
under objective 1 of the transport section is to</P><P>&quot;Reduce the time taken 
to undertake trunk road journeys on congested/heavily trafficked sections of the 
network by 2006.&quot;</P><P>What does that mean? By how much will the times be 
reduced? I lodged a question to ask what </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16573">16573</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>statistics would form the basis for an assessment of whether that target was 
being met, but the reply informed me that no statistics that directly cover journey 
times are available and that data collection will commence in the spring or summer 
of 2003. That means that we have a target, but no statistics to measure it with 
and that, when we decide what the statistics should be, we will not start collecting 
them until the summer of next year. In future, those statistics might give us 
a good basis on which to set a target, but we should not now set targets that 
cannot be validated.</P><P>Jamie Stone mentioned less favoured areas, so I will 
give another example. Target 8 for the environment and rural development department 
is to</P><P>&quot;Encourage more sustainable agricultural activity on 13,500 farm 
businesses in Scotland's remote hills by 2006.&quot;</P><P>Again, I lodged a question 
with a view to finding out what that means and how it would be decided that the 
target of encouraging more sustainable agricultural activity had been met. Effectively, 
the answer says, &quot;Well, we are paying support to 13,500 farms. That must 
be encouraging activity.&quot; That is to confuse the means with the end. The 
Executive cannot prove that that target is being met either. We have many unmeasurable 
targets. The budget is getting better, but we still need much more definition 
on some of the targets.</P><P>I welcome Nicola Sturgeon's amendment. It is important 
that we establish the principle that we are engaged in a budget process in which 
individual members, not acting on party advantage, can try to amend the budget 
constructively. If that develops in future years, that will be good.</P><P>To 
call the process a budget process is a misnomer. As Mr Peacock knows, it is not 
even half a budget process. We deal with virtually none of Scotland's income, 
except for non-domestic rates, and only a proportion of its expenditure. We deal 
with nothing that has to do with social security, for example. Until we have all 
the levers of Scotland's budget in our hands, we will never realise Scotland's 
potential.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I now call on

<P>I will pick up on various points that were made during the debate. Trish Godman, 
Mary Scanlon, Tom McCabe, Karen Gillon and other members made a number of points 
about the nature of the block allocations that we make to the health service and 
to local government. At the heart of that matter is something that we have yet 
to reconcile as a new set of democratic institutions in Scotland: the relationship 
between the centre, which is the Scottish Government, and our local delivery agents&#151;democratically 
elected local authorities and the health service.</P><P>We constantly try to illuminate 
the funding that goes to those sectors. We have undertaken to give the Local Government 
Committee more information about the assumptions that underlie the budgetary decisions 
in the way that Iain Smith described. In turn, we will give that information to 
the Finance Committee.</P><P>Because of the concerns that some people have expressed 
and because of our concerns about the issues that have been raised, we are also 
moving to construct better outcome agreements with our partners to ensure that 
we work towards shared targets. That is why we are increasing the Accounts Commission 
of Scotland's powers on local government, why we are doing better auditing throughout 
the system and why inspection systems are more robust than in the past on local 
authority works and certain aspects of local authority work.</P><P>However, we 
must reconcile that with the fact, which we must continue to recognise, that we 
must give local discretion to allow decisions to be exercised in tune with the 
needs of those communities. We must continue to work at those relationships over 
time. Nonetheless, I hope that we are making progress on that.</P><P>Trish Godman 
also raised points on local government input into the budget process. I am glad 
to say that, this year, we have substantially revised the way in which we involve 
local government in the spending review. A series of meetings between local government 
representatives and ministers took place to help inform our discussions of how 
the spending review could move forward. We plan to continue and strengthen that 
partnership over time.</P><P>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton made some points about 
the justice budget. There is a point of principle in what he said with which I 
cannot agree. He said that, unless, each year, we increase the budget for any 
part of the Executive's activity by more than the average, we are not regarding 
that part of our activity as a priority. That cannot be correct in principle.</P><P>I 
will take the police service as an example. As Lord James indicated when he spoke, 
we have </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16575">16575</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>record numbers of police in Scotland. The fact that we maintain those record 
numbers of police and try to make progress will create a statistical effect that 
means that, in percentage terms, that budget will not rise as high as other parts 
of the budget, such as health, in which we are crying out to grow the budget. 
That does not mean that policing is any less of a priority. We are securing that 
priority into the future. Also in the justice service, we have substantially increased 
the resources that are going into the Crown Office to address the problems that 
have been identified for us.</P><P>David Davidson made some spurious points about 
broadband and a number of other points about the budget report. I wonder whether 
he has read the budget. Apart from other initiatives that we are taking, only 
two weeks ago Iain Gray announced significant new investment in broadband infrastructure 
in Scotland to try to stimulate that marketplace. The pathfinder projects in the 
Highlands and Islands&#151;and in the south of Scotland&#151;are also trying to 
make progress on broadband.</P><P>On the Skye bridge, I am glad that John Farquhar 
Munro acknowledged that the Executive will ensure that Skye bridge users will 
not have to pay higher tolls as a result of the European judgment on the application 
of value-added tax to tolls. Alasdair Morgan and others mentioned growth. Skye 
is one of the most successful communities in the Highlands and Islands. The population 
of Skye has grown for, I think, the fourth decade in a row. The bridge has not 
been an impediment to the economy of Skye. Skye has prospered while other parts 
of the Highlands and Islands have struggled.</P><P>I have some sympathy with Alasdair 
Morgan's points on targets. I am glad that he acknowledged that we have made substantial 
progress on that. We have made very significant progress in defining targets. 
However, in some areas&#151;Alasdair Morgan touched on a number of them in his 
astute analysis&#151;we must go still further in trying to establish better targets 
and better monitoring. That is in the Executive's interest as much as it is in 
the Parliament's interest. We plan to make progress on that.</P><P><strong>Mary 
Scanlon: </strong>I still do not get the feeling that the minister will do something 
positive to monitor and audit local authority spending, particularly on free personal 
care and mental health services. The Executive has allocated £79 million to tackle 
delayed discharge over four years. However, in a parliamentary answer, Frank McAveety 
says:</P><P>&quot;It is not possible to extract from total discharge numbers those 
discharges funded directly&quot;</P><P>from the £79 million. You are not making 
an effort to hold local government accountable for </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16576">16576</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>implementation and spending.</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>We are trying 
seriously to work and move forward with local government. That is why I referred 
to agreeing joint outcome statements about what we are trying to achieve with 
local government, but leaving the methods of achieving those outcomes much more 
freely available to local authorities to make choices to suit their local circumstances.</P><P>We 
must remember that local councillors are democratically elected and are accountable 
for their actions at that local level. We must find a balance between the rights 
of the centre&#151;the Parliament and the Executive&#151;to expect certain things 
and the local flexibilities that are required. We still have work to do on that, 
but we are trying to work our way through it.</P><P>Jamie Stone raised questions 
about European funding for the Highlands and Islands and in Scotland more widely. 
He can be assured that, as we move forward in a greatly changed landscape in Europe, 
we will continue to fight hard Scotland's corner on funding and that, within Scotland, 
we will also fight the Highlands and lslands' corner.</P><P><strong>Mr Stone: 
</strong>I accept and welcome what the minister has just said. Would that include 
co-ordinating work with the Highland Council, other relevant local authorities 
and the Scottish Enterprise network?</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Absolutely. 
In fact, I had meetings with those organisations in the past week about those 
issues.</P><P>I was intrigued that Alasdair Morgan invited us from the Scottish 
National Party front bench to follow English valuation practices. That is a helpful 
precedent for the SNP to follow. A huge effort goes into harmonising valuation 
north and south of the border and has done for many years. That continues to progress 
and helps to find a level playing field.</P><P><strong>Alasdair Morgan: </strong>I 
agree. However, the more that the Executive tries to harmonise valuation north 
and south of the border, the sillier it is to have a different uniform business 
rate north of the border.</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>I do not agree 
with that. The point is that we seek harmonisation in valuation practices north 
and south of the border. Alasdair Morgan himself described why rates north and 
south of the border cost the same when we multiply the poundage by the valuation. 
That is the critical point.</P><P>Nicola Sturgeon, Fergus Ewing, Mary Scanlon, 
Shona Robison, Janis Hughes and others made points on hepatitis C. The Finance 
Committee considered the issues carefully and rejected Nicola Sturgeon's suggestion 
for good reasons. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16577">16577</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Those reasons have not changed during the past two weeks.</P><P>There is no 
painless way of finding additional funding for the scheme. Nicola Sturgeon suggested 
reducing the departmental expenditure limits capital budget by 2 per cent in the 
three years from 2003-04 to 2005-06 to find an additional £89 million. There is 
no single DEL capital budget from which we can take that money. Instead, there 
are capital budgets for transport, health, education and all the other portfolios 
in the Executive.</P><P><strong>Brian Adam </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></P><P><strong>Peter 
Peacock: </strong>I will not give way; I must make progress.</P><P>To reduce all 
those capital budgets would mean spending less on hospitals, roads, schools and 
other projects. We have capital budgets for a reason. We must accept that reducing 
those budgets by 2 per cent would affect the improvements that we want to make 
to our schools, hospitals and roads. Nowhere does Nicola Sturgeon set out which 
of those budgets should be cut.</P><P>Which are the planned roads, hospitals and 
schools that will be removed from the programme? In which constituencies and communities 
will that happen? Nicola Sturgeon has tried to make a virtue of the fact that 
she does not seek to take the money from the health budget; it therefore has to 
come from somewhere else. Will it mean less spending on secure accommodation, 
on which her colleague Roseanna Cunningham asked a few weeks ago that more money 
be spent? Will it come from recycling, for which her colleague Bruce Crawford 
asked for more money last week? Will it come from flood prevention, for which 
Margaret Ewing asked for more money? Those are the real choices of Government. 
Nowhere is there an indication of where those moneys will come from.</P><P><strong>Nicola 
Sturgeon: </strong>If the minister does not think that my proposal is supportable, 
can he tell us from where in the budget he would suggest taking the money, bearing 
it in mind that although his colleague, the Minister for Health and Community 
Care, does not accept in full the recommendations of the expert group, he has 
said that he will compensate some sufferers? From where will the Executive take 
the money?</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Nicola Sturgeon will get the 
answer to the generality of that point as I move forward in what I have to say.</P><P>It 
is not only a question of the cash. Other issues surround the creation of any 
ex gratia compensation scheme. We want to avoid a position where we provide financial 
support that </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16578">16578</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>leads to social security payments&#151;as members have commented on&#151;being 
withdrawn or reduced. There is no point in sufferers receiving more money from 
the Executive if they simultaneously receive less money in benefits as a result 
of our changes. In addition, as the Finance Committee acknowledges, the recent 
report on hepatitis C raises issues of no-fault compensation; those need to be 
resolved. We hope to make progress on those issues so that we can get on with 
the task of helping the people who need support the most. That aim is shared by 
all members of the Parliament.</P><P>I am over time, Presiding Officer, so I will 
conclude.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> The minister has 
taken a lot of interventions, so if he has more to say, he can continue.</P><P><strong>Peter 
Peacock: </strong>I am more than happy to keep going because I would like to say 
a few things.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>We have a couple 
of minutes in hand.</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>In that case I will 
turn my attention&#151;</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Will Peter Peacock 
give way?</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>No. I will not take any more interventions.</P><P>I 
will now discuss the rest of what the SNP has not said on this occasion. It has 
taken a remarkable period of time for the SNP to discover that it can move changes 
to the Scottish budget, yet it has chosen to do so in only one case. What happened 
to all the other matters that we have been hearing promises about over recent 
weeks? The report that we are discussing deals with not only the coming financial 
year, but a three-year time horizon&#151;almost the whole life of the coming Parliament&#151;yet 
there is not a single proposal to deal with all the SNP's budget promises. Where 
is the amendment from the SNP to provide the cash to meet John Swinney's £450 
million commitment to dual the A9? It is not here. Where is the amendment to give 
local government the £411 million that Tricia Marwick promised two weeks ago? 
It is not here. Where is the amendment to provide the extra cash that Mike Russell 
wants to go into the McCrone settlement? It is not here. Where is the amendment 
to provide the extra money for roads that Alasdair Morgan called for on 4 March? 
It is not here. Where is the amendment to provide the extra road bypasses that 
Margaret Ewing asked for a few weeks ago? It is not here.</P><P><strong>Shona 
Robison: </strong>Will Peter Peacock give way?</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>No.

<P>money to universities that Andrew Wilson called for in January past? It is 
not here either. Where is the amendment to give nurses even more money, which 
Nicola Sturgeon asked for in August? It is not here either.</P><P>There are no 
proposals to back up the empty promises that the SNP distribute all over Scotland 
week in and week out. There is no substance to support the SNP's rhetoric. Those 
are the actions of an irresponsible and reckless opposition, which is prepared 
to promise anything to buy a few votes in the coming election, but is unprepared 
to use the powers, practices and processes that this Parliament has to make the 
practical changes that it claims that it wants.</P><P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick 
(Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Lab): </strong>Will Peter Peacock give way?</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>No.</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>It 
is no wonder that the Scottish people do not trust the SNP and it is no wonder 
that they will not trust the SNP in future.</P><P>12:14</P><P><strong>Elaine Thomson 
(Aberdeen North) (Lab): </strong>The debate brings us to the end of stage 2 of 
this year's budget process. It has been an interesting morning. Thoughtful contributions 
have been made by many members&#151;even those who were out late last night.</P><P>This 
is the third full year of the complete budget cycle. The cycle continues to grow 
and develop for the benefit of the people of Scotland. Although further progress 
is required on some aspects of the budget process, we should not lose sight of 
the significant difference in both the quality and quantity of financial data 
that are now available in Scotland. An increasing range of people, both inside 
and outside the Parliament, are taking part in the budget process. The minister 
referred to what the Scottish Executive is doing in respect of public consultations 
and discussions with COSLA. Each individual committee and the Finance Committee 
also speak to many more people. All those who have taken part in stage 2 of the 
budget process should be commended.</P><P>I welcome Tom McCabe to his post as 
the new Finance Committee convener and I wish Des McNulty, who oversaw the earlier 
part of this year's budget process, success in his new ministerial role. The adviser 
to the Finance Committee, Professor Arthur Midwinter, has continued to help and 
advise us effectively, for which we are grateful. I thank the clerks to the Finance 
Committee and members of the Scottish Parliament information centre, who are crucial 
to the success of the budget process.</P><P>As members have mentioned, the committee

<P>went to Skye this year. I am pleased to hear from John Farquhar Munro and Jamie 
Stone that the workshops at which we spoke to local people about important issues 
and the visit generally were well received by the people of Skye. Such visits 
continue to be a positive move. It is clear that the Skye bridge is a major issue, 
so I am pleased to hear the minister's comments on freezing tolls and on the success 
of Skye's economy.</P><P>This year, we had the welcome addition of funds from 
the 2002 spending review, which has resulted in unprecedented growth in the Scottish 
budget. The draft budget shows that, by 2005-06, the budget will have increased 
by 14.4 per cent in real terms, which will allow around £1 billion of extra expenditure 
in each year of the three-year plan. I reiterate the statement in the Finance 
Committee's report that that measure will result in the highest sustained real 
growth in the Scottish budget since 1975. The report recognises and welcomes the 
significant growth in the coming three-year period.</P><P>Various members mentioned 
what that growth will mean for individual areas. Bristow Muldoon mentioned the 
extra investment in transport&#151;22 new trains were announced this week&#151;and 
Karen Gillon referred to the extra funding for the sure start programme, which 
will give Scottish children a better start in life. The committee is concerned 
that the extra resources should be used effectively and that value for money should 
be sought. I welcome the minister's assurance that best value will always be sought 
in spending decisions.</P><P>Members have mentioned the Executive's cumulative 
accounting in the presentation of the budget increases, which, the committee feels, 
can be misleading. However, the committee welcomes the progress that has been 
made on the presentation of the budget documents. As the Finance Committee and 
the subject committees have recognised, that significant improvement helps to 
facilitate scrutiny. I note Karen Gillon's comments on timetabling issues and 
the level of detail that is available at different stages. Other members have 
mentioned the fact that we require further development on inputs and outputs and 
relating objectives.</P><P>The minister mentioned the technical notes, which have 
been made available for the first time and which broaden and deepen the available 
information. When, as in this year, there is lots of new spending, the committee 
would like to be able to distinguish between baseline spending and new spending. 
I welcome the minister's commitment to work closely with the committee to develop 
that process.</P><P>Cross-cutting issues are increasingly important. The budget 
is laid out on a departmental basis, but as various members have mentioned, a 
cross-</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16581">16581</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>cutting approach might provide more information. Jamie Stone made that point 
in relation to rural issues. The point has been recognised and, for the first 
time, the Executive has published cross-cutting reports, such as &quot;Closing 
the Opportunity Gap: Scottish Budget for 2003-2006&quot;. We look forward to that 
approach being developed in future.</P><P>This year, around £175 million has been 
distributed through EYF: £78 million has gone to the Scottish Executive's key 
priorities of health, education, crime, transport and jobs; and a further £95 
million has gone to local authorities for developments in the local environment 
and for children. The committee welcomes the improvements in EYF presentation, 
but we would like more clarity about which moneys are available for reallocation. 
It should be possible to see clearly money that has been allocated for projects, 
which is not being used immediately but which will be used later, and money that 
is completely available because the expenditure that was originally planned is 
no longer required.</P><P>The Equal Opportunities Committee continues to experience 
frustration with the budget process. There is a clear desire among all members 
to see progress on equal opportunities. It is suggested that further discussions 
between the Equal Opportunities Committee and the Scottish Executive should take 
place so that a working definition of gender-based analysis can be agreed and 
can be used by the Finance Committee and others. It would also be useful if a 
report was produced on equal opportunities, which would perhaps be similar to 
some of the cross-cutting reports.</P><P>Recommendations have been made by committees 
and individuals, and the Finance Committee has welcomed the first proposal for 
budget reallocation from an individual MSP. However, the committee has made it 
clear that we cannot progress Nicola Sturgeon's proposal. I am glad that Ms Sturgeon 
recognises the Finance Committee's concerns about her proposal, and I note the 
comments of the Health and Community Care Committee and the work that it is carrying 
out.</P><P>The justice committees felt some unhappiness about their share of the 
budget, given the fact that tackling crime is one of the Executive's priorities. 
I note the minister's comments on that area and the fact that extra resources 
are now going to the police and the Crown Office.</P><P>Margaret Smith and Trish 
Godman raised issues of concern to the Health and Community Care Committee and 
the Local Government Committee. Both committees are scrutinising the budgets of 
large organisations that get block grants, and there are still difficulties in 
understanding what </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16582">16582</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>happens to the money. Further discussions need to go ahead to make the process 
a bit more transparent. Nonetheless, Trish Godman highlighted one of the successes 
of the current budget process: the Local Government Committee raised concerns 
about the increase in the level of national insurance for local government and 
the matter was dealt with positively by the Executive. I note the minister's comments 
on that issue and look forward to hearing what the committees have to say on that 
in future years.</P><P>Several members have discussed the issues surrounding the 
Holyrood building and the SPCB budget. Members of the SPCB appeared before the 
Finance Committee again earlier this week, as we were not happy with some of their 
remarks at an earlier appearance before the committee. The committee is unhappy 
with the degree of uncertainty that continues to exist around the cost and the 
completion date of the Parliament building, and we look forward to receiving more 
up-to-date information from the SPCB in January.</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>I 
wonder whether the member shares the disappointment of the rest of the Finance 
Committee that the minister has failed to give us an assurance about cumulative 
accounting. That is the one aspect of the report that she seems to have skipped 
over. Does she share our concerns?</P><P><strong>Elaine Thomson: </strong>I think 
that I touched on cumulative accounting earlier, and the matter has been discussed 
fully this morning. I am sure that we will continue to discuss the best methods 
of presenting financial figures over time.</P><P>Despite having reservations in 
certain areas, the Finance Committee recognises and welcomes the fact that the 
budget represents sustained growth in public services, which will impact positively 
on lives throughout Scotland. We also welcome the fact that the opportunities 
to scrutinise the Scottish budget will continue to grow, to the benefit of democracy 
and good governance.</P><P>I commend the report to Parliament.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16583">16583</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

standards commissioner. We now seek the Parliament's approval for the other recommendations 
in that report on private legislation, temporary conveners and the journal of 
the Scottish Parliament.</P><P>As well as constituting a tidying exercise, the 
private legislation changes clarify the deadline for lodging objections and make 
it clear that no further fee is payable for reintroduced private bills.</P><P>The 
proposed temporary convener changes will result in committees being able to appoint 
a temporary convener if both convener and deputy convener are unavailable, for 
which standing orders do not provide at the moment.</P><P>The journal of the Parliament

to clarify that it should contain the dates of publication of committee reports, 
the details of each bill that is introduced and the minutes of meetings of the

number of working days available for the processing of answers to parliamentary 
questions that arises from public holidays and days when the office of the clerk 
is closed. Instead of 14 days, the Executive will have 10 working days or, to 
use a more accurate expression, counting days&#151;days when the office of the 
clerk is open&#151;in which to lodge an answer to a written question. As the change 
will not lengthen the period for answering questions, it will not disadvantage 
members.</P><P>The second recommendation seeks to reduce the potential for holding 
answers, by extending the period for lodging written questions immediately before 
recesses of four or more days from one week to two weeks. At present, the deadline 
for answering written questions that are lodged in the second week before the 
summer recess falls in the first week of the parliamentary recess, when many Executive 
staff are on leave. That can lead to more holding answers. We hope that the proposed 
measure will help to avoid that.</P><P>The third recommendation seeks to clarify 
that junior Scottish ministers should be permitted to answer written questions.</P><P>The 
fourth recommendation in the committee's sixth report relates to the language 
in which public petitions are submitted. Following a report by parliamentary officials 
and the endorsement of the Presiding Officer, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
Body and the Public Petitions Committee, we recommend that the Parliament should 
accept public petitions in any language and that appropriate arrangements should 
be made for translation.</P><P>Finally, the recommendations of the committee's

change that will allow the Audit Committee to consider any report that the Auditor

Minister for Health and Community Care (Malcolm Chisholm): </strong>All NHS Scotland 
staff have received above-inflation increases in each of the past four years, 
with the highest awards targeted at the lowest paid. A new contract for doctors 
in training has been implemented and we are working with the British Medical Association 
to take forward the new consultant contract. Talks on a new pay system for all 
non-medical national health service staff throughout the United Kingdom have also 
been concluded and the Executive is fully involved in UK talks on a new general 
medical service contract for general practitioners.</P><P><strong>Bristow Muldoon: 
</strong>Discussions have been taking place on improving the pay and conditions 
of the poorest-paid staff in the NHS. Does the minister believe that it will be 
possible for that improvement to be achieved earlier than the target date of October 
2004? Does he agree that Labour's commitment to improving the pay of the poorest-paid 
staff in the NHS represents its commitment to improving the pay and the lives 
of many of the poorest-paid workers in the country?</P><P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: 
</strong>We have a particular commitment to increasing the lowest levels of pay 
in the health service. While the agenda for change should, in general, start in 
2004&#151;although it will be subject to the agreement of the unions following 
a ballot&#151;we are keen to start the new minimum wage before that. That, too, 
will require the support and approval of the unions, but if they agree to it&#151;the 
next key meeting is in January&#151;that crucial step can be taken without further 
delay.</P><P><strong>Nicola Sturgeon (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>Does the minister 
agree that Audit Scotland's finding that a third of hospital wards have too few 
nurses is the strongest evidence yet in support of an immediate and substantial 
pay increase for nurses? Such an increase would reward them for what they do and 
give Scotland a competitive edge in the recruitment market. Will he join me in 
supporting a minimum across-the-board rise of 11 per cent for all nurses in Scotland, 
not over two or three years, but in one year?</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16587">16587</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I am certainly committed to increasing the 
pay of nurses, which is exactly what has been proposed under the agenda for change. 
Recently, I heard one nursing leader praise the agenda for change and its emphasis 
on rewarding skills and new ways of working in particular. Substantial increases 
are on offer for nurses if they accept the agenda for change proposals, such as 
an increase of 6 per cent for a nurse who is starting out. If we compare the agenda 
for change proposals for a nurse at the end of his or her first year with what 
she or he gets now, the increase is of almost 9 per cent over and above the annual 
rate of inflation. It is up to individual nurses to decide whether they wish to 
accept that substantial offer. I believe that that is the best way forward, and 
I note that the majority of nurses, as represented by their unions, support a 
continuing UK agenda for pay. That is exactly what the agenda for change delivers.</P><P><strong>Mary 
Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>Given the development of managed 
clinical networks in the NHS, will the staff employed in them be able to negotiate 
pay and conditions that are different and separate from those of existing NHS 
staff?</P><P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Staff in managed clinical networks 
will still be employed by a board or trust. They may now be appointed to a managed 
clinical network, which is a significant change, but their terms and conditions 
will be similar to those of other staff in the health service. I think that that 
is right and proper.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Industrial Fishing (North Sea)</STRONG></P><P>

we will have to check that against delivery. Is the minister aware that the Government's

fishing industry.</P><P>We share Andrew Welsh's concern about the scale of industrial 
fishing, especially at a time when other fisheries that take cod are facing such 
draconian quota reductions. However, we must be clear about the level of cod bycatch 
in other fisheries. The Commission maintains that cod bycatch in the nephrops 
fishery is significant. It is important that we do not shoot ourselves in the 
foot by adopting too dogmatic a line&#151;which the member may be suggesting&#151;on 
that issue.</P><P><strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>Does 
the minister agree that cuts in industrial fishing should be the same as those 
that are offered to the Scottish white-fish industry&#151;total closure or a cut 
in quota of at least 80 per cent? Does he also agree that it is ridiculous, given 
all the conservation measures that the Scottish fleet has taken, that people who 
pursue industrial fishing can do so with mesh sizes that are no bigger than those 
of fish-net stockings?</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I will not get into 
fish nets, if members do not mind&#151;I keep that for Saturday nights.</P><P>However, 
this is a serious matter. Over the past few weeks, both Ross Finnie and Elliot 
Morley have had wide-ranging discussions with the Danish presidency, the Commission

industrial fishing. However, we must be careful about using arguments about cod 
bycatch that could be applied equally to our nephrops fishery, for example.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Wildlife

plan to deliver 3,500 staff to Scotland's schools, some of whom will be classroom 
assistants. On our targets and progress made, the scheme has been extremely successful.

the establishment of a new body called EventScotland, which will be used to take 
forward our strategy in attracting as many major events as possible to Scotland, 
whether cultural or sporting events, major conferences or exhibitions.</P><P><strong>Dennis 
Canavan: </strong>What lessons have been learned from our failed bid for Euro 
2008 that might help us to launch a successful bid for future events, such as 
the Commonwealth games and the Union of European Football Associations cup final? 
In view of the fact that the behaviour and reputation of football fans might influence 
future decisions, will the minister support the call by Julie Morgan, the Labour 
MP for Cardiff North, for an inquiry to establish what exactly happened on the 
flight last week from Santiago, which landed in Cardiff rather than in Glasgow?</P><P><strong>Mike 
Watson: </strong>We learned a number of lessons about the planning to be undertaken 
in such a bidding process. We had a good bid team, which worked closely on behalf

in which we pitch bids and the extent to which we argue them. We will take forward 
those lessons for aspects of any future events strategy.</P><P>On the final question, 
any inquiry would be a matter for the Civil Aviation Authority. It is instructive 
that, as far as I am aware, South Wales police have not brought charges against 
any of the Celtic fans who were removed from the plane. That might well be a strong 
message.</P><P><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>Will the minister 
join me in congratulating the organising committee in Stirling that has just obtained 
next year's world medical and health games, which will attract 2,500 delegates 
and £2.6 million to the Stirling area? Will he ask the major events team to talk 
to the organisers to ensure that appropriate sponsorship is achieved and that 
the games can come to Scotland?</P><P><strong>Mike Watson: </strong>It is important 
that we recognise our reputation for attracting events to Scotland. Just last 
week, Glasgow was named the European city of sport for 2003, which is a reflection 
of that reputation. As far as Stirling is concerned, I think that Richard Simpson's 
point refers to an event outwith the influence of EventScotland, which is not 
due to be established until the spring of next year. However, I am certainly happy 
to meet him to discuss aspects of the bid and to see whether we can be of assistance.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>The minister might be aware 
of an international youth football tournament held in Northern Ireland called 
the Milk cup, which brings not only football teams but many parents and people 
who spend money to the area. Is he willing to consider not just attracting international 
events to Scotland, but how events might be set up for the benefit of youth football 
in Scotland in conjunction with EventScotland?</P><P><strong>Mike Watson: </strong>I 
am aware of the Milk cup, which is held in Coleraine every year and is successful 
in attracting teams from throughout the world. I would like a similar event in 
Scotland. Last week, in the aftermath of the Euro 2008 bid, the First Minister 
and I made it clear that we would ensure a legacy for youth sport&#151;particularly 
youth football&#151;in Scotland. A youth football review is being undertaken by 
the Scottish Football Association and will report next year. I want to ensure 
that we learn the lessons from that review first, but the Milk cup is the sort 
of event that I envisage emerging from the strategy that we develop for youth 
football in Scotland.</P><P><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP): </strong>Does

indoor stadium for sport and football, which should be in Glasgow?</P><P><strong>Mike 
Watson: </strong>A number of considerations have to be taken into account, but 
I can say that we expect that a decision will be made fairly soon. Obviously, 
Glasgow's strengths are well known and have been accentuated by last week's award,

the UK Government, the regulator and the industry itself to ensure that the grid 
is developed and operated efficiently so as to ensure that our renewables potential 
can be fully realised.</P><P><strong>John Farquhar Munro: </strong>The minister 
will be aware that we are competing with many other countries to gain a crucial 
lead in the development of wave and tidal energy. Failure to upgrade the grid 
as a matter of urgency could prevent Scotland from taking the lead in developing 
the required manufacturing support base, which has been estimated as being worth 
up to 800 jobs in the Highlands and Islands alone. Will he press the UK Government 
to ensure that our position as a leader in wave and tidal energy technology is 
not lost due to inaction on grid renewal?</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I 
am aware of the member's points. I shall make representations; indeed, I met the 
UK energy minister only last week to discuss those very matters. We are represented 
on the Great Britain transmission issues working group, which was established 
by the Department of Trade and Industry to examine, among other issues, the interrelationship 
between potential renewables production and the geographic distribution of generating

that it will have good news for Scotland.</P><P><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland

potential, all the UK's electricity consumers should share the cost of meeting 
that potential?</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I am aware of those proposals 
and we met Ofgem comparatively recently. The issues may have come across Bruce 
Crawford's desk, but the UK energy minister has had on-going discussions on them 
with Ofgem over a long period. In that context, I am pleased to be able to announce 
to the Parliament that Ofgem has accepted our argument that we require a fair 
charging and investment regime across the UK.</P><P>If I may say so, the real 
danger comes from the nationalists' policy, which would disrupt the UK market 
in energy supply as it seeks to divorce us from the biggest market for renewable 
energy production, which is the rest of the UK.</P><P><strong>John Scott (Ayr) 
(Con): </strong>Can the minister inform the Parliament about the development of 
the west-coast subsea interconnector? Does he accept that his renewable energy 
targets for wind power cannot be met unless grid capacity is significantly increased 
in the west of Scotland to harvest renewable energy?</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: 
</strong>As he is a Tory&#151;I think that John Scott is still a Tory&#151;I am 
sure that the member will agree that investment in the grid is a matter for the 
grid owners, who are Scottish and Southern Energy and Scottish Power. It is proper 
that that should be the case. Those matters have been the focus of the discussions 
with Ofgem that I mentioned. The subsea interconnector will be the subject of 
the report to which I referred earlier, which will look at the geographic relationship 
between production and transmission throughout the grid.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Air

certainly no negative implications for the proposed centre at Prestwick. The growth

The examples that have been given of shared campuses&#151;for example Annbank

David's Roman Catholic primary, where I recently opened the new school&#151;give

in the year? Such schools make a valuable contribution to a diverse education 
system and, hopefully, to a diverse and tolerant Scotland. Will the minister consider 
the many examples of good working between denominational and non-denominational 
schools such as Turnbull High School, Thomas Muir High School and Bishopbriggs 
High School and their feeder primaries? Will she consider how such instances of 
good practice might be supported and promoted throughout the country?</P><P><strong>Cathy

I am aware that much good practice in Scottish schools is unrecognised. I would 
be delighted to hear more about the examples that Brian Fitzpatrick has mentioned.</P><P><strong>Murdo 
Fraser (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>The minister is aware that there 
is some concern in the Roman Catholic community about shared campuses. Will she 
assure us that there will be no move to introduce shared campuses unless they 
have the full support of the parents of children at both schools involved?</P><P><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>The member is aware that that is primarily a matter for the 
local authorities. I am aware that, in some instances, consultation is currently

The reality is that, unless stocks are protected, they might collapse and, as

enterprise sector and some will be best in the bigger sector. It is expected that 
small spin-out businesses will be created. I look forward to that happening in 
Aberdeen.</P><P><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I welcome 
the institutes' establishment, but I ask the minister to examine the competitor 
institutes in other countries, such as Singapore and Sweden, and the budgets that 
are allocated to them, which are more substantial than the budgets for the Scottish 
institutes. I realise that it is early days, but will the minister monitor the 
situation and benchmark the institutes' performance and budgets against their 
competitor institutes in other countries?</P><P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>When 
the ITIs were developed, institutes in places such as Sweden, Singapore, Taiwan 
and Canada were examined. The ITIs are based on a model that has proven successful 
elsewhere. The budget for the three ITIs is £450 million over 10 years. It is 
always nice to do more and for budgets to be bigger, but the key point to recognise 
is that that is a massive catalytic intervention to transform Scotland's economy. 
We will continue to benchmark that and watch how it performs over the years.</P><P><strong>Mr 
David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>Will university research 
funding be impaired by the money for the institutes, or will university departments 
have a method for linking directly into the ITIs?</P><P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The 
facts are completely the reverse. The funding under discussion is a further source 
of funding for research within the university sector. The ITIs will commission 
research in the university sector that would not take place otherwise. That research 
will be over and above our expectation for our universities to continue to punch 
well above their weight in attracting the competitive research funds that are 
available on a UK basis.</P><P>As always, there is a catch. In order to bid for 
research contracts from the ITIs, our academic institutions will need to have 
the infrastructure in place to support the research. An additional £10 million 
of recurrent funding has been included in the comprehensive spending review from 
the 2005-06 period to support universities to do exactly that.</P><P><strong>The

the Executive will have a clearer view of whether additional resources will be 
needed to deliver the service further.</P><P><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Is 
the minister aware that not all the money that the Executive allocated previously 
for audiology services has been put to that use by all trusts? Will she consider 
ring fencing the money in the future so that members can be assured, when we tell 
our constituents that the Executive is prioritising audiology services for people 
who desperately need them, that the money will be allocated to those services 
by each health board across Scotland?</P><P><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>In 
April of this year, I announced an additional £750,000 specifically for audiology 
services. I would be very interested to hear from Sarah Boyack if she has evidence 
that that money has not been spent in that way. We are aware of difficulties in 
audiology services and I want to pursue any concerns that she may have.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): </strong>Is the minister

training purposes? When will those of my constituents who need digital hearing 
aids benefit from such aids being issued under the national health service in 
Scotland?</P><P><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>Mr Rumbles asked two questions. 
We did not say how the money that was allocated last April should be spent within 
audiology services. I suggest that training is a legitimate way of spending the 
money. I know that members are receiving postcards on the issue and I want to 
assure everyone in the chamber that digital hearing aids are made available to 
all those for whom digital aids are the most applicable hearing aid. Not everybody 
benefits from digital hearing aids and we need to continue to respond to the needs 
of the individual.</P><P><strong>Cathie Craigie (Cumbernauld and Kilsyth) (Lab):

areas throughout Scotland have created a problem in audiology services? Will she 
commission an audit of all health boards to examine how they are spending the 
money that the Executive has made available? It is clear that the money has not 
been spent as intended.</P><P><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>I am very aware of

will seek to address those gaps.</P><P><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald (Lothians) (SNP): 
</strong>Cathie Craigie's suggestion is the most sensible route to follow. I ask 
the minister to remember that she recognises that not everyone needs the best-quality 
digital hearing aid. Some people need only traditional hearing aids, but I know 
of instances in which people cannot be supplied with either type of hearing aid. 
Will the minister take up that point?</P><P><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>My 
concern has always been that the debate has concentrated on digital hearing aids. 
Margo MacDonald said, rightly, that not everybody needs that type of equipment. 
I am very concerned that we provide the staff to ensure that people are assessed 
properly and are supported in using their hearing aids. We also need to have the 
equipment and facilities to assess people properly. All those issues will be included 
in the review that we are considering at the moment.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16602">16602</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

They continue to argue strongly the case for Scotland's fishing industry.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Swinney: </strong>Two weeks ago, I argued for the commonsense position that negotiations 
should take place under the new regime that is coming into force rather than under 
the old and failed regime&#151;that argument certainly seems to have been accepted 
by many European countries&#151;and that we should resist panic measures that 
do long-term damage for supposed short-term gain. Does the First Minister agree 
that any proposal to limit days at sea can be described only as a panic measure

proposal that days at sea should be limited to the equivalent of seven a month 
has been under discussion since Monday. That proposal is unacceptable and Mr Finnie

they are far more likely to be successful if Richard Lochhead's behaviour in Brussels 
this week&#151;which is what is really politically unacceptable&#151;was a bit 
more in keeping with his position as a parliamentary spokesperson for the main

Brussels. Instead of doing what Tony Blair and I have been doing, which is underlining 
the case that Ross Finnie and Elliot Morley are putting this week, he has been 
undermining the case for Scotland. He is attacking not only the individuals who

Minister was about a compromise on days at sea, which is an important issue. Will 
he rule out a compromise on days at sea? He said that seven days at sea a month 
is unacceptable, but what does he consider acceptable? If he cannot rule out a 
compromise on days at sea, how can Parliament be assured that the Scottish Executive 
and the United Kingdom Government are doing everything that they can to save the 
Scottish fishing industry? Can the First Minister say with confidence that, when 
Parliament reconvenes after Christmas, he will not stand in the chamber to defend 
a deal that has ruined the economic prospects of countless families in Scotland?</P><P><strong>The

and win in international negotiations. The reality is&#151;[<em>Interruption.</em>] 
It may be difficult for those who want simply to undermine the case to listen, 
but it would be better if they did. In international negotiations, we have not 
only to be realistic about our prospects, but to argue as strongly as possible 
for Scotland. That is exactly what we have been doing for weeks on end. In doing 
that, we have received support from the majority of members of all parties and 
we have had the courtesy to keep people such as the Opposition spokesperson for 
fisheries involved and informed about the strategy that we are following.</P><P>At 
every stage in the process, we have secured the support of the British Government, 
including, at the highest level, the Prime Minister in discussions with the President 
of the European Commission and other European leaders. That will happen again 
if it has to.</P><P>We have to be honest. Of course there will be changes in the 
North sea fisheries, but we have to ensure that, in the final decisions that are 
made, the unacceptable closure or anything getting close to closure of the North 
sea fishery does not happen tonight or tomorrow. That is our objective and I believe 
that Ross Finnie and Elliot Morley can meet it. However, the Parliament needs 
to unite behind them instead of undermining them.</P><P><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>There

week, the Executive awarded itself a 92 per cent pass mark in a paper that it 
marked itself. However, on the same day, an independent survey carried out by 
the Electoral Commission found that public confidence in the Administration's 
ability to improve our health and education services has slumped over the past 
five years. Given that state of affairs, does the First Minister agree that we 
need to cut the Parliament and the Government in Scotland down to size and focus 
them properly on reforming our public services?</P><P><strong>The First Minister:

could do is spend the next four years arguing about politicians, sizes and structures 
instead of dealing with the key issues that face Scotland, such as improving our 
transport system, tackling crime, improving standards in our health and education

on those fundamental priorities instead of on politicians.</P><P><strong>David

our hospitals, thousands of people are waiting longer for treatment. Although 
it promised to tackle crime, violent crime in Scotland is on the up.</P><P>The 
Executive has been successful in a few cases, however. It has successfully poured 
tens of millions of pounds into a hole in the ground at Holyrood and it has successfully 
persuaded Helen Liddell to fiddle with the Scotland Act 1998 to suit its own selfish 
interests. Is that the First Minister's idea of how to regain the Scottish people's 
trust and confidence in his Administration and the Parliament?</P><P><strong>The 
First Minister: </strong>It is not easy to restore public confidence when all 
political parties do not accept their share of the Parliament's responsibilities 
or their share of the responsibility for the Parliament's decisions. Mr McLetchie 
and his party could learn a lesson from that.</P><P>As was confirmed again yesterday, 
Scotland has the lowest unemployment rate for 25 years, the highest rates of employment 
for almost 40 years, record numbers of police officers, record levels of detection 
of crime, higher standards in reading and writing than we have had for years and 
greater investment in transport than we have had for a generation. As far as investment, 
reform and improving the standards of our public services are concerned, Scotland 
is getting better. However, all that we have heard in the chamber from the two

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1</STRONG></P><P> 
<strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr Murray Tosh): </STRONG>The next item 
of business is a debate on motion S1M-3396, in the name of Ross Finnie, on the 
Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill, and on one amendment to that motion.</P><P>15:33</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development (Allan Wilson): </strong>I 
am pleased to open the debate. I have a sore throat, but will continue my Satchmo 
impersonation.</P><P>This is the first opportunity for the Parliament to discuss 
the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill. The Executive is committed to a mixed 
system, with a healthy tenanted sector performing an important and distinctive 
role alongside the owner-occupied sector. The bill aims to revitalise the tenanted 
sector for the benefit of our agriculture industry and rural Scotland as a whole. 
In doing so, it reforms current legislation, which essentially dates from the 
immediate post-war period and is recognised by tenants and landlords alike as 
being badly in need of updating.</P><P>The strength and breadth of support for 
the bill cannot be overstated, but are probably too easily forgotten, because 
attention has focused on one element of the bill, which is the tenant's right 
to buy. That is certainly an important element of the bill, but for the industry 
as a whole, other features that will introduce new tenancy options, extended rights 
for tenants and simpler and cheaper dispute resolution arrangements are even more 
important.</P><P>I read with interest the evidence on the bill that was presented 
to the Rural Development Committee and I am delighted that the committee endorsed 
the bill's objectives. The committee also made several recommendations. In the 
limited time available to me, I will focus on the committee's recommendations 
and will perhaps respond to other points in summary as they arise.</P><P>The bill 
will introduce new tenancy options that will exist alongside current types of 
tenancy. The short limited duration tenancy will have a maximum life of five years, 
and the limited duration tenancy will have a minimum term of 15 years. The new 
options will provide tenants with strong security of tenure throughout an agreed 
term and will give landlords the means to reclaim the land at the end of the term.</P><P>We 
also welcome the committee's broad expression of support for the bill's diversification 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16612">16612</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>proposals. The committee expressed concern about the fact that a landlord's 
grounds for objecting to a tenant's proposal to diversify might not strike the 
right balance between the respective rights of landlord and tenant. The important 
point is that section 35(9) sets out a landlord's grounds for objecting to a proposed 
diversification, but will not give the landlord the power to block a tenant's 
proposal, and no landlord will be able to withhold consent unreasonably. The grounds 
for objection have to be broad to remain relevant against a wide range of potential 
non-agricultural uses, particularly as the bill deliberately does not constrain 
the types of non-agricultural activity into which a tenant will be able to enter. 
If a landlord objects to a tenant's proposal, we intend to make it clear that 
the tenant will be able to ask the Scottish Land Court to approve the proposal 
nevertheless.</P><P><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) 
(LD): </strong>Is it not the case that any landowner who objected could put in 
a written objection under section 35(9)(iii)? That was the committee's point. 
The description is wide so they could object almost automatically.</P><P><strong>Allan 
Wilson: </strong>Yes. The bill now includes provisions that allow the landlord 
to grant consent subject to conditions. We intend to make it clear in the bill 
that the Land Court will be able to strike out, modify or insert conditions, which 
will be an important way of ensuring that restrictions on a tenant's freedom to 
diversify will be proportionate to a landlord's reasonable grounds for objection. 
I am sure that we will be able to come to an agreement with the committee on that 
particular point.</P><P>As members will know, our most recent consultation on 
the draft bill revealed many tenant farmers' dissatisfaction with the operation 
of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991. In giving evidence to the Rural 
Development Committee, Mr Finnie acknowledged those concerns and said that we 
were considering ways of dealing with them. The first concern relates to the practice 
whereby landlords ask tenants to conclude an agreement that quickly writes down 
the amount of compensation the tenant is entitled to at waygo for the value of 
improvements made by the tenant to the farm. I can confirm that we intend to lodge 
amendments at stage 2 that will prohibit landlords and tenants from concluding 
write-down agreements in future, in relation to both existing and new leases. 
We continue to consider whether and how action might be taken in relation to current 
write-down agreements, but potentially complex legal issues would need to be overcome.</P><P><strong>Fergus 
Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP): </strong>I fully accept that 
the issues are </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16613">16613</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>complex, but does the minister agree that the mischief to be corrected relates 
to past agreements? Will he advise whether the amendments he will propose will 
have retroactive effect? If they will not, I believe that we will not address 
the problem that he has correctly identified.</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I 
understand Mr Ewing's point but, to a certain extent, he answered it himself when 
he referred to complex legal issues. I suspect that those are, indeed, the issues 
that will concentrate our minds at stage 2.</P><P>Tenants have complained about 
landlords who have demanded that they enter into post-lease agreements that transfer 
responsibility for renewing fixed equipment from landlord to tenant. As with write-down 
agreements, we propose to render as void any post-lease agreement entered into 
in future that purports to transfer responsibility for renewals, and we are considering 
how we might allow tenants to revoke existing agreements.</P><P>We are also considering 
sympathetically further issues surrounding the correlation between rental values 
and the profitability of farms.</P><P><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con): </strong>Does 
the minister accept that the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill is likely to 
lead to a reduction in the value of land in Scotland? As that value currently 
underpins the borrowings of the Scottish agricultural sector, does he accept that 
the bill will lead to increased hardship for Scottish farmers, particularly owner-occupiers?</P><P><strong>Allan 
Wilson: </strong>No. I will come to the issue of blight when I come to the absolute 
right to buy, which is supported by some but not by others.</P><P>I have been 
struck by the enthusiasm of the industry to find solutions to the issues. Bodies 
representing tenants, landowners and other interests have worked together in an 
effort to resolve the outstanding issues quickly. We are liaising closely with 
the industry and will continue to do so. I recognise that, if Parliament approves 
the principles of the bill, we will need to move fast, because time is not on 
our side. However, the bill has been built on consensus and I would like that 
to continue with regard to the outstanding issues.</P><P>That brings me to the 
aspect of the bill that has attracted most interest: the pre-emptive right to 
buy, which is a right for tenants under the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 
1991 to buy the farm they rent when it is offered for sale. I am pleased that 
the majority of the committee stated its support in principle for a pre-emptive 
right to buy.</P><P>The right to buy in the bill operates whenever a landowner 
wants to sell the land. It provides a guaranteed right for the tenant to buy the 
land at </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16614">16614</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>market value. In effect, that gives a statutory basis to a procedure from which 
the tenant and the landlord both benefit. It is usually cheaper for a tenant to 
buy the farm that they rent than an equivalent farm elsewhere, while landlords 
can usually expect to receive a higher price by selling land to a sitting tenant 
than to a third party. However, at present, some landlords not only sell land 
to a third party without giving the tenant the opportunity to bid, but sometimes 
do not even alert tenants to the change of landlord. That is why it is important 
that we create a statutory pre-emptive right to buy. That will mean that it will 
no longer be possible for land to be sold over the head of the tenant. Everybody 
should welcome that.</P><P>Crucially, the right-to-buy provisions in the bill 
are entirely consistent with our aim that the bill should revitalise the tenanted 
sector in Scotland. The bill extends tenants' rights but does so in a way that 
does not prejudice the legitimate rights of landlords. We have provided a right 
that tenants want and which the Scottish Landowners Federation has stated that 
landlords can live with.</P><P>There is, of course, a body of opinion that believes 
that tenants should have an absolute right to buy, which they could exercise against 
the will of the landlord. Regardless of the way in which an absolute right to 
buy was introduced, it would undermine our efforts to revitalise the tenanted 
sector in Scotland. [<em>Applause.</em>] I thank the Conservative members for 
that applause, even if it came from strange quarters.</P><P>Those of us with a 
brain in the chamber can see that those who advocate an absolute right to buy 
and suggest that it should apply only to tenants with tenancies under the 1991 
act have completely failed to explain why they believe that an absolute right 
to buy would be right for those tenants but would not be justifiable for other 
tenants. Tenants who would not share the right to buy would, I am sure, be interested 
to know why the distinction is appropriate. So, too, would landlords, who would 
not let land if there were a risk that they would be unable to reclaim the land 
at the end of the lease. That is why the introduction of an absolute right to 
buy, even if only for tenants under 1991 act tenancies, is likely to affect the 
availability of agricultural land for let. Indeed, it could depress confidence 
in letting in other non-agricultural commercial sectors, too. I would argue that 
it has implications across the commercial sector and in retail and other areas.</P><P><strong>Murdo 
Fraser (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>Will the minister give way?</P><P><strong>Allan 
Wilson: </strong>I would like to, but I am out of time.</P><P>I have much more 
to say, but I will say it in my closing speech. The bill is fundamentally about

<P>much more than the tenant right to buy. It contains several important elements 
that work together to stimulate the tenanted sector. I have attempted to outline 
a few of those in the time that is available to me. The Executive will be happy 
to consider other points at stage 2. I look forward to that process.</P><P>I move,</P><P>That 
the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) 
Bill.</P><P>15:45</P><P><strong>Alex Fergusson (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>While 
sympathising with the minister's hoarse voice, I must congratulate him on what 
I assume was an excellent rendition at the karaoke at last night's Labour party 
party.</P><P>I draw members' attention to my entry in the register of interests: 
I am the owner of a farm that is run by a partnership in which I am the limited 
partner. Some would say that I am very limited.</P><P>In January 1999, the land 
reform policy group suggested, among other things, that agricultural holdings 
legislation should be amended to provide more flexible tenancy arrangements, to 
permit more farm tenants to diversify, to allow tenants to plant woodland, to 
encourage tenants to indulge in good conservation practice, to provide greater 
protection for tenants, to strengthen a tenant's right to compensation, and to 
simplify and reduce the cost of dispute resolution. Accordingly, the bill tries 
to do that and, as the minister said, seeks to reinvigorate the tenanted sector.</P><P>The 
Conservatives endorse those aims whole-heartedly. We agree entirely that, in some 
cases, there is room for considerable improvement in the relationship between 
lessor and lessee, but we strongly dispute that that relationship has turned sour 
at every instance, across the board, as some would argue. We must consider the 
bill in the realisation that the vast majority of landlord-tenant relationships 
are perfectly healthy and productive. I refer members to a letter that they received 
just a week ago from five tenants on five different estates. That letter says 
clearly:</P><P>&quot;as tenant farmers, we have benefited from the innovative 
enterprise of different estates. It is often not acknowledged just how much of 
the infrastructure of every farm on an estate has been provided by the landlord&quot;.</P><P>Likewise, 
we should acknowledge that the majority of tenanted landholdings are not owned 
by the big estates that attract so much publicity, but are often single units 
and are sometimes owned by the widow of a former farmer or by a former farmer 
who has chosen to retire. There is a vast range in the size of ownership and of 
tenancy throughout Scotland. We would do well to realise that as we consider the 
bill's general principles.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16616">16616</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>In the light of that, and bearing in mind the bill's intentions to reinvigorate 
the sector, we very much welcome the provision for the new limited duration tenancies 
and the provisions that address diversification, compensation and dispute resolution. 
We look forward to scrutinising the amendments that the minister has promised 
to lodge on those issues at stage 2. We particularly welcome those provisions 
because, as the minister said, they have been brought about largely by agreement 
among all the relevant stakeholders. Essentially, they are the product of consensus. 
That is exactly as the situation should be on issues such as land reform.</P><P>The 
problem arises when the Executive departs from the agreed stakeholder concerns 
and embraces antagonism, as it has done by introducing at a relatively late stage 
in the proceedings the section that will give secure tenants under the 1991 act 
a pre-emptive right to buy. The Executive did that in spite of the fact that Ross 
Finnie said in the Parliament in May 2000:</P><P>&quot;We are trying to move towards 
a situation of greater diversity, in which more leases will be offered. Neither 
the consultative group that existed before we took office nor that which was set 
up afterwards proved that instituting a tenant's right to buy would do anything 
other than dry up a limited supply. We were not persuaded that that was consistent 
with our aim of getting new tenants.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, 17 
May 2000; Vol 6, c 695.]</P><P><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>As Alex Fergusson 
opposes the pre-emptive right to buy, does he also oppose the rights of pre-emption 
that feudal superiors hold and have held for centuries?</P><P><strong>Alex Fergusson: 
</strong>That is a matter of legal contract. As a lawyer, Fergus Ewing should 
certainly know that.</P><P>The sentiments that Ross Finnie expressed in May 2000 
were right then and they are equally correct now. The available land has already 
dried up.</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Does Alex Fergusson accept that 
the introduction of the pre-emptive right to buy is beneficial if landlord and 
tenant are willing to participate, because the right benefits both in securing 
a suitable market value?</P><P><strong>Alex Fergusson: </strong>I fully support 
such sales where there is a willing buyer and a willing seller, but why on earth 
do we need legislation for that? As I said, available land is already starting 
to dry up. In the past five years, an average of two farms a month have been available 
for rent in <em>The Scottish Farmer </em>magazine. Since last May, there has been 
none. The only reason for that is the justifiable fear that a pre-emptive right 
to buy may be extended to all tenancies at the whim of a future minister. Worse, 
the right to buy might be turned into an absolute right to buy.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16617">16617</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>Oh, come on.</P><P><strong>Alex Fergusson: </strong>It 
is true, Fergus. Such an absolute right to buy is a right to expropriation&#151;a 
right that will ensure that even the new tenancies that the bill envisages never 
even get off the ground.</P><P>I was recently contacted by a farmer who had tried 
to rent six neighbouring fields from three willing neighbours in order to maintain 
a sustainable number of sheep under the organic aid scheme. None of the neighbours 
was willing to enter into any arrangements other than a short-term grazing lease, 
because of their fears over the right to buy. At least St Paul had a heavenly 
experience before his biblical U-turn; the only experience that the minister seems 
to have had before his own volte-face was intensive lobbying from George Lyon&#151;an 
experience that I would describe as anything but heavenly.</P><P>Not one stakeholder

right to buy, other than the Scottish Tenant Farmers Action Group, which does 
not even speak for the majority of Scotland's tenants.</P><P>One columnist recently

of the bill have been hidden behind the disastrous smokescreen of the right to

that the provision in the bill of a right to buy for some tenants has already 
led to a significant reduction in the amount of land let under medium- and long-term 
arrangements, and believes that the enactment of such a provision will minimise 
land available for rent, including holdings under the new tenancies proposed in

negative impact on the management of the tenanted sector.&quot;</P><P>15:51</P><P><strong>Fergus

<P>committee spent a great deal of time and effort working on the parts of the 
bill that are not the subject of any great controversy. We all welcome the introduction 
of new vehicles that will allow leases to be entered into and we are all aware 
that the purposes of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991 were circumvented 
to an extent by&#151;I have to say this&#151;smart lawyers.</P><P>I also note 
that the percentage of farmers who are tenants decreased from 32.5 per cent in 
1982 to 16.6 per cent in 2001; over 20 years, the percentage of farmers who are 
tenants halved. If that is not an indictment of the current system, I do not know 
what is. It is difficult to see how anything could be worse than the current system 
from the point of view of creating new land for leasing.</P><P>I will quote the 
words of some farmers, and I note the work of the Scottish Tenant Farmers Action 
Group, which I think has done a brave and good job. I also commend the efforts 
of the other leading players, whose submissions have been extremely helpful.</P><P>Stuart 
Black, a farmer in Strathspey, said:</P><P>&quot;I see the value of a right to 
buy in terms of the effect it would have on my position as a tenant. I would love 
to be able to go along to the estate as an equal partner, and I think that a right 
to buy would have a radical effect on the way in which individual tenants were 
regarded and treated by the estate.&quot;</P><P>Donald Gibbon of Middleton, Fintray, 
said:</P><P>&quot;There has been no significant investment by the estate in farm 
infrastructure for over a decade, and it upsets me to see the way the place is 
suffering. The new generation of landlord has little common interest with the 
likes of me, and a right to buy would give me the chance to stand on my own feet 
and run the place properly. We could develop the engineering business to its full 
potential, and investigate some other ideas for diversification that I have in 
mind.&quot;</P><P>Stewart Jamieson said:</P><P>&quot;Since I took over the farm 
from my father in 1975 we have invested over £290,000 in this farm while the estate's 
contribution has been a mere £40,000 ... When I retire I will get almost no recompense 
for this. All of the value that we have created will revert to the estate&quot;.</P><P>A 
farmer in Sutherland said:</P><P>&quot;Our landlord, Sutherland Estates, owns 
a huge part of Sutherland including much of the land around Brora and Golspie. 
Throughout this area there is a shortage of land for housing and business development, 
and the local economy is strangled by this monopolistic system of land tenure. 
It's a tragedy really. So much enterprise and opportunity stifled when our communities 
should be retaining their people and encouraging new blood in.&quot;</P><P>I have 
quoted the words of a few farmers; I could quote many more. The points that I 
wish to draw from those comments are as follows. First, we do not imagine that 
every landlord is a bad landlord&#151;quite the contrary. I know that people such 
as Jamie Williamson in my constituency do their utmost to promote diversification 
and new </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16619">16619</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>opportunities. I know that because I have visited his farm&#151;I hope that 
I understand what he is doing. However, I am afraid that many landlords have the 
motto &quot;let it and forget it&quot; and that their concern is that they get 
the rental cheque once a year. I have spoken to many farmers in my constituency 
who could tell many a tale. However, many of them do not speak out. Perhaps that 
is why the situation has not been sorted out before now.</P><P>Once we begin to 
scrutinise the detail of the bill at stage 2, we will have to consider some serious 
issues relating to the right to buy. The proponents of the principle of the right 
to buy must take serious issues seriously, and we will do that. However, the quotes 
from farmers and communities that I have read out make the case strongly that 
there is considerable public interest in having a right to buy, whether pre-emptive 
or absolute.</P><P>Issues such as sporting rights are important. We must ensure 
that those rights continue to be exercised and I think that that can be achieved. 
Compensation at waygo, post-lease agreements and writing down agreements must 
all be dealt with and must apply to existing tenants. We must also consider the 
value of land. Since 1995, farm incomes have fallen by 60 per cent, while average 
levels of rent have increased by 30 per cent. That does not seem to indicate that 
the market and rental levels correspond to farm viability. The rent determination 
procedures must reflect economic viability.</P><P>I know that the minister, his 
civil servants and the various parties have done a great deal of work, including 
during this week, for which I commend them. We all want to get a better deal for 
the tenant; that is my principal aim and if we achieve it there will be more economic 
development and opportunities in the countryside, which we all want. For that 
reason, we must take the issue very seriously.</P><P>In a speech in September 
1998 that he made in reference to tenants' responses to a consultation on land 
reform, the late Donald Dewar said:</P><P>&quot;The words stifling and stultifying 
occur again and again in these case histories. These are not people looking for 
an easy life&#151;quite the reverse. These are people keen to make the best of 
the opportunities that should be available to them&#151;keen to build a better 
life for themselves and their families and communities, but held in check by the 
action or often, inaction, of external powers.&quot;</P><P>I hope that we can 
all subscribe to the aims that the former First Minister set out, and that at 
stage 2 we will be able to consider seriously the issues that members of the Rural 
Development Committee, who have grasped this task, and other members who have 
an interest, understand and care deeply about. We must ensure that we do not </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16620">16620</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

are predicting in an exaggerated and somewhat extreme fashion. A way ahead can 
be found and I look forward to working to achieve our objectives at stage 2.</P><P>I 
support the Executive motion.</P><P>15:58</P><P><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles (West 
Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): </strong>The Liberal Democrats recognise that 
there is broad support across all sectors of the agriculture industry for the 
proposals that are contained in the bill.</P><P>In its stage 1 report, the Rural 
Development Committee said that it</P><P>&quot;shares the hope that the Bill will 
contribute to a revitalisation of the let land market, increased investment in 
agriculture and the wider rural economy&quot;,</P><P>as was outlined by the minister. 
In 1999, the Liberal Democrats' manifesto for the Scottish Parliament elections 
stated that the party would</P><P>&quot;Introduce term tenancies of a minimum 
of 15 years to replace landlord/tenant partnership agreements&quot;,</P><P>and 
that it would legislate to</P><P>&quot;Give tenants a right of pre-emption if 
the holding is placed on the market.&quot;</P><P>Both those commitments are met 
in the bill.</P><P>It is clear that the reforms are essential because previous 
efforts to reform the system have not succeeded in increasing the availability 
of tenancies or in encouraging the diversity that is needed on our farms. The 
last attempted reform, by a Conservative Administration in 1991, failed because 
mechanisms were found to circumvent the intended security of tenure. In its report, 
the Rural Development Committee recommends to the Scottish Executive that it ensure 
that the new reforms are not similarly frustrated.</P><P>I turn to the point that 
the minister made about section 35(9) and the Rural Development Committee's feeling 
that it might not strike the right balance between landlords' rights and tenants' 
opportunities. Section 35(9) states:</P><P>&quot;The landlord may object to the 
notice of diversification if ... the landlord reasonably considers that the intended 
use of the land for a non-agricultural purpose ... would ... be detrimental to 
the sound management of the estate&quot;.</P><P>If I were a landlord, I would 
consider that to be a catch-all and I would automatically issue an objection to 
anything that I did not consider to be effective use of the land. That is what 
the committee was trying to say, so perhaps section 39 could be tightened up a 
little bit.</P><P>I turn to the element of the bill that deals with a tenant's 
right to buy land. It must be wrong for a </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16621">16621</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>landlord to be able to sell a farm over the head of a sitting tenant. The committee 
received compelling evidence of that from Stuart Black, who told us that his property</P><P>&quot;was 
finally sold some months later, the only notification we received, and only goodbye, 
was a legal notice to pay future rents to Salingor Holdings, incorporated in the 
Bahamas, the new owners are a French/Belgian family".</P><P>Under the bill, that 
farmer would have an opportunity to purchase his farm when it came up for sale. 
Another tenant farmer&#151;Mr Mann&#151;told us that his property had had six 
different owners in his time. The bill is designed to help such farmers.</P><P>The 
right of pre-emption that is contained in the bill is a real step forward and 
it is a win-win proposal&#151;I cannot understand why the Tories oppose it. The 
tenant will gain by having first refusal on the property that he farms and the 
landowner will gain by selling to a sitting tenant, thus increasing at a stroke 
the value that he would otherwise gain from selling the farm on the open market 
while it had a sitting tenant.</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson (Banff and Buchan) 
(SNP): </strong>I thank the member for giving way. He is clearly an enthusiast 
of the bill, which I very much welcome. Will he explain why he voted against the 
committee's report when his Liberal colleague John Farquhar Munro and the Labour 
and SNP members found it perfectly possible to recommend it to Parliament?</P><P><strong>Mr 
Rumbles: </strong>Stewart Stevenson has raised the issue, so I will explain. Fergus 
Ewing said that 95 per cent of the report had general agreement&#151;indeed it 
did. On 26 November we had completed the report, apart from topping and tailing 
it. What happened? On 3 December we went back and at the request of SNP members, 
we inserted a paragraph about the absolute right to buy, which I could not support, 
because it was against what I believe in and against the principles of the bill. 
I did what I did so that my objection would be recorded in the <em>Official Report</em> 
of the meeting.</P><P>The only people to oppose the reform in committee and again 
here in the chamber are the Conservatives who, true to form, seem to be content 
simply to oppose reform for the sake of it. Some 74 per cent of landowners who 
responded to the NFUS survey that was published in February supported the pre-emptive 
right to buy. Why? They supported it because it is so obviously in everybody's 
interests.</P><P>I turn to the issue that dominated the deliberations of the Rural 
Development Committee, even though that issue is not covered in the bill. I refer, 
of course, to the proposals to demand compulsory sale and transfer of farm property 
from one private individual to another. Throughout the evidence-gathering sessions 
I </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16622">16622</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>asked witnesses continually whether they could identify the specific public 
interest in transferring property in such a manner, but none could do so. We came 
close only when Andy Wightman agreed with the proposition that it did not matter 
whether there were a few injustices to individuals should the greater good prevail. 
I am sorry, but I cannot disagree more. I see no justification whatever for the 
state's demanding the compulsory sale of property by one individual to another 
when no public interest is at stake. If there is a public-interest argument, compulsory 
purchase powers are already available to the state. It seems to me that, unlike 
in relation to the community right to buy, under which ministers must be assured 
that there is a public interest argument to sustain a proposal, the proponents 
of the argument have failed to support their case.</P><P>In conclusion, there 
is much to commend in the bill. The proposals in the bill, such as the new short 
limited duration tenancies and the limited duration tenancies, the pre-emptive 
right to buy, the diversification of provisions and the dispute resolution procedures 
are worthy of our support. I urge colleagues to support the motion and to reject 
the negative and destructive Tory amendment.</P><P>16:04</P><P><strong>Rhoda Grant

have to keep quite tightly to four minutes.</P><P><strong>Rhoda Grant: </strong>Thank 
you.</P><P>I am pleased that the vast majority of the bill is not controversial 
and that many organisations are signing up to the new form of tenancies that will 
be created and to the added opportunities for diversification that the bill will 
provide. The general principles of the bill are to be welcomed. However, amendments 
will be required at stage 2 to ensure that the bill's aims can be fulfilled.</P><P>The 
most contentious issue, which has not been included in the bill, is the absolute 
right to buy. The bill provides for a pre-emptive right to buy, but in truth the 
pre-emptive right to buy will not make a huge difference to current land-ownership 
patterns in Scotland. Needless to say, tenant farmers look with envy at their 
crofting neighbours. However, the plea for an absolute right to buy is not based 
only on envy; it is sought for practical reasons.</P><P><strong>Alex Johnstone

<P>Some landowners, many of whom are now rushing into dialogue with tenant farmers, 
have used every trick in the book to ensure that the rights of tenants are flouted. 
Secure tenancies place obligations on landlords to maintain farms and farmhouses, 
but many landlords have refused to do that. They either end up in arbitration 
or leave the tenant to carry out the work. If the tenant does not get permission 
for an investment, the tenant forgoes any compensation for that investment on 
leaving the farm. If the tenant asks for permission, landowners insist that the 
value of the investment be written down over a number of years in a write-down 
agreement, which ensures that the tenant again forgoes the right to compensation.</P><P>I 
welcome the minister's assurance that that loophole will be closed to ensure that 
landowners cannot have write-down agreements. However, will landowners be prevented 
from withholding permission for investment? How can we ensure that landowners 
will compensate tenants if they say that they are cash poor at the time when the 
tenant gives up the farm?</P><P>If we had an absolute right to buy, tenants who 
face difficulties could buy their farms. Compensation could be paid to the landowner 
at that time for loss of ownership and the tenant could raise money for investment 
to improve the farm, which would make farming more viable. However, we are told 
that the absolute right to buy would be against the European convention on human 
rights because it would mean the straight transfer of land from one owner to another 
without any greater community benefit. I want to argue against that assertion.</P><P>If 
secure tenants could buy their farms, they would be able to invest and have collateral 
against which they could raise money for investment. That would lead not only 
to more vibrant farming and more vibrant communities, but to the creation of jobs 
through diversification. Creating stable communities leads to support for local 
schools, services and businesses. That would be public gain.</P><P>If tenants 
could buy their farms, they would also have assets that they could sell on their 
retirement. At present, because of write-down agreements, farmers who give up 
their tenancies have no access to the investment that they made and which would 
allow them to give up the tenancy, which is also their home. That means that tenants 
remain on farms long after they should have retired, which causes a shortage of 
tenancies, prevents young people from taking on new tenancies and blocks rural 
development. That happens through no fault of the tenants, who are unable to release 
the investment in the farms. For that reason, it would be in the public interest 
to </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16624">16624</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>resolve the problem; the argument that such a policy would be in breach of 
the ECHR does not hold water. I could give many examples to illustrate those points, 
but I want to ask the minister to consider the issue seriously and to seek a resolution 
that leads to a vibrant farming industry.</P><P>16:08</P><P><strong>Mr Duncan 
Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP): </strong>As the first member to speak 
in this debate who is not a member of the Rural Development Committee, I commend 
the committee for its report. The report was honest in seeking agreement where 
that was possible and in reflecting some of the difficulties in what is a complex 
area.</P><P>As other members have said, vast parts of the bill have attracted 
cross-party agreement. There is crucial agreement about the problems surrounding 
tenancies and the need for diversity of ownership and land use. There is agreement 
about some of the bill's measures that will apply to new tenancies; those measures 
will allow the right balance between flexibility and the possibility of long-term 
investment, which is exactly what we want.</P><P>I want to draw attention to a 
couple of areas on which more work will definitely be required during the bill's 
future stages. The first area is the rental assessment. The Rural Development 
Committee's report makes the point that evidence was received that rent levels 
were driven more by the subsidy-attracting capacity of the land than by its overall 
profitability or farm income. That is a very interesting point from which to start. 
If we are now saying that it is in the nature of public subsidies that they potentially 
push private rents higher, that is an odd way of reflecting the public interest. 
I do not see who will benefit from such a system. If subsidies are the primary 
driver of rents, I suggest that more research and work is needed. Perhaps some 
of the stage 2 amendments and innovative ideas about forums can be acted on.</P><P>There 
is also the question of how to encourage the diversification that we are all keen 
to see. The Rural Development Committee was clear that substantial barriers to 
diversification exist. The phrase &quot;non-agricultural use&quot; and the threat 
of resumption of land on the back of that is something that the committee and 
the minister will want to tackle. Some sensible diversification is being unnecessarily 
blocked, which cannot be to the benefit of the rural economy.</P><P>How do we 
allow tenants to diversify? I note that a number of suggestions have been made, 
one of which is to use a prescribed list of allowable diversification&#151;a mouthful 
at any time. I suggest </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16625">16625</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>that that is far too rigid a procedure. It seeks to dot all the i's and cross 
all the t's and to give to diversification an exact nature that is probably not 
appropriate. As I understand the procedure that is outlined in the bill, we will 
have a system whereby notification of any planned diversification can be given 
and there will be a right to object and appeal to the Scottish Land Court. That 
suggests that all the various players have an opportunity to have their say and 
to test what is the best way forward. That is a fair balance and the bill is right 
in that regard.</P><P>There were controversial areas about which there was no 
agreement, particularly with regard to the right to buy. I support firmly the 
pre-emptive right to buy, which will impose a fair balance once a property is 
on the market. We should reflect on the fact that in the National Farmers Union 
of Scotland's survey of opinion&#151;although some members doubted the result&#151;82 
per cent of NFUS members supported the pre-emptive right to buy including, importantly, 
75 per cent of the landowners they asked. That is a useful statistic to have on 
public record because it shows that it is possible to build consensus on the issue. 
As Rhoda Grant suggested, in many cases all the bill will do is give a statutory 
basis to good practice, which is to be encouraged.</P><P>With regard to the absolute 
right to buy, the committee has acknowledged that however sympathetic many members 
might be to that right, the case for it is probably not proven. Substantial issues 
remain to be resolved about the reduction in confidence in letting land. There 
are questions about the ECHR and about public interest and there are questions 
about investment in land. That is not to say that the Rural Development Committee 
might not come to a consensus at a later stage in the bill's progress and resolve 
to support the absolute right to buy. As matters stand, we can support the principles 
at stage 1, but it is an absolute requirement at stage 2 that the committee come 
back to the Parliament with some answers to those very important questions.</P><P>16:13</P><P><strong>Mr 
Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>Every form of flexibility 
must be used to keep the Scottish agricultural sector competitive. For that reason 
alone, I am pleased that the bill seeks to address landlord and tenant agreements 
by making them better for both parties. That would represent progress. It should 
be possible for those who have agricultural expertise to rent farms&#151;professionalism 
has always been a strength of our agricultural industry.</P><P>It must also be 
possible for landlords and tenants to make agreements that are honoured by both 
sides. I see value in the proposed legislation </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16626">16626</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>on short limited duration and limited duration tenancies and there are certainly 
advantages in the diversification and dispute resolution proposals. Since the 
enactment of the first Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1883, arbitration 
has been the primary method of dispute resolution between landlords and tenants 
and, in recent years, the cost of arbitration has escalated while incomes have 
plummeted and been the subject of much criticism.</P><P>The bill seeks to diminish 
costs by taking prime jurisdiction away from the arbitrator and placing it in 
the hands of the Scottish Land Court. The bill seeks to give the Land Court much 
wider powers, including the ability to decide on whether a tenancy exists or has 
been terminated. That is a major improvement because, until now, that question 
had to be determined either in the Court of Session or a sheriff court, with a 
consequent multiplication of costs.</P><P>There is relief that the proposed legislation 
appears to recognise that limited partnerships have been in use for many years 
and that, in order to not disturb long-standing commercial expectations, section 
42 of the bill will apply only to tenancies that are entered into after the commencement 
of the proposed act. If the new forms of tenancy meet the economic needs of the 
industry, limited partnerships will disappear anyway, which means that there will 
be more privacy for tenants in conducting their affairs and&#151;from a landlord's 
point of view&#151;they will know more precisely where they stand under one or 
other of the new statutory tenancies.</P><P>Those are the good points of what 
was originally intended in the consultation, but that has all been hijacked by 
the inclusion of the pre-emptive right to buy leading to demands for an absolute 
right to buy. To be frank, if that approach wins favour with Parliament, there 
is little point in spending a lot of time on the other aspects of the bill, because 
no one will let agricultural land. There is already evidence that new letting 
is not taking place, which is disastrous for the agricultural industry because 
tenancies are the first rung on the ladder for agricultural workers who rightly 
aspire to running their own farming businesses. It seems to me to be unfair that 
those workers should be denied fulfilment of their ambitions because of preferential 
treatment of one sector of the industry, namely those who have secure tenancies.</P><P>We 
must always remember that permanent security was introduced to encourage tenants 
to invest in farming improvements, in order that the UK could be self-sufficient 
in food. That was in the 1940s. It was a national strategic goal and was deemed 
to be in the public interest, but things have changed dramatically since then. 
There are food surpluses, and if we continue to import Black </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16627">16627</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>sea grain at £35 per tonne, no amount of production and investment facilities 
will enable our farmers to compete on price.</P><P>New investment must be made 
in marketing and diversification. Far from its being in the public interest, the 
absolute right to buy will simply increase fragmentation and reduce investment, 
and will possibly produce a situation similar to the one in Ireland, where arable 
land is £5,000 an acre, there is no land to let, and tenants are coming over here 
to try to get leases.</P><P>There are hundreds of agricultural workers who would 
give their eye teeth for a secure tenancy, but that will be denied them if an 
absolute right to buy goes ahead. Members should bear in mind the fact that secure 
tenants often pay less rent for their holding than the house alone would fetch 
on the open market; in fact, the house is often thrown in free. They enjoy the 
same security that we will have in Parliament, if we ever reach our new dome&#151;sorry, 
I mean home&#151;in Holyrood. Unfortunately, one can hardly say that that house 
was thrown in for free.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> Yes&#151;thank 
you very much.</P><P>16:17</P><P><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab): </strong>Like 
Duncan Hamilton, I am pleased to speak in this debate although I am not a member 
of the Rural Development Committee. However, I have constituents who have secure 
tenancies, and they have been approaching me for some time about the right to 
buy.</P><P>I am an outsider to the Rural Development Committee, but I have read 
the evidence and the press reports. It strikes me that the Agricultural Holdings 
(Scotland) Bill has to be welcomed, if only because it raises a number of very 
important issues, three of which have been mentioned already: the compensation 
provisions, the rental determination, and the notice to quit. The National Farmers 
Union of Scotland briefing deals with those issues adequately, in particular the 
compensation issue.</P><P>There is a widespread feeling of discontent among tenant 
farmers about the compensation provisions in the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) 
Act 1991. I welcome the fact that the minister said that he will examine those 
issues and return to them at stage 2. An issue that has been raised with me, and 
which Rhoda Grant mentioned, is the fact that tenants do not feel that they can 
invest in their farms, because they feel that the investment will not be recovered, 
which prevents them from selling. That is a big issue.</P><P>The crux of the matter 
is whether the pre-</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16628">16628</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>emptive right to buy should be extended to an absolute right to buy. A tremendous 
amount of evidence is gathering on both sides of the issue. The Scottish Tenant 
Farmers Action Group draws parallels with crofting rights, because individual 
crofters have an absolute right to buy, although I believe that ministers' discretion 
applies. Indeed, the group also points out that in England, under several acts, 
there are leaseholders with long leases who can purchase outright the property 
from the landlord.</P><P>As Duncan Hamilton said, big issues still have to be 
debated at stage 2. Another point is that the bill is considered part of the land 
reform programme. The various bills must be consistent. As has been suggested, 
we must bear it in mind that the bills are really social reform bills.</P><P>The 
pre-emptive right to buy is expected to make not much difference for some secure 
tenants, but I accept that the situation will be helped if the system has more 
triggers. However, many of the arguments that have been made for having an absolute 
right to buy for secure tenants must be answered.</P><P>The ECHR considerations 
go against having an absolute right to buy. In his report, Sir Crispin Agnew says 
that they are not insurmountable, but I accept that they are big issues. The Conservatives 
talked about a reduction in land values and said that such a right would be bad 
for the industry and would immediately produce a major reduction in confidence. 
Those matters must be addressed, but they must be balanced by the arguments for 
such a right.</P><P>There is much in what Rhoda Grant said about regeneration. 
If it is the case that secure tenants want to buy their property or to diversify, 
that goes against what the Conservatives say about reducing confidence.</P><P>One 
hopeful sign is the meetings that are taking place between the Scottish Landowners 
Federation, the Scottish estates business group and the Scottish Tenant Farmers 
Action Group. Those meetings will be helpful for the future.</P><P>16:22</P><P><strong>John 
Farquhar Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West) (LD): </strong>I imagine that all 
members who speak in the debate want the development of a framework for our agricultural 
communities that will enable them to survive and grow by encouraging new entrants 
into farming and sustaining existing tenants. How we achieve that aim is where 
some of us differ. When most of us consider the relationship between landlords 
and tenants, our sympathies lie predominantly with tenant farmers.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16629">16629</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The bill contains much that is good&#151;especially the creation of the new 
short limited duration tenancies and limited duration tenancies. They are badly 
needed to replace the scam of limited partnerships, which are no more than a Tory 
ploy to enable their landowning Conservative friends to rid themselves of their 
unwanted incumbent tenant farmers. I ask my Tory friends to confirm or deny that 
a large donation&#151;£7,500&#151;was made to the Tory party's funds by one of 
the biggest landowning estates in the Borders. I wonder why that was given.</P><P>Much 
in the bill must be toughened to protect tenant farmers' rights. I will consider 
the differences between farming tenants and housing tenants. Could we imagine 
a social housing tenant paying to repair a leaking roof or to replace their windows? 
If they were forced to sign a post-lease agreement, as tenant farmers are, they 
would be responsible for all repairs. Post-lease agreements for tenant farmers 
should be done away with. What adds insult to injury is the fact that when tenants 
undertake improvements, many landowners insist on write-down agreements. They 
agree to set a devaluation period for the improvement, which often lasts only 
five years, after which the tenant's investment becomes wholly the landlord's 
asset.</P><P>That is why the bill must be tougher. Otherwise, the advantage will 
remain with the landowner. That is why I support heritable farming tenants winning 
an absolute right to buy. The argument that that would prevent the creation of 
new tenancies has no legs, because no new heritable tenancies have been created 
in the past 20 years. Such arguments are bogus.</P><P><strong>Alex Fergusson:

</strong>If what he says is the case, will the member tell the chamber why not 
one farm has been available for let since May this year?</P><P><strong>John Farquhar 
Munro: </strong>I suppose that the landlords have a great interest in ensuring 
that their argument is supported. They can do that by not releasing land into 
the farming community. I repeat that those arguments are bogus.</P><P>As for the 
idea of a land grab, if landlords of secure heritable tenants have in effect lost 
the right to the use of their land, what landlords have not lost is the ability 
by mismanagement and neglect to undermine their tenants' businesses.</P><P>An 
absolute right to buy would finally give tenant farmers an escape from bad landlords.

<P>absolute right of crofters to purchase their crofts. It has voted for communities 
to be able to buy the land in which they have an interest and also for crofting 
communities to purchase their rivers. If only to be consistent, the Scottish Parliament 
must vote for farming tenants to have an absolute right to buy. Their case is 
just and it is worthy of the Parliament's support.</P><P>16:26</P><P><strong>Alasdair 
Morgan (Galloway and Upper Nithsdale) (SNP): </strong>I remember asking a question 
of Ross Finnie after the statement that he made on agricultural tenancies in Glasgow 
in 2000. The fact that it has taken us three years to get this far says something 
about the complexity of the issue.</P><P>I welcome the short limited duration 
tenancies and limited duration tenancies. It is clear that we need to stimulate 
the tenanted sector. I want to touch on one or two matters other than the right 
to buy. The bill also has the objective of promoting more effective diversity 
in the rural economy, although it does not say so explicitly in the long title; 
it uses other words to do so.</P><P>I note the Rural Development Committee's concern 
about section 35(9). The committee is concerned that the landlord's right to object 
to a notice of diversification may shift the balance too far. I accept what the 
minister said, which was that the provision is a right to object and not the right 
to unilaterally block such a notice. However, I am concerned that the provision 
gives landlords the right to put a spoke in the wheel of the system.</P><P>I am 
also concerned about the effect of section 44(1) which, among other things, provides 
for compensation to landlords on the termination of tenancies where</P><P>&quot;the 
value of the holding has been reduced by ... the carrying out of conservation 
activities&quot;.</P><P>I may have missed the evidence that would tell me what 
kind of conservation activities could reduce the value of the land, but if there 
are such beasts, we should reconsider our approach to encouraging conservation.</P><P>As 
a representative of one of the most afforested constituencies in the country, 
I share the concern that has been expressed about section 36, especially the reference 
to limited duration tenancies. Section 36 gives tenants the right to cut the timber 
that they have planted. Given the growing cycle of timber, unless some new kinds 
of tree are to be introduced into Scotland, that benefit would seem to be pretty 
illusory. Perhaps the minister will explain the thinking behind section 36.</P><P>I

<P>bill. I am not referring to their approach to the absolute right to buy, as 
I recognise that that is a contentious issue on which strong views on both sides 
of the subject are to be expected. The two Tories on the Rural Development Committee 
voted against the pre-emptive right to buy for secure tenants and against the 
general principles of the bill. They even voted against section 47, which suggests 
extending the range of transfers that trigger the pre-emptive right to buy to 
ensure that mechanisms such as limited companies, trusts and companies registered 
abroad cannot be used to frustrate the policy intentions of the bill. John Farquhar 
Munro referred to that. By their actions, the Tory members of the Rural Development 
Committee have in effect said that they are happy for methods such as offshore 
companies to be used to frustrate the modest provision of the bill for a pre-emptive 
right to buy for secure tenants.</P><P>This is not just about having a willing 
buyer and a willing seller; it is about having a seller who is willing to sell 
to the willing buyer who is the sitting tenant rather than somebody else. Many 
of the arguments against the absolute right to buy are totally spurious. The argument 
that no one will lease out anything for other than a few months because of the 
danger of the right to buy ignores the fact that there is a fundamental difference 
between a secure tenancy and a tenancy that is let for a limited duration.</P><P>The 
argument that if the Parliament passes this absolute right to buy it will go on 
to grant other kinds of absolute right to buy is the same argument that was used 
by the same people in respect of fox hunting. They said that if fox hunting were 
to be banned, fishing would be banned. It was just as wrong then as it is now.</P><P>Jamie 
McGrigor spoke about fragmentation. If he is against fragmentation, I presume 
that he will say that he is in favour of the ultimate consolidation, which is 
the nationalisation of all Scottish land into one big estate. What nonsense of 
an argument that is.</P><P>We need a vibrant tenanted sector. If we do not get 
the absolute right to buy, we need to put in place measures to remedy many of 
the injustices that exist at the moment.</P><P>16:30</P><P><strong>Mr John Home 
Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab): </strong>I declare my peripheral interest in agriculture 
as a dormant partner in a family farming business.</P><P>The background to the 
bill is the fact that agricultural holdings legislation has been comprehensively 
overtaken by the device of limited partnership tenancies. We now have a </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16632">16632</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>diminishing number of secure hereditary farm tenancies and a limited number 
of insecure and unregulated partnership arrangements. That is all that is on offer, 
and there is not much of that.</P><P>I come at the question with the objective 
of opening up a proper career structure in agriculture. At present, there are 
just three ways into farming: patrimony, matrimony or lottery money. Far too many 
graduates from the Scottish Agricultural College and other institutions who do 
not have any of those advantages have not got the remotest chance of running their 
own farming businesses at any stage in their careers. That is a criminal waste 
of talent for rural Scotland. We have a fossilised land tenure system, with no 
way into the industry for bright, young land managers.</P><P>If we want to create 
business opportunities for new farmers, there are only two ways of doing it. The 
radical way, which I might prefer, would be to take a lot of land into public 
ownership and for the state to let farms through local community agencies. I have 
argued for that policy in the past but, whether we like it or not, there is no 
serious prospect of taking substantial areas of good farmland into community ownership 
in the foreseeable future. Bluntly, we will not take resources out of health and 
education for the acquisition of farms to let. That leaves us with the only other 
way of creating new opportunities for new entrants into agriculture, which is 
by persuading private landlords to let farms on fair terms. That is what the bill 
is all about.</P><P>I have probably made this clear already, but I should confess 
that I am instinctively hostile to the landowning fraternity. Not for nothing 
have I been described as a class traitor, and I have certainly not paid any attention 
to the interests of the Scottish Landowners Federation. However, I have listened 
carefully to the representations from tenant farmers in my constituency and elsewhere 
in Scotland, and one thing is crystal clear. The objective of increasing the availability 
of farms to let depends on the confidence of landowners. It seems that the risk, 
let alone the reality, of an absolute right to buy would put the kibosh on any 
prospect of achieving that confidence. That is the reality with which we must 
live, whether we like it or not.</P><P>At present, no farms are becoming available 
to let. The bill has evolved from a carefully balanced and exhaustively negotiated 
framework for new tenancies, and as such it might just work. I hope that it does.</P><P>The 
call for an absolute right to buy is a distraction. It has nothing to do with 
the objective of increasing opportunities for new tenant farmers. It would just

<P>create opportunities for new tenants. Indeed, it could harm the prospect of 
creating new tenanted farms by wrecking the only prospect of increasing the availability 
of farms to let on fair terms.</P><P>On balance, I believe that we should support 
the bill as it stands, including the pre-emptive right to buy. That is abundantly 
fair and right. At this stage, we should resist calls for an absolute right to 
buy but, in doing so, give a good old Labour warning to the landowners of Scotland. 
If the bill fails to achieve an increase in the number of tenanted farms, the 
Parliament should return to the subject in the not-so-distant future to consider 
the case for community ownership of land to let.</P><P>16:34</P><P><strong>Alex 
Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>I draw members' attention to my 
entry in the register of members' interest, which shows that I am a landowner, 
although neither a landlord nor a tenant as I am an owner-occupier. I am also 
a paid-up member of the National Farmers Union of Scotland and the Scottish Landowners 
Federation, although sometimes I begin to feel that I am keeping an expensive 
dog and doing all the barking myself.</P><P>The main test of this vital piece 
of legislation is what it does to the tenanted sector. I am prepared to admit 
that the bill is, by and large, necessary, welcome and long overdue. However, 
I have grave reservations, for many of the same reasons that John Home Robertson 
has just expressed.</P><P>We must apply the vital test of whether it is genuinely 
desirable to continue to run down the amount of land that is available for let. 
Indeed, Fergus Ewing ably made that point in his opening speech. We know that 
the amount of land available for let is decreasing, and I do not think that that 
is desirable. As John Home Robertson pointed out, the availability of new land 
is necessary if we are to have new entrants to the farming industry. However, 
we should not make land available through state intervention; after all, the mechanisms 
that would allow that to happen already exist.</P><P>The legislation threatens 
and undermines the confidence of people who are willing to let land. People have 
argued that we are talking simply about the pre-emptive right to purchase land 
under long-term tenancies. However, if the Parliament decides once to legislate 
retrospectively on previously existing tenancies, it could do so again. No member 
of the Parliament can say that it would not or could not. John Home Robertson 
suggested that if the bill does not succeed in its aims, we should revisit it 
in the near future. However, that could well be the future that John Home Robertson 
described in his speech.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16634">16634</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>As I have said, we are seriously undermining the confidence of the people who 
already let land or who, because of the bill's provisions, own land and are considering 
whether to let it. Such confidence is necessary to give the boost to the tenanted 
sector that the bill is capable of delivering.</P><P>In the short time that I 
have left, I want to make a couple of points that I would have raised if I had 
been allowed to intervene earlier. Rhoda Grant expressed some extraordinary ideas 
that were given lip service by one or two other members. It is easy for someone 
to make comparisons with crofting communities if they have gained their experience 
in the crofting counties. However, that experience of crofting is not shared by 
the vast majority of Scotland. Although such comparisons might be relevant in 
the Highlands, I do not believe that they are relevant across the lowlands of 
Scotland, where a genuinely competitive market in let land is essential to ensure 
that those who can farm effectively and efficiently will be able to take on and 
maintain tenancies when the bill is enacted.</P><P>It must also be said that, 
when she was listing the advantages of a tenant becoming an owner-occupier, Rhoda 
Grant missed one enormous point: the millstone of debt. People who become owner-occupiers 
have to find the money somewhere. Banks will be the main source of that money 
and at the moment not many banks are willing to get involved in such schemes. 
Furthermore, those who are able to borrow money to become owner-occupiers will 
not have the confidence that she suggested they will have, because they will have 
to manage that debt.</P><P>Presiding Officer, there is much more that could be 
said about the bill. Indeed, much more will be said about it before we complete 
our stage 2 consideration.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>But 
not by you, please.</P><P><strong>Alex Johnstone: </strong>No, not by me.</P><P>16:38</P><P><strong>Mr 
Rumbles: </strong>The debate has focused on the right to buy and, in particular, 
the pre-emptive right to buy. It seems that the Conservatives are the only people 
to have opposed that reform in committee and again in the chamber today. True 
to form, they seem content to oppose reform for opposition's sake. They have become 
so out of touch, even with the people who used to support them, that they must 
get a reality check. We have already heard that 74 per cent of landowners who 
responded to the NFUS survey that was published in February supported the pre-emptive 
right to buy. They did so because it is so obviously in everyone's interest.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16635">16635</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: 
</strong>No. The member will have his own say in a moment.</P><P>It seems to me 
that Alex Fergusson does not oppose the pre-emptive right to buy on principle. 
If he did, he would also have opposed the feudal superior's pre-emptive right 
to buy. He cannot see the relationship between a feudal superior's pre-emptive 
right to buy and a tenanted farmer's right to buy.</P><P>Jamie McGrigor highlighted 
the importance of the Land Court in the new tenancy agreements. However, he gave 
the game away about the Conservative position. The Conservatives oppose the pre-emptive 
right to buy, not because they disagree with it&#151;they do not&#151;but because 
it will lead to an absolute right to buy. The Tory position is basically dishonest. 
It is not a position of principle. They want a win-win situation for tenant and 
landlord.</P><P>Sylvia Jackson said that much evidence was gathering on both sides 
of the equation about the absolute right to buy. She said many sensible things, 
but I cannot agree on that one point. I have repeatedly asked witnesses in evidence 
sessions to provide specific examples of where it would be in the public interest 
to go down that route, and they could not, apart from the tenant farmers action 
group and Andy Wightman.</P><P>I respect the views of my friend and colleague 
John Farquhar Munro&#151;he has a long-standing commitment to the absolute right 
to buy, as does my friend and colleague George Lyon. [<em>Interruption.</em>] 
Quiet, folks.</P><P>John Farquhar Munro talked about social tenants' right to 
buy from the state. That is not the same as the state forcing the sale of the 
private property of an individual owner to another individual against the will 
of the former.</P><P><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>If Mr Rumbles believes that, 
in a liberal democracy, the state should not force an individual to sell his land 
to another individual, why does he not apply that logic to the pre-emptive right 
to buy?</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>It is obvious that Murdo Fraser has 
not been following the argument. The landlord wishes to sell his land&#151;that 
is the fundamental difference between the pre-emptive right to buy and the so-called 
absolute right to buy. The Tories have lost the plot completely. Even Robert Balfour, 
the convener of the Scottish Landowners Federation, is quite happy about the pre-emptive 
right to buy.</P><P><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>No he is not.</P><P><strong>Mr

that SNP members have listened to the debate and that they do not risk throwing 
the baby out with the bath water&#151;that they do not proceed down the route 
of an absolute right to buy. There are many things in the bill that we all agree 
on. We all agree with 95 per cent of it and it would be useful if the SNP did 
not lodge such amendments at stage 2.</P><P>16:43</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson

farmers action group strongly believed that there was a case for an absolute right 
to buy. We welcome the discussions that have been taking place between that group 
and the NFUS with the aim of broadening the consensus and extending the provisions 
of the bill to meet many of the legitimate concerns that the tenant farmers action 
group brought to the committee and to the wider public.</P><P>To address Mike 
Rumbles' point, the paragraph that the SNP was happy to support, along with Labour

those concerns in an adequate way, we simply must consider other options. I am

<P>In his opening remarks, Fergus Ewing highlighted the point made on page 2 of 
the report&#151;that the long-term reduction in the number of tenant farmers across 
Scotland is at the absolute core of the argument. The 1991 act, which was introduced 
by the Tories&#151;without safeguards, so that its purpose could be avoided by 
a series of manoeuvres&#151;is the problem that we are addressing today. That 
is perhaps one of the reasons why the Tories find themselves uncomfortable with 
the measure&#151;it is addressing their previous failure. Paragraph 14 in the 
committee report highlights that matter.</P><P>On avoidance, we must look at what 
the committee has said in paragraph 17. I hope that the Executive has listened 
carefully to the arguments and evidence that have been brought forward and that 
amendments will be lodged to ensure that we have a robust way of dealing with 
any emerging avoidance tactics that may follow.</P><P>On diversification, the 
committee pointed in paragraphs 26 and 29 to the difficulties that there might 
be in limited partners and general partners having to agree jointly on certain 
matters. I hope that that matter will be addressed.</P><P>I remain somewhat unclear 
as to why Mike Rumbles could not support the report. However, I welcome his support 
for what is actually proposed in the bill. As paragraph 53 says, it is important 
that we consider an amendment to allow tenants in all tenancies a statutory right 
to notification of an intention to sell land, even if they do not have a pre-emptive 
right to buy. That would be of value, and it would be vindictive to oppose such 
a proposal, were it to be brought forward.</P><P>We must consider the Tories' 
amendment and recognise that they remain&#151;on this issue as on so many others&#151;out 
of touch with mainstream Scottish opinion. They are even cleaved, for the first 
time, from the SLF. We need a strong tenanted sector. The bill can, and must, 
help us to achieve that. I particularly look forward to John Farquhar Munro's 
amendments on an absolute right to buy. They will make interesting reading.</P><P>16:48</P><P><strong>Murdo 
Fraser (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>Unlike other members, I have no 
formal interests to declare, but in my legal practice I did some work on agricultural 
holdings. Indeed, I am one of the wicked lawyers referred to in the debate who 
set about circumventing the 1991 act with limited partnership agreements. I say 
to John Farquhar Munro that limited partnership agreements came in because the 
1991 act still allowed security of tenure. If we did not have limited partnership 
agreements, we would not have land let at all under any circumstances. That is 
the important </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16638">16638</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>point.</P><P>As far as the bill is concerned, it is a piece of legislation 
that is overdue to modernise the law on agricultural holdings. There was consensus 
between the NFUS and the SLF, and many of the measures in the bill, such as the 
limited duration tenancies and the improved dispute resolution measures, were 
warmly welcomed. Sadly, the bill has been wrecked by the introduction of a tenants' 
right to buy. We have to wonder why there was a U-turn on the part of the Executive. 
As my colleague Alex Fergusson told the chamber, Ross Finnie set out in a ministerial 
statement on 17 May 2000 the Executive's opposition to a tenants' right to buy, 
which he said would not</P><P>&quot;do anything other than dry up a limited supply&quot;,</P><P>and 
that that would not be</P><P>&quot;consistent with our aim of getting new tenants.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official 
Report</em>, 17 May 2000; Vol 6, c 695.]</P><P>We have to ask why there has been 
a change of heart on the part of the Executive. Could it perhaps have something 
to do with lobbying by George Lyon, who I see has ensured his diplomatic absence 
from the chamber this afternoon and who stands to benefit personally from the 
bill? It is interesting that, despite what Mr Rumbles said, the Liberals are all 
over the place with the bill. What is the Liberals' position? All Liberal members 
who have contributed to the debate have taken a different position.</P><P>As the 
minister said, evidence to the committee suggests that most landowning interests 
do not have a problem with the pre-emptive right to buy in itself. I say to Mike 
Rumbles that the right to buy is not a problem in itself, but its introduction 
opens the door to an absolute right to buy&#151;that is what the committee saw. 
The committee's evidence makes it clear that the threat of the absolute right 
to buy is causing huge concern to the agricultural community throughout Scotland. 
In the debate, we have heard that land agents are trying to terminate all leasing 
agreements, as they fear that the door has been opened to an absolute right to 
buy.</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>I made that point, too. Robert Balfour 
of the SLF stated:</P><P>&quot;We are not attacking the pre-emptive right to buy&quot;.</P><P>Why 
are the Conservatives so opposed to it?</P><P><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>That 
should be perfectly clear to Mr Rumbles. We oppose it for the same reason that 
he has opposed the absolute right to buy: in a liberal democracy, it should not 
be the right of the state to tell a person to sell their property to another person. 
More seriously, it opens the door to an absolute right to buy and we have seen 
the damage that that has already done to the tenanted sector. If the intention 
of the bill is to rejuvenate the tenanted sector, it will not do that.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16639">16639</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>All the evidence on the ground is that an absolute right to buy would be a 
disaster for the tenanted sector. Far from expanding that sector, which was the 
bill's intention, it would further restrict the supply of land that is available 
to tenants, and the farming industry would be deprived of new entrants. That would 
be a disaster.</P><P>The minister could do one thing to help the situation&#151;he 
could state here and now, on behalf of the Executive that, if the bill is amended 
at stage 2 to include an absolute right to buy, the Executive will drop it and 
not pursue it. If the minister did that, he would at least provide some assurance 
to landlords and tenants alike. In his response, I invite the minister to address 
that.</P><P>I am truly sorry that what should have been a sensible piece of reforming 
legislation has been wrecked by the minister for political purposes. The bill 
will further damage the fragile economy of rural Scotland. For that reason, the 
Parliament should support the amendment in the name of Alex Fergusson and ensure 
that there is a sensible bill that will achieve the stated aim of rejuvenating 
the tenanted sector.</P><P>16:52</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Unfortunately, 
today's debate has been short, but it has nonetheless been passionate. That passion 
is a reflection of and tribute to the importance of the Agricultural Holdings 
(Scotland) Bill to the people of Scotland and to the people of rural Scotland 
in particular.</P><P>The bill is the culmination of an historic process. It has 
brought together all sides of the industry to agree on new tenancy arrangements 
after decades of recognition that the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1949 
tenancies are anachronistic, stifle the sector and have been avoided and evaded 
to the detriment largely of tenants. It is important that equilibrium in the relationship 
between tenant and landlord is restored.</P><P>I will start with a theme with 
which I suspect I will continue. I agree with Stewart Stevenson and other members 
that a successful tenanted sector can perform a key role in supporting our overall 
vision for rural Scotland. That vision involves a prosperous farming industry 
that can help to sustain our rural communities and protect our environment. Success 
is dependent on the industry embracing change and new opportunities. A successful 
tenanted sector can provide much of the flexibility that is required for change 
and can also play a major role in attracting new blood and new ideas into agriculture.</P><P>I 
say to Alex Fergusson that there are indications that there is genuine interest 
among </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16640">16640</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>landowners in offering the new tenancies. Where existing tenancies are ending, 
I suggest that many landowners want to offer the new tenancies as soon as possible.</P><P>I 
agree with Alasdair Morgan, whose reference to Glasgow was apposite. Devolution 
created the atmosphere that permitted a new consensus on how necessary change 
should be moulded to fit the industry for the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century and the 
long-term challenges that it faces. The bill was created from that devolutionary 
mould. I hope that members, particularly the Tories, understand how important 
the bill is to rural Scotland.</P><P>Attention has inevitably been diverted to 
the question of what kind of right to buy a tenant should have under the 1991 
act, but the importance of the rest of the bill should not be subjugated to that 
consideration. I agree with Murdo Fraser that landlords must feel able to let 
land with confidence. Tenants, too, require the confidence that security of tenure 
brings, if they are to turn ideas into practice and invest in their businesses. 
As Rhoda Grant said, the bill will provide for compensation to the tenant. I inform 
Rhoda Grant and Stewart Stevenson that we are considering how to ensure that that 
cannot be contracted out from write-down arrangements.</P><P><strong>Fergus Ewing: 
</strong>I thought that the minister would appreciate a bit of a break because 
of his throat.</P><P>I refer the minister to recommendation 39 from the Rural 
Development Committee's report, which perhaps has not been specifically addressed:</P><P>&quot;The 
Committee recommends that the Scottish Executive should examine the recommendation 
made by the NFU Scotland that the termination of a secure heritable tenancy (for 
example, by conversion to an LDT under section 2 of the Bill) should attract statutory 
compensation.&quot;</P><P>That would perhaps allow the new entrants that some 
of us would like to see, as well as giving a tenant farmer proper compensation.</P><P><strong>Allan 
Wilson: </strong>I think that I referred to that matter in my opening address 
and we will obviously consider it in detail at stage 2. I look forward to that 
debate. I will come later in my speech to the issue of compensation more generally.</P><P>To 
work effectively, the tenanted sector requires trust between tenant and landlord. 
The amendment to the motion acknowledges that. However, I dispute the assertion 
that a pre-emptive right to buy, as provided for in the bill, will undermine such 
confidence. After all, the pre-emptive right to buy builds on what is already 
usual practice, whereby a landlord offers to sell a farm to a sitting tenant because 
to do so is to the financial advantage of both. The right to buy will be exercised 
when a landlord is willing to sell and a tenant is willing to pay market value 
for the land. I believe that landlords, their advisers and their </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16641">16641</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>representative bodies, who understand our provisions&#151;unlike the Conservatives&#151;know 
that to be true. Therefore, I call on members to reject the amendment.</P><P><strong>Murdo 
Fraser: </strong>Would the minister address the particular point that I put to 
him earlier, which is that if the Rural Development Committee amends the bill 
at stage 2 by including in it an absolute right to buy, what would the Executive's 
response be to that?</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I will come to Mr Fraser's 
point directly.</P><P>I accept that landlords are concerned about the risk that 
they might in future be compelled to sell land against their will. I have explained 
why we believe that an absolute right to buy would harm our efforts to stimulate 
farm tenancies. We also believe that an absolute right to buy would not achieve 
its desired purpose. I fully understand why the Scottish tenant farmers action 
group is concerned about the plight of tenants under the 1991 act who cannot afford 
to retire, buy a farm on the market or have encountered difficulties in their 
relationship with their landlords. We have made it clear that we are sensitive 
to those concerns, but the only tenants who could afford to exercise an absolute 
right to buy at market value would be those who could afford to buy a farm on 
the open market. I think that Murdo Fraser made that point. To any tenant facing 
financial hardship, an absolute right to buy would be useless and superfluous.

to own, use and manage that land were inhibited by such a right would be lower 
than they would be willing to pay for the same land at the moment. We believe 
that those losses could run into scores of millions or hundreds of millions of 
pounds. The potential loss arising from each reduction of 1 per cent of the marriage

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Firefighters and Fire Control Staff (Pay)</STRONG></P><P> 
<strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </STRONG>The final item 
of business is a members' business debate on motion S1M-3393, in the name of Alex 
Neil, on firefighters and emergency fire control staff.</P><P><em>Motion debated,</em></P><P>That 
the Parliament recognises the valuable and courageous work undertaken by the fire 
service and believes that a new pay formula together with a commensurate level 
of pay for firefighters and emergency fire control staff should be introduced 
to ensure that these accurately reflect the highly skilled and professional role 
which they undertake.</P><P>17:08</P><P><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP): 
</strong>On behalf of the members, I wish the Presiding Officers a merry Christmas 
and a happy new year. I am sure that we do that every time that we are not called 
to ask a supplementary question.</P><P>I make it absolutely clear that I do not 
speak to the motion from a party-political point of view. The issue is far too 
important and the industrial dispute is far too big for us to play politics with 
it. The wording of the motion is deliberately based on that of a motion that the 
Northern Ireland Assembly unanimously agreed to in September before it was suspended.</P><P>My 
motion has two purposes. First, it affords the Parliament the opportunity, which 
we have not had in the dispute, to record our respect for and recognition of firefighters 
not only in Scotland but throughout the United Kingdom. It also affords us the 
opportunity to recognise the work that they do and the need for them to be given 
a fair and just settlement on their pay and conditions.</P><P>The second purpose 
of the motion is to allow the Parliament to put some pressure on the Executive 
and the UK Government to adopt a more reasonable approach to dealing with the 
dispute and to try to settle it much more amicably than has been the case until 
now.</P><P>The job of a firefighter is not easy. Our firefighters are a group 
of professional, dedicated and worthy men and women. They see their job not just 
as a job or career, but as a vocation in life. Their priority&#151;indeed, their 
obsession&#151;is to save lives and to ensure that people are protected from the 
effects of fire and associated hazards. When the rest of us leave a burning inferno, 
the firefighters go into it, often without knowing what they will find.</P><P>Sometimes 
their experiences are too horrific for words. They often have to cope with situations 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16652">16652</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>involving injury and death that are impossible for the rest of us to imagine. 
Having to witness people being burnt alive or seeing a child die at the scene 
of a road accident is part of a firefighter's lot. Indeed, being present at such 
incidents is part of the job description. From time to time, they also have to 
put their own lives in danger in order to save those of others. For all those 
reasons, our firefighters should be treated as national heroes, not demonised 
as if they were the enemy within.</P><P>As Jim Wallace said in his foreword to 
the Scottish Executive paper &quot;The Scottish Fire Service of The Future&quot;, 
which was published last year:</P><P>&quot;The fire service is one which has an 
enviable reputation for delivery.&quot;</P><P>As with a small number of groups 
in our society, such as nurses and the armed forces, the nature of the firefighters' 
job makes them a special case, and they should be treated as such. In a modern 
society, essential workers such as firefighters should not be forced into a situation 
in which they think that the only way they will get a fair deal is by going on 
strike. Our firefighters do not want to be on strike; they want to settle the 
dispute round the negotiating table, which they would have done had the Government 
allowed them and the employers to do so. The firefighters want negotiation, not 
confrontation.</P><P>It is not for the Parliament to decide the exact details 
of a settlement to the dispute or to determine what percentage increase the firefighters 
should get. However, it is the right&#151;it is the duty&#151;of the Parliament 
to set the record straight about some of the stuff and nonsense that some UK ministers 
and others have put about with regard to the firefighters' pay claim.</P><P>The 
first myth that needs to be exploded is about modernisation. Far from being against 
modernisation, the firefighters have been demanding it. Indeed, they have submitted 
their own detailed proposals for the modernisation of the fire service. Furthermore, 
following last year's terror attacks, they have agreed to undertake new duties 
in relation to mass decontamination without any additional pay or benefits.</P><P>The 
measures that the firefighters oppose are those that fly in the face of their 
professional experience and which are more about cost cuts and job cuts than about 
modernisation. For example, they oppose the proposal to reduce the number of firefighters 
on night shift, not because they are militant but because 75 per cent of people 
who are killed in fires are killed at night. Fighting a fire in the dark is, of 
course, much more problematic than fighting one during daylight hours. The common 
sense of the firefighters' position on that issue was exemplified two weeks </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16653">16653</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>ago, during the fire in Edinburgh's old town. Had there been reduced night 
cover, who is to say how much further the fire would have spread or what damage 
or injury would have been done to individuals?</P><P>Who in their right mind would 
take the advice of Sir George Bain, the vice-chancellor of Queen's University 
Belfast, on night-time cover, rather than that of the professional firefighters, 
who have years of experience on the front line? Sir George has never fought a 
fire in his puff. How would he like it if the firefighters told him how to run 
his university?</P><P>The other modernisation proposals&#151;some of which are 
equally crazy&#151;are opposed for good professional reasons, not because of militancy 
and obstinacy on the part of the firefighters.</P><P>I do not have time to go 
through each of the issues&#151;I am sure that other speakers will do so. However, 
Sir George Bain's report was neither independent nor neutral. Sir George was knighted 
by the UK Government. He and his committee were appointed by the Government&#151;without 
consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. The committee's 
remit was set by the Government, its conclusions were dictated by the Government 
and its proposals are a carbon copy of what the Government wanted.</P><P>Let us 
forget Bain and get back to real negotiations. Let our firefighters get the pay 
rise they deserve and let us modernise the fire service&#151;in the real sense 
of the word modernisation&#151;rather than butcher it as Bain would have us do. 
Let common sense prevail.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>The

<P>support the rights of workers to take action on issues in which they believe&#151;workers' 
rights and their pay dispute. If nothing else, the dispute has taught me a few 
things about the technical work that is involved in putting out fires; many of 
us may not have been aware of that work.</P><P>In Glasgow Kelvin, I have spent 
a great deal of time with Yorkhill firefighters, who form part of the Strathclyde 
fire brigade. They have outlined to me the difficulties that are involved in fighting 
fires in tenement buildings and of getting large vehicles up narrow streets&#151;issues 
that many constituents will not have considered. They have told me about the variety 
of duties and dangerous procedures that they must carry out&#151;including dealing 
with chemical fires and explosions, to which Alex Neil referred&#151;and about 
the intricate timings that those procedures involve. Firefighters must time one 
another in a scientific way when tackling fires in situations where they cannot 
see anything. On such occasions, they have their colleagues' lives in their hands. 
There is no question of our not recognising the work that firefighters do.</P><P>Many 
of the firefighters are on strike for the first time and do not want to be so, 
but they genuinely believe in their campaign and industrial dispute. However, 
disputes that are as high profile as this one often become ugly, and the dispute 
has become ugly on both sides. I urge both sides to refrain from demonising each 
other, because if trust is not built up on both sides we will not get an opportunity 
to discuss what is really meant by modernisation and what could make our fire 
service better.</P><P>Strathclyde firefighters seem to be out in front on the 
modernisation of methods. I have witnessed training in resuscitation and the application 
of surgical collars. I believe that all Strathclyde firefighters are trained to 
apply surgical collars, although that may not be the case in the rest of the country. 
I have not yet met a firefighter who is opposed to carrying a defibrillator. Some 
of the issues that have been raised are red herrings. We must analyse what is 
meant by modernisation in the public fire service&#151;what would make the service 
better and what would be the best way of saving lives. That is why trust needs 
to be rebuilt on both sides. The talks are crucial for the delivery of our fire 
service and for our constituents.</P><P>17:19</P><P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton 
(Lothians) (Con): </strong>I congratulate Alex Neil on his success in securing 
the debate. We recognise the undoubted courage and dedication of Scotland's firefighters. 
We believe that the first priority of the Executive and the UK Government must 
be the protection of the lives of the public. We therefore see it as imperative 
that the Government take a central role in negotiations.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16655">16655</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Disputes that lead to the sort of strikes that we have seen so far can put 
lives in danger. That is why we would encourage all parties across the board to 
develop voluntary no-strike agreements if at all possible. In relation to the 
emergency services, strikes, which in our opinion threaten lives, cannot be justified. 
For that reason, the police, the armed services and prison officers are not able 
to take strike action.</P><P>I understand that some European countries ban firefighters 
from taking industrial action on the grounds of public safety. In order to encourage 
unions and employers to adopt responsible and realistic bargaining positions, 
pendulum arbitration should be considered. By that method, the arbitrator decides 
to accept the final offer of one of the two sides, rather than simply opting for 
a compromise. Research suggests that that method increases the likelihood of the 
two sides reaching a negotiated solution.</P><P><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) 
(SSP): </strong>I am sorry that Lord James Douglas-Hamilton is so lonely, as he 
is the only Conservative to have turned up for the debate. In relation to the 
no-strike agreement, what does he think about the fact that the rank and file 
of the police have already voted for the right to strike in recognition of the 
need for them to be able to withdraw their labour? Does he support the rank and 
file police?</P><P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>I made it very 
clear in a press release that I will not support the police's having the right 
to strike, because I believe that their task in saving lives is vital. However, 
I believe that the emergency services should be very well paid in exchange for 
a no-strike agreement.</P><P>The Fire Brigades Union described the Bain review's 
findings as irrelevant, but it must recognise that the inquiry's submissions present 
the best chance of a constructive outcome as a starting point and it must treat 
them seriously. The strike will be settled eventually, but substantial increases 
can be agreed only as part of a review of the entire pay and working practices 
of the fire service. An 11 per cent rise in firefighters' pay over two years, 
coupled with radical modernisation of their working practices, has been proposed 
in the Bain report.</P><P>Our first priority is the protection of the public and 
of lives. It is our hope that any modernisation would help to reduce the death 
rate from fires to a level that is more comparable with that of other European 
countries with a similar climate and culture to our own. The Netherlands, Germany, 
France, Switzerland and Austria all achieve much lower death rates than does the 
United Kingdom. If we achieved the same rate as do the Swiss or the Dutch, we 
would save 300 lives a year. I believe that that is a worthy aim.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16656">16656</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>In the interests of accuracy, I point out that 
the Bain report does not guarantee an 11 per cent wage increase for firefighters; 
it recommends an 11 per cent increase in the wages bill. There is only the potential 
to earn an additional 11 per cent, provided that very tough conditions are met.</P><P><strong>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>That is a perfectly fair point. I see the 11 
per cent as a starting point. I hope that the on-going discussions can be conducted 
in a spirit of constructive engagement and can be taken forward positively and 
constructively. I hope that the Deputy Prime Minister will not lose an hour in 
pursuing a responsible outcome to the dispute. For the sake of the safety of the 
public, I hope that the dispute can and will be resolved speedily and satisfactorily.</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Given that Cathy Peattie had a motion on the 
subject, I will allow her four minutes.</P><P>17:23</P><P><strong>Cathy Peattie 
(Falkirk East) (Lab): </strong>I thank Alex Neil for introducing the debate and 
I congratulate him on his speech. I am pleased to see so many members here this 
evening for this important debate.</P><P>There is no doubt that, since the firefighters 
accepted a pay formula that tied their pay to manufacturing workers' wages, there 
has been significant change in those wages and significant loss of better-paid 
jobs within the manufacturing industry. As a result, firefighters' wages have 
fallen in comparison with those of other workers and, in particular, with the 
wages of other professional and technical workers.</P><P>There is also no doubt 
that firefighters have acquired new skills and have accepted modernisation of 
the service to deal with the new hazards that they face in the modern world. There 
are different views regarding the extent, the time scale and the affordability 
of a settlement, but I believe that it is important that the settlement addresses 
those points.</P><P>It is important that the distorting lens of the media does 
not disrupt the negotiations. For example, the figure of 40 per cent was actually 
drawn from a report by the Labour Research Department, which was the same team 
that produced the report on MPs' pay rises. In that context, it is worth noting 
that the Fire Brigades Union maintained that it is prepared to accept the 16 per 
cent deal that was offered by the employers in May.</P><P>Further negotiations 
will not simply be about pay. The FBU claim would also have brought </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16657">16657</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>retained firefighters and, if possible, control room staff to the same pay 
levels as whole-time firefighters. Staffing levels have also become an issue in 
the negotiations.</P><P>We should not doubt the commitment of our firefighters. 
In recent weeks, I have spoken to firefighters both in my constituency of Falkirk 
East and throughout Scotland, as well as to FBU national officials. All of them 
were reluctant to take industrial action. During the strike, they were all ready 
to abandon the picket line to go to the assistance of those in distress. Firefighters 
continued to free people from wrecked cars and burning buildings in constituencies 
up and down the country. We should value our fire service.</P><P>Firefighters 
are hard-working dedicated people who care about the quality of the service that 
they provide. We do not want to see that undermined by old-fashioned working practices 
that involve excessive overtime.</P><P><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>When Cathy 
Peattie mentions excessive overtime, is she referring to the Fire Brigades Union?</P><P><strong>Cathy 
Peattie: </strong>We should congratulate the Fire Brigades Union on having an 
overtime ban. One hears so often, including in my constituency, that people are 
working excessive overtime. Any attempt to find a solution in the dispute through 
increasing overtime would not help. I was referring not to the Fire Brigades Union, 
but to the possibility that overtime might be increased as a way of resolving 
the problem. I do not support that.</P><P>We should recognise the firefighters' 
contribution and be prepared to listen to their case. I believe that that should 
take place in Scotland as well as in the UK. I urge the minister to meet firefighters 
to explore ways in which the Executive can help to bring about a UK settlement 
to the issue.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>We are back 
to three minutes for speeches, plus time for interventions.</P><P>17:27</P><P><strong>Tricia 
Marwick (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP): </strong>I add my congratulations to Alex 
Neil on securing tonight's debate and I pay my respects to the firefighters for 
the work that they do on behalf of the rest of us.</P><P>The motion supports a 
call for a fair-pay settlement, which I have supported from the beginning. The 
dispute should have been settled a long time ago and would have been settled had 
the UK Government not interfered in the process between employer and employees.</P><P>I

<P>the public gallery tonight. Their presence gives me an opportunity to record 
my personal thanks to the firefighters who broke their strike recently to try 
to rescue two elderly people from Kinghorn harbour. I know that the family also 
extends its thanks to the firefighters for the work that they did in vain.</P><P>We 
have heard a lot about modernisation, but the fire service has already modernised, 
as many members have mentioned. In Fife, we do not have a fire service but a Fife 
fire and rescue service. That name better sums up the work that the firefighters 
do. They are already doing that work; they do not need modernisation to continue 
to do it.</P><P>The Scottish Executive's consultation paper &quot;The Scottish 
Fire Service of The Future&quot; has a section entitled &quot;The Vision&quot;, 
which states:</P><P>&quot;The biggest change for the fire service in Scotland 
in recent years has been devolution. Under The Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish 
Parliament has legislative competence for all fire service matters in which central 
government has a locus ... the Scottish Executive has identified a number of key 
issues for the development of a distinctive Scottish Fire Service and these are 
set out in the sections which follow.&quot;</P><P>That statement is important 
given the fact that our discussion has been on the Bain report, which makes a 
number of recommendations, not least of which is that there should be a UK policy-making 
body that is led by the Deputy Prime Minister.</P><P>I repeat some of the questions 
that I asked the First Minister today and I would appreciate an answer from the 
minister who is here tonight.</P><P>Does the minister agree that the Scottish 
Executive will continue to develop a distinctive fire service in Scotland? Will 
he explain why the Bain report recommends a UK policy-making body led by the Deputy 
Prime Minister? Does he agree with that recommendation? Will he guarantee to the 
Parliament that any operational and policy decisions will be made by the Parliament 
and not by the UK Government?</P><P>In response to all those questions, the First 
Minister said only that the Scottish Executive will introduce legislation to repeal 
section 19 of the Fire Services Act 1947. Under that provision, a fire authority 
may not close a fire station or reduce the number of fire appliances or fire-fighting 
posts without the consent of the secretary of state. That is what the First Minister 
seeks to change. When will that legislation be proposed, and what other Bain report 
recommendations will become the policy of the Scottish Executive? Will the Scottish 
Executive still attempt to develop a distinctive fire service in Scotland?</P><P>17:31</P><P><strong>Tommy

the settling of </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16659">16659</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the fire services dispute. George Bain is nothing more than an obedient servant 
of a Government that is determined to introduce cuts across the fire service and 
is using him as the delivery mechanism.</P><P>I have in my hand the Lothian and 
Borders fire brigade's report of incidents in 2001. It makes interesting reading. 
It tells me that, in that year, six rescues took place during the day shift in 
Lothian and the Borders, whereas the number of rescues that took place during 
the night shift across the area was 62. In other words, 62 lives were saved during 
the night shift. That is why Mr Bain's report is irrelevant and a danger to the 
public of Scotland and the UK.</P><P>I want the minister to answer my questions 
about the affordability of the legitimate and justified wage claim of firefighters 
and their control staff. As Cathy Peattie said, that claim is based on an independent 
research document; the firefighters did not come up with the figure. The document 
was drawn up using the same independent research that came up with MPs' 21 per 
cent pay rise, which MPs did not even bother voting for&#151;they did not have 
to withdraw their labour, although no one would have bloody noticed if they had.</P><P>Can 
we afford the firefighters' wage claim? Are Scottish ministers prepared to fight 
the Westminster Government to come up with the readies? That is the question that 
the minister has to answer. Platitudes do not pay bills. We can congratulate firefighters 
and pat them on the back until the cows come home, but will we fight for the money 
to pay them?</P><P>We are told that the claim would cost £400 million to £430 
million. It appears that we can afford to pay compensation of £450 million to 
Railtrack's shareholders and it appears that we can afford to give £650 million 
to British Energy to bail out the privatised nuclear industry. It also appears 
that we can afford to set aside £1 billion for those who want to start fires in 
Iraq, yet we cannot afford £430 million for those who want to put out fires in 
the UK.</P><P>The crux of the matter is whether the minister is prepared to argue 
that Westminster should put an extra 10p on the tax of people who earn between 
£50,000 and £100,000 a year and an extra 20p on the tax of people who earn more 
than £100,000 a year. That would not give us £430 million to pay the firefighters; 
it would give us £8.7 billion more in revenue every year. That is more than enough 
to pay the firefighters, nurses, ancillary workers and the other low-paid public 
sector workers. Is the minister prepared to argue with the Westminster Government 
that, instead of pampering and protecting the rich, it should start to pay public 
sector workers and firefighters a decent wage?</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16660">16660</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> I call Bill Butler, whom I will 
allow four minutes because of his motion on the subject, to be followed by Linda 
Fabiani.</P><P>17:34</P><P><strong>Bill Butler (Glasgow Anniesland) (Lab): </strong>I 
begin by congratulating Alex Neil on securing this members' business debate on 
a serious issue. As a Labour member, I had no problem in appending my signature 
to Mr Neil's motion. In my view, the content of his motion is reasonable and should 
attract the support not only of MSPs, but of all fair-minded members of the public. 
The motion rightly shies away from being prescriptive and demanding a particular 
figure&#151;that is properly the business of the negotiating team. Instead, the 
motion gives a voice to the FBU's wholly understandable objective of achieving 
a pay formula and a level of pay that mirror the professional and skilled job 
that its members carry out on our behalf.</P><P>Alex Neil's motion is as reasoned 
as my motion on the subject, which, for some inexplicable reason, has not yet 
been selected for debate. My motion S1M-3639 called on</P><P>&quot;Her Majesty's 
Government to ... provide the conditions that would enable a settlement to be 
concluded ... one which would recognise the aspirations of firefighters for professional 
status and pay.&quot;</P><P>Most, if not all, members wish to do all in their 
power to aid the parties involved to achieve a positive resolution. That is what 
my motion is about.</P><P>It is my firm conviction that no one wishes to see the 
dispute continue. I know from visiting firefighters on the picket line at Knightswood 
fire station in my constituency that the workers involved do not want to be on 
strike. They want to do what they do best and what they are trained to do&#151;to 
keep people and property safe and to act in highly dangerous circumstances to 
preserve the lives of their fellow citizens.</P><P>Every firefighter to whom I 
have spoken is anxious, because they fully recognise the risk that industrial 
action poses to the health and safety of the general public. Because they realise 
that, they want a sensible agreement that is acceptable to all sides and they 
want it to be brokered speedily. Firefighters are decent, committed people. They 
deserve such a settlement.</P><P>As talks continue at the Advisory, Conciliation 
and Arbitration Service, it is incumbent on us all to proceed sensibly, to talk 
constructively and to choose carefully the language that we employ. When we have 
all had our say today, one reality will remain: only those who are party to the 
talks at ACAS can reach a settlement. We should do </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16661">16661</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>whatever we can in what we say or do to make that more rather than less likely.</P><P>Unhelpful 
and untruthful rumours have been propagated by sections of the media. Claims that 
firefighters' hours are minimal, when in fact each shift totals 48 hours, or that 
firefighters get overtime and weekend allowances, when in fact no overtime or 
unsociable hours and weekend allowances are received, are propaganda that must 
be countered. The Parliament is a good place in which to do that. Like me, most 
people believe and support not the mischief-making headlines, but the rational 
case that can be made for a settlement&#151;a settlement with honour and with 
no unnecessary and unacceptable strings attached.</P><P>If, in the new year, the 
firefighters find themselves on the picket line again, I will support them and 
visit them at my local fire station, as I have done previously. After all, many 
if not all of those who work out of Knightswood fire station are my constituents. 
I know that everyone, including the firefighters and the public, are agreed on 
one thing: their new year resolution is that negotiations should be successful 
and that, in 2003, firefighters should do what they do best&#151;saving lives 
and protecting people's property.</P><P>17:39</P><P><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central 
Scotland) (SNP): </strong>On one hand, I am pleased to speak in the debate, because 
it was following a meeting with the FBU in Hamilton that Alex Neil and I jointly 
agreed the motion. On the other hand, I am sad to be speaking, because that meeting 
seems so long ago and we seem to be no further forward. The Government does not 
even seem to have recognised that the professionalism of the firefighters should 
be matched with a professional wage.</P><P>I will talk about pension provision 
for firefighters&#151;an issue that the SNP raised way back in February. Firefighters 
do not carry a pension fund. Serving firefighters pay 11 per cent of their salary 
back into brigades' general funds, and pensions for retired firefighters are paid 
from those funds. In years past, the pension contributions were more than enough 
to cover pension costs and funds were diverted to prop up front-line services.</P><P>This 
year, that scam hit the buffers. Too many retired firefighters had to be paid 
from too little money. Brigades face the prospect of closing front-line services. 
My colleague Fiona Hyslop has pushed that issue for some time and lately succeeded 
in obtaining some answers in the chamber from the Deputy Minister for Justice. 
We should not have to push for answers to those </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16662">16662</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>questions, as that suggests a lack of respect for public service workers.</P><P>The 
same disrespect and disregard of the potential consequences of their actions allow 
ministers to suggest that we can cut night-shift cover in the fire service and 
cut the number of firefighters. We can relate that to the pensions shortfall this 
year. If the Government plan of retiring 20 per cent of firefighters were applied, 
we would return to the choice between closing front-line services and refusing 
to pay retired firefighters' pensions.</P><P><strong>Pauline McNeill: </strong>Will 
the member give way?</P><P><strong>Linda Fabiani: </strong>No, thank you.</P><P>In 
the meantime, serving firefighters seek a professional wage for a job that, since 
the 1970s deal, has become a profession. Why is the Government so determined to 
refuse even to discuss paying the salary for which firefighters ask? I have spoken 
to workers in the Scottish Ambulance Service who express similar concerns to those 
of fire brigade workers. Those staff see their jobs changing without proper consultation 
and without any consideration of the consequences.</P><P>The UK Government is 
failing public service workers. I would like Scotland's Government to accept the 
responsibility for fighting that failure on behalf of those whom it is elected 
to serve. Public services should be operated on the basis of putting people before 
profit. I would like the Government in Scotland to spearhead that approach in 
the UK.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>If Dennis Canavan, 
Christine Grahame and Margo MacDonald keep their speeches to two minutes, I will 
just get everybody in.</P><P>17:42</P><P><strong>Elaine Smith (Coatbridge and 
Chryston) (Lab): </strong>I, too, congratulate Alex Neil on securing the debate. 
As Patricia Marwick said, the Scotland Act 1998 gives the Scottish Parliament 
legislative competence for all fire service matters in which central Government 
has a locus. It is appropriate that the Parliament should be given the opportunity 
to debate the issue.</P><P>Any young recruit to the fire service can expect an 
annual salary of £17,727 after his or her initial six months' training. That is 
an hourly rate of just over £8. More disturbing is the fact that, after 15 years 
of service, the same firefighter can expect his or her salary to have risen by 
only £4,764, which is an hourly increase of just £2.18. Firefighters' pay is determined 
in accordance with a pay link that was established 25 years ago. Although a firefighter's 
job has since then changed </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16663">16663</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>dramatically in respect of the required skill level, training and the incidents 
that new recruits attend, wages continue to fall in real terms. Firefighters' 
pay continues to be linked to that of manual workers.</P><P>I will make a point 
that others have made, but I will put it slightly differently. After commissioning 
two independent research studies into the pay formula for firefighters and fire 
control operators, the FBU was told that the substantial research that those studies 
provided as evidence for the its pay claim was inadmissible because it was not 
objective. If the Labour Research Department's findings were deemed to be biased 
because the FBU commissioned them, surely we should ask whether the findings of 
the Review Body on Senior Salaries&#151;which recommended MSPs' salary increase 
last year&#151;are any more objective; they were requested by senior representatives 
of the Parliament.</P><P>It continues to disappoint me that one of the most consistently 
high-performing services in local government, which our Deputy First Minister 
described as having an &quot;enviable reputation for delivery&quot;, has been 
forced to take industrial action to secure a valid and long overdue pay adjustment. 
In the same document, the Deputy First Minister talked about not leaving</P><P>&quot;this 
policy paper ... on a shelf&quot;.</P><P>Will the Deputy Minister for Justice 
tell members in his summing up what the status of that policy paper is at the 
moment?</P><P>During my recent visit to Coatbridge fire station, I was struck 
by the anxiety and regret that firefighters and staff clearly felt as a result 
of having to engage in a second period of industrial action. No firefighter wants 
to have to strike; other members made that point. We live in a modern society 
in which we are increasingly reliant on the emergency services' capacity to provide 
comprehensive and highly effective services. Surely it is crucial that we take 
the action that is necessary to correct a situation that has seen the fire service 
and its employees suffer from years of underfunding?</P><P>The reality of daily 
working life for firefighters dictates that they might at any moment be called 
upon to risk their lives on behalf of others. Surely that exceptional dedication 
to public service deserves levels of pay that are at least commensurate with that 
dedication? I fully associate myself with the motion.</P><P>17:46</P><P><strong>Dennis 
Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>Given that I was a young Labour MP at the time 
of the last firefighters strike back in the 1970s, I have a </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16664">16664</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu about this debate.</P><P>I was not the only 
Labour MP to support workers who had to resort to strike action to get a fair 
deal. I remember John Prescott boasting about the leading part that he played 
in the seamen's strike of the 1960s, when he worked as a cabin boy or a steward 
on a luxury liner. Probably the hardest part of his work was to manage to raise 
a smile as he served gin and tonics to bloated first-class passengers. Today, 
two Jags and three jowls later, the same Prescott is attacking firefighters for 
having the audacity to strike, but we are talking about men and women who risk 
their lives to save others and who are paid a pittance compared with the salary 
of the Deputy Prime Minister.</P><P>The FBU showed remarkable restraint and flexibility 
by calling off the last phase of the strike and trying to seek a solution through 
negotiation. I can understand the FBU's dissatisfaction with the Bain report, 
which has been described as being 11 per cent, but with strings attached. I say 
that the conditions are not so much strings as chains and padlocks.</P><P>New 
Labour and Sir George Bain keep ranting on about modernisation, but it is a misnomer 
to use that word if so-called modernisation means fewer firefighters, which means 
lower safety standards, which in turn means putting more lives at risk. The FBU 
has rightly pointed out that more fatal fire incidents take place at night than 
during the day. What is the sense in reducing the number of firefighters on night 
shift?</P><P>I urge the Scottish Executive to indicate to the employers that additional 
resources will be made available to ensure a fairer deal for the firefighters. 
That would enable them to continue their valuable work of saving lives and property.</P><P>17:47</P><P><strong>Christine 
Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Stuart Graham, Robert Scott, Gordon 
Matthews, John Gibson, Colin Easton and Jacqui Renton&#151;that is a roll call 
of the Gala firefighters picket line. Doreen Tait, Dave Hardy, Dick Polson, James 
Thomson and Roy Barrie&#151;that is a roll call of the Hawick picket line.</P><P>As 
Bill Butler said, those decent and committed people are standing on picket lines 
on cold December days to campaign for a decent wage for a professional life-saving 
job; they are not to be demonised, as much of the press has done. Other members 
have addressed that point.</P><P>Firefighters have modernised year on year. A 
firefighting appliance now carries radiation equipment, modern hydraulic equipment, 
modern pneumatic lifting equipment, oxy-acetylene cutting equipment, an emergency 
speedboat and line rescue equipment.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16665">16665</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Helen Eadie (Dunfermline East) (Lab): </strong>Will the member take 
an intervention?</P><P><strong>Christine Grahame: </strong>I will, if time will 
allow it.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>The member can 
have two minutes and no more.</P><P><strong>Christine Grahame: </strong>I am sorry, 
Helen.</P><P>I was present at an incident at Hawick in which a woman had thrown 
herself from a bridge. Firefighters lifted her from a freezing river using some 
of the modern equipment to which I referred. Firefighters have modernised. Firefighters 
also undertake fire prevention work in schools and in nurseries, telling children 
about the problems and dangers of fire. However, talk of modernisation is a red 
herring.</P><P>It is very wrong to treat those valuable men and women as outcasts 
and it is wrong to demonise them. Their strike has been dignified, although it 
should never have happened in the first place. As Dennis Canavan rightly said, 
it has been 30 years since firefighters were driven to take strike action. It 
would be a disaster to cut night services in rural areas because of the size of 
the areas that must be covered. If that was to happen, firefighters could not 
get to the scenes of fires on time.</P><P>Of course we should support them and 
of course they should have a decent living wage, but that has to be dealt with 
through negotiating, not by driving them back on to the picket line.</P><P>17:50</P><P><strong>Ms 
Margo MacDonald (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>I am glad that Alex Neil introduced 
the debate by referring to the inadequacies of the Bain report. If anyone doubts 
those inadequacies, they should think back to the fire in the Cowgate. We have 
proof in this city. The Bain report lost credibility on that Saturday night. Had 
the manning levels suggested by Bain been in place, the Cowgate and much beyond 
would have burned to the ground. Bain's recommendations also rely heavily on the 
availability of firefighters on their rest days but, in practice, many firefighters 
would be ruled out on a Saturday evening because they do the sort of things that 
other folk do on a Saturday night. The basic argument advanced by Bain would not 
have worked for the Cowgate.</P><P>I am not an expert, but I have spoken to those 
who are&#151;the firefighters&#151;and they tell me that the general point is 
that the Bain report is London-centric. Not many of them are nationalists; they 
are just firefighters. They know that nobody is in the City of London at night, 
so it is true that the night rescues that were referred to do not apply there, 
but they do apply in Scottish cities. We cannot go down the road of having the 
manning levels, particularly at night, suggested by Bain.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16666">16666</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>In the time available, I also want to lay to rest a couple of myths. We hear 
about four and four&#151;firefighters working four days on and four days off. 
The four days off are not four days, but three days, because the first is spent 
sleeping after two long night shifts. Firefighters work a 42-hour week, which 
is a lot longer than most public servants. The other myth is that Bain has recommended 
a generous settlement. He has not. As Alex Neil said, Bain said that there should 
be an increase in the total wages bill. If retained firefighters are brought up 
to the same level of payment as the regular firefighters, as they should be, there 
will not be enough left for firefighters of anything over 10 years' standing.</P><P>The 
Bain report is seriously flawed. With all due respect, minister, we should not 
give it any credibility.</P><P>17:52</P><P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Justice 
(Hugh Henry): </strong>The debate has stimulated a lot of interest from members. 
It is unusual to see so many members not just staying behind, but participating. 
It is clear from the passionate contributions that have been made that people 
feel strongly about the service provided by firefighters.</P><P>I want to echo 
many of the remarks that have been made during the debate and to put on record 
the appreciation of both the Scottish Executive and the people of Scotland for 
the work of the fire service and all emergency service workers. They are rightly 
held in high regard for their professionalism and dedication in often difficult 
and hazardous circumstances, which have most recently been demonstrated during 
the devastating fire in Edinburgh's Cowgate.</P><P>In answer to questions a fortnight 
ago, I put on record my recognition of the valuable work firefighters do as public 
servants and as trade unionists. That has been generally recognised in tonight's 
debate. Cathie Peattie asked whether I will meet the FBU. I met FBU representatives 
in a private meeting last Friday. It was a constructive meeting at which I took 
the opportunity as a new minister to introduce myself and to hear from the representatives 
at first hand some of the issues that concern their members. That discussion was 
on the basis of a shared commitment to promoting a calm and constructive environment 
in which the national talks and negotiations can move forward. The members of 
the FBU made it clear to me that they want the settlement to be made at the UK 
level. We will play our part in helping to reach a settlement, but the negotiations 
should be between the FBU and the employers. We will look to our responsibility 
for whatever comes from those negotiations, which I will return to later.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16667">16667</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>It will be impossible for me to answer all the precise &nbsp;&nbsp;questions 
that members have asked during the debate, but I will try to touch on some of 
them.</P><P>On 29 April, the Deputy First Minister launched a policy paper entitled 
&quot;The Scottish Fire Service of the Future&quot;, which members have already 
mentioned. The paper was debated in the chamber on 15 May and was generally welcomed. 
On Monday, the independent review of the fire service&#151;the Bain report&#151;was 
published. I know that members have very strong views on the report; however, 
it has proposed a number of reforms that are in many respects not dissimilar to 
the recommendations in our policy paper. Like our paper, the report is aimed at 
producing a modern, efficient, effective fire service.</P><P>Our policy paper 
did not deal with pay, which is handled on a UK basis and is a matter for negotiation 
between the employers and trade unions in the National Joint Council. The Bain 
report, however, has a lot to say about pay, much of which has been highlighted 
tonight. The report concluded that there is no basis for a pay settlement of more 
than 4 per cent this year and that firefighters' pay compares well with other, 
similar, jobs in the public and private sectors&#151;indeed that pensions and 
other aspects such as job security make firefighters even better placed. Bain 
suggested a further 7 per cent increase in the pay bill from 7 November 2003, 
subject to agreement on a programme of modernisation.</P><P><strong>Fiona Hyslop 
(Lothians) (SNP): </strong>Margo MacDonald raised a very important point about 
proposals for the total bill and the impact of bringing retained firefighters' 
pay up to a level commensurate with that of firefighters. Does the minister share 
those concerns? Will he ensure that, in representing the Parliament's interests, 
he raises those concerns with the UK Government?</P><P><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The 
FBU is raising those matters directly with the employers. We are not directly 
involved in those negotiations. I will also talk a little later about any financial 
consequences of the eventual settlement.</P><P>The Bain report estimated that 
the increases would exceed by a small amount the resources that are available 
to the fire authorities through the spending settlement and modernisation over 
the next two years. As I pointed out, many of the report's recommendations closely 
chime with the issues that we covered in our policy paper. Our paper also extensively 
covers issues that Sir George Bain's report addresses such as risk-based fire 
cover, the duties of fire authorities, the importance of collaborative work and 
the need for a much greater emphasis on prevention. We intend to compare the Bain 
report with our policy paper in our considerations of how to modernise </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16668">16668</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the fire service in Scotland.</P><P><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>Will the 
minister give way?</P><P><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>I am sorry&#151;I am running 
out of time.</P><P>It is in the context of such changes that we and the UK Government 
have indicated our willingness to provide transitional funding to support an agreement 
that leads to changes in return for significant pay increases. Like the UK Government, 
we have said clearly that we will consider providing any additional funding from 
our own resources as a result of an agreement that is based on such terms. John 
Prescott has already indicated that any additional money will be met from his 
department's budget, not from central contingency funds, and the Scottish Executive 
will have to meet any contribution to transitional funds from its funding.</P><P>I 
do not have the time to go into the pay formula in any detail and whether any 
advantages and disadvantages should be considered when determining future pay. 
I assume that those issues will be reflected in negotiations.</P><P>Like all members 
in the chamber, I recognise that firefighters deserve a pay increase. However, 
as Tommy Sheridan indicated, they are not the only public sector workers who are 
looking for such increases through negotiation. Many public sector workers do 
a fantastic job. I should also put on record my appreciation for the work of the 
armed forces during the recent strikes.</P><P>I do not accept the claim that modernisation 
is a euphemism for reducing the number of staff and stations. Risk-based fire 
cover is not about cutting fire stations or firefighters, but about targeting 
services at identified risks to people as well as to property instead of having 
rigid targets for a set number of appliances. [<em>Interruption.</em>] Presiding 
Officer, yet again we hear ill-tempered and unmannered contributions from members. 
I listened with respect to other members and I have taken notes. If you want me 
to use my time doing this, Presiding Officer&#151;</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding 
Officer: </strong>Order. Everyone should recognise that the minister is under 
a great time constraint. Exceptionally, I will give him another minute to wind 
up his remarks and round off the debate.</P><P><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>Tricia 
Marwick asked about the legislative changes. We will look to do that as quickly 
as possible&#151;at the first available opportunity, as the First Minister has 
said. We are considering what options are open to us.</P><P>Cathy Peattie and 
one or two other members mentioned overtime. One of the new factors in the debate 
is the working time directive introduced by Maastricht. I think that there is 
no possibility for </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16669">16669</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>unrestricted and unacceptable overtime working. We do not propose and have 
not considered, as Lord James Douglas-Hamilton suggested, a ban on strikes.</P><P>We 
share some of the views expressed by Alex Neil, Pauline McNeill and others about 
the need to avoid demonisation on both sides. We do not want the dispute to continue 
on the basis of recrimination. We want a settlement based on negotiations and 
we want some common sense to be brought to the debate.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col16670">16670</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>This has been a useful debate. There are hard decisions to be made. In the 
circumstances, it is best left to the firefighters and their employers to get 
round the table to negotiate. We in the Parliament and the Executive will do what 
we can to make the settlement effective. I hope we can proceed without any further 
industrial action.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I close 
this meeting of Parliament. A happy Christmas and a good new year to all of you.</P><P><em>Meeting 
closed at 18:02.</em></P></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR> <!-- end of variable data -->
