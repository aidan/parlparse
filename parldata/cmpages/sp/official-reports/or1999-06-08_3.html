<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>Listening to "Good Morning Scotland" today, I was informed that
this was likely to be a tawdry debate, which was the opinion of all those
people asked to comment on it. I hope that the debate will not be tawdry
in any sense. If it is conducted properly, I think that it will show the
great strength of the parties here to debate a point of principle no matter
how much we disagree with that point-and I profoundly disagree with the
terms of the amendments to be discussed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, it is important at the outset
to stress what has been achieved rather than what remains to be achieved.
I want to start by paying a very strong tribute to the people who have
taken part in the special sub-committee on allowances, which is responsible
for the motion in my name on the business list. Four weeks ago-although
it seems like four months ago-that small group was asked to convene to
discuss the possibility of bringing forward a scheme of allowances to the
Parliament on behalf of all the parties. That group has met on innumerable
occasions to examine in very great detail the items contained in the motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thanks are due to everyone on that group:
Andrew Welsh from the SNP; David Davidson and Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
from the Tories; Robert Brown from the Liberal Democrats; Jack McConnell,
who was preceded by Patricia Ferguson and Kate Maclean from the Labour
party. I know that the new politics has arrived when I am prepared to offer
thanks and congratulations to Jack McConnell. That should be noted carefully.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also need to thank others who have worked
on the motion: the clerks and lawyers who have worked very long hours,
the secretaries and others who have typed up endless drafts, and the couriers
who have taken versions of this motion round Scotland on various weekends.
I particularly thank one who came all the way to my house in Argyll and
managed to make it at 2 o'clock in the morning. That was the Scottish equivalent
of a Marco Polo journey.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have produced a detailed motion out
of all that work and deliberation, but there is one extremely important
area still unresolved and it will affect the ability of many members to
do their jobs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will talk first about what appears to
have been agreed. This motion is a revolutionary motion. It establishes
what is, I hope, the best, most comprehensive and most transparent scheme
of&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">allowances that
currently exists in any elected body.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the outset of the discussion process,
it was obvious that what this Parliament, every member and every party,
had to do was to sign on to a system that would be completely transparent.
This system requires those in this chamber to account-to the penny-for
all of their allowances. It makes sure that allowances are provided on
the basis of what is expended. The purpose of providing allowances is to
support members in the work that they do. All those points are enshrined
in this motion. I am glad that in the scheme there will be a clear schedule
of publication. That will cover the work and allowances for each member
of the Parliament and for the staff who work for them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The principles of openness and accountability
run through this motion, and are intended to do so. As the years go by
and the allowances are published, I hope that it will become obvious that
members of the Parliament are using the resources provided to them to do
the job that they have to do because these resources are provided by the
people of Scotland for the people of Scotland. Those resources are only
available to members of the Parliament to allow them to undertake the role
for which they have been elected.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The motion is complicated and I do not
want to further complicate the matter by going through every paragraph.
There is a detailed scheme for publication. There is also a scheme for
enforcement so that if any person thinks that allowances are being misused,
there is a way to pick up on that at the earliest notice, and that is in
the interests of every member of this Parliament. There is a scheme for
virement so that money is not misused or is drawn in the right way and
to ensure that we make the proper use of resources. Where we can use resources
more effectively by pooling with one or more members, we should certainly
do so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a scheme for uprating, as it is
important that we do not have this debate every year and that once we have
set the scheme of allowances we leave it alone, unless it does not work
properly. There is a requirement in the scheme that within 18 months it
should be reviewed by an independent group for the Scottish Parliamentary
Corporate Body. That will let us see how well it is working. It would be
wrong for members to return to consider this scheme year after year. We
want a scheme that works well and can move forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The final two rules are important: these
are the rule of equality and the rule of general allowances. The issue
of general allowances is self-explanatory. There need to be allowances
for resources for staff to assist members in their work, allowances to
make sure that offices are run&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">properly, and travel
allowances. There must be an Edinburgh accommodation allowance, which is
always difficult to decide on and was probably the area where there was
the most vociferous debate. Whichever method is used, whether postcodes,
residence in constituencies or drawing a circle on a map is used to decide
the limits, those methods all create anomalies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another principle that runs through this
scheme is that there should be the right of appeal on any decision that
appears unfair. So if members feel that they are being treated unfairly,
for example, if they are two minutes or a couple of miles from one of the
limits in this scheme, they can discuss that with the Scottish Parliamentary
Corporate Body.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is provision for an exceptional needs
allowance where constituencies are too large to be serviced in a single
journey and there is a scheme for an overnight subsistence allowance. There
are travel allowances for staff and family, for we should not forget that
this is a family-friendly Parliament and must be so for members who come
from some distance away. There is a disability allowance, a winding-up
allowance and provision for an independent review.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Then there are some radical innovations.
The allowances code seeks to define and police the way in which allowances
can be used. That will be extremely useful to every member of this Parliament
in ensuring that the scheme works for them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The scheme provides everything that members
need to do their jobs. It arose from the members of the allowances group,
where there was considerable agreement. However, in one area agreement
has not been possible. I greatly regret that, because the issue at the
heart of the disagreement is the issue of equality. Equality of treatment
does not mean, as I have heard endless people say in television and radio
debates, equality of treatment for members of this Parliament. What strikes
at the heart of this motion is that the amendments might prevent equality
of treatment for voters.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Irene Oldfather (Cunninghame South)
(Lab): </strong>Listening to Mr Russell, I cannot contain myself any longer.
I believe it was in October last year that Mr Russell was adopted as the
Scottish National party candidate for the Cunninghame South constituency,
where he stood against me. In the seven months before the election, if
the people of Cunninghame South saw him on more than five occasions we
were very lucky. On occasions the SNP were reduced to playing tapes of
Mr Russell on the main street. He was notable by his absence, and that
must have been frustrating for people in his party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> Order. The
member must resume her seat when I am on my feet. Interventions must be
brief and that intervention was quite long enough. If you wish to speak,
you should press the button and I will call you to speak.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>I am sorry that
the member for Cunninghame South could not contain herself-I was into only
the second sentence of this section, so I am glad that I did not go any
longer. I do not want to pay any attention to that unhelpful intervention.
I refer Ms Oldfather to the point that I made at the beginning of the debate.
We want to have a debate about principles, and we do not want to have that
type of old politics. Let me return to the matter that I was addressing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Equality of treatment is at the heart of
this motion: not equality of treatment for members, but equality of treatment
for voters. By definition of the Scotland Act 1998, every member here is
a constituency member. If people write to this Parliament asking who their
member of the Scottish Parliament is, they get a letter back informing
them that they have eight members. I received such a letter this morning,
which was also copied to Mr Jack McConnell and the Parliament information
office.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A very senior member of the front bench
put it rather well when, in a letter to Lord Neill in August 1998, he wrote,
talking about the Neill committee:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I drew the committee's attention to the
additional provision we have made in the Scotland Bill for individuals
to stand for election at the regional level. The position of these individuals
will technically be the same as a party list, although they may in practice
perceive themselves more as 'super constituency' candidates"-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">not constituency candidates, but super
constituency candidates.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The letter was written by Mr Henry McLeish,
and he goes on to say:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We will of course need to be able to apply
expenses provided to them in a way which is seen to be fair."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What we are trying to do is to provide
a system that is fair. It is fair to say that every member will work as
a constituency member. Indeed, members from lists will work over much larger
constituencies-super constituencies. I could not have put it better myself.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have heard three arguments against treating
constituency and list members as equal. The New Zealand example is much
quoted, especially by the Labour party. It is a false comparison. There
are no list constituency members in New Zealand; they are national members.
The German system makes no differentiation between members. The Welsh system
is the same as ours, and the Labour party has now agreed that allowances
should be the same for all members there.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_9"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a television
debate at the weekend, I heard that it did not matter what happened in
Wales, because it was important that Scotland had the freedom to do what
it wanted. Even if Scotland was to get it wrong, it was important that
it had that freedom. As far as I am concerned, the decision that was taken
in Wales was correct. It was based on a principle that I would ask be used
here. There is no allowances system in the world that is based on the interpretation
by one party of what members of the other parties are likely to do. There
is no allowances system in the world that is based on an interpretation
of the electoral system after the vote. That simply does not work.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the circumstances, I think that both
amendments are unhelpful and I would urge the movers of both amendments
to withdraw them as Mr Andrew Kerr has withdrawn his. Those amendments
will impede the work of this Parliament. We should encourage every member
in this chamber to work as hard as possible for the people who put them
here. The system that is proposed in either of those amendments will damage
that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">While I think that the Liberal Democrat
amendment seeks to help, it is rather curious. It seems to favour parties
that have only one member elected on a regional list, let alone one member
elected on five regional lists. I do not think that is fair. If we are
to have a debate that is honest and straightforward and of the new politics-and
I sincerely hope that we will-we must address that principle. Is there
a principle or not in the Liberal Democrat amendment? I do not believe
that there is.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

wanted policies that would bring an end to the cycle of poverty in Airdrie
and Shotts. That cycle means that one in every five of our children grows
up in poverty, and that one in every three families lives on state benefits.
That is why the new deal is being embraced in my constituency. The people

working on on behalf of the people of Edinburgh West and the people of
Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is a shame that we are debating this
issue in this way. As Mr Russell said, there is no need for us to stoop
to the level of making this a tawdry debate because much of this motion
is welcomed whole-heartedly by all parties. There is only one sticking
point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that members will accept the Liberal
Democrat amendment. The motion is important: it is not about high politics
but about making politics work for people. It is about ensuring that we
give the people of Scotland the quality of service that we want to give
them. It means giving MSPs the tools that they need to do their job.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I dispute the points made by Karen Whitefield.
Every member has been elected to serve the people who elected them. I am
proud to serve the people of Edinburgh West and I know that every other
member is proud to serve the people who sent them here. I do not think
that we should be scoring points against one another on the back of that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important to give MSPs the tools
they need to do their job and to be super MSPs. That means we need staff,
offices, stationery and all the other things that go towards doing the
job. Those items may be boring and uninspiring but, quite frankly, they
are the building blocks of our democracy. Without them we do not do our
job properly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The motion is also about putting in place
an allowances scheme that represents value for money for Scottish taxpayers
and is, as Mr Russell rightly said, open, transparent and subject to scrutiny.
It is about setting down the relationship between members. During the next
18 months and beyond, the relationship between constituency MSPs, of which
I am one, and list MSPs will evolve. I do not think that any member claims
to know exactly where that relationship is going. MSPs have to give one
another respect.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The motion is also about protecting staff
rights and the rights of the public to have access to their MSPs through
surgeries, for example. Each of those is an essential component of a modern
parliamentary democracy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On staff allowances, we support the motion
as it stands. Many of us may think that constituency MSPs will have a bigger
postbag than list MSPs but, as I have said, the relationship will evolve
and I do not believe that anyone can say categorically today how it will
evolve.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of first and second-class MSPs is in the best interests of this Parliament

to accept that approach at this point. We welcome the fact that that issue
will be reviewed. I agree with Mr Russell that we should not return to
it ad infinitum. At the end of 18 months, we will consider whether the
allowance scheme has delivered, not only for us but, most important, for
the people we serve.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All MSPs will have duties that they need
staff to perform. That is why we are happy to support the motion on that
point. Our amendment recognises that MSPs have been elected to represent
different constituencies; there are first-past-the-post and regional list
constituencies. Our view is that it is reasonable to have an office allowance
for the constituency. For constituency MSPs that means an office in their
constituency; for party list MSPs it means, under our amendment, a regional
office to be used by regional members. That maintains the link with the
constituency the MSP was elected to serve and reduces the amount of public
money that is spent on what might prove an unnecessary, and possibly sometimes
confusing, plethora of political offices.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our amendment sets out the details of payments
for all to see. We recognise, however, that while our proposals work well
in cities such as Glasgow, they have limitations in areas such as South
of Scotland, the Highlands and Islands and North-East Scotland, so they
are covered by the exceptional needs allowance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are pleased that the scheme will be
subject to an independent review within 18 months. It would be amazing
if the scheme did not have some teething problems. I welcome all the work
that was done by the members of the group and the supporting officials,
but there will be teething problems and odd things will happen. I call
on the corporate body to keep an eye on the scheme. At the end of the period,
the independent review should be able to propose any necessary changes
and present them to Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Liberal Democrats believe that the issue
of allowances is for Parliament to decide. My group will have a free vote
on the matter, as will some other parties. I hope that colleagues from
all parties will see that the Liberal Democrat amendment gives each and
every member the chance to serve the people of Scotland to the best of
their abilities. I commend it to members for their support.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

We would far rather be talking about other matters. Any diffidence I had
vanished after hearing from Karen Whitefield, because she articulated the
crux of the matter. The tenor of her speech, and its content, was indicative
of the fact that the Labour party is selectively democratic. It is seeking
to deny resources to the Opposition parties to prevent their operating
effectively in areas that it regards as its own baronial fiefdom. I find
that disgraceful.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not recall Miss Whitefield showing
the same concern for prudence with the public purse when she cheerfully
voted with her colleagues in the Labour party and the Liberals to put into
power this bloated Administration. I see from her speeches in the past
that she has not consistently been opposed to public expenditure, so is
it not with some hypocrisy that the Labour party proposes this amendment?
The Labour party is seeking to deny those who might oppose it the opportunity
of doing so effectively.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is a pity that the debate has taken
such a turn. Mike Russell's comments were particularly apposite; much has
been achieved to enable this motion to be debated today. Achieving what
has been achieved thus far must have been an exhaustive and, no doubt,
exhausting process, so it is distressing that the atmosphere has been soured
by what the Administration is seeking to do. What is it afraid of? Does
it feel-Karen Whitefield denied it quite vigorously-that we who are elected
as regional members will suborn Administration members' activities on behalf
of their constituents? That is certainly not the intention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">People must work in partnership. The new
politics decree that people should work in partnership for the better of
the people of Scotland. What is happening today is an attempt to ensure
that that does not happen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mrs Smith's amendment does not find any
great favour. It is a typical Liberal ploy to fly midway between two areas
of conflict. While what she said may have been offered in the spirit of
compromise, it is not likely to have much support from us or the SNP.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Today, we are seeking to achieve a degree

of equality, opportunity and equal rights for all, should be seeking to
deny the Opposition the rights that it deserves-indeed requires-to ensure
that this Parliament works effectively and in the best interests of all
our constituents? It is depressing that Labour should adopt that attitude.

the fact that my first speech in this Parliament is on this matter-a matter
that I, like my colleagues who have already spoken, feel should never have
reached this chamber. It is before us today because of a scheme that has
been dreamed up by new Labour with one simple aim-to stifle all opposition
and to deny the people of Scotland the right of access to the MSP of their
choice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SNP motion is about equality and democracy.
It is about ensuring, for example, that the 83,000 people in West of Scotland
who voted for my colleagues and me should have equal access to us, as their
chosen representatives. That was the whole point of proportional representation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why should someone from Arran or Dumbarton
have to travel to Edinburgh to meet their chosen MSP? There should be no
difference between constituency and list members. We are asking for the
means to serve our constituents-no more, no less.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Labour amendment, by contrast, can
only be described as politically motivated. We can disregard the flowery
words that have been used about the public purse-as we in Ayrshire say,
facts are chiels that winna ding. The facts are that the amendment flies
in the face of the recommendations of the Electoral Reform Society of Great
Britain and Ireland, which says that under PR there should not be two classes
of MSP. It flies in the face of Scottish new Labour's Welsh colleagues,
who describe the position of Labour in Scotland as a kick in the teeth
for proportional representation. It flies in the face of Henry McLeish's
pre-election pledge that all MSPs would be treated equally.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Labour party's posturing about only
trying to protect the public purse is undermined by the fact that under
its amendment it is okay for the Labour party to have 20 constituency offices
in the city of Glasgow, 10 for MSPs and 10 for Westminster MPs-although
we might wonder what the latter will do in their 10 offices. All 20 offices
can be had at the expense of the public purse.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

way as people felt about the allowances that were previously given to the
people in our positions. This is a positive move.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I and all my colleagues recognise that
constituency and list MSPs are of equal value to the public. However, their
roles over the next four years will be weighted differently. Constituency
members will be recognised by local people and organisations, and will
be the first port of call as a matter of course. We have to recognise the
practicalities: most people in a constituency will come to the constituency
MSP first.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mrs Mulligan: </strong>No.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It would be confusing and wasteful if other
members appeared to be doing exactly the same job. It has been said that
if a Tory voter, for example, has a problem, they will want to go to a
Tory MSP, but such a course is unnecessary: problems are not party political
and we should not be playing games with the issues that people raise with
us. I will represent all Linlithgow constituents, whether they voted for
me or not. I am sure that other constituency MSPs feel the same way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must recognise that if people go to
a list MSP-I would not want to stop them doing so if that was their choice-they
will be supported. Amendment S1M-40.1 recognises that there will be occasions
when people go to a list MSP and it provides financial support for that.
Allowances will be made available for list MSPs who are contacted in that
way-proportional allowances. I thought that we were all in favour of proportionality
these days.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The term "allowances" has perhaps been
misused. All MSPs will receive the same wage, the same right to speak in
Parliament and its committees and the same right to vote on all issues.
The allowance is for a particular task: giving constituents a local place
to go-the office-and providing support staff.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We believe that there are strong arguments
for parity and are supported in that view by no less a person than Scotland's
First Minister, Mr Donald Dewar. On 25 March 1998, he wrote a letter to
the Senior Salaries Review Body on the subject of salaries and allowances.
He wrote:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"In considering these matters, no distinction
is to be made between the salaries etc of members of the Scottish Parliament
elected under the normal constituency system and those elected under the
regional additional member system".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Read in context, it is quite clear that
his letter related to allowances as well as to salaries. It cannot be dismissed
as mere election rhetoric.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Senior Salaries Review Body said in
its summary of its response:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Members of the devolved bodies would require
the equivalent of two full-time staff"-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and that</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"there are other office-related costs to
be covered, such as the rent of constituency offices or the hire of rooms
for surgeries. We recommend that Members may make vouched claims against
an annual allowance."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It made no distinction whatever between
different types of members of Parliament and it had been told not to make
any.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Henry McLeish was quoted in <i>The Scotsman

that a two-tier system would be a backward step.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I believe that the case that is advanced
on behalf of New Zealand misses the essential point that Mr Michael Russell
picked up: that list MPs there do not have individual constituencies. In
this country they most certainly do. We should aim for parity, which is
why the motion provides for local office costs allowances as well as for
exceptional needs. The justification for local office costs is that list
MSPs represent a huge area; for example, South of Scotland is approaching
the size of Wales, stretching from Prestwick airport in the west to the
fishing harbour of Eyemouth on the east coast. Several offices will be
necessary in a regional constituency of that size if the job is to be done
to high standards. The same considerations apply to the Highlands and Islands
and North-East Scotland constituencies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A positive decision on the motion would

place at all. As Mike Russell said, most of the provisions of the motion
were reached by consensus. It is a pity that that consensus has been cast
aside by the Labour party. It serves none of us well in the eyes of the
public that in this Parliament so far we have done little other than to
discuss ourselves.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This debate should be about parity, principle
and the Parliament itself-and about recognition that all MSPs are equal
and that none is more equal than others. This debate is about principle
in the shape of the Parliament. What we agree today will be difficult to
change; other parties would be well advised to consider that point. The
staff allowances and office accommodation allowances are not for the benefit
of MSPs but are to allow us to do our jobs well and, most important, to
provide a service to the people we represent. Until 6 May there was widespread
acceptance that all MSPs would be treated equally and that constituents
would have a choice of MSP to approach. It is a pity that Henry McLeish
is not here to hear this again. He told the House of Commons in May 1998:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The Scottish people value their Parliament
and want it to work for them. The nation does not want the Parliament to
work for any political party."-[<i>Official Report, House of Commons</i>,

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ms Whitefield would do well to remember

Henry McLeish's words are a bit hollow considering the events of the past

We should not, however, be too parochial when we are discussing a global

good governance of Scotland. That is a tremendous honour, privilege and
responsibility.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I point out, as have others, that regional
members have huge areas to cover, with large populations. In common with
Tricia Marwick, I have had pieces of information and bits of requests from

the north coast and something from Dundee on the Tay. I shall follow up

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In his article, the First Minister talks
about allowances based on work load. That is a pile of absolute nonsense,
as I am sure Labour members who have recently left council chambers will
agree. In Scotland today, there is sheer political inequality. Councillors,
who are at the very bottom of the political ladder, get &pound;6,000 a
year in allowances, and they deal in the first instance with the overwhelming
number of cases concerning local issues. In other words, local councillors'
work loads are higher in most respects than those of members of the Westminster
Parliament, who get a personal salary of &pound;47,000 with another &pound;50,000
or so in allowances. Councillors' work loads are certainly greater than
those of our Euro MPs, whose salaries are &pound;47,000 with another &pound;53,000
on top, and many of whom are the Lord Lucans of Scottish political life.
That is why the idea that allowances will somehow be based on work load
is nonsense.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

for themselves. Rather, it is about MSPs being able to employ assistants,

I heard Jack McConnell on the radio this morning saying that all MSPs were
equal. I refer to a cutting in <i>The Herald</i>, about Henry McLeish.
As devolution minister, he said in evidence to the Scottish Affairs Committee
last July:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The key notion is to make sure we have
no two-tier membership. Everyone has a role to play and everyone will be

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yet what are we getting this afternoon?
We are getting a distinct difference. Speaker after speaker has made it
plain that the money will not go into MSPs' pockets-it is for allowances.
James Douglas-Hamilton mentioned the South of Scotland region and the vast
area that it covers. Even the West of Scotland region covers a vast area,
from the northern point of Loch Lomond down to the East Ayrshire district
boundary, over to the west, including areas such as Arran and Cumbrae,
and over to the central belt.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I wonder about the minority parties. Mr
Presiding Officer, you are clearly an independent now, and quite rightly
so, but with your stature, many constituents might make approaches to you.
Will you be denied equality because you are not a member of the Liberal
Democrat party in this chamber? You took that decision. Where does the
Presiding Officer stand in this instance?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I return to the question of equality. Tommy
Sheridan is right; he and I served together in the same council in Glasgow.
In many local authorities, councillors are often the front-line troops,
yet they are paid less than anyone.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the case in Eastwood? If I use that office, will it get no share of the

designed to dampen down those fears, to deal with the problem and to suggest
a reasonable formula. Staff allowances should be the same for list and

a good debate, as debates go, but it is unseemly that it has had to take
place at all. The matter could have been dealt with beforehand. I say to

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although I have made several attempts to
get the information, it seems that no terms and conditions have been determined.
As we wish to be good employers, it is inconceivable that we should not

Workers Union, which negotiates on behalf of the parliamentary staff in
Westminster and of which I happen to be a member.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

line, which says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the Tories, who did not want a minimum wage or the limitations that result
from a 48-hour working week. The members' information pack, which was very
helpfully put together for us, tells members how to get their staff to
opt out of the 48-hour rule. I hope that, after all the talk of family-friendly
policies, no member of this Parliament attempts to do that-especially those
of us who are wearing ribbons to show support for the Carers National Association.
I do not believe that anybody-certainly not a member of this Parliament-should
ask his or her staff to work more than 48 hours a week.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

all members, whether they be constituency or list members. I was elected
to do a job in Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. I fully intend to do that
job and I expect the list members to do theirs. Their job is no less valuable
than mine, but it is different. List members are here to ensure political
balance; they have different responsibilities and there may be different
requirements to allow them to fulfil those responsibilities. Neither I

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Jackson will raise
during members' business today. I went to Kinross to meet party workers
and to Cupar for a meeting. I went through, I think, five constituencies,
whereas the First Minister went only to his constituency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the First Minister and members such
as Mr Salmond and Mr Swinney, who were at Westminster, know-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>I do not have time to
give way, but I will give way the next time if I can.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A member's job is as elastic as he or she
chooses to make it, and that is true for both regional and constituency
members. In my view, we need the same resources-and parity and equality
of treatment-so that we can serve our voters equally. That was Mr Russell's
crucial point, and I agree with him.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">16:46</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mike Watson (Glasgow Cathcart) (Lab):
</strong>A lot of cant and hypocrisy has been in evidence during this debate
and I do not agree with anyone, from whatever party, who said that they
regret having to speak during it. We have this period before the Parliament
assumes its powers so that we can get such matters out of the way before
we get down to serious business. We cannot bring 1 July forward any faster
than it will come naturally, so we should deal with these issues when we
have the opportunity to do so, before the Parliament's business comes along.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I thought it illuminating that Mr Russell
said, in his opening remarks, that we must not have two classes of MSP
and then immediately went on to say that he represents a super-constituency,
while the rest of us represent ordinary constituencies. Presumably he is
a super-MSP and I am just a fairly average, run-of-the-mill MSP. Let us
be honest and look logically at this issue. It is not a question of whether
there is a distinction between the two kinds of MSP because-I am sorry,
Michael-quite clearly there is. There are three ways of looking at the
issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first is dealt with in the scheme.
No one is suggesting that everyone should get the Edinburgh accommodation
allowance-for obvious reasons-and three classes have been suggested for
the way in which that allowance should be paid.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly-this is important for Mr Russell-there
is not uniformity in the way in which, should he pop his clogs, he would
be replaced and how I would be replaced should the same thing happen to
me. Difficult though the task would be of filling Mr Russell's shoes-if
one could get close&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">enough-he is not
arguing that he should be replaced by someone who has submitted themselves
to the electorate. It is important to note that. The next person on the
SNP's list would be brought into the Parliament, because that is the system.
There is not uniformity there, and I have not heard any complaints about
that. There is also not uniformity in the way in which the regional members
and constituency members come here. Ten regional members-quite rightly
and properly-did not even have to submit themselves to the electorate in
a constituency contest. They were entitled to do that, but we should not
let that happen and then say that there has to be absolute uniformity and
that we are all the same.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thirdly, I agree that every MSP is equal,
but every MSP does not and, I suggest, will not have the same work load.
Today's debate is really about staffing and costs allowances. The situation
in Wales has been mentioned several times. Are we arguing that we should
be measuring ourselves against Wales? Do we want the legislative powers
of the Welsh Assembly? Do we want the salaries that the Welsh Assembly
members are paid? Sorry, Tommy, you probably think we should.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, the analogy with Wales is not
important as there are other countries, such as New Zealand-which was mentioned
earlier-Germany and Spain that offer instructive examples at federal and
regional level. Regional members tend to spend their weekends where the
Parliament is, and go less often to their constituencies. It has been proven
over a number of years in the Bundestag and in the L&auml;nder Parliaments,
and in the Cortes and the Spanish regional governments, that regional members
are given less constituency case work. That is a matter of fact and of
concern.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We cannot try to change the system after
it is in place-which is why it is important that we get things right today.
The public furore that has arisen around today's debates is nothing; just
watch if we try to open up this issue again in 18 months' time, when the
review comes around. It will be extremely difficult. That is why we must
grasp the nettle today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I suggest that it is likely that the roles
of list and constituency members will differ. Both have equal value in
this chamber. List members were brought here to provide political balance
and it is important that they do so, but it is only fair to recognise-as
Karen Whitefield's amendment does-that they will not have the same constituency
representational role.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

two minutes each to Ben Wallace and Andy Kerr before the summing-up speeches,
so please be brief.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ben Wallace (North-East Scotland) (Con):
</strong>I want to do the decent thing and congratulate Karen Whitefield on
her maiden speech. I do not necessarily agree with the content of her speech,
but we all need to go through the experience. In fact, I got the maiden
telling-off.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yesterday, I was up in Aberdeenshire meeting
Conservative councillors. I am delighted to represent the people of Dundee,
of Banff and Buchan, of West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, of Angus and
of Aberdeen. They all elected me and members of the SNP who are here not
as constituency, but as regional, MSPs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When I came back late last night in a taxi,
the taxi driver said, "You're all the same. You don't represent us. I wrote
a letter to one party-no answer. I wrote a letter to another party and
waited three weeks-no answer." Every time we politicians fail-either on
purpose or by neglect-to respond to the need of a constituent, we do not
damage our party; we damage democracy. Every time we do that because of
our work load or other commitments, we damage the Scottish Parliament.
Giving list members parity and the ability to represent people will strengthen
democracy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I understand why the Liberal Democrats
and members of other parties might be worried that we have some devious
agenda to undermine them. I can give an assurance that I am a professional
and I hope that I will concentrate on certain issues-not, for example,
to undermine Mike Rumbles whom I stood against, but to provide better representation
for the people in the region. Their money and their votes have put me and
Mike Rumbles into this chamber. I therefore ask that members back the SNP
motion to give list members parity in representation, because representation
of the people counts for far more than the interests of MSPs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">16:52</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Andy Kerr (East Kilbride) (Lab):
</strong>I too believe in parity and equality, but I also believe that there
is a difference between the jobs of list MSPs and the jobs of constituency
MSPs. That is simply a fact of life that we will have to live with.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was elected as a first-past-the-post
representative primarily to look after the interests of the people of East
Kilbride, who will come to me with constituency matters. They have already
done so through the two surgeries that I have held, through phoning me
at home and through writing to me. That is my role and we do not need another
MSP simply shadowing that role at the taxpayers' expense.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I will not give way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is against the principles and the great
spirit of this Parliament for someone to purport to be a shadow MSP for
an area and to be reported in the local papers as being the local MSP when
they clearly are not.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">List MSPs were elected to achieve proportionality.
They are equal in the job, but in a different job, which is what Karen
Whitefield's amendment is all about. We must support the amendment because
list MSPs and constituency MSPs play different roles in the community.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should reject the partnership of greed
between the Conservatives and the SNP, which does not recognise the roles
that we play in our constituencies. It is misleading to talk about second-class
MSPs when the issue in question is value for money. We have to recognise
that list MSPs play a different role from constituency MSPs and I therefore
beg members to support Karen Whitefield's amendment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>I have to say that
I am disappointed by the debate this afternoon. In my opening remarks,
I talked about the need to have a dignified debate. I discussed that in
a telephone conversation with Jack McConnell on Sunday night. It is a horrific
thought that on Sunday nights Jack McConnell and I have to speak to each
other, but we agreed and this morning I made the same point to Mr McCabe.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is to be regretted that there has been
no such restraint and dignity in most of the speeches that we have heard,
especially from Labour members, and particularly from Mr McConnell. Like
Robert Brown, I do not recognise Mr McConnell's account of the allowances
group. I remember that after giving a lecture on the need for public prudence-shortly
after his appointment and before his department spent &pound;600,000 on
special advisers-Mr McConnell left the building and got into his chauffeur-driven
car. Being lectured on prudence by a man who leaves in a chauffeur-driven
car sticks in the craw.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I regret the way in which Labour members
have treated most of these matters. I am sure that Ms Whitefield has a
passion for Airdrie-she expressed it in lengthy terms-but she has no passion
for democracy. That came out in the&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">memorable words
of Johann Lamont. She said that self-interest dressed up as principle is
still self-interest. I think that a number of members condemn themselves
out of their own mouths. There is an important principle, which was embodied
by something Mr McLeish said on 28 January 1998 during the committee stage
of the Scotland Bill. He said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Once elected, a regional Member will have
the same rights and responsibilities as any other Member."-[<i>Official
Report, House of Commons</i>, 28 January 1998; Vol 305, c 444.]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is impossible to know exactly how things
will turn out, but look at that pile of correspondence on Mr Harper's desk.
There is no doubt that there will be a heavy weight of constituency responsibility
on list members, who have a constituency. I stress that they have a constituency,
which is obvious from the debate that we have had and from debates on the
Scotland Act 1998. In the circumstances, it would have been better-and
wiser-if the Labour party had not indulged in what Tommy Sheridan called
an act of political spite. That is what we are seeing today and it is regrettable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The motion is worthy of support in its
own terms. It preaches equality and transparency and those things are in
it. I will say one thing to Irene Oldfather. I am flattered that I am at
the centre of her attentions and that she follows every movement that I
make in Irvine. I promise her that for the next four years I shall be in
Irvine regularly and shall hold surgeries in Irvine, as the code allows
me to do. I shall work in Irvine and I look forward to the next Scottish
