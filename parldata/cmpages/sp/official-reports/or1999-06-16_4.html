Officer:</strong> I am sorry, Mr Ewing. Could you start again, because the microphone
was not on?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>Will Tavish Scott
acknowledge that just last week I received a letter from the Labour Government
at Westminster stating that it rules out the possibility of a variable
VAT rate on fuel? What specific proposals will the Liberal Democrat party
put forward to deal with the crisis in the Highlands and Islands-which
have the highest fuel duty in Europe, if not the western world-given that,
as Tavish Scott has indicated, this Parliament lacks the power to turn
the fuel escalator downward?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Mr Ewing may be aware
that the European Union has examined this question several times, and that
member states have the right to argue the case for varying the rate of
VAT for individual parts of the EU that are recognised as peripheral. If
he is saying that we as the Scottish Parliament should take a view on that
and make a strong case for such variation, I agree. I will certainly be
doing so, as it is very important.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to finish by commenting on the land
reform bill. The debate should be not only about land, but about the sea
bed and its ownership. Those of us who represent areas where the salmon
industry is extremely important should recognise that the land reform policy
group document "Recommendations for Action" includes the sentence:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The Scottish Law Commission should be
invited to undertake a comprehensive review of the law of the foreshore
and seabed, with a view to reform."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is very welcome and I hope that it
can be taken forward. The industry is losing &pound;1.4 million from its
kitty-&pound;1.4 million out of its ability to invest. That is a production
tax that an industry in great need of restructuring and reinvestment should
not have to pay. I hope, therefore, that the ownership of the sea bed can
be considered in the context of the land reform bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

do so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

into ScotRail's running of the Edinburgh to Glasgow express. The company

such is the size of the press corps and the number of MSPs coming through
from Glasgow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When he spoke this morning, the First Minister
asked for constructive dialogue and debate. I agree. For the record, it
is important to highlight some of the serious weaknesses in what was presented
this morning. One of those weaknesses is the lack of a quality of life
bill, designed to look fundamentally at the serious poverty pervading all
corners of Scotland, not just among the unemployed, but among the low-paid,
students, pensioners and those who are, in modern-day parlance, socially
excluded.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I find it unacceptable that the elected
Scottish Parliament, whose first priority should be to tackle the scourge
of poverty, is not prepared to set targets. I want to know in two, three
and four years' time the progress that this Parliament has made in tackling
the scourge of poverty. Whether they are simplistic targets or not, as
the First Minister said this morning, we need targets to measure the success
or failure of this Parliament in addressing that priority.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the local government bill, we have to
consider the detailed McIntosh report, which looks at local government
from all angles, but Governments are there to govern: they should always
be prepared to give political direction to committees of inquiry. We should
consider the results, but also the political priorities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The large number of members who spoke today
about support for progressive taxation means that there must be a base
of support in this chamber for the early abolition of the council tax in
Scotland. The council tax is an acutely regressive piece of taxation. In
1988, under the old rates system, the differential between a small tenement
in Govan and a large mansion in Pollokshields was 14:1-the wealthier parts
of Glasgow paid 14 times more than the poorer parts. The differential today
is 3:1. By any standard or measure, that is regressive taxation, so I hope
that, as part of the local government bill, we will bring forward an early
piece of legislation saying that we want to replace the regressive council
tax with a progressive local income tax that specifically exempts our pensioners,
students, disabled and unemployed and generates more income from those
with the ability to pay. We would then have a differential of 10:1, rather
than 3:1.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know that I do not hold the monopoly
of concern about housing, but I hope that others are as puzzled and dismayed
as I am that there is not a specific housing bill. There is a serious housing
problem in Scotland and the green paper, which took its final reports on
31 May, inspired some very positive responses from the City of Glasgow
Council and COSLA on the creation of a national&nbsp;</font></td>

of planning with housing to regenerate both rural and urban communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Margaret Vass, the
depute director of city housing in Glasgow, said, when Glasgow was offering
houses for the Kosovar refugees-and I make no criticism of that-that there
was an abundance of housing in Glasgow, and that this was available for
the refugees. If there is such a housing shortage in Mr Sheridan's area,
why did she make such a statement?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>That is why we need
a housing committee and more informed debate, because then Phil would realise
that the homelessness problem in Scotland is different in rural and urban
areas. In urban areas the problem is to do with the standard of housing
that is available, not the number of houses that are available. The difficulty
that we have to address in cities like Glasgow is that we have a great
many houses, but they need serious renovation and repair. Money was spent
on upgrading houses in the Red Road flats to provide homes for the Kosovar
refugees, which I am sure Phil will be pleased about. He wants to intervene
again.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Thank you for letting
me come back. If that is the case, is the honourable gentleman saying that
it is far better that people sleep on the streets rather than in the houses
in Glasgow that are available for let?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>I did not say that.
Sometimes when I debate with Phil I give the argument some credibility
by answering the questions. I think the standard of debate has fallen so
low that that question does not deserve an answer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was at her funeral yesterday; she was
aged four and a half. Natasha plunged from the window of her home-a little
child who just ran to the window. I saw similar windows in the same block;
they give way instantly. In Glasgow we have 57,000 council houses with
windows that range from dodgy to unsafe; 30,000 do not even have basic
safety catches. That is why that child died. We do not need to wait for
the outcome of the autopsy. The child fell straight on her head on to concrete.
Her fall was witnessed by other little children and by neighbours and,
if the Parliament is going to be family friendly, I must appeal to the
members on the other side of the chamber to show proof of that-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>I hope that Natasha's
family does not take umbrage at our raising this matter. It is of practical
importance to the Parliament because there is a regulation that was introduced
by the Tories to pay back capital receipts. It means that any council in
Scotland that sells any of their property or land cannot use the proceeds
to improve their existing housing stock. We used to be able to do it until
four years ago when the Tories introduced that regulation. Two years ago,
Labour opposed it and said that they would repeal it. If the First Minister

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Elaine Thomson (Aberdeen North) (Lab):
</strong>Although there were many valuable proposals in the First Minister's
statement this morning, I particularly welcome the measures in the forthcoming
transport bill. Aberdeen City Council has been at the forefront of developing
innovative and forward-looking transport strategies, using both bus priority
measures and park-and-ride schemes, and I am delighted that that has been
recognised.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Aberdeen has one of the fastest-growing
rates of car ownership in Scotland, which is increasingly causing severe
congestion. A local transport strategy has now been developed to meet that
challenge and to meet the needs of some 40 per cent of the population who
do not have access to a car. The park-and-ride schemes and the bus lanes
are integral to that policy. The route from the Bridge of Don, in the northern
part of my constituency, is increasingly heavily used; its use is growing
by some 20 per cent a year. Aberdeenshire Council is now considering running
a similar park-and-ride scheme from Ellon, a major commuter town to the
north of Aberdeen. This Parliament's transport bill will support and extend
the efforts of local councils and transport operators, to allow better
long-term planning and the regulation of bus services. That would mean,
for example, allowing the development of services from Aberdeen to the
industrial estates around the city, where many people work, while improving
the flow of traffic for those who must use their cars.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The way for the future has to be an increased
use of buses and other forms of public transport that are of high quality
and that provide a frequent service that is accessible to everybody; for
instance, through the use of kneeling buses. That will be a plus for the
environment and will improve the flow of traffic. From personal experience,
I know how bus lanes can improve journey times, making the bus the simplest
and most stress-free way of travelling. However, the use of buses is still
declining, and that situation needs to be reversed. The proposals that
have been outlined today will provide the necessary framework to do that,
a key feature of which will be the development of partnerships between
all the people who are involved-local authorities, transport operators
and, most important, transport users-to provide seamless journeys with
through-ticketing and well-thought-out timetabling. I look forward to the
legislation becoming law and meeting the transport needs of the Scottish
population in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP): </strong>I
will confine my remarks to the remit of the Minister for Justice which,
in this Parliament, includes justice, equality and land reform. Specifically,
I will address the proposals in the Government's legislative programme,
which was set out this morning, and suggest some omissions. That may be
a novel approach to a debate on the legislative programme but, nevertheless,
I shall try it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In his statement this morning, the First
Minister made it quite clear that land reform is perceived as a major plank
of the Government's first-year programme. I do not think that three, four
or five parties, or the independent member in this chamber, would object
to that. I am never certain quite where the Conservatives sit on land reform;
there is always the suspicion that they are opposed to any suggestion of
reform. I would be interested to hear whether they welcome any of what
was suggested this morning.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>I assure Roseanna
Cunningham that we would not welcome the SNP's proposals for a series of
bureaucratic land councils-bunches of interfering busybodies who know nothing
about the management of the land in charge of which the SNP would put them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>That is interesting.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would have liked to see a few of our
proposals being announced this morning but, regrettably, they were not.
There can be no objection to the principles in the two proposed bills.
There will be a widespread, but not universal, welcome to an end to feudal
tenure. We must all agree that that is long overdue. I recall that, during
an adjournment debate in what we are now calling another place, Alex Salmond
led us through what can only be described as a dismal catalogue of outrages
perpetrated by the so-called raider of the lost titles.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I look forward to seeing the draft bill,
just as I look forward to seeing the other draft bill-the land reform bill
as opposed to the bill for the abolition of feudal tenure. It might be
a slight overstatement to say, as the First Minister did this morning,
that there is enthusiasm for the land reform policy group's proposals.
It would be fairer to say that there is resignation to the fact that, although
there will be some movement, the more wide-ranging reforms are not going
to take place.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am concerned that we are not approaching
land reform in the way that might once have been expected. Land reform
is not just a legal reform; it is also a social reform. I appreciate that
issues of social reform and social justice often tend to be seen as purely
urban matters, but they are not; they have a strong rural element.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

right to buy is important. I absolutely support that, as I have supported
the communities in Eigg and in Assynt, but-and this is a big but-how often
will communities actually want to exercise that right? When thinking about
land reform, I like to set my own test, which I call the Blackford test.
It may be a little parochial, as the Blackford estate is in my constituency,
but it is one of the largest estates in Scotland and perhaps one of the
worst perpetrators of some of the unfortunate practices that are possible
under the present system of land ownership.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When I hear proposals for land reform,
I always think of the Blackford estate and ask myself what those proposals
would do to change the situation there. It is only 30 to 45 minutes up
the road; we do not have to go right up north to the western Highlands
to see some pretty atrocious examples of land management. Will the proposed
legislation do anything to help? It might have prevented the period of
speculation as to where and with whom the ownership of Blackford was based.
Beyond that, I do not see how the legislation would make any difference.
People in the community in Blackford and the surrounding area do not want
to own the estate. The ability to buy the estate is neither here nor there
as far as they are concerned. They have spent years watching perfectly
habitable farmhouses being allowed to fall into dereliction. They are totally
frustrated by that, and all they want is some input and some say in what
is happening on the estate. Although I welcome what is proposed, none of
it will make the slightest difference to that estate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Land reform is about more than the issues
that are being addressed. The Executive may intend to tackle other aspects
later in the legislative programme or in the years to come. If that is
the intention, I hope to hear a word or two about it in the closing speech,
which I understand will be delivered by Mr Wallace.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When he replies, I would like Mr Wallace
to clarify a minor point about the section of the proposal that relates
to national parks where there is a reference to legislating for access.
Is it the Executive's intention that the access legislation will be a stand-alone
bill, or will it be subsumed by the legislation on national parks? That
is an important clarification. Until now, we have always assumed that access
legislation will be dealt with quite separately.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I welcome the announcement of the incapable adults bill. Shorn of its most
controversial clauses, it will be regarded as a long-overdue reform that

would like them to be addressed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is unfortunate that, as well as omitting
more extensive land reform legislation, the Executive has missed the opportunity
to introduce a Scottish freedom of information bill. I know that there
is to be a statement on it next week, which I anticipate with interest,
but how much more of a signal could we have sent out to Scotland if, as
one of our first major pieces of legislation, we had done a freedom of
information bill? That would have shown that this Parliament really is
going to be different-particularly if the bill was more generous than its
Westminster equivalent. It would have been a big legislative set piece
that would have made people sit up and notice. Sadly, that is not going
to happen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are other missed areas and opportunities.
There is no mainstream justice legislation. There are two areas where,
I feel certain, there would have been cross-party support and therefore
a speedy passage through Parliament. That must be taken into account: not
all these bills will take the same amount of time to go through Parliament.
Some smaller bills that would have been given speedy approval could have
been introduced, so their absence is all the more puzzling. Why are there
no proposals for changing both civil and criminal law to enable domestic
violence to be dealt with in a speedier, more effective and more sensitive
way? Why are we not addressing the problem of Scots-born but overseas-raised
individuals who are convicted of serious crimes and then dumped back on
Scotland without warning? There have been back-bench calls from all parties
on those matters. I see the First Minister screwing his face up, but some
of his own Westminster back benchers have called for action on that latter
point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My final comment is triggered by the First
Minister's reference to Westminster legislation. Among the many things
that have bedevilled Scotland's justice system is the fact that important
changes are made in civil or criminal law by tacking on odd clauses from
what is essentially English and Welsh legislation, or by stuffing a series
of unrelated measures higgledy-piggledy into a so-called law reform (miscellaneous
provisions) (Scotland) bill. I hope that we will see the end of the latter
practice, but I am concerned about the continuation of the former one.
It is happening even now, and I seek an assurance that it will be well
and truly seen off.</font></td>

for the Executive, although I notice that it was mentioned last. I am sure
that that will not be reflected by the impetus that will be given to the
bill when it is introduced and we are given more detail. Education became
a key issue during the election campaign. All areas of education-not just
tuition fees, but pre-school education, higher still and other issues-gained
new importance, and that is welcome.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Also welcome is the opportunity for greater
consultation. As the Parliament does not have a second chamber to scrutinise
the legislation we pass, it is all the more important that we go the extra

I will be interested to hear the detail of what will be in the education
bill. For the moment, we have only the soundbites.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

control of education and will include provisions to meet promises in respect

is included in any proposals, but that Jordanhill School in Glasgow is
too.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

positions and pupils, so that there is now a waiting list. It has managed
to improve standards of education through various tests, and through the
yardsticks that it uses for measurement, and it has done so at a lower
cost than the average cost at other schools in Stirling. It will be interesting
to see the detail surrounding the debate on self-governing schools.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: </strong>Is not the amount
of funding that has been given to St Mary's equal to all that given by
Stirling Council to all the other schools in its area? That may be why
there is a big waiting list for the school.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>I suggest that Dr Jackson
waits until the meeting she is to have soon with St Mary's to find out
the real details. She will find that the additional funding that was programmed
by Central Regional Council was later spent by St Mary's, so the idea that
the school was given special treatment is erroneous.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Similarly, I will be interested to see
whether the bill tackles the problem of four-and-a-half-year-old children
who are not yet ready to go to primary school and should stay at nursery
school. That issue came up during the election and the Conservatives gave
a commitment that funding should be available for children in that situation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I see that there are proposals to place
a duty on local authorities to raise standards. We are all in favour of
motherhood and apple pie, and we all want standards to be raised, but how
that is proposed will be in the detail. Will local authorities be given
sole responsibility for helping underperforming teachers to improve and,
if they cannot improve, for removing them from the teaching profession?
That debate has been going on between the Educational Institute of Scotland,
the other teaching unions, the General Teaching Council for Scotland and
local authorities for two or three years. I will be interested to see what
line the Executive decides to take.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the short time before the new Executive
was appointed, there was a variety of proposals. Whichever one the Executive
favours, it will be a controversial choice because, while we need to improve
teaching standards, we also need to ensure that teachers can do the job
to the best of their ability and, if they cannot, that help is available
to them. If, even after that, teachers cannot deliver the required standard
of teaching, the profession should accept that they may have to find more
suitable jobs. We should put children first. That will, in turn, raise
the professional recognition and standards of teachers-and it is why the
EIS is ready to meet half way on the issue and find some way to deal with
a problem that is not as large as some politicians like to make out.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Having looked at the issues of detail,
I doubt whether many of them will be dealt with. While there will be many
parts that the Conservatives can support, I have no doubt that much of
the bill will show that Labour continues with its mean-spirited crusade
against private provision, private initiative and plurality in our education
system and that it worships the monolithic god of municipal socialism.
We will continue to oppose that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

has been laid before us, members of the Parliament have wanted only to
add to the legislative programme. Each member, in each speech, has introduced
to the debate a different aspect to which they would like priority to be
given. That emphasises the difficulty that the Executive faced in introducing
only eight bills to put through the Parliament over the next year. Each
of us has our own priorities, but the Executive has made a great attempt
to include bills that will address social justice. That is what will be
important in this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In particular, I welcome the education
bill. We all realise that standards must continue to be raised and that
we have to make demands of our education system, of our teachers and of
ourselves as parents to raise standards. We all welcome proposals that
raise standards.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also welcome the stated position that
education will stay within local authority control. That is one of the
issues on which there has been some discussion about whether the Parliament
will seek to assume powers that presently rest with local authorities.
I am pleased that we are saying clearly that education will stay under
local control, but within a national framework.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will highlight one area in which that
issue has caused some difficulties. Following local government reorganisation
some years ago, many local authorities found that they did not have adequate
special education needs provision. They have tried to address that difficulty
over recent years, but special education provision involves particular
problems. I am very supportive of children with special education needs
remaining in the main stream and being given support to continue there,
but some children and young people are unable to do that and therefore
need to attend special education schools.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that we will ensure in the education
bill that the general discussion about raising standards includes special
education schools. It is important that we continue to make demands on
them to continue to improve the education they provide. I hope that the
bill will allow for partnership between local authorities so that they
can share their expertise and experience. I also hope that the bill will
allow for partnership with the voluntary sector-for example with Capability
Scotland, which runs some special education schools-so that we can benefit
from its experience. Most important of all, I would welcome partnership
with parents, because it is important that parents feel that their views
on special education are being taken into account.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alasdair Morgan (Galloway and Upper
Nithsdale) (SNP):</strong> In his statement, the First Minister talked about
Westminster legislating on devolved matters, which we have already discussed
in this chamber. He said that Westminster will legislate on devolved subjects
only if consent has specifically been given after due process. What, precisely,
is meant by due process? What arrangements are foreseen in this Parliament
for that due process? Who will give the consent, the Administration or
the Parliament as a whole? How specific will the consent be? Will it simply
be to the long title of the bill, or will it be to the detail? If it is
the latter-this is a point that I have raised already-what will happen
if the bill is then amended substantially at Westminster?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When we discussed this matter previously,
I referred to this chamber's ability to repeal Westminster legislation
and suggested that some inertia might be involved. The problem is not just
inertia. One problem centres on the ability of anyone other than the Executive
to introduce a bill that might be considered by this chamber. Does the
minister foresee any mechanism whereby members other than those in the
Administration might seek to repeal parts of an act on a devolved area
that has been passed at Westminster? We should have a convention between
the two parliaments that says that what has been devolved should stay devolved.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Rural areas are represented significantly
in this Parliament. That is quite right as rural areas are more important,
proportionally, to Scotland than they are to the rest of the United Kingdom.
Earlier today, it seemed as if we were going to get a National Farmers
Union of Scotland debate. Every part of the Executive's programme impacts
on rural areas-education, housing, social work and transport. They affect
rural areas in a special way because of the special circumstances of those
areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also welcome the land reform bills as
an important part of the progress in updating our legal system. One slightly
cautionary note about the land reform bills is that although there are
clearly some serious problems in the north of Scotland, some of the issues
are much less salient in the south of Scotland. Indeed, some of the large
estates in the south of Scotland are the focus of much extremely valuable
economic activity and of high levels of employment, so we do not necessarily
have to consider a solution for the whole of Scotland. We must ensure that
in solving problems in the north we do not create them in the south. I
am sure that we can deal with that in consultation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On agriculture, I was interested in Alex
Johnstone's speech. I think he will agree that a number of things can be
done without legislation, particularly in areas such as the overshoot problems
in arable aid. Those problems have been caused by an inaccurate base area,
which has not been revised since it was introduced seven years ago. I am
sure that the Minister for Rural Affairs will welcome some discussion on
the issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In England, there is no ceiling on the
countryside premium scheme, but in Scotland there is a low ceiling. The

much can be done by the Executive and I look forward to the Rural Affairs
Minister dealing with a number of the issues.</font></td>

where enterprise and success in business, industry and the arts are admired,
not despised; where the old are treated with dignity and respect; where
communities do not have to wake up in the morning to the depressing outlook
of ruined streets and rundown estates; where people can walk without fear
and our children can play without being exposed to the monsters that prey
on our society; and where people have the dignity of work and the opportunity

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should be able to tell people to raise
their sights and their hopes. For a little while this morning, I thought
that the First Minister shared my vision, but, alas, I was disappointed.
The problem with this Administration is that it does not realise that,
in order to see the stars, we must raise our eyes above the horizon. If
it were able to realise that, perhaps it might put at the forefront of
its policies the agenda of improving the prospects of the people of Scotland
and the next generation. We have a duty to educate them in our schools,
to cure them in our hospitals, to protect them from the monsters that we
have allowed to enter their world, to provide them with an opportunity
to work and to lead fulfilling lives in a country not blighted by pollution
and neglect and to free them from the selfishness of the worst landlords
of all, the Labour local authorities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is easy to be generous with other people's

he seems to have got his sums wrong.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to the absence of health legislation. Most important-this is at the core
of today's debate-comments were made by Margaret Curran, Michael McMahon,
Tommy Sheridan and Fiona Hyslop about the social agenda of the Parliament
and its aspirations. However, there is nothing in the legislative programme
to give that shape and form.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important that the Deputy First Minister
should respond to a couple of specific points that were raised during the

to address some of the important issues that McIntosh raised, which are
absent from and not touched by the legislative programme. We need reassurance

We must be aware of what is expected of us in this Parliament. We are expected
to deliver on employment and social justice, and to tackle the war on poverty

is light in any way, as many of the bills will be substantial. Mr Salmond
said how much he welcomed-and I welcome his welcome-the long-overdue abolition
of the feudal system, which the Westminster Parliament failed to abolish
for 300 years. It is fair to point out that the English Parliament took
the first step towards abolishing the feudal system in 1290-with the statute
Quia Emptores-and effectively got rid of it in 1660. The old Scottish Parliament
did not address the issue, and it is a tribute to this Parliament that

to address Scotland's transport problems, such as pollution and congestion.
However, our number one priority is legislation on education. Mr Monteith
bemoaned the fact that the education bill was last on the list, but he
overlooked the theological point that the first shall be last and the last
shall be first.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I endorse what Mr Swinney said about my
colleague Ian Jenkins's speech, which indicated the importance of valuing
teachers. Mr Salmond was somewhat selective when he quoted Mr Galbraith,
because Mr Galbraith also recognises the importance of valuing the commitment
and professionalism of teachers. They play a key role in raising our country's
educational standards and in ensuring that our young people have the best
start in life to have the best opportunities for life.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>What Mr Galbraith will
do remains to be seen. However, will the Deputy First Minister comment
on Mr Galbraith's predecessor as education minister, Mrs Helen Liddell,
who always recognised the benefit of teachers to the people of Scotland?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I am content that Mr Galbraith and the Executive as a whole value the contribution
that teachers make-and will continue to make-to our young people's education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There will be considerable debate about
the contents of the bills. If I do not manage to answer every point that
has been raised-which would be impossible-there will be plenty of opportunity
to address those points in the future. As an Executive, we are committed
to consultation and to the examination and scrutiny of bills, as was foreshadowed
in the consultative steering group report and endorsed in a debate last
week.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some members spoke about the proposals
for national parks. There was some concern about how those proposals would
affect people who lived in potential national park sites. I want to make
it clear that the thrust of our proposals is to ensure the integrated management
of rural development in those areas and to take full account of the need
for sustainable communities as well as for sustainable development.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the subject of transport, Mr Raffan,
Mr McLetchie and-I think-Mr MacAskill asked whether the money raised from
road charging and other levies would be used to fund public transport.
A section in the partnership agreement states:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We will legislate to allow road user charging
where it is sensible to do so. We will enable local authorities to levy
charges on parking at the workplace. The proceeds will be used to invest
in transport."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Gil Paterson (Central Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>As I am a member for the central belt, what I have to say may carry
little weight. The Liberal Democrats have talked a lot about the people
in Skye, so I wonder if that party-as part of the coalition-can do something
for them. People throughout Scotland feel great disquiet about the treatment
of the people in Skye and the impact of the horrendous toll charges that
they have to pay. Surely the time has come to do something to make up for
the damage that has been done.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I am grateful to Mr
Paterson for giving me the opportunity to remind him that, under the partnership
agreement, toll charges will be frozen for the duration of the contract
period. That is a substantial concession that will grow over the years
and I am sure that many business people will be pleased to know that the
costs are fixed for a considerable time to come.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We were asked whether the standards that
we will apply to local authorities would also apply to quangos. We are
committed to high standards of conduct in all public bodies and we are
open to views about whether similar provisions should be made for all public
bodies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

what is in the legislative programme, but about what is not in it. Members
have questioned our ambitions on health, education, drugs, the economy
and housing. I agree that those are pressing issues of critical importance
to the future of Scotland. They are our priorities, too, and we are taking
action to deliver on them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the First Minister stressed, the programme
of legislation is not the end. As he said in the context of local government,
we intend to respond rapidly and comprehensively to the proposals of the
McIntosh commission. In response to the point that Mr Swinney made in his
wind-up speech, that is likely to mean more legislation. We would have
laid ourselves open to criticism if we had introduced that legislation
before we received and consulted on the McIntosh recommendations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should not forget that action by this
Administration is not restricted to new legislation. We have inherited
many wide-ranging powers and significant budgets with which we can make
a difference to the lives of the people of Scotland. We have heard many
complaints-we would expect to from the SNP-that certain matters are still
reserved. It is important to remember that the devolution scheme that we
are implementing and progressing in this Parliament was overwhelmingly
endorsed by the people of Scotland in a referendum. In the recent elections,
the majority of people voted for parties that want to retain the links
in the United Kingdom, so we should not make any apologies for the fact
that some matters are still reserved to Westminster.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know that Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
is specifically interested in speed limits. I can tell him that from today
an order will come into effect that will allow local authorities, if they
so wish, to set speed limits at 20 mph. That is proper devolution down
to our local councils.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have an ambitious programme. In addition
to our commitments on raising standards in education, we are committed
to the recruitment of 1,000 additional teachers, 5,000 classroom assistants
and the guarantee of a nursery place for every three and four-year-old.
We are also committed to additional expenditure of &pound;21 million on
books and equipment, to the reduction of class sizes and to capital investment
of &pound;600 million.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Questions have been raised about the economy
and Alex Neil raised the issue of jobs. I am pleased, as we all will be-as
an Opposition member at Westminster, I will not claim any credit-about
the unemployment figures that were announced today. At 5.5 per cent, the
unemployment claimant count is at its lowest level since 1977. As a partnership,
we are committed to creating 20,000 modern apprenticeships, to getting
more out of our science base to create&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Remarks have been made about rural Scotland.
It is not always legislation that is required. As Mr Finnie indicated,
while we have been debating today he was out doing something to tackle
the costs in the food chain so that the benefits of reducing costs come
to our primary producers. That does not require legislation but shows this
Executive doing things to help rural Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A number of people have talked about health-Mrs
Scanlon made useful comments on the subject. We have had an opportunity
to find ways in which to tackle Scotland's distinctive, and sometimes chronic,
health problems. As a partnership, we are committed to the promotion of
public health. We are committed to a network of healthy living centres,
to one-stop clinics and to round-the-clock access to health advice through
NHS Direct.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In an exchange with Dr Simpson, Mrs Margaret
Ewing raised the issue of junior hospital doctors. As an Executive, we
have a strong commitment to achieving the 56-hour target as a first step
to reducing hours to 48. Ms Deacon, the Minister for Health and Community
Care, has written to the junior doctors to invite them to a meeting to
discuss further progress on that issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tackling poverty and social injustice was
a recurring theme in our debate. As the First Minister said this morning,
social justice is at the heart of what we all want to achieve. It is a
theme that links many other things. Education is at the heart of social
justice; an education bill to raise standards will tackle poverty and social
exclusion at its source by equipping our children to build successful lives.
Our proposals on incapable adults will address a pressing concern of many
thousands of people who need care or who provide that care. That is practical
social justice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is more. Through legislative and
non-legislative action across Government, we are committed to building
strong and stable communities; to promoting social inclusion; to tackling
dampness with a healthy homes initiative; to developing a national child
care strategy; and to tackling homelessness. Mr Sheridan mentioned the
green paper on housing published by the Westminster Administration. He
reminded us that the consultation period finished on 31 May and that there
had been some robust and interesting contributions to that consultation.
We will respond to that in a way that will take forward housing policy
in Scotland and reflect the housing needs of our nation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the scourge of drugs. I can assure those members that we share that concern.

tackle the problem. However, many of the suggestions for tackling drugs
do not require legislation. We are, as a partnership, committed to the
establishment of a drugs enforcement agency. Along with the Deputy Minister
for Justice, Angus Mackay, I have had meetings with the Association of
Chief Police Officers (Scotland) to start to work out how we can take the
agency forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We want to create mechanisms within the
Executive to ensure that there is an integrated approach across government,
allowing us to pursue a far-reaching strategy on drugs. Tackling drugs
has a health dimension, an education dimension, a rehabilitation dimension
and a crime and law and order dimension. The Government wants to ensure
that it approaches the issue on that cross-cutting basis.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is much to be done. We have waited
nearly 300 years for this Parliament. It is impossible in the first few
weeks and months to get everything done that we want to get done. However,
our programme is ambitious-to deliver for Scotland. It will emphasise the
key themes of this Administration: social justice; promoting enterprise;
and ensuring that we have a sustainable economy. The legislative programme
has been laid out as a first step along the road. I commend it to the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> That
concludes the debate on the Executive's legislative proposals. As we have
no questions to put as a result of that debate, we now move directly to
the members' business debate on motion S1M-42 in the name of Mr David Mundell.
The debate will conclude after 30 minutes without any question being put.</font></td>
