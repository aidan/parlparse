Could you give me some guidance on the process following the election of
the First Minister? I collected a copy of the document "Partnership for
Scotland" from the document office earlier today. It contains the agreement
that underpins the appointments that we will be asked to approve in Parliament
tomorrow. Will we have the opportunity to debate the contents of that document
and its proximity to the election manifestos of the two parties that have
supported this agreement before we are asked at tomorrow's meeting to support
the nominees who will be put before us in the motion that has been tabled

of Mr Alex Fergusson on the subject of prayers. The text of that motion
was printed in today's business bulletin and I intend to put the question
on it no later than one hour after it has been moved.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In accordance with section 48(1) of the
Scotland Act 1998 it is for the First Minister to recommend to Her Majesty
the appointment of persons to be the Lord Advocate and Solicitor General
for Scotland. Before doing so the First Minister must have the agreement
of Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">14:32</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister (Donald Dewar):</strong>
I do not regard this as a routine motion in any sense, but I hope that
it is reasonably uncontentious-we will discover whether it is in the next
few minutes. I am conscious of the fact that this is a short debate and
that therefore it would be wrong of me to take too much time. However,
I want to make it clear that the motion-which I have pleasure in moving-is
to seek the agreement of the Parliament to the appointment of Andrew Hardie
as Lord Advocate and Colin Boyd as Solicitor General for Scotland. If members
agree to the motion, as First Minister I will recommend to Her Majesty
that those appointments should be made.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Lord Advocate and Solicitor General
for Scotland are currently the Scottish law officers in the United Kingdom
Government but on 20 May-which is imminent-they will cease to be members
of the UK Government and the offices will transfer to the Scottish Executive.
That fact dictates the timing of this motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scottish law officers will become members
of the Scottish Executive on 20 May-before other Scottish ministers-because
they have to be in place so that they can offer legal advice to the Executive
in the run-up to 1 July, which is the day on which Parliament assumes its
full powers. Arrangements have been made to ensure an appropriate distribution
of the Lord Advocate's functions during the transitional period from 20
May to 1 July.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As most members will know, the offices
of Lord Advocate and Solicitor General have been with us for a long time.
The office of Lord Advocate has existed since at least the 15<sup>th</sup>
century. I think that the Solicitor General arrived late-somewhere around
the 17<sup>th</sup> century-but the positions have been important parts
of the administration of justice and of politics in Scotland for many years.
They have been the power base; in fact, the office of Lord Advocate ran
Scotland on many occasions and the Lord Advocate was very much the man
of affairs for the government of the day.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The offices are still central-in a different
way-to the government of Scotland. They will continue&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to be the principal
Scottish law officers-the Lord Advocate in particular, with the Solicitor
General continuing to be his deputy-and they will work as a team.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The functions conferred on the Scottish
ministers generally can be exercised by any of them, but there are exceptions,
the most important of which is the Lord Advocate, who will retain those
functions that he exercises immediately before he ceases to be a minister
of the Crown. Those retained functions, which are retained in statute,
are functions that he will continue to exercise as a member of the Scottish
Executive; they can be exercised only by the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General. In other words, the functions cannot be passed around or swapped
around-they remain firmly with the holders of those offices.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is significant in particular areas.
The Lord Advocate will be the law officer to the Scottish Executive. His
functions as law officer will be retained functions and will, as I said,
include providing legal advice to the Scottish Executive and representing
the Scottish Executive in legal proceedings.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Lord Advocate's role as the independent
head of the systems of criminal prosecution and investigation of deaths
in Scotland will also be a retained function. As most members will know,
the independence of the Lord Advocate in that role is entrenched in the
Scotland Act 1998. Section 48(5) confirms that the Lord Advocate's decisions
as head of those systems must be taken independently. Section 29 provides
that it is outwith the legislative competence of the Parliament to remove
the Lord Advocate from his important independent position as head of the
system of criminal prosecution.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General
have to shoulder an onerous role, which is a bulwark of our justice system.
That is the order of the day in the courts of Scotland-although, as we
all know, there are sometimes spectaculars, such as the events that will
shortly take place in Holland. However, I suspect that the Lockerbie trial
will cease to be quite so contentious in parliamentary terms because we
do not have Tam Dalyell with us-at least not in this forum.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I stress to members that the Lord Advocate
and the Solicitor General have full powers to serve on committees, to speak
in debates and to answer questions in this Parliament. They lack one important
power-the right to vote. Apart from that, they will, as I understand it,
have a full sweep of activity-when it is judged appropriate and when their
services are required.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

is now a new office of Advocate General for&nbsp;</font></td>

has been created by the Scotland Act 1998. The Prime Minister announced
yesterday that Dr Lynda Clark would be the first Advocate General. I take
this opportunity to offer her my congratulations-and I hope those of all
members-on her appointment. The UK Government will require advice on Scots
law-fairly frequently, I imagine-and it is not possible for the law officers
who are answerable to the Scottish Executive to give advice to the United
Kingdom Government. That is why this post has been created.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that this Parliament will confirm
the law officers and that those law officers will add a great deal to our
debates. I mentioned their sweep of responsibilities and their ability
to contribute to our debates, but I should add that, under section 27(3)
of the Scotland Act 1998,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The Lord Advocate or the Solicitor General
for Scotland may, in any proceedings of the Parliament, decline to answer
any question or produce any document relating to the operation of the system
of criminal prosecution in any particular case if he considers that answering
the question or producing the document-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(a) might prejudice criminal proceedings
in that case, or</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(b) would be contrary to the public interest."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is as well to put that on record, in
case there is frustration later because it is not recognised and not known.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have tried to be brief and to set out
the structure of the argument. I have put the case rather impersonally,
so perhaps before asking members to endorse the motion I should remind
them that it relates to the appointment of two colleagues whom I know well
and whom I like immensely. Their qualities have been tried and tested over
two years in office, and I have been happy-fortunate, indeed-to be able
to rely on their judgment, integrity and wise counsel during that period.
I very much hope that my confidence will be shared by colleagues in every
part of the chamber, that the motion will be passed and that Andrew Hardie
and Colin Boyd will be recommended to Her Majesty for appointment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

motion-to delete one or other part of the motion that relates to these

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>The
Scottish Conservatives do not object on a personal basis to the appointment
of Lord Hardie and Mr Boyd to the offices of Lord Advocate and Solicitor
General; indeed, we wish them well in fulfilling their important roles.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is worth emphasising-as the First Minister
did in his opening remarks-the importance of preserving the independence
of the two offices. That independence should be respected by all parties
in this Parliament and we should resolve that it should not in any way
be undermined by the actions of the Executive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From observation, it seems that there have
been at least two fairly high-profile cases in the past year that have,
at the very least, raised doubts about whether there has been political
interference in the judgment of the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters
and appeals against sentences. I do not wish to comment on the specifics
of those cases; I simply want to say that doubts have been raised, as members
will be aware.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To maintain public confidence in our system
of independent prosecutors, it is important that there is not the slightest
hint of political influence being brought to bear on future judgments.
As the First Minister said, that independence is an important part of our
justice system. It is also an important bulwark of this country's system
of civil liberties and we would abandon it at our peril.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are also areas in the remit of the
law officers that are, I think, of concern to MSPs. We look forward to
the opportunity of questioning the law officers on their roles-in a general
sense if not on specific cases. As we said at the election, the Scottish
Conservatives have real concerns about the increasing use of fiscal fines
as a means of disposing of cases, and about the fact that a number of cases
are being prosecuted in lower courts in the interests of saving money rather
than of ensuring that justice is done.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We give notice to our new law officers
that, in the months ahead, we will be questioning them and the new minister
for justice closely on those matters. The public must have confidence in
all aspects of our criminal justice system. As a party, we will seek to
ensure that confidence is&nbsp;</font></td>

Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>I support the appointment of Andrew Hardie

whether the First Minister or, if it is allowed, the Lord Advocate designate
could explain how frequently the two law officers will appear in this Parliament
to answer questions and to make statements.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It has been a long time since the House
of Commons had the opportunity of questioning either a Lord Advocate or
a Solicitor General. I accept what was said about the independence of the
Lord Advocate as public prosecutor but, as law officer for the Scottish
Executive, he must have some accountability to this Parliament. Can the
First Minister give us some indication of how often we can expect to see
the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General to put questions to them on
behalf of our constituents and the people of Scotland generally?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Andrew Hardie is a member of another Parliament;
like you, Sir David, he is a member of the House of Lords. Could we have
some assurance that his prime responsibility and first allegiance will
be to this Parliament rather than to the House of Lords?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> I will ask
the First Minister to respond to that but I preface his remarks by saying
that a timetable for questions has yet to be discussed by the Parliamentary
Bureau. The law officers will obviously be included in that rota. Does
the First Minister wish to add anything?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>As<strong> </strong>Sir
David said, there is to be discussion about the arrangements for question
time. The consultative steering group report envisaged that there would
be questions to the First Minister but that he would come to question time
with a team of ministers-the questions would be answered as appropriate.
I assure colleagues that-assuming that the business of the courts permits
it-the law officers will deal in Parliament with the appropriate questions
that have been lodged. The matter of the House of Lords is for Lord Hardie
to determine, but he is very determined and, with the transfer that I hope
will be agreed in the next few minutes, he has committed himself to serving
in Scotland and this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not wish to tempt Mr McLetchie into
further details but I do not recognise the examples to which he referred.

The next item of business is a debate on the principle of prayers being

that the standing orders provide for the Parliament to have a decision
time at the end of each sitting day. A decision on Mr Fergusson's motion

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alex Fergusson (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong>
In moving the motion, may I first clarify any confusion over its wording
by stating quite clearly that my intention is to ensure that prayers are
said, in one form or another, on a daily basis, at every meeting of the
whole Parliament within this chamber.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Much has been made in the past week of
the fact that during the inaugural meeting of the Parliament about one
third of MSPs chose to make the affirmation rather than take the oath.
It has not been pointed out as strongly that two thirds of us chose to
take the oath. Some 86 of us preferred to swear our allegiance in the name
of God.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I, like you, Sir David, am a son of the
manse. I was, therefore, brought up in a Christian, God-fearing household,
although I admit that for much of my early upbringing I tended to fear
the wrath of my father on earth rather more than that of my father in heaven.
None the less, throughout the years I have found the occasional moment
of prayer or simply of quiet and reflective thought to be of great assistance
in my daily business.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My motion today, however, is not born purely
of personal preference or desire. Rather, that desire was reinforced during
the build-up to the election on 6 May by the surprisingly large number
of people who voiced their concern on this subject to me, having read the
various rumours in the press, among them one that suggested that there
would be no room for prayers at all in the daily business of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

therefore, that this Parliament, particularly as it meets in the assembly
building of the Church of Scotland, should ask for a little daily advice
and guidance from the greatest expert of all.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is not a party political matter; it
is a question of getting our priorities right. To my mind, a Parliament
that meets without prayer is not respectful or complete. Therefore, as
a matter of urgency, I move,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That this Parliament agrees in principle
for Prayers to be held on a non-denominational basis, at the start of each
plenary session of the Parliament, and remits to the Parliamentary Bureau

recommendations speedily.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">14:52</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):
</strong>I am sympathetic to the motion, but I start with a slight correction
of Mr Fergusson's remarks. If someone decides to make an affirmation, it
does not necessarily mean that they are not religious. There are a number
of reasons why someone might wish to make an affirmation. A very religious
person might choose the affirmation because they did not like the nature
of the oath that they were asked to take. Perhaps Mr Fergusson will reflect
on that point. I do not think that we should make assumptions about people's
religious beliefs on the basis of whether they affirmed or swore an oath-and
I speak as someone who swore the oath last week.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have three points to make. The first
is that I speak as an individual. This is a matter of conscience and should
be the subject of a free vote for all parties and members. There are some
aspects of the motion that I hope the mover will want to confirm. When
Mr Fergusson talks about non-denominational, I think he means interfaith;
in other words, relating not only to Christian denominations, but to the
various other faiths in Scotland. It is important that this Parliament
affirms that the Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and Jewish communities are important
in the wider Scottish community and that, if we have some form of religious
or other observance in our proceedings, it should encompass all the faiths
of Scotland. I am sure that Mr Fergusson would not want to suggest that
we are talking only about Christian denominations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My second point relates to an experience
that I had earlier this year when I wrote to members of all of the faiths
in Scotland to make a suggestion. The Episcopalian Bishop of Edinburgh
took the opportunity of "Thought for the Day" to suggest that he was not
in favour of religious observance. I found that quite interesting. It was

Prime Minister" when Jim Hacker was faced with appointing two Church of
England bishops, neither of whom believed in God. I am not suggesting for
a second that the Episcopalian Bishop of Edinburgh falls into that category,
but I found it interesting that a cleric should take such a position. More
interesting was that he took the opportunity of "Thought for the Day",
as it is an opportunity allocated to representatives of all of the faiths
by the BBC on the basis that it is important to have some sort of observance
even among the various news topics of "Good Morning Scotland" and that
there is a place for a minute or two's reflection. It was, therefore, interesting
that the Bishop of Edinburgh chose that spot on BBC radio to deny that
the concept of religious observance might have any validity in the proceedings
of the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My third point is that those of us who
have experience of the Westminster Parliament would not want to reproduce
the nature of prayers in that institution, where they have been described
as a meaningless ritual. That is not altogether true, because prayers in
the Westminster Parliament can be meaningful as a means for people to reserve
their seats for the day. However, I am not certain that that is the best
reason for people to take part in what should be a solemn observance of
worship.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What I had in mind when I wrote to the
various denominations and faiths was that there should be a time allocated
within parliamentary proceedings, whether daily or weekly, when the religions
and faiths in Scotland could be asked to provide a two- or three-minute
thought for the day or for the week. That observation might go beyond the
day-to-day events that we are debating, and might rise above some of the
inter-party battles that we might get into, even in the new politics of
this new Parliament. I thought that that would be a good thing, because
it would show the strength of unity in diversity. It would be a good thing
if the faiths of Scotland were to agree on such a formula.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The last point that I want to make in support
of Alex Fergusson's motion is that, when he sums up, he could indicate
that this is not a matter for the Parliamentary Bureau alone, but that
the Parliament should be taking advice from representatives of the faiths
of Scotland. If they could come to us with an agreed formula-something
like the daily or weekly observation, spread round the faiths of Scotland-that
would be something that this Parliament would do well to consider. Our
affirmation of the key role of all of the religions of Scotland in contributing
something above and beyond the smoke and battle of politics could be very
important indeed to our proceedings.</font></td>

(Con): </strong>I listened with interest to what Mr Salmond said. It is important
that all of us in the chamber do not get too bogged down by an apparent
or deemed gravity. I have a lot of sympathy for what the motion proposes.
My background is in no way remarkable in that respect; it is probably like
that of several other members. I am a member of the Church of Scotland
and an elder of the kirk. I have fruitlessly spent years trying to improve
the political ways of the father of Ms Wendy Alexander, the member for
Paisley North-without success.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important that those of us here who
have some sense of belief or religious adherence should be given the opportunity
to draw from that belief or adherence, whatever it may be, the very comfort
to which Mr Fergusson alluded, in an informal and, I hope, relaxed manner.
My preference would be for that to be possible on a daily basis. There
is an old Russian proverb that says if the thunder is not loud, the peasant
does not cross himself. I am not suggesting that, in this chamber, we should
await claps of thunder. However, I feel very strongly that challenges may
lie ahead-and there I am in sympathy with Mr Salmond's view.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think that it is important for us to
remember, as a fraternity, that we are people first and MSPs after that.
While I am very much in sympathy with Mr Salmond's view on further consultation
with the faiths, I believe that it is essential to keep the matter before
us as simple as possible. To me, the simplicity is this: for those of us
in this company who have a desire to seek some sort of comfort on a daily
basis, it would be helpful, whatever our beliefs or adherences, to have
that facility available within the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

can lodge a motion and we will debate it. That is a great step forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

They are exclusive, Church of England from 1660, and, in my view, they

the Parliament is part of a Church of England plot.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must embrace all religions: all the
Christian denominations and all the other faiths. As well as benefiting
those members who wish to listen to prayers, it would send out to our fellow

their beliefs may be.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When I pursued this matter before, the
figures that I got from the library at the House of Commons indicated that
about 30 per cent of the inhabitants of Scotland over the age of 15 are
considered to be members of one of the faiths. The views of many other
people are influenced by Christianity and by other faiths.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prayers would benefit those who come and
enjoy them, if that is the right expression. The people who do not approve
of prayers need not come, and will have two minutes more to drink some
coffee. It does not benefit non-believers to deny believers the chance
to benefit from their belief.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It will not surprise members to learn,
therefore, that I am in favour of proportional praying. [<i>Laughter.</i>]
Although I have figures from the library, statistics about membership of
religions are almost as dubious as statistics about membership of political
parties. However, although the figures may need to be refined, I suggest
that prayers should be allocated roughly in proportion to the number of
adherents to a religion, whether it be Christianity or another religion,
and each faith should have a certain number of days of praying over us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not think that we want a sort of bland,
all-faith prayer; that would be awful. Each group should be allowed to
have its say in its own style. For the benefit of many people who genuinely
have no belief, there could be, on some days, a two-minute silence, when
people could meditate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have served on four councils, and have
found the prayers conducted there helpful. They make one view one's opponents,
and sometimes even one's colleagues, with more charity. Sometimes, I have
moderated the venom of an attack on my opponents because something in a
prayer caught my attention and made me think that I should not go over
the top. So I think that prayers do some good.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I reject the argument that, because the
Parliament is a secular place of work, there should be no prayers. In the

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Members of the Scottish Parliament are

recommended that the Parliament take an early view.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that can demonstrate the humility that should be attached to membership
of this Parliament, and it would allow members to consider the great privilege
of being a democratic representative.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scotland's great strength is its diversity.
Some members may choose a more private opportunity to express prayer. Some
may prefer the opportunity for a more contemplative moment before the business
of the Parliament begins, to consider again and again the burden of their
responsibilities as well as the great possibilities that their position
can create for the advancement of the common good. That strength of diversity
is in the multiplicity of faiths and beliefs that encompass Scottish life,
as well as the freedom not to have any formal beliefs. It is important
that we recognise also the secular thread that runs through Scottish life.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</strong>Speaking as a poor sinner, which, of course, we all are, I would say
that there should definitely be an element of spirituality in this Parliament.
It is not just a matter of personal conscience. It is a matter of what
the people of Scotland, of the majority of all faiths, want. That was very
apparent to me in Glasgow Baillieston and in all parts of the city of Glasgow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a shocking thing in this Parliament.
Spot the window-up there in the gallery. That stained-glass window has
been known to me all my life. When I sat in the front row, where Mr Dewar
is now, as a reporter at Church of Scotland general assemblies, I used
to look up at that window. What has happened? A blind has been drawn halfway
down the window so that the figure of Christ is beheaded. That is not good
enough. We should not start a Parliament with that, not in anyone's religion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I call for multifaith prayers. The major
religions of the world usually operate in units of 10 on the sin front.
Some of the major religions of China, for instance, adhere to the 10 courts
of hell. I do not recommend any of us trying those as a holiday destination.
It is quite simple, however, to have a form of prayer that suits everyone.
I strongly recommend that we have that touch of spirituality and that we
do not descend entirely into the secular in this age. What is this age?
We are approaching some form of a new age of darkness, of witchcraft, with
all sorts of crackpots getting in on the scene. [<i>Laughter.</i>] Not

am on record in <i>The Scotsman</i> as supporting Alex Salmond's view.
Some months ago, I suggested that we have a period of contemplation preceded
by a talk from a representative of a religion, or even of a group, in Scottish
life. That would achieve several things.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First, the people of Scotland hope that
this Parliament will be open and accessible. I cannot think of anything
more accessible than for this Parliament to be addressed on a daily basis
by somebody from outside, whether they be from different faiths or even
from campaigning groups. People who wanted to perform that office would
be queueing down to the Canongate Tolbooth within a few days of any announcement
that that would happen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, such a talk followed by a period
of quiet contemplation would have the advantage of enabling us to listen
to our faiths in public, and to address our gods in private in whatever
way we prefer. My suggestion is not a negative to the motion, because the
motion does not state whether the prayers should be spoken or should be
private and quiet. If this motion is passed, we could proceed to a parliamentary
committee. If I were to be on that committee, which I would like to be,
I would repeat my idea and would support that of Mr Salmond.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that my colleagues have criticised. As an Episcopalian, "meaningless ritual"

a little more instruction in the Episcopal faith. We should recognise the
history and symbolism of the building that we are in and the area in which
it is situated. I suspect that I am the only member of this Parliament

terms of other forms of event such as prayer or celebration. If we can
build on the motion in terms of multifaith celebration-and I think that
that is important-then the motion gives us an opportunity to start something
happening rather than to stop and go backwards. I support the motion as

as I was prepared to argue the case for the Church of Scotland in the House

nature of Scottish religious belief. We have also to consider the frequency
of prayers and when they would take place. I am not in favour of our having
prayers immediately before meeting. I suspect that, if we did, members
might attend because they wanted to get a good seat in the range of the
television cameras rather than because they were seeking divine guidance.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have to recognise that not only is Scotland
multifaith, it contains people who do not have any faith in God. They have
every right to hold that principle and to have their views respected. I
would not like their rights to be imposed upon by a majority, even if there
is a religious majority in the chamber, in this very noble building. I
hope that there will be discussions between the parties on this subject
and that it will be recognised that in Scotland there are non-religious
as well as religious people, and that there are non-Christian as well as
Christian groups. Above all, I hope that this Parliament will respect the
religious views of individual members and will not impose on them rituals
that may mean nothing to them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the First Minister would like to speak.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">15:23</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister (Donald Dewar):</strong>
I managed to press the wrong button. It was an administrative triumph in
my panic at seeing this debate being brought to a conclusion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On this occasion I speak as an individual
and not in any other capacity. This has been an interesting debate. I have
concerns about what we may be about to do. A large percentage of speakers
have said that they do not want to recreate Westminster. There is a great
danger that that is what we are going to do.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Great stress has been placed on the religious
traditions of Scotland. I am very well aware of them and, in an academic
sense, I probably have a wider grasp of them than do many people. I am
also very aware that many people do not have a religious faith, although
they may welcome the possibility of a period of contemplation or a quiet
period at the start of the day. It would be improper of me to embarrass
members by asking them to declare by a show of hands whether they go to
church every Sunday. I suspect that members do not differ markedly from
the population of Scotland, in which case the proportion of the gathering
here that go to church every Sunday will be around 15 per cent-I may be
wrong, but I suspect that that is so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At Westminster, the vast majority of people
who do not have a religious faith hang around in the corridor during prayers.
As soon as prayers are over, there is an almighty rush to get into one's
seat. There has to be a gap between the end of prayers and the start of
business to allow the large majority of members-I suspect-to get to their
seats. I raise that as a practical point as I think that that is what would
emerge here.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think that there is a possibility of
securing a quiet period for contemplation and reflection. An alternative
to prayer was mentioned by Mr Salmond. That might be reasonable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to vote for it
on the basis that it does not mean what it says. If we believe that we
should have a period of quiet contemplation-several people, including Mr
Harper, referred to that-we cannot vote for the motion. The motion, which
will presumably be binding on the Parliament and the bureau, specifies
prayer. It is clear that prayers and variations on them are meant, not
a quiet talk or a humanist talking about his point of view-those are not
prayers. We have been told that the prayers should be interfaith, not interdenominational,
but the motion says "non-denominational". I have some respect for motions
and I believe that voting for a motion endorses the meaning of the words
that the motion uses.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>The motion also says
"in principle" and remits the matter to the Parliamentary Bureau, which
would make arrangements and come back to the Parliament. The motion is
phrased loosely enough for the matter to come back to the chamber. A decision
in principle is being sought today, not a decision in detail.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>That is Mr Salmond's
interpretation of the motion. I do not intend to ask you to make a ruling,
Sir David, but in the provisions to which I have referred the motion is
very specific.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is not necessarily a great difference
of opinion between members. I accept that there is a mood in the chamber
that some arrangement should be made, but I am not sure that there should
be prayers before every meeting. We will have facilities in the new Parliament
building for religious observance and worship. Some of us might think that
those who wish to have that kind of experience, help and satisfaction might
want to go to a place that has been set aside for the purpose. That has
to be considered. I am not openly hostile to the idea of prayers, but we
should vote for something that is clear. That means that we should discuss
the issue first and make a considered judgment before we reach a conclusion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are all a little ambivalent about these
matters. I was much entertained by Dr Ewing's account of her experience
of having to pray in order to get a seat in the House of Commons. The implication
of that was that if she could have got a seat without praying, she would
have done so, and yet she stresses the absolute necessity of having prayers
before every meeting.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is teasing out to be done-not as
a delaying tactic. We should consider this matter further and sort out
what we mean by prayers and non-denominational. Some thought should also
be given to the location before we reach a final decision.</font></td>

Fergusson: </strong>I was tempted, for a moment, to withdraw the motion, but
only on the ground that any religious service is likely to be drowned out
by the sound of members' pagers going off for most of the service, which
would render any form of contemplation almost impossible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am not minded to withdraw the motion,
however, for the simple reason that many members have spoken in favour
of it. I accept, to a certain extent, what the First Minister said about
its wording. I tried to make it plain and was advised by the clerks earlier
today that, if I made my intention plain in my opening remarks, any misunderstanding
of the wording would be made up for.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One misunderstanding was referred to by
Dr Ewing. Coming from the deep south of Scotland, I thought that plenary
was a splendid word to introduce to any motion but was rather horrified
when a clerk pointed out to me that it would mean that prayers would take
place once every four years. That would find 100 per cent approval in the
chamber, no doubt. I made it plain in my opening remarks, however, that
my sole intention is to ensure that prayers are said in one form or another,
on a daily basis, at every meeting of the whole Parliament in the chamber.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>I hope that, in going
for the treble, Mr Fergusson will accept a point about an interfaith approach.
I mentioned earlier that I had written to representatives of all the faiths
in Scotland; I should have said that they all replied with enthusiasm.
The Bishop of Edinburgh, Richard Holloway, wrote to me and said that, notwithstanding
his personal views on the matter, his Church was in favour of some initiative
in this regard.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> I am grateful for
that comment. I am in complete agreement with the interfaith concept of
the motion. It was perhaps naive to use the word non-denominational, but
I have never been in any doubt that the interfaith aspect is the one that
we should pursue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also have sympathy with the "Thought
for the Day" angle-which I think Mr Salmond used-that I mentioned in several
interviews this morning as presenting a model that could be considered.
I cannot agree with Mr McCabe because I think that he is disputing the
merits of prayer. We have been praying for almost 2,000 years and I think
that it is more than time to take a stand.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I strongly believe that with the new Parliament
we have a new beginning. I see no reason why we should not have a new all-embracing
form of contemplative thought or prayer as part of our parliamentary procedure.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> I will ensure
that that problem is investigated tomorrow, as it is very important that
members are able to hear me everywhere.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
