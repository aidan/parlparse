the views of the Scottish people, including their views on the important
matter of higher education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to say something about this Lib-Lab
pact, or partnership, or whatever it is called. I am not opposed in principle
to a coalition, but this seems to be a rather shabby deal to cheat the
people by depriving them of what they voted for. All that we have on tuition
fees is the promise of some kind of inquiry or review. Anybody with any
experience of politics in another place knows that the term review is just
Westminster-speak for a fudge. Besides, we have just had a national review
of tuition fees-it was called an election. During the election the subject
was aired very adequately, not just in my constituency but in virtually
every constituency in the country.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The people of Scotland want us to introduce
early legislation to abolish tuition fees. The abolition of tuition fees,
although necessary, is not sufficient, because it must be accompanied by
the restoration of student grants, particularly for students from low-income
families. Virtually all the designated members of the new Scottish Executive
had the same advantage that I had: going to university with the assistance
of a student grant. Many of us would never have had that opportunity if
we had not had student grants.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I remember visiting the campus of the University
of Stirling, which was then in my constituency, as a young Labour MP, many
years ago. A young revolutionary, complete with long hair and leather jacket,
started haranguing Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister at that time, who
was perceived by that student revolutionary, who was then a member of the
Communist party, as the great bogeyman. The student revolutionary complained
that Harold Wilson was not doing enough to help students because he was
not meeting the full demands of the National Union of Students for an increase
in grants.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Times change. Earlier this week, that erstwhile
student revolutionary became the new Secretary of State for Scotland, and
therefore a member of a Cabinet which, frankly, has kicked away the ladder
of opportunity from many students, including future generations of students.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should not repeat the same mistake in
this place. We, collectively, as members of this Parliament-not just the
members of the Scottish Executive-have a great responsibility to try to
ensure that young people in particular have maximum educational opportunity,
including those from low-income families.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a sense, education is the key to the
future of our country, and we should not sell our young people short.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Lewis Macdonald (Aberdeen Central) (Lab):
</strong>I welcome the nomination of an Executive to represent the whole of
Scotland and to highlight the priorities for Government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In my constituency of Aberdeen Central,
there are areas of severe urban deprivation. There will be a warm welcome
there for the creation of a ministry for social inclusion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Aberdeen is also at the heart of a wide
rural hinterland; there will also be a warm welcome for the creation of
a specific ministry for rural affairs. Important city-based industries
such as paper and food look to the country areas as a source of supply;
people from country areas come into town for their health services, higher
education and much else. So central is Aberdeen to the rural north-east
that Aberdeenshire Council, as well as the city council, is headquartered
in my constituency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Beside all those things and beside all
the economic links, there are family ties; today, most relevantly, there
are shared values. I am confident that in both town and country in the
north-east, there will be broad support for the principles which underlie
the partnership agreement that has been presented today: principles of
working together on a co-operative basis and of seeking to make this Parliament
work not as a Westminster in miniature and not as a stepping-stone to independence,
but as an open, accessible and new Parliament in its own right.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>Mr Macdonald referred
to the partnership agreement and to its principles. It is fairly obvious
which particular principles the Liberal Democrats have given up to reach
that partnership. For the benefit of the rest of us, would Lewis Macdonald
care to elucidate which principles the Labour party is giving up to enter
the agreement?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I appreciate Mr
Adam's persistence in asking that question a second time. He misses the
point of the partnership, which is to bring together the positive aspects
of the two manifestos. That is what the partnership agreement-very notably-achieves.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There will be a particular welcome in the
north-east for the strategic approach that the Minister for Rural Affairs
permits on rural issues. The new ministry will have a straightforward but
very wide remit, although it was criticised by a member of the SNP. In
fact the ministry will be responsible for co-ordinating the delivery of
services across a wide range. It will work with the transport ministry
on integrated rural transport policy and it will work with the justice
department on promoting and implementing land reform. These are positive
and welcome developments.</font></td>

Officer: </strong>Will you finish, please.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The ministry for
rural affairs will also develop policy and by its very existence send out
the right signals about the priority that this Parliament gives to rural
areas. I am disappointed that some of the parties here choose, as their
first reaction to the proposal to create a ministry for rural affairs,
to seek to delay the appointment of a minister. On the contrary, we should
endorse the appointment of Ross Finnie and give rural issues the priority
that they deserve.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>Mr Macdonald was just
as embarrassed as Mr Watson was by the question from my colleague Mr Adam
about what the Labour party had given up to ensure the partnership agreement.
With a number of others who are here I was in London on Monday evening
for the incapacity benefit vote. There was no embarrassment displayed then
by Labour MPs who were, frankly, doing cartwheels along the lobbies of
the House of Commons because of what had been achieved by the Labour party
at the expense of the Liberal Democrats.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Adam's question was a key moment in
the debate. The other key moment in the debate was Mr Lyon's contribution,
and I am glad to see that he has come back into the chamber. He told us
that the Liberal Democrats will be making up their own minds about tuition
fees in due course. I am sorry, but I still cannot reconcile that statement
with remarks on the record by Mr McLeish that quite clearly say that the
two parties will come to an agreement within the coalition Executive on
what the line is on tuition fees and that both parliamentary parties will
be bound by it. Those two points of view are not compatible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Keith Raffan (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(LD): </strong>Will Mr Swinney give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>Please excuse me-I would
normally give way, but I have only two minutes. I worked in the business
world before I became a full-time parliamentarian and when two companies
came together there was always a debate on whether it was a merger or a
takeover. I think all of us in the Parliament know that the coalition agreement
was not a merger but a takeover: the Liberal Democrats were the wee party
and the Labour party was the big party.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>It has been a fascinating
discussion so far. I was intrigued by the contribution from Mr Sheridan,
whose support I welcome. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I was also intrigued by the
contribution from Patricia Godman, who referred to Keir Hardie. I have
to tell her that she will never get off the back benches by invoking the
name of a socialist in the chamber. I was very intrigued by the lack of
answers to the question posed by the persistent Mr Adam and I congratulate
him on his persistence. The truth that his unanswered question elucidates
is that the coalition is a result of a partnership of give and take-the
Liberal Democrats giving and the Labour party taking. That is the foundation
on which it is based.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am intrigued by the faith that is being
placed in the proposed committee of inquiry. Mr Canavan said that we have
already had a national review in the general election. He is right, but
preceding that there was a review in the Dearing and Garrick reports of
the whole issue of funding of higher education, which came to a particular
conclusion on fees. All the political parties had an opportunity to consider
those reports and to come to their own conclusions on tuition fees. My
party did so, as did the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have had all the inquiries, reports
and reviews that we need to take a decision. We took a decision in our
parties and the people took a decision on 6 May. The committee of inquiry,
as Dennis Canavan rightly said, is a complete and utter fudge-it is a fig
leaf and a delaying tactic to allow time for arm-twisting, or perhaps for
gentle persuasion by Mr McLeish, in order to get a particular outcome.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have been bombarded with letters from
people in higher education requesting a wider review, because those people
rightly feel that the Government will not make up the difference by providing
the additional funding that those institutions need. That would be the
real solution. Our solution is for Mr McConnell, as the new Minister for
Finance, to sharpen his pencil, reduce the bloated administration, and
redeploy some of the funds into the people's priorities-the abolition of
tuition fees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

However, this is an era of new politics, and by progressing in a partnership
agreement we have shown that such politics are possible. When I hear criticisms,
it is with a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. I remember criticisms from
the same coalition of the SNP and Tories when the Liberal Democrats went
into the constitutional convention with a broad range of Scottish civic
opinion. We were told that, as Liberal Democrats, we would be eaten up,
and that by selling out our principles we would not get anywhere. Yet the

the chance to answer the charges against them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the new politics, in which the voting
system was always likely to make all parties minorities, we said all along
that we would be willing to talk to the party with the largest number of
seats, to consider whether a partnership agreement for a stable and effective
Government could be achieved. By their votes, it was the people of Scotland
who shaped the composition of this Parliament. It is up to us, the elected
members of the Scottish Parliament, to make the effort to secure fair,
stable and effective government, recognising that no single party has been
given unlimited power by the people of Scotland. We talked for four days
to achieve our negotiated partnership. It is a partnership that will last
for four years. As Trish Godman said, our partnership agreement is open
and it is on the record. We will be accountable according to that partnership
agreement. The alternative would be four years of a hamstrung minority
Government, with deals being cobbled together on the back stairs night
after night. There would be no accountability and no notion of what was
being traded for what.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

well as meeting our opportunities and challenges.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I appreciate that the culture of coalition
government is not one with which we are very familiar in this country.
Through either naivety or mischief, people think that the smaller party
in a coalition can still achieve its whole manifesto. It is worth remembering
what we have achieved: the investment of new real resources in our schools;
additional teachers; more investment in books and equipment; immediate
measures to tackle student hardship and to improve access to education;
building on the health opportunities fund to promote public health; a healthy
homes initiative to tackle dampness; a freedom of information regime; progress
towards reform of the electoral system for local government; and a ministry
for rural affairs, with specific measures to help farmers who are dogged
by form filling and to promote quality Scottish meat produce. Our manifesto
is committed to providing opportunities for new types of public and private
partnerships. I do not think that Mr McLetchie ever read our manifesto.
That commitment will allow assets-where appropriate-to revert to public
ownership. We are also committed to freezing the tolls on the Skye bridge
for the rest of the contract period. All those commitments are more than
was ever on offer before and we have managed to negotiate them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Liberal Democrats remain committed to the
abolition of tuition fees, as my colleague Mike Rumbles indicated. A crucial
element that is spelt out in the agreement is that we remain free to support
that view and argue the case for it. We are the only party in this Parliament
that has so far taken an initiative on tuition fees, with the exception
of an amendment lodged by Mr Canavan. In spite of all the rhetoric, neither
Mr Salmond's party nor Mr McLetchie's party has spelt out how they would
fulfil and finance their commitment to Scotland's students.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have secured, as a matter of urgency,
the establishment of a committee of inquiry, whose membership, time scale
and terms of reference will be approved by this Parliament. That committee
will address not only tuition fees, but financial support for those participating
part time and full time in further and higher education. I share Mr Canavan's
concern about hardship among students. That was also mentioned by Mary
Scanlon, although I do not think that the Tory party is in any position
to lecture on student hardship.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Much has been said about principles. A
belief in the basic worth, merit and integrity of every individual is what
drives me as a liberal and as a Liberal Democrat. I believe in freedom
from ignorance, and our policies are to improve access to and to invest
in education. I believe in freedom from disease, and our policies will
bring about a patient-centred health service, tackling bad health and promoting
good health. I believe in freedom for each individual to fulfil his or
her potential, and that is why we want to tap the reservoir of enterprise
and to tackle the vicious circle of deprivation and underachievement. Those
are fundamental principles to me and to my party. They are such important
principles that I do not want just to talk about them; I want to do something
about them. That is why we are prepared to go into government and put those

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):</strong>
The next business is a debate on a motion from the First Minister, which
seeks the agreement of the Parliament to the appointment of the junior
Scottish ministers. I will put the question on the motion and on the amendment
no later than one hour after the First Minister has opened the debate.
I intend to select amendment S1M-5.1, as printed in the business bulletin.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">14:30</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister (Donald Dewar): </strong>I
will be brief. We are debating the list of ministers outwith the Cabinet.
Of course, I have no difficulty in commending the names on that list to
members. I know that there has been some criticism of the size of the list.
Mr David McLetchie made reference to that in this morning's debate. He
used the phrase</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"an explosion of bureaucracy and red tape".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He said that he was looking for a "smaller,
smarter" Administration that was not "bloated"-to use his happy word. I
do not know whether my colleagues qualify as being bloated but the only
explosion was probably of rhetoric.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I submit to the Parliament that there is
a need for proper supervision of the Administration and for adequate scrutiny.
As many people have said today, anyone who has served in the Scottish Office
or who has a knowledge of the stress, strain and difficulty of stretching
political scrutiny across the vast range of responsibilities previously
held by the Scottish Office and now passed to this Parliament will understand
why I believe that there must be an adequate group of ministers, each specialising
in a particular area.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to make a small prediction. I may
be wrong, but I predict that over the next week or two there will be criticism
that we do not have an individual minister for such-and-such an area. If
members look through the party manifestos-I would not necessarily recommend
anyone to do so-they will see that those documents are sprinkled with demands
for not just ministers, but separate ministries for a number of areas.
I noticed in the press today that there was criticism of the fact that
we do not have a separate ministry for tourism, as distinct from a minister
responsible for tourism. The pressure may be to increase ministerial coverage,
not to restrict it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the Cabinet side, we have a good basis.
This is an occasion on which, surprisingly, I am totally&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at one with the
Scottish National party. I took the trouble to look at its manifesto, which,
at the back, describes the nine key posts that the SNP believes should
make up the Cabinet. If one adds a business manager and the Lord Advocate,
who everyone would expect to be included, we arrive at exactly the same
number of ministers, with a large overlap of responsibility and definition.
I suspect that it will become clear that our choices for the junior posts
are wise and well defined.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):
</strong>The SNP has criticised the choice rather than the number of ministers.
What policy will a junior minister with specific responsibility for fisheries
pursue on the transfer of 6,000 square miles of fishing waters to English
jurisdiction? How did that transfer, which is causing such anxiety within
the Scottish fishing industry, happen?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>The junior minister,
like the senior minister, would be expected to follow the collective policy
of the Administration. He would not be allowed to go off on a fishing trip
of his own, if I may put it that way. He would have to follow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am sure that we will return to the question
of fishing. However, as Alex Salmond will know, the order was made in early
March, and was explained in a Scottish Office press release at the time.
The order went through the House of Commons on 23 March. If the SNP missed
it-I can understand how such things happen-it, too, may have some explaining
to do.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I believe that this group of junior ministers
has talent and considerable relevant experience. I look forward to working
with a very able group of ministers who will be of enormous support to
the principal ministers in their departments. The junior ministers will
be part of a corporate team; that is an important point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have heard a lot about tuition fees
and this and that; we have also had some wonderful mixed metaphors. I particularly
enjoyed David McLetchie's remark that the committee of inquiry was both
a fudge and a fig leaf. I would have thought it would be either one or
the other. If I could mix metaphors even more, he probably thinks that
we are using belt and braces. In any event, it was a cheery debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In his speech, Jim Wallace referred to
three substantial concessions that have been overlooked. Those substantial
concessions are for those from poorer backgrounds who stay on at school
to get university qualifications and who require financial support. There
will also be support for part-time mature students. Moreover, the access
fund has been increased to &pound;14 million. Those concessions are worth
underlining because they provide practical help and broaden the base of
entry to higher education. Perhaps that-I put&nbsp;</font></td>

We have heard a lot about spending but not a lot about what will be cut.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister:</strong> I know that
Andrew Wilson was one of the chief architects of the SNP manifesto. As
the SNP was attempting to buy the sun, the moon and the stars-and various
other things-on the basis of savings within the Scottish Office block budget,
it is a little odd that he should question me on spending.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister:</strong> Just let me
finish. We have taken steps to ensure that there is a debate on these matters;
no doubt such points can be addressed then.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Today, we are putting forward a team which
I believe stands for partnership and progress. This is not a matter of
scoring and totalling up points. Obviously, the partnership agreement is
not an exhaustive list-it was never meant to be-but a way of establishing
and proving that there is an identity of interest and a common approach
over a wide spread of policy areas, which we believe will be the basis
for the effective operation of government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What I am interested in above all, and
what I think people in Scotland are interested in, is in ensuring that
the operation of government is effective and that the Government delivers
on the key areas of the social justice agenda-education and health-in the
way that was promised in the partnership document and in our respective
Liberal Democrat and Labour manifestos. We have the people to do that;
what we need now is the support of this chamber so that they can take up
their ministerial posts and get on with the work.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I start by expressing the apologies of
Annabel Goldie, who intended to move the amendment but was called away
for a funeral.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the First Minister does not recognise
the difference between a fudge and a fig leaf, he does not inspire me with
confidence. This morning, he referred to the misses that I made. I missed
winning Ayr by 25 votes, reducing the Labour majority by some 6,500. I
do not intend to miss it next time round.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This morning, there was a lot of hot air
and indignation against those of us who dared to question the make-up of
the First Minister's lists. The First Minister was dismissive about our
amendment, which the Presiding Officer accepted for debate. He referred
to a little huddle of amendments, which perhaps sets the tone for future
Government-led debates.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Labour members express dismay at the loss
of consensus in the new style of politics. In every respect, their way
is the Blairite way: "Do not question, just accept and do what I say."
That may be good enough for Labour and Liberal members, but it is certainly
not good enough for Conservative members or for Dennis Canavan, as the
points that he made this morning show.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">New politics? The Scottish electorate would
settle for honest politics. They would like to believe that politicians
mean what they say, which is precisely what this amendment is about.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have no beef with the Labour party other
than over the number of ministerial positions created. Hugh Henry gave
the game away to the Liberals this morning when he said that the partnership
was about delivering on Labour's manifesto commitments. For the Labour
party it may be partnership; for the Liberals it is absorption.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A comparison between the document "Partnership
for Scotland" and the Liberals' election pledges emphasises the scale of
the sell-out. That is why I ask members to support the amendment. I bear
no personal animosity towards Nicol Stephen or Iain Smith. Like, I suspect,
most of us in the chamber, I know little of them, but I know that they
supported their leader when he said two days before the election that tuition
fees would be dead on the following Friday.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nicol Stephen boasted that the Liberals
had done more than any other party to campaign against Labour's tuition
fees, but he now condones them. How can he condone-how can we condone-the
appointment of Nicol Stephen and Iain Smith as Government ministers when

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This morning, Conservatives were criticised
for not having prepared the way for the abolition of tuition fees, but
that comment showed a lack of knowledge. We tabled a bill in the House
of Lords. Our measures were costed and could have been covered within the

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Liberals' motion on tuition fees is

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We also heard about reviews yesterday,
when Mr McCabe and Mr Dewar attempted to put the issue of prayers on the
back burner. That is typical of Labour. We need to examine what Labour
has done recently. The Scottish air traffic control centre at Prestwick
has been on the back burner for the past two years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>If Donald does not
know what I am talking about, I suggest that he gets to grips with these
issues, because they are important to Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Like defence cuts, the A77 upgrade has
been put on the back burner in order to waste time and to lay off implementing
those aims that Labour has but that it has not declared since it was elected.
I suspect that more issues will be put on the back burner following the
difficulties that Labour is having at Westminster over social security
reform.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Let us not get fixated on tuition fees.
What about the Liberals' pledge to end the beef-on-the-bone ban? People
spoke about the medical risk, but the chance was 1 billion to one. None
of us would even consider such a risk when travelling to this place. What
about the abolition of eye-test and dental charges and the Liberals' stand
against the private finance initiative? All those ideals seem to have gone
down the tubes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):
</strong>On behalf of the Scottish National party, I support the amendment to
leave out Mr Nicol Stephen. Like others, I do so on the basis not of personality,
but of policies. Accountability, accessibility and transparency were principles
that underpinned the consultative steering group report. The document arose
out of and reflected the application of those principles. Many meetings
were held, and they were open and accountable. Public views were canvassed,
public views were sought and welcomed, and public views were reflected
and echoed in the document.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What has happened in the past few days?
First, our Parliament, adjourned for nigh on 300 years, has reconvened
and been opened to public view. A great deal of public warmth and sympathy
has been extended. Secondly, and sadly, a deal has been brokered behind
closed doors-behind the back of the electorate and behind the back of Liberal
Democrat members and voters. As Mr Canavan said earlier, the electorate
spoke on 6 May, in clear public view.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I regret that the electorate in Aberdeen
South did not choose my party. That is their democratic right and entitlement.
They selected Mr Stephen and supported the policies and platform on which
he stood. His victory was acknowledged by my party with all the dignity
and decorum that went with the occasion. However, the electorate did not
select or vote for the Labour party candidate, so Mr Stephen has no democratic
right whatever to sell out his principles or the policies and platform
on which he stood and sought election.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As my colleague
Mr Hamilton said earlier, this is not a partnership but a takeover-a lock,
stock and barrel takeover of the soul of liberal democracy. That is clearly
shown in the document "Partnership for Scotland"-otherwise known, as far
as I can see, as the unconditional surrender of liberal democracy in Scotland.
Never in the recent history of Scottish politics has so much been ceded
by so many for so very little.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The document refers to the settled will
of the Scottish people. On 11 September 1997 and again on 6 May 1999, the
people of Scotland expressed their settled will. That is fine. I believe
that their settled will was that tuition fees should be dead in the water.
We have found that that promise has been reneged on. It was not, as far
as I can tell, election rhetoric. It was not even empty rhetoric. It was,
as I remind Mr Wallace, a simple statement of fact that tuition fees would
be dead if all those parties that pledged their opposition to them remained
firm and true to the pledges that they gave to the electorate and upon
which they sought to be returned.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

is with particular pleasure that I support the two nominees whom I know

their ability, experience and integrity. I also wish the other nominees
for junior minister well.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I take this opportunity to wish the First
Minister well. I did not vote for him last week, but there was nothing
personal in that. I did not feel that it was right to hold the vote on
the First Minister before the composition of his Administration was clear,
as it now is. I have a high regard for the First Minister. We go back a
long way-back to 1966, when I unsuccessfully tried to prevent him from
becoming the member of Parliament for Aberdeen South. I wish him and his
Administration every success for the country's sake.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I did not vote for the partnership agreement.
That was a very difficult decision for me to take as our negotiators achieved
far more than I expected. As a result, there is a lot of good in the agreement.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Robin Harper: </strong>Does Mr Raffan agree
that, despite what he has said, it is a matter of considerable regret that
the Liberal party has abandoned its commitment to ban the further planting
of genetically modified crops in Scotland? The Liberals have a commitment
in their manifesto that there should be no commercial planting of GM crops.
I know that it has not yet started, but the pressures for commercial planting
will now be excessive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

was an intervention as well.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Robin Harper: </strong>Is it a matter of

I am worried about my four minutes-Mr Harper seems to have taken half of

catch up with the school building maintenance backlog, which exists thanks
to the Tories. We might not have secured the 500 extra teachers without

in terms of the ministries. Ministries exist to do a job. Last Thursday,
we elected the First Minister with a clear majority; the other three candidates
somewhat disappeared.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When the two parties sat down and discussed
the "Partnership for Scotland" agreement, things were taken from both manifestos.
The agreement was brought to the Parliament; people have had a chance to
look at it and it has been agreed by the majority of members.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Labour and the Liberal Democrats have come
together and agreed to create a ministry for enterprise and lifelong learning
to deliver a sustainable economy for Scotland. That gives focus to the
delivery in Scotland of Labour's pledge to young people-the new deal-and
to the 20,000 modern apprenticeships that were promised and will be delivered
by the Labour party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As someone who represents East Kilbride,
which is well known for innovation, economic development and employment
in a new town, I believe that that ministry has a great role to play. I
ask the minister, after he has taken office on 1 July, to visit East Kilbride
to see some of the good examples that we have set.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We want to increase the number of business
start-ups. The role of one of the ministries is to develop 100,000 new
businesses in Scotland in order to increase and stabilise employment. We
must ensure a balance of responsibilities between home and working life
to enable people to educate themselves-that is part of lifelong learning
and also a role for one of the ministries.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yes, a debate over tuition fees will occur,
but not as people have said. This is the Scottish Parliament, not Westminster,
where things are put to committee and then disappear. The committee of
inquiry will be run in the interests of members and it will report back
with recommendations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Putting tuition fees aside, because we
have an agreed position on them, we can perhaps discuss maturely the real
business for today. We should agree the appointment of ministers, not endlessly
discuss tuition fees. The reality is that 54 per cent of students do not
pay tuition fees, 23 per cent pay partial fees and 23 per cent pay the
full fees. Members should also remember the 42,000 extra places for students
in Scotland-equivalent to the number of students at Edinburgh and Glasgow
universities put together. Those are the real issues for today, which I
hope the Opposition parties will debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that the Scottish people may have other ideas. We heard a great deal earlier

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What we seem to have in the proposed appointment
of Nicol Stephen as the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning-perhaps
that should be lifelong debt for Scotland's students-is an attempt to find
some glue to hold the whole thing together. At least, that is the charitable
view. The less charitable but I suspect more accurate view is that&nbsp;<a NAME="OLE_LINK1"></a>Nicol
Stephen is being stitched up by his so-called new friends on the Labour
benches, tied in to supporting a policy that he campaigned against in the
election, and when the time comes, to supporting his boss over his own
party colleagues. In supporting this amendment I urge to give serious consideration
to voting for it because I suspect that in the months and years ahead he
will look back and realise that it is in his own political interests to
do so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I took part in a couple of debates with
Nicol in Aberdeen during the election campaign. I heard him promise his
constituents that he would abolish tuition fees. I believed him. I think
his constituents believed him as well. So I urge him today to follow his
conscience and not to follow the Labour party in imposing tuition fees
on students in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is not the interests of that are important
in this Parliament, however; it is the interests of the Scottish people.
In the foreword to the CSG report Henry McLeish said that the people in
Scotland have high hopes for their Parliament. That is something we are
all acutely aware of in the early days of the Parliament. We know that
the decision that we take now will shape the Parliament for many years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is why we, as members of the first
Scottish Parliament, must be guided by the principles that guided the consultative
steering group. That group envisaged an open, accessible Parliament in
which power would be shared between the Parliament, the Executive and the
Scottish people, with an Executive that would be accountable to the Parliament
and a Parliament that would be accountable to the Scottish people. However,
the first act of the present Executive was to go behind closed doors and
cut a secret deal-a deal that seems to have been motivated more by the
pursuit of power than by the priorities of the Scottish people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the will of the people of Scotland, on the subject of tuition fees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

who before the election declared the abolition of tuition fees to be non-negotiable,

if we are to believe Labour sources he has been duped as far as power is
concerned-and the fact that Nicol Stephen is lining up behind Mr McLeish
as deputy minister for tuition fees, should be unacceptable to this Parliament.
I think that it will be unacceptable to the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we are to build a Parliament that can

afternoon, several people have asked what the real issue of this debate
is. The real issue is that a major Scottish political party has reneged
clearly and categorically on promises that it made to the electorate. That
is a disgraceful and shameful situation. Let us consider what has been
cobbled together. The Liberals say that they have achieved 48 of their
aims-of course they have. The only reason that they have achieved those
aims is that they were in the Labour manifesto as well. Many of those issues
were also dealt with by the SNP and the Conservatives-so that is what the
Liberal Democrats have got: absolutely nothing. And what have they lost?
They have lost political credibility and respect. As I listened to the

it be before it is totally subsumed by the Labour party?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to get off. How will Mr Smith explain that to his boss, Mr McCabe?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The other issue to emerge from today's
debate is, as David McLetchie said, the size of the Administration. That
will no doubt be costed in due course. It will be interesting when the
cost of ministerial salaries is weighed against what that Administration
can produce. "Education, education, education" may have been the mantra
of 1997, but how much of the Parliament's money that is about to be spent
on a bloated and oversized Administration could be used for the benefit
of education? How much of it could be used to provide additional school
books and additional classroom assistants?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue of tuition fees, however, is
one that cannot be sidetracked, because its effect on the Scottish people
is manifest. The system has caused a dramatic fall in applications, it
has affected middle-income families, and is generally unfair. It is a chicken
that will, in due course, come very firmly home to roost. Although I do

to be part of a Labour team that seeks to celebrate and embrace difference,
but which will challenge the underlying and damaging inequalities than
can emerge from those differences.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am pleased to support the nominations
of Frank McAveety and Jackie Baillie, who, with Wendy Alexander, will be
responsible for leading the fight for social inclusion and justice. There
are many causes of exclusion, whether of the carer looking after a dementia
sufferer, the woman victim of male violence, the young black person suffering
a racist attack, or the child whose life chances are already significantly
determined by the time he or she goes to school. It is fitting that Scotland's
first Administration in Scotland's first democratic Parliament should have
social inclusion as a central aim.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A crucial area of inequality that must
be addressed is the experience of women. I am proud of Labour's record
on equal representation. It was done not by proportional representation
nor by accident, but as the result of the determination of women in the
Labour movement, and outside it, to ensure that, from the beginning, this
Parliament would be different.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the fact that Labour's team for
tackling social exclusion contains two strong women, giving practical meaning
to all our aspirations for the women of Scotland. Our challenge will be
not only to work for the women of Scotland, but to work with them, to bring
about real change.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Perhaps people are wondering what the difference
might be. I am the first woman ever to represent the people of Pollok-records
go back to 1761-and that is a responsibility that I take seriously. I hope
that we will now have the opportunity to create a politics that seeks practical
outcomes, empowers those who need changes, and ends the world of gesture
politics that is, regrettably, so beloved of many people in this chamber,
who, soundly beaten in the election, want to use this Parliament to go
on performing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Wendy Alexander and her team seek not gesture
but action. We should welcome a strategy for social inclusion that emphasises
the crucial and critical role of communities in determining priorities
for themselves. We welcome action on housing and action to tackle child
poverty.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>I have just stopped
after twenty years spent working with young people and their families who
faced more challenges in their everyday lives than we shall ever know.
Our children's voices must be heard and their stories must inform and drive
our priorities in power. They can tell us the cost of poverty. They can
tell us what happens to their educational opportunities. Given what the
Tories have done to create social disaffection during the past 20 years,
I for one would have pause for thought to wonder whether my priorities
are the same as those of the Tories on the question of tuition fees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those young people know the impact of poverty
on their health and emotional well-being. We should be outraged at the
affront that the statistics of poverty give to our idea of a new Scotland.
I commend Labour's team to members, and I urge support for a team and a
strategy that must address inequality and that will embrace the power of
co-operation. I am supported by the Co-operative party and by the Co-operative
movement. We have nothing to fear from co-operation. We must celebrate
community and give power to communities in order that the Scottish Parliament
can take on the responsibility of tackling the deep-rooted injustice that
is faced by too many young Scots.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>I
got the impression from this morning's debate that some members of the
Labour party were questioning the right to challenge the list, and that
this debate should somehow be a formality. The demand for Nicol Stephen's
removal from the list presented to us today is certainly not made in a
mean-spirited manner. In this new democracy we have a duty and a responsibility
to challenge anything that calls into question the democratic will of the
Scottish people who, quite clearly, are against tuition fees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This debate is about the content of the
"Partnership for Scotland" document. Rather than being for Scotland, it
is a partnership for two political parties that are hungry for power. It
is a partnership against students and free education and for Labour's privatisation
agenda, and which has cost implications that must be challenged in debate.
We need more resources for education, but since the Liberal Democrats abandoned
the notion of tax-varying powers in their deal, they had better ensure
that education spending is not paid for by health and housing cuts and
the things that the previous speaker mentioned.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">prayers-a concept
which I think is inappropriate, but of which I could see the logic. There
is, however, something that you cannot have proportionally, and that is
principle. Principle is measured in absolute terms, and on tuition fees,
the Liberal Democrats do not have it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue of tuition fees was a touchstone
in the Scottish elections because education matters to the people of Scotland.
Anyone who has studied the evolution of education in Scotland will know
that it is the principle of free education that we uphold. That is why,
although the Tories have seen sense on this issue, their attack is blunted.
They started the cuts in grants and maintenance that are continued under
new Labour. It is important that we remember that free education is not
just about tuition fees; it is also about grants and about maintenance.
Up to 12 per cent fewer mature students are applying for university places-that
is not a very good advert for lifelong learning, Mr Stephen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This Parliament should be about building
trust, so that our young people believe that the democratic process can
work for them. Mr Stephen's appointment is an action that would destroy
that trust. How can we persuade young people to engage in the political
process and to come out and vote when, the Scottish people having given
the Parliament a clear mandate to scrap tuition fees, as soon as it sits,
it turns its back on them? If we want young people to engage in political
and democratic processes, they must be treated with respect.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I warn Jim Wallace not to hide behind the
coat tails of the National Union of Students. Its president may not be
completely impartial, having campaigned less than a fortnight ago for a
minister who was approved today-Sarah Boyack. As a student leader she led
me and many others at the University of Glasgow in campaigns against cuts
in student grants. The Labour front bench is awash with former student
leaders, who should know about student poverty, including Jack McConnell
and Susan Deacon. I understand that Susan used to campaign for fair grants
and against any loan schemes. It is interesting how times change.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If a week is a long time in politics, we
have seen a century and a chasm in thinking from Labour since it became
new and high office prevailed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A final criticism is that the architecture
of these appointments is more reflective of selfish party power dealings
than the interests of democracy. The Scottish people had hoped for the
creative use of Government departments and that joined-up thinking would
be reflected in department structures. The split of higher education from
the education brief is not to serve innovative Government, it is to serve
and accommodate&nbsp;</font></td>
