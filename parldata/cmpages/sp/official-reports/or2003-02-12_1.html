Anne L McIntyre (Leader of the Prayer for Parliament, Scotland, Intercessors Team):</strong> 
Presiding Officer and members of the Scottish Parliament, thank you for the privilege 
of being here today. Some of the prayer team are with you every week&#151;albeit 
from afar&#151;in the public gallery. It is a real joy to come down to the floor 
of the chamber and speak to members face to face, eye to eye, and heart to heart.</P><P>St 
John's gospel opens with the words:</P><P>&quot;The Word became flesh and dwelt 
among us full of grace and truth.&quot;</P><P>It also records numerous accounts 
of Jesus meeting individuals and groups. One meeting was with an MRC&#151;a member 
of the ruling council. Nicodemus was determined to meet this powerful man face 
to face. On greeting Jesus, he declared him, eye to eye, to be a man from God. 
Jesus gave an immediate and incisive reply to Nicodemus's heart&#151;he said that 
you need to be born of the Spirit. Jesus went on to explain that God is a Spirit 
and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. He gave Nicodemus, 
and gives us, the key to a possible living relationship with God, making effective 
prayer a reality.</P><P>This week, you have sacrificed your mid-term recess to 
complete as much of the outstanding work as possible in the remaining 32 working 
days of the session. You will then immediately take part in a gruelling 31-day 
election campaign. So, let us hear the word of the Lord, for you, from Isaiah, 
chapter 40:</P><P>&quot;The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends 
of the earth.<BR> He will not grow tired or weary and His understanding is inscrutable.<BR> 
Those who choose to wait for the Lord will gain new strength.<BR> They will mount 
up with wings as eagles<BR> They will run and not grow weary<BR> They will walk 
and not faint.&quot;</P><P>&quot;New strength&quot;&#151;for a mountain of amendments

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Education</STRONG></P><P> <strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_3"></A>The 
Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel): </STRONG>The first debate this morning is 
on motion S1M-3879, in the name of Michael Russell, on education. I invite all 
those who want to take part in the debate to indicate that now.</P><P>09:34</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Two weeks ago in the chamber, the 
Minister for Education and Young People launched a glossy document called &quot;Educating 
for Excellence: Choice and Opportunity&quot;&#151;I have a copy of it in my hand. 
I am sorry that the Minister for Education and Young People is not here today. 
Most people in Scottish education looked forward to the document. We are talking 
not about the great debate, but about the response to the great debate. Our motion 
finds the Executive's response to that debate wanting.</P><P>We should consider 
what the great debate brought forward and what those who were encouraged to respond 
to the debate said. People had to be encouraged to respond, because many were 
obviously confused by the process. The team that was established to analyse the 
results of the great debate&#151;Professor Pamela Munn and her colleagues at the 
University of Edinburgh&#151;identified four key areas that required improved 
funding and support. The first area was more pupil choice. In the document, there 
is repetition in respect of further initiatives, further interventions and an 
overcrowded curriculum, but there is no indication that anything in the document 
will produce more pupil choice.</P><P>People wanted smaller class sizes. There 
is a vague commitment to those in the document, but it is not backed up with any 
details or concrete proposals.</P><P>People wanted more professionally qualified 
teachers, but the document and the minister's statement two weeks ago are heavy 
on matters such as adult to pupil ratios and light on the key issue of getting 
additional teachers into classrooms to make a difference. Indeed, the Executive's 
projections on teacher numbers show that it is intended that numbers will peak 
in 2007 and fall thereafter.</P><P>People wanted better buildings. Many reports, 
including the Accounts Commission's report, say that the way to get better buildings 
is not through the current private finance initiative scheme. The Accounts Commission 
report, which was published in January 2003, showed that it was harder to get 
better-designed buildings under PFI procurement, particularly buildings with wider

<P>corridors, enough social space, swimming pools and good equipment.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_5"></A>Dr 
Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab): </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell: </strong>No&#151;I have only just started. I will give way shortly.</P><P>On 
the key requirements, there is an obvious mismatch between what people want and 
the Executive's responses. The most dramatic mismatch relates to a key requirement 
that came through in virtually every request in the great debate&#151;a move away 
from performance measurement, tick boxes and meaningless statistics and towards 
actual achievement in education. The gap between achievement in education and 
what the Executive has proposed is as dramatic as the gap between the Executive's 
rhetoric over the past four years and the reality of Scottish education.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_7"></A>Dr 
Jackson: </strong>Has the member visited Balfron High School? Many characteristics 
that he said were not appearing in new schools have appeared there.</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell: </strong>I am sure that some buildings are better than others and that, 
if the member believes that Balfron High School is among the best of those buildings, 
she will carry that belief, no matter what the evidence is to the contrary. However, 
the reality is that PFI contracts throughout Scotland are not delivering the buildings 
that are needed, particularly as they do not allow schools to be built in a way 
that will reduce class sizes.</P><P>The gap between the Scottish Executive's rhetoric 
and the reality is absolutely stunning. One should consider what the Executive 
has promised and what it has delivered. To some extent, I am sorry that the Deputy 
Minister for Education and Young People is here, as he is not responsible for 
that gap. He did not write the Labour party's manifesto or other documents in 
the Labour party's name. However, he must take responsibility for them&#151;that 
is one of the pitfalls of coalition.</P><P>The gap between what was promised and 
what has been achieved is stark. One target in the Labour party's manifesto was 
for</P><P>&quot;80% of children to reach the appropriate standard in reading, 
writing and arithmetic by the time they leave primary school.&quot;</P><P>The 
reality is that, in reading, 28 per cent of pupils, in writing, 41 per cent of 
pupils, and in maths, 32 per cent of pupils did not reach the basic minimum level 
expected of them by primary 7. That is a gap between rhetoric and reality.</P><P>Another 
pledge was that there would be</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17991">17991</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>&quot;An e-mail address for every Scottish child and at least 4 modern computers 
per class.&quot;</P><P>That has not been achieved. There are 2.2 computers per 
primary class and only 16 per cent of primary school children have an e-mail address; 
indeed, not even two-thirds of secondary school children have an e-mail address.</P><P>There 
is a whole list of other examples. The Labour party's manifesto target was for</P><P>&quot;13,000 
pupils to achieve higher standards at Standard and Higher grades.&quot;</P><P>The 
gap in attainment at standard grade is now wider than when the Labour party took 
office.</P><P>Another target was for</P><P>&quot;Every child in Scotland to have 
access to an After School Club.&quot;</P><P>That process has hardly started.</P><P>Another 
target was to</P><P>&quot;Reduce by half the number of 16/17 year olds who do 
not go on to education, training or a job&quot;</P><P>between 1999 and 2002. That 
gap grew.</P><P>Another target was to reduce school exclusions and truancy by 
a third. Since 1999, unauthorised absence in primary schools has risen by 30 per 
cent and in secondary schools by 21 per cent. The statistics for violence in schools 
are off the chart.</P><P>Another target was to recruit 5,000 extra classroom assistants 
by 2002. That is the target that Labour trumpeted most, but it has not been achieved. 
The target of 1,000 additional teachers by 2002 has not been achieved. Another 
target was to improve assessment by 2003 so that achievement could be measured 
effectively; the Executive has given up talking about that, such is the mess that 
it is in. Another target was the development by 2002 of a comprehensive building 
strategy. The school estates strategy that was published last week contained none 
of the promised information. It is empty rhetoric; all that it asks for is information 
by December 2003.</P><P>I could go on with that list, but there is a longer list 
of the gap between rhetoric and reality in education. It is extremely important 
that that gap is closed, but &quot;Educating for Excellence: Choice and Opportunity&quot; 
does not close it. Within hours of the document being published, those who know 
something about education were complaining about it.</P><P>An example is the proposals 
on inspection, which were very confused last week. Cathy Jamieson talked about 
stronger inspection and the document mentions &quot;'proportionate' inspection.&quot; 
The following Friday, after the document was published, an article in <em>The</em> 
<em>Times Educational Supplement Scotland</em> started:</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17992">17992</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>&quot;Education directors have told Cathy Jamieson there is no need for extra 
Scottish Executive powers to deal with schools or authorities deemed to be failing 
pupils.&quot;</P><P>The directors of education state that there is no need for 
the extra powers. There is a gap between rhetoric and reality. We must close that 
gap in the coming Scottish Parliament elections. We must say to people in Scotland, 
&quot;This is what can be achieved in Scottish education and this is how we are 
going to achieve it.&quot;</P><P>I will focus on three issues that need to be 
addressed; they are listed in the SNP motion. The first of those issues is smaller 
class sizes. There is a desperate need for that throughout each school, but there 
is a particular need in primaries 1, 2 and 3, where investment in smaller class 
sizes produces the biggest results. That can be achieved and it will be achieved 
by an SNP-led Executive, because it has to be done. Sylvia Jackson finds that 
amusing; she finds anything that will bring forward real change in Scotland amusing. 
That is the problem with Labour in Scotland; it can only laugh at the reality 
of real change, because it is unable to achieve it. It is essential to have smaller 
class sizes in the early years in Scottish primary schools.</P><P>The second issue 
is simplification of the five-to-14 curriculum, with a new emphasis on core skills. 
The minister talked two weeks ago about literacy and numeracy being among our 
most pressing problems, but the document states that the Executive will carry 
on with the present failed policies. We know that those policies have failed. 
We must simplify the core curriculum and introduce an emphasis on core skills. 
In secondary 1 and 2, where the problem is most pressing, we must not play around 
with ideas of a teacher here or a teacher there; we must refocus on core skills.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>Will Michael Russell give 
way?</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>No thank you.</P><P>It is impossible 
to have a modern and vibrant economy and a successful Scotland without an emphasis 
on core skills. We build on those core skills of thinking and learning. If they 
are not deeply embedded by S1 and S2&#151;and, according to the figures, they 
are not&#151;the prospects for Scotland and its economy are grim.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Monteith: </strong>Michael Russell talks about core skills. Will he define what 
he means by telling the chamber what subjects will be dropped to establish core 
skills? Will music, art, science or ecology be dropped? What will be removed from 
the curriculum to establish the remaining subjects as core skills?</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell: </strong>That shows about as much understanding of the process of simplifying 
the five-to-14 curriculum as does Mr Monteith's </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17993">17993</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>amendment, which I find baffling.</P><P>It is necessary to deconstruct the 
current curriculum and take it back to the core skills. The curriculum can then 
be rebuilt on the basis of all the things that we have talked about, which centre 
on the core skills. Any primary teacher in any classroom in Scotland understands 
that. It says something about the Conservatives' education spokesperson that he 
does not understand it.</P><P>The start of this Parliament was seen as a time 
when people in Scotland might establish renewed faith in the delivery of public 
services in Scotland. They have spent four years looking for an opportunity to 
re-establish that faith. It is a cruel hoax on the people of Scotland, after a 
so-called great debate, to produce a document that is as empty of initiative and 
as empty of solutions as &quot;Educating for Excellence&quot;. It is an even crueller 
hoax to come to the chamber and try to justify the document on the basis that 
it is what people want. In respect of the document, people have asked for bread 
and they have been given a stone. [<em>Interruption.</em>] I am sorry that a quotation 
from the scriptures makes Karen Gillon laugh.</P><P><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) 
(Lab): </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: 
</strong>No.</P><P>People are being deceived in Scotland. It is time that we had 
honest politics that shows that it will deliver. The SNP is pledged to deliver 
real excellence in Scottish education; what it will not do is deceive the people.</P><P>I 
move,</P><P>That the Parliament notes <em>Educating for Excellence: Choice and 
Opportunity</em>, the Scottish Executive's response to the National Debate on 
Education and the statement by the Minister for Education and Young People on 
launching the document; further notes that in places the document is contradicted 
by the Minister's statement; expresses concern that the document contains little 
new despite the high quality of many responses to the consultation; is particularly 
concerned that, despite the Minister's admission in her statement that matters 
of literacy and numeracy &quot;are among our most pressing problems&quot; and 
that &quot;we will not tolerate underperformance in literacy and numeracy&quot;, 
the document contains no clear and firm commitment to actions that will change 
the present situation in which the number of pupils failing to meet the required 
standards of literacy and numeracy by S2 is unacceptably high, and therefore supports 
the Scottish National Party's radical programme to reduce class sizes in the first 
three years of primary education to 18 or below and to re-focus teaching effort 
on core skills throughout the primary school and into the early secondary years.</P><P>09:45</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Education and Young People (Nicol Stephen): </strong>I welcome 
the opportunity for the Parliament to consider again the key issues that face 
education in Scotland. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17994">17994</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Cathy Jamieson presented the Executive response to those issues in her statement 
on the national debate at the end of last month, on the same day that we published 
the document, &quot;Educating for Excellence: Choice and Opportunity&quot;, which 
was referred to in such glowing terms by Mr Russell.</P><P>I remind Mike Russell, 
in among all his false and feigned anger and his bluff and bluster, that the document 
is all about creating choice and opportunity. At the core of the document is a 
move from a one-size-fits-all system to a new curriculum and a new approach to 
education, which meets the needs of each individual pupil. That is the core of 
the document.</P><P>I will start with our plans on class sizes. The Executive 
has already delivered smaller class sizes for pupils in primaries 1, 2 and 3. 
The early years of primary are a critical stage in pupils' education, but we all 
know that many pupils are not making the progress that they should in the later 
stages of primary&#151;primaries 5, 6 and 7&#151;and the first two years of secondary 
school. That is also a critical stage for young people. The Executive is not prepared 
to let those young people miss out on the opportunities that each and every one 
of them should have. We are committed to reviewing class sizes at all critical 
stages&#151;the early stages and the P7 to S1 and S2 transition&#151;and to bringing 
forward proposals to make reductions, after consultation with the education community, 
where they will matter most.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_9"></A>Michael 
Russell: </strong>The minister is aware of the proposals that I mentioned&#151;my 
colleagues will talk about specific proposals. Could he tell me the time scale 
for the reductions that he is talking about, where they will apply and what they 
will cost?</P><P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Not yet, because we will establish 
that in consultation with parents, pupils and education authorities throughout 
Scotland. That is the right approach. It is the approach that we have taken through 
the national debate and it is the approach that we will continue to take. We are 
not going for the single, monolithic SNP policy of reducing class sizes in P1 
to P3; it is not as simple as that. To suggest that it is that simple is to deceive 
pupils and parents throughout Scotland who are looking for improvements to the 
education system.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_11"></A>Mrs Margaret Ewing 
(Moray) (SNP): </strong>Will the minister give way?</P><P><strong>Nicol Stephen: 
</strong>No thank you.</P><P>We are particularly keen to reduce class sizes in 
maths and English as part of our overall strategy to improve literacy and numeracy. 
Mike Russell is correct that we must raise standards of literacy and numeracy. 
We must close the unacceptable </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17995">17995</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>opportunity gap for many of our children in Scotland. Doing that means taking 
action on all fronts.</P><P>Teachers are central to everything that we do throughout 
Scotland's schools. That is why we are reviewing initial teacher education, so 
that new teachers will have even better skills to improve standards of literacy 
and numeracy. We will give literacy and numeracy their place at the heart of a 
fully revised curriculum, emphasising their key importance. Above all, we will 
not tolerate underperformance in literacy and numeracy. We expect education authorities 
to play a key role in driving forward the issues to ensure the highest standards 
in their schools.</P><P>Raising standards means that we need good information 
on the outcomes of education for pupils. I agree that we cannot and should not 
reduce the outcomes of education to simple tables of exam results for each school, 
which is why the Executive rejects league tables in Scotland. The key reason for 
assessment in Scotland should be to support the learning of the individual child. 
That is why the Executive has put in place a framework based on the national priorities 
in education and the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Act 2000, which the SNP 
supported and which was approved by the Parliament.</P><P>We want good education 
authorities and good information for those authorities. We want good teachers 
with good information and we want pupils and parents to have access to excellent 
information to assist the education of each child. We want to take into account 
all the national priorities, not only exam results.</P><P>Later this year, we 
will publish the first baseline report on national priorities, which will draw 
together reports from all schools and education authorities and give a rounded 
picture of what we are achieving in education throughout Scotland. That is a huge 
step forward, but it is only a first step. We will do more to allow parents and 
pupils to achieve a clear and meaningful understanding of each child's development 
and the performance of their school. Exam results will be a part, but only a part, 
of the picture.</P><P><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: </strong>Given that it will be 
difficult to take the league tables out of the public domain, is the minister 
considering a value-added approach, whereby the improvement of schools, rather 
than crude raw information, is taken into account?</P><P><strong>Nicol Stephen: 
</strong>The approach taken through the national priorities is intended to achieve 
exactly that&#151;a far more rounded picture that takes into account not only 
exam results but a range of indicators. Our approach will not try to compare one 
school in one area with a different school in </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17996">17996</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>another area in a crude league table.</P><P>The Executive has set out its plans 
for delivering excellence in education in Scotland. We are reducing class sizes 
and improving literacy and numeracy. We are determined to give parents, pupils 
and the Scottish community better information and to involve those people more 
in the education system. We want to implement our plans for excellence for Scottish 
schools, as outlined in our response to the national debate.</P><P>Our plans involve 
creating a more flexible and relevant curriculum; giving head teachers more local 
control; allowing teachers to work more flexibly across primary and secondary 
schools; reforming the assessment system; reducing and simplifying the burden 
of assessment; improving facilities and the design of school buildings; and involving 
parents more in their children's education. Those priorities reflect the broad 
range of concerns that pupils, parents and teachers throughout Scotland raised 
during the national debate. We are determined to deliver a world-class education 
for all Scotland's children.</P><P>I move amendment S1M-3879.1, to leave out from 
first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert:</P><P>&quot;welcomes the strategy for 
the future of education in Scotland published in <em>Educating for Excellence: 
Choice and Opportunity</em> with its focus on raising standards and closing the 
opportunity gap; supports the plans to reduce class sizes and the measures to 
improve literacy and numeracy and to ease transitions between key stages, and 
endorses the strategy's key objectives of an education system centred on the needs 
of each individual child with a more flexible and relevant curriculum, a streamlined 
assessment system and greater parental involvement in our schools.&quot;</P><P>09:53</P><P><strong>Mr 
Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>Unlike the SNP, I will 
not concentrate on the coalition Government's response to its great debate. Why 
should I? The document is worthy and full of good intentions and it contains much 
on which members of all parties can agree, but we all know that it is really just 
an appetiser. It tickles our taste buds, but leaves us unsatisfied.</P><P>The 
main course is still to come: we will not have it at least until the election 
campaign, or after it, if the coalition parties form the Government. The minister's 
problem is that he is scared to reveal the real agenda for change. He is scared 
that the unions, the directors of education and many members sitting behind him 
will find it unpalatable and throw it back in his face. The minister uses flowery 
language like that of fancy restaurants to disguise his true intentions. In future, 
will he intervene in failing schools or failing council education departments? 
Will he use independent school expertise? There is nothing in the document to 
reveal that, but there are suggestions </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17997">17997</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>that that is the way that the coalition Government will go if it is re-elected.</P><P>The 
minister's boss might be a vegan, but&#151;nudge nudge, wink wink, say no more&#151;the 
truth is that the document suggests that she will be eating bacon rolls and red-blooded 
steak tartare.</P><P><strong>Margaret Jamieson (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (Lab): 
</strong>On a point of order, Presiding Officer. Is it in the interests of the 
Parliament to discuss someone who is a vegan and to make such appalling comments?</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>I do not think that it is insulting to describe someone 
as a vegan if they are one.</P><P><strong>Margaret Jamieson: </strong>My point 
is about the relevancy of that issue to the debate.</P><P><strong>The Presiding 
Officer: </strong>If I were to rule on relevancy, that would be a full-time job.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Monteith: </strong>I assure members that I did not mean the word &quot;vegan&quot; 
as a term of abuse; I was simply drawing to members' attention the metaphor that 
the minister may be forced to eat something that she finds unpalatable.</P><P>To 
some extent, the document is a deceit, but it is nothing compared to the great 
deceit of the SNP's education policies. The policy of having class sizes of 18 
or fewer is well intentioned and laudable, but without the right ingredients, 
it is a recipe for disaster. The simple truth is that class sizes of 18 or fewer 
cannot be delivered without abolishing placing requests, tearing up the current 
catchment areas and, in many cases, building extra classrooms and new schools. 
As long as the SNP resists admitting the real cost to parental rights and choice, 
it will be lying to the electorate.</P><P>The SNP policy is predicated on using 
the spare capacity that some schools have and which many more might have in the 
future because of falling school rolls. However, many schools are in the wrong 
place and many are half empty because parents choose not to send their children 
to them.</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson (Banff and Buchan) (SNP) </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></P><P><strong>Mr

Monteith's argument bizarre. I find it even more bizarre, although illuminating, 
that many of the Labour members nodded in agreement with him. Many parents will 
find it simply disgraceful that members are dancing on the head of a pin to stop 
smaller class sizes.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17998">17998</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>I will move on and give a few examples so that 
Michael Russell understands why his policy is a deceit. As I said, the policy 
is predicated on falling school rolls, but some schools are simply in the wrong 
place. Some parents choose not to send their children to certain schools, which 
creates the empty classrooms that Mike Russell wishes to fill up. However, there 
is a difficulty: if we decide to send children to schools that their parents have 
not chosen, parental rights and placing requests will, in effect, be abolished. 
That would create a terrific backlash and a clamour for independent primary schools.</P><P>Parents 
guard jealously their right to placing requests and, though many politicians try 
to deny it, they often choose schools by choosing houses that are located in a 
particular catchment area. I will give a recent example with which Sylvia Jackson 
will be familiar. In Dunblane, there has been outrage from parents in the Barbush 
area, who found that the area was to be rezoned into a new catchment area, which 
would mean that new pupils would go not to Newton Primary School, but to Dunblane 
Primary School. The parents held public meetings and, with some effect, sought 
to change the situation. Families had located to Dunblane because of its schools; 
they had bought houses in the Barbush area because it fell within the catchment 
for Newton Primary School, but they were told that that was going to change.</P><P>The 
problem is that Newton Primary School is full to the gunwales and, from next year, 
class sizes will reach 30. Dunblane Primary School has just enough spare capacity 
to accommodate the city's expansion and St Mary's Episcopal Primary School is 
full. All three primary schools in Dunblane are full, with no spare classrooms 
and no budget to expand, so catchment areas are having to be redrawn. Placing 
requests for those schools from outside the catchment areas, such as from Bridge 
of Allan, will have to be refused in the future.</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson: 
</strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>No, I am 
running out of time.</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>You are already 
over time. I have given you injury time.</P><P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>To 
introduce class sizes of 18 or fewer in Dunblane will require seven more classrooms 
and seven more teachers, but there is no budget available. There is no spare capacity 
in Dunblane.</P><P>Thank you, Presiding Officer, for allowing me to extend, given 
the interventions that I took. The SNP's policy is nothing more than mutton dressed 
as lamb. It will ultimately disappoint the electorate, who would be better turning 
to the Conservative benches; we will strengthen parental rights, because, on these 
benches, we know our onions.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17999">17999</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

schools to develop areas of particular excellence and &#163;14 million has been invested 
to support that.</P><P>We have introduced new national qualifications, bringing 
together vocational and academic qualifications. We are extending opportunity. 
We are committed to allowing children with additional support needs to have access

schools now provide access to the internet. We are improving the learning environment 
through better conditions for teachers and better school buildings. More than 
4,000 classroom assistants have been employed in primary schools and by 2006 there 
will be 3,000 more teachers, ensuring a 15:1 adult to child ratio in all local 
authorities.</P><P>We have implemented the new community schools programme in 
430 schools and have committed &#163;78 million to roll out the approach to all schools 
by 2007. We are investing more than &#163;1 billion to rebuild and refurbish schools 
and have recently announced an additional &#163;110 million for improving school buildings

the role of school boards and parent-teacher associations is welcome, but there 
is a clear need for full consultation with all concerned before there is movement 
on that.</P><P>Head teachers should have more control over budgets, so that those 
closest to children can decide how best to use resources. There should be greater 
flexibility for schools and education authorities through agreements for excellence.</P><P>We

<P>Brian Edwards of Heriot-Watt University claimed that research from America 
shows that the more natural light in schools, the better pupils learn. Too many 
of our young people are being taught in poor physical conditions. It will cost 
up to &#163;2 billion to bring Scottish schools up to standard.</P><P>Unfortunately, 
the new PFI schools are generally not being built to a desirable design that will 
allow pupils to attain. As John Swinney revealed last week, the Amey group made 
profits of 31 per cent on its schools PFI projects, so &#163;13 million was stuffed 
into the pockets of Amey and its shareholders&#151;money that should have remained 
in our schools system. Audit Scotland found that PFI projects will cost taxpayers

has been a problem with reduced community access&#151;it is costing communities 
an extortionate amount to hire the facilities within schools. Even though public 
money has already bought those facilities, youngsters who play for football teams 
are being forced to go elsewhere.</P><P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>Will the 
member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Tricia Marwick: </strong>No. I am running 
out of time.</P><P>For the past six years, the Labour Government has fixed it 
to ensure that PFI projects are the preferred option. Indeed, they are the only 
game in town. The National Audit Office referred to the so-called public sector 
comparator as &quot;pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo&quot;.</P><P>That is the result 
of a dogma that permeates all the thinking on the provision of new facilities. 
The Treasury's drive to get capital projects off the balance sheet has ensured 
that PFI projects cost more, that profits are squirreled out of the public sector 
and that the facilities that have been provided are not as good as those that 
could have been provided if students, teachers and the wider community had had 
some influence on the design process.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18003">18003</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I understand that the Liberal Democrats now favour public sector trusts. I 
look forward to hearing the Liberal Democrat Deputy Minister for Education and

him to do so.</P><P>The SNP will ensure that our young people have decent facilities

</strong>When I reflect on the education of SNP members, I note that Mike Russell 
must have done particularly well in his creative writing class and that Tricia 
Marwick must have sailed through her geography class. The observation that Falkirk 
is not in Glasgow is most illuminating. It might surprise Tricia Marwick to learn 
that Scotland is still in Britain.</P><P><strong>Tricia Marwick: </strong>Will 
the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>No&#151;I 
am still in my first minute.</P><P>Although everyone knows that education and 
opportunity are closely linked, the link between ambition and opportunity is talked 
about less often. Opportunity needs to be courted. Opportunities do not just appear 
with the milk on the doorstep; they need to be seized. I want the children of 
Scotland to be educated, to be ambitious and to seize opportunities. I want them 
to be educated with a can-do attitude. To encourage such an attitude, it is essential 
to recognise the child as an individual, to address life skills as well as maths 
and English and to build confidence as well as qualifications.</P><P>The Scottish 
Executive has invested money in education in the traditional sense, through the 
provision of bricks and mortar, school books, equipment and teachers. Unlike the

child's needs. Following that route has meant that children in Dumbarton constituency 
have access to health development officers, to family and pupil support&#151;to 
address barriers to achievement at school&#151;and to groundbreaking educational 
information technology systems. Subsequent evaluations have shown that those investments 
have paid dividends, particularly in improved literacy, numeracy and good behaviour.</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell: </strong>Will the member give way on that specific point?</P><P><strong>Jackie 
Baillie: </strong>No. Unlike SNP members, education has come a long way in the 
past four years. However, I am always the first to agree that more can be done. 
The national debate revealed the need to make progress in some areas. I am pleased 
that the minister is addressing those issues.</P><P>The sheer scope of the five-to-14 
curriculum is one of the most important issues, as teachers in my constituency&#151;most 
recently, staff at John Logie Baird Primary School&#151;have pointed out. In trying 
to cover so many areas, teachers cannot give sufficient attention to core areas. 
A slimming down of the curriculum would lead to the devotion of more class time 
to core skills and would ensure that everyone attained a level of foundation learning.</P><P>I 
must take issue with the SNP on the important issue of class sizes. Yet again, 
the SNP conveniently fails to acknowledge what is being done. The Executive has 
already set targets for primary and key secondary school years. Let us step back 
to analyse the logic of the SNP's call for smaller classes across the board. How 
would such a change be paid for? Smaller classes ultimately mean more classrooms 
and a complete overhaul of the school infrastructure. Although the Executive is 
committed to improving the school estate and has secured &#163;1 billion to do so, 
that would not be enough to fund the SNP proposals.</P><P>Like most critics, the 
SNP thinks that it knows the way, but it cannot drive the car. The SNP has no 
idea how it would deliver any of its proposals. Surely it is much more sensible 
to increase the teacher to pupil ratio. That is quicker and much more effective 
than counting the number of classrooms. After all, it is attainment that matters. 
We know that improving the adult to pupil ratio gives a significant boost to pupil 
learning.</P><P>Anyone who removes the blindfold of bias&#151;I urge Mike Russell 
and Tricia Marwick to do so&#151;must admit that great steps have been taken. 
Ninety-seven per cent of secondary schools have access to the internet. Extra 
educational resources are being targeted at those in most need. For the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18005">18005</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>first time, more than half our young people are going on to university and 
further education colleges. Those are the foundations for a strong society and 
a strong economy.</P><P>10:16</P><P><strong>Colin Campbell (West of Scotland) 
(SNP): </strong>I recently asked an experienced teacher what single thing he would 
prioritise to improve schools. He said that he would prioritise getting the bad 
kids out so that the good kids could be educated. He went on to tell me stories 
that I will not relate.</P><P>However, I will give members a couple of my stories. 
Discipline has deteriorated since I left teaching. With the minimum amount of 
force, I have gently neck locked a pupil of my size who continued&#151;in spite 
of my order to stop&#151;to kick another pupil repeatedly. My actions were aimed 
at safeguarding the victim, who was lying on the dining hall floor. The victim 
had hurled school custard at the assailant, although most of it had ended up on 
my suit. In a disciplinary situation, four adults, each holding a limb, have brought 
into my office a writhing and screaming child who was parallel to the ground. 
Things have not got better.</P><P>A better teacher to pupil ratio&#151;</P><P><strong>Johann 
Lamont: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Colin Campbell: 
</strong>No, because I know exactly what I will get. I have only four minutes, 
which will probably be my last four minutes on education.</P><P>A better teacher 
to pupil ratio in the early years of school is essential, because that is when 
the fundamental attitudes to the system and to the way in which it works are established. 
International evidence backs that up. Better liaison with social work and support 
services is needed. Teachers should be given systematic training in conflict avoidance 
and resolution and in how to keep themselves and their charges physically safe. 
I ask the minister to take that point on board.</P><P>On exclusions, there is 
a predictable tension between teachers and head teachers. I understand that my 
exclusion rate was average. The price for that was that some teachers thought 
that I was far too soft. Schools do not need targets for the reduction of exclusions. 
To demand percentage decreases in exclusions is to increase classroom and inter-staff 
tension and to demoralise teachers and head teachers. I ask the minister to take 
that on board, too.</P><P>Head teachers manage their institutions. Following a 
surgery with ex-head teachers who felt that they had been treated unjustly, I 
wrote to <em>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland</em>. My letter, which 
was published in the edition of 13 September 2002, invited any head who</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18006">18006</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>&quot;feels that he or she has been hounded from their post by the actions 
of staff who have adopted a culture of grievance and orchestrated a campaign against 
the management of the school&quot;</P><P>to contact me in confidence. A number 
of head teachers did so.</P><P>Let me give a composite of their replies. Imagine 
a head who arrives in a school in which an influential body of staff is set in 
its ways. The staff are resentful of the head, perhaps seeing themselves as the 
guardians of the school's traditions. They may have extensive networks through 
parents associations or social circles, but they are clever enough not to get 
themselves disciplined. Alternatively, imagine even a well-established head of 
some years' standing, who is obliged to implement new policies with a staff whom 
he or she had hitherto been able to woo and persuade.</P><P>Indifference to the 
head's desired new policies changes to open hostility. Grievances are lodged. 
A succession of grievances may even be planned. The unions are brought in. To 
whom does the head then turn for support? The head's union may not have the wealth 
to fight his or her legal case&#151;that is something that those who are thinking 
about becoming head teachers should investigate&#151;or, if the staff and the 
head are in the same union, the union may side with the staff against the head. 
The union may even coach staff in the tactics necessary to beat the head. To whom 
then does the head turn?</P><P>Does the head turn to his or her employers? Good 
employers will give advice and support and even offer arbitration to solve the 
problem and make progress, but others may make the calculation that it is easier 
to move one member of staff than to move several and so side with the majority. 
The head must then go, even if he or she is innocent of any major wrongdoing. 
I have evidence that that has happened. I ask the minister to take that on board. 
I would love to say to the minister, &quot;Come to my office and we will discuss 
it.&quot; However, I recognise that it is I who may need to invite myself to the 
minister's office.</P><P>10:21</P><P><strong>Ian Jenkins (Tweeddale, Ettrick and 
Lauderdale) (LD): </strong>At the centre of today's debate is our consideration 
of the Executive's response to the national debate on education, which the Executive 
published under the title &quot;Education for Excellence: Choice and Opportunity&quot;. 
The document must be popular&#151;I was unable to obtain a copy from the Scottish 
Parliament information centre yesterday, so it must be going down well with the 
public somewhere.</P><P>When the minister introduced the document, I </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18007">18007</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>welcomed it as a first step in taking up the ideas and recommendations that 
flowed from that extensive debate. I acknowledge that the proposals in the document 
are not revolutionary, but they promise solid progress across a wide range of 
aspects of the education system. If we can make solid progress in all those aspects, 
the educational experience that we offer our children will benefit from a substantial 
improvement, building on the sound basis that exists within our schools today. 
We need to build on the pre-school provision and the early-start mechanisms that 
are currently in place.</P><P>I was pleased that the responses to the debate endorsed 
the comprehensive system, but I am not complacent. I am anxious to see a system 
that is not monolithic but embodies flexibility and offers opportunities for innovation 
and fresh approaches at all levels. The document's proposals offer to increase 
pupil choice by reviewing the school curriculum and by streamlining and simplifying 
assessment. It proposes to bring forward a reduction in class sizes and to tackle 
discipline problems. Indeed, I endorse many of Colin Campbell's recommendations 
about the need to improve things such as initial teacher education.</P><P>The 
document also makes proposals about improving school buildings, giving more control 
over budgets to head teachers and improving transitional arrangements between 
primary and secondary schools. There will be more professional co-operation than 
has previously been the case and parents will be involved more fully. The inspection 
regime for schools is to be changed, so that it is more closely focused on schools 
in which there are problems. All those measures are important; cumulatively, they 
will offer a substantial model for progress.</P><P>Let me say a little about class 
sizes, assessment and the promised review of the school curriculum. As a former 
teacher, I well know how important class sizes are to our ability to deliver the 
best in education. I believe that a reduction in class sizes is important and 
that it should be built into how we think and plan about the future. However, 
the SNP promise to reduce class sizes to 18 seems to me to be wildly optimistic. 
As others have pointed out, the SNP policy takes no account of the cost of extra 
school buildings.</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Will the member give 
way?</P><P><strong>Ian Jenkins: </strong>No, hang on.</P><P>Just the other day, 
I spoke to a teacher who compiled a wee Latin motto that describes the SNP policy:</P><P>&quot;Crustum

<P>I am pleased that the Executive is committed to reductions in class sizes, 
but I would welcome a longer-term commitment to planned and achievable reductions 
within a time scale over the next few years.</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>The 
member has received no such commitment, even from his own minister.</P><P><strong>Ian 
Jenkins: </strong>But I would welcome it.</P><P>The commitment to simplify assessment 
is vital. We must always consider what assessments are for and whether they are 
reliable, necessary and practicable. We must also be careful about the use that 
is made of the results. I am pleased that the exam results league tables are being 
discredited as the sole benchmark of quality. I endorse every measure that can 
be taken to reduce the power of the league tables in that regard.</P><P>The national 
tests for reading and writing that were in operation when I left teaching involved 
a whole battery of tests that had to be applied to individual pupils or to groups 
of pupils when the teacher thought that the pupils were ready. Not only were the 
tests difficult to manage and inconvenient to administer, but they simply confirmed 
what the teacher already knew. They were part of a silly and elaborate bureaucratic 
system. We need to have a rational look at how we obtain information about standards 
without such elaborate arrangements. In all those ways, it is vital to reduce 
the burden of assessment on teachers and pupils.</P><P>Like the Executive's document, 
the SNP motion talks about reviewing the curriculum and focusing on core skills. 
I support such a review. I welcome the focus on literacy and numeracy, but I am 
anxious that the core curriculum should not be confined only to numeracy and literacy. 
It must embrace the wider purposes of education and involve the development of 
the whole pupil as an individual and as a member of the community. We must be 
prepared to make informed and sometimes difficult choices about the shape of the 
curriculum and what may have to be dropped from it. I hope that the Education, 
Culture and Sport Committee's document on the purposes of education will assist 
that process.</P><P>I believe that we now have the basis for real progress. I 
urge ministers to ensure that the mechanisms are in place to take the proposals 
off the paper and put them into action in the classrooms. That should be done 
in partnership with teachers, parents and pupils.</P><P>10:26</P><P><strong>Mary

to parents. I will make two points today, both of which arise from </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18009">18009</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>representations that parents in the Highlands have made to me.</P><P>My first 
point has been made in particular by school board chairmen in the Highlands. Although 
the McCrone report was widely welcomed, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities 
estimated that there would be a shortfall in funding of &#163;150 million. At the time, 
many of us thought that COSLA might be exaggerating. However, now that McCrone 
is being implemented, the actual shortfall is &#163;147 million. For Highland Council, 
the underfunding for McCrone implementation is &#163;6.6 million, which means that 
the council can implement the pay settlement but little else. Classroom assistants 
and continual professional development are now dreams, aspirations or targets&#151;to 
use the Executive spin.</P><P>Given that the McCrone funding formula was based 
on pupil numbers, it is hardly surprising that there should be a shortfall in 
an area that has so many small schools. The result is that teachers in urban areas 
will receive all the support and classroom help that was outlined in McCrone, 
whereas rural teachers will receive only minimal support. If the minister were 
job hunting after graduating from teacher training college, where would he choose 
to go? The Highlands already faces a crisis in recruiting general practitioners 
and dentists, but the Executive is now creating similar problems in respect of 
teachers. We will have a two-tier system in Scotland.</P><P>How can schools and 
education authorities be given a legal obligation to pursue continuous improvement 
when they have no funding to implement it and no staff to cover the resulting 
teacher absences? Highland Council's education convener said only this week:</P><P>&quot;This 
financial year will not be good for education, culture and sport. &#163;3.58 million 
was removed in 2002/03 from our service to help balance the council's budget which 
was not replaced.</P><P>That meant a 10% cut in the money schools get per pupil 
... and a freeze on recruiting visiting teachers.&quot;</P><P>Highland teachers 
also have to deal with the fact that their levels of administrative and support 
staff are among the three lowest in Scotland.</P><P>The second point that I want 
to make relates to what was said by Colin Campbell, who made his points extremely 
well. However, my concern is not only with class sizes. A problem that is constantly 
brought to the surface is discipline and bullying in schools. That could be tackled 
by joined-up government. It takes far too long to identify vulnerable children 
and bullying, too long to diagnose and assess education needs and an impossible 
time to get the necessary psychological support. Young offenders are simply becoming 
old offenders because there is no help or support for </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18010">18010</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>them, so they carry on offending. If addressing offending behaviour were a 
higher priority than the publication of glossy brochures, that would be of great 
benefit.</P><P>There is a critical lack of residential care for children with 
psychiatric problems. Without facilities and support near home, young people's 
problems become more acute. Those with drug and alcohol problems cannot be treated 
in adult facilities until they are 16&#151;that wait is just too long for many. 
In Inverness, fast-track referrals to the department of health and child psychiatry 
take more than six months and normal referrals take 18 months.</P><P>I have raised 
those points because of the effect that disruptive children can have on other 
children and because of the demands that they can make on teachers.</P><P>10:31</P><P><strong>Fiona 
McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I was going to begin my speech by declaring 
my registered interest as a member of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information 
Professionals. However, having heard the earlier speeches, I will concentrate 
my remarks on school buildings. As we have heard, evidence shows that a pleasant 
and healthy environment leads to healthy education and good educational attainment.</P><P>My 
colleague Tricia Marwick has already quoted from the Audit Scotland report that 
told us that under the public-private partnership regime to which this Government 
seems to be wedded, we are already paying 3 per cent more in additional interest 
payments on the schools that we are procuring under PPP. Only last week, we heard 
that Amey&#151;the company that used a PPP to build our schools in Glasgow and 
Edinburgh&#151;made a 31 per cent profit on that contract.</P><P><strong>Brian 
Fitzpatrick (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Lab): </strong>Against that background, 
can we take it that the member will not be urging favourable treatment for the 
outline business case that was made by East Dunbartonshire Council for funding 
from the Scottish Executive? Is she content that schools in East Dunbartonshire 
should wait until funding can be secured from public revenue?</P><P><strong>Fiona 
McLeod: </strong>I was anticipating that intervention from Mr Fitzpatrick. I remind 
him of the meeting that we both attended last week with Cathy Jamieson. At that 
meeting, the parents of pupils who attend Kirkintilloch High School showed their 
hostility towards the use of private finance initiative contracts in building 
public schools in East Dunbartonshire. At that meeting, Cathy Jamieson said that 
it was her responsibility to &quot;spend the money wisely&quot;. Given the information 
we have had from Audit Scotland and </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18011">18011</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the gross profits that Amey has made from the Glasgow schools, how many more 
schools could we have built from that profit and the interest on that money? Is 
that a wise use of public money? How many more teachers could we have got and 
how much smaller could class sizes have become using those grossly inflated profits? 
Is that responsible use of public money?</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>I 
want to add to the very impressive case that my colleague is making by giving 
one piece of information that I learned on Monday. Dumfries and Galloway Council 
asked whether it could use a not-for-profit scheme, but that was refused by the 
Scottish Executive. Despite the Executive's announcements on the issues, it is 
determined to keep putting 31 per cent profit into private companies.</P><P><strong>Fiona 
McLeod: </strong>Mike Russell's comments lead me on to say that a procurement 
process for public buildings should be open, consultative and participative. As 
Mr Fitzpatrick and I know, those processes should not be shrouded in commercial 
confidentiality&#151;or secrecy&#151;as was the outline business case to which 
Mr Fitzpatrick referred. I wonder how the member can support an outline business 
case for a joint venture from East Dunbartonshire Council, when the council refuses 
to discuss it in public with members of the public or with parents.</P><P><strong>Brian 
Fitzpatrick: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr Murray Tosh): </strong>The member is in her last 
minute.</P><P><strong>Fiona McLeod:</strong> The other day, I was at another meeting 
with Brian Fitzpatrick, but because of the commercial confidentiality and secrecy 
surrounding the issue, a local school where the building is crumbling around the 
pupils has been offered &quot;tarting up&quot; and maybe&#151;if members will 
excuse my cod Latin&#151;fructus hodie, or jam tomorrow.</P><P>Not-for-profit 
trusts would ensure that the public, parents and pupils were involved producing 
schools, rather than having foisted on them schools that are not fit for purpose&#151;schools 
whose only purpose is to provide profits for private companies.</P><P>10:35</P><P><strong>Donald 
Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>By and large, our education system is 
reasonably successful in getting pupils to learn more, understand more, acquire 
facts and learn skills. However, we are less good at making pupils into better 
people and citizens. The problems are very difficult to solve. First, people tend 
to fulfil the expectations that others have of them, and to </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18012">18012</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>respond to peer pressure. In some communities, peer pressure pushes people 
in the wrong direction&#151;it is assumed that people will fail, get into trouble 
and not have a job. We have to address that.</P><P>Secondly, a minority of pupils 
have parents who are apathetic about or positively hostile towards education, 
and who are often extremely hostile to teachers. We have to sort that out. The 
suggestions in the Executive's worthy document about improving parent-teacher 
associations are not relevant because such parents do not come to PTA meetings. 
We have to get through to them somehow.</P><P>Thirdly, a lot of learning is done 
outwith school, or at school but outwith the mainstream, but there is little mention 
of that in the Executive's document. I am sure that I am not alone in that my 
abiding memories are of the things that influenced me most being, for example, 
performing in concerts, playing in school teams, acting in plays, being involved 
in clubs during the holidays, and going to scout and cadet camps which, with all 
their failures, have still done some good work.</P><P>We must put much more effort 
into recreational and informal education activities. That would not require a 
huge sum from the education budget; however, a little more effort would have a 
significant effect on pupils. Those who are switched off by school can often be 
switched on again by a charismatic club leader, for example. Most people are interested 
in something and if we can get young people interested, that would do a huge amount 
of good.</P><P>I have experienced the good effect that Outward Bound Trust-type 
activities have on some people. Such activities are not everyone's cup of tea, 
but they do some people a lot of good. I plead that, in addition to the good things 
that are mentioned in &quot;Educating for Excellence&quot;, we should pay more 
attention to education outwith school and try to create a better society.</P><P>Possibly 
the greatest contribution that politicians could make to improving education is 
to start saying what we mean and meaning what we say. I know that most members 
are well intentioned and honourable, but the public sees us as a shower of dishonest 
people and we must correct that. If the leaders of the country are seen to be 
unreliable and dishonest, young people will follow that course. We have to persuade 
them that society can work better if they become better and do a better job than 
we have ever done.</P><P>10:38</P><P><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab): 
</strong>There has been a lot of talk today about the gap between rhetoric and 
reality, but I suppose the SNP has </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18013">18013</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>become expert on that in the past few years. &quot;Free by '93&quot; represents 
one of the gaps between rhetoric and reality that we can all enjoy.</P><P>The 
gap between rhetoric and reality is well illustrated by what the SNP says, which 
is that the only thing that matters is class sizes. However, parents actively 
send their children to schools that have larger class sizes because, in reality, 
there is more to school than the number of pupils in the class, although class 
size is important and we need to make progress. Some of the worst discipline problems 
come from schools that have small classes.</P><P>The SNP wants to improve the 
support that is available to pupils, but dismisses classroom assistants as nose 
wipers and pencil sharpeners-exactly the kind of educational snobbery that has 
put us in the current situation. The reality in every school that I have visited 
is that every person and every teacher welcomes classroom assistants as being 
valuable and meaningfully supportive of pupils' learning.</P><P>I arrived in the 
middle of Donald Gorrie's speech, in which he spoke about a wide range of issues. 
One thing that has struck me in some schools that I have visited in Clydesdale 
is how the whole school team, from the janitor to the lady who provides the school 
dinners, is part of the learning environment for every child. Whoever they are, 
they can be a learning model for every pupil. We cannot take away from the valuable 
role that every member of a school's staff plays.</P><P>There has been rhetoric 
about improving school buildings, but the reality is that the SNP has opposed 
every case where it has happened, it. My colleague Johann Lamont talked about 
Rosshall Academy, St Paul's High School and Lourdes Secondary School. Those examples 
were dismissed by Tricia Marwick as being irrelevant to the debate, yet there 
have been real improvements to the learning environments of some of our most disadvantaged 
children in Scotland, who are learning in places that are fit for learning. The 
reality is that when the new Larkhall Academy is built, Biggar High School is 
refurbished, Carluke High School is refurbished and Lanark Grammar School is refurbished, 
the SNP will oppose those improvements.</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Will 
the member give way?</P><P><strong>Karen Gillon: </strong>No, Michael Russell 
has had his turn. Sit down.</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Karen Gillon 
said something that is not true.</P><P><strong>Karen Gillon: </strong>Oh&#151;the

about that change of heart.</P><P>The difference between the rhetoric and the

<P>reality is only too real. Mike Russell likes to quote the Bible and the reason 
why I laugh is that he has done it once too often. The reality is that here in 
Scotland people see the truth and look for the truth; they know the difference 
between rhetoric and reality. People in Scotland know that although classes of 
18 might sound good, the reality is that they are unachievable. On 1 May they 
will dismiss the rhetoric of the SNP and support the reality of the Labour party.</P><P>10:42</P><P><strong>Mr 
Monteith: </strong>I enjoyed Karen Gillon's wind-up speech for Labour. There is 
much in &quot;Educating for Excellence: Choice and Opportunity&quot;, and much 
in what Labour has said over the past five or six years, that represents a sea 
change for that party. There is much that is highly progressive and that deserves 
support from the Conservatives. I trace that back to when Helen Liddell became 
the shadow spokesman on education. I wonder whether much of the change is the 
result of Karen Gillon's input at that time. Although we will not support the 
Labour amendment, there is much good in it, and if it becomes the substantive 
motion it will enjoy our support.</P><P>I wish that there were an education debate 
almost every week. It would be a terrific opportunity for all of us to give examples 
to Michael Russell of the problems that the SNP policy faces. Every week I could 
mention yet another school&#151;yet another Newton Primary School&#151;that exemplifies 
the inability to deliver class sizes of 18 or fewer. [<em>Interruption.</em>] 
Michael Russell laughs as if reality has not dawned on him, so maybe I should 
give another example to address the obvious lack of knowledge on the SNP benches.</P><P>Take 
the Royal High Primary School, which my sons recently attended. It has three forms&#151;P1, 
P2 and P3&#151;with 30 pupils in each class, and two classes in each form, which 
equals 60 pupils in each year. Of course, 18 does not fit nicely into 60, so that 
school would have to have 54 pupils in each form. The catchment area would have 
to be reduced to take account of the falling numbers, because we could have only 
three classes of 18&#151;</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Will the member 
give way?</P><P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>I must carry on with this example. 
The three forms would need to be reduced and we would need to reduce the catchment 
area to take account of the fact that there could be only 54 pupils in each year. 
If we had 54 pupils, we would need another classroom for each year: even if the 
catchment area were reduced, we would still need another classroom for each year.</P><P><strong>Dr 
Sylvia Jackson: </strong>Does Brian Monteith agree that that policy might result 
in composite classes? </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18015">18015</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I do not know the SNP's line on that.</P><P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>Composite 
classes might be a way round the problem. I would be interested to hear Michael 
Russell's point of view on that.</P><P><strong>Michael Russell </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></P><P><strong>Mr 
Monteith: </strong>Mike Russell can answer in his own speech&#151;I have less 
than two minutes left.</P><P>The point is clear: a school like the Royal High 
Primary School would need three new classrooms and three new teachers and would 
still need to reduce its catchment area. That school already has placing requests, 
but those would have to be removed. That would not happen only at the Royal High 
Primary School, but at the neighbouring Parsons Green Primary School and the neighbouring 
Duddingston Primary School, because in Edinburgh many schools are full to the 
gunwales.</P><P>Of course, the situation does not apply only to Edinburgh. I quote 
from a letter from the service manager in charge of education of Perth and Kinross 
Council, which states:</P><P>&quot;In terms of accommodation we currently have 
classrooms for each class but we have no spare capacity, particularly in Perth 
City. We do not anticipate that the anticipated reduction in primary pupils nationally 
will alter that situation in the next few years as this area continues to benefit 
from a growing population. Obviously any proposal to dramatically reduce class 
sizes would have serious implications for our accommodation stock&#151;quite apart 
from the requirement for additional teaching staff.&quot;</P><P>There we have 
it; that man is not a Tory, but an official and he is saying that it would be 
quite difficult, if not impossible, for Perth and Kinross to deliver smaller classes 
of 18. The truth is that classes of 18 cannot be achieved without additional massive 
expenditure and, even then, without effectively removing parental choice by removing 
placing requests. I put it to the Parliament that that policy would be unworkable 
and undeliverable, and as such it is a deceit. It is a policy that should be removed.</P><P>10:47</P><P><strong>Nicol 
Stephen: </strong>I commented earlier on Mike Russell's speech, and I will return 
to it in a moment, but first I will comment on Brian Monteith's opening remarks, 
rather than on the speech that he just gave.</P><P>I had a vision of Brian Monteith 
late at night scripting his words for this morning, desperate for good rhetoric 
and good analogies, and all that came into his mind&#151;in fact, everything that 
came into his mind&#151;was food. Brian Monteith is not restrictive in relation 
to his food; he knows no boundaries. He did not stick with vegan food; there were 
bacon rolls, there were onions and there were restaurant meals&#151;the lot. Some 
of what he </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18016">18016</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>said, however, was sensible. It is important that we record that fact because 
it is, as we know, a rare occurrence and another such occurrence might not take 
place in the lifetime of this Parliament.</P><P>It was important that Brian Monteith 
focused on some of the shortcomings of the SNP policies. He focused on areas on 
which I would not have chosen to focus; for example, the impact of class sizes 
on placing requests. In his closing remarks he focused on the impact on catchment 
areas. Mike Russell is itching to respond to those points. Brian Monteith probed 
the SNP policy in a way that the SNP is not used to and is clearly not comfortable 
with&#151;</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Will the minister give way?</P><P><strong>Nicol 
Stephen: </strong>Before I let Mr Russell in&#151;as I will&#151;I will focus 
on the key issue in relation to the SNP's class-size commitment. It does not relate 
to placing requests or catchment areas; it relates simply to the cost and the 
consequences of having to provide the additional classrooms that Mr Monteith spoke 
about. It is not a fair policy. It would not mean just one or two extra classrooms 
for P1; it would mean one or two extra classrooms for each of P1, P2 and P3, which 
would quickly add up to five, six or seven extra classrooms. Those extra classrooms 
would be required in many primary schools throughout Scotland. At the moment, 
that is completely uncosted, but such an uncosted upheaval must be clarified. 
We have to test the SNP on whether the policy has been properly thought out.</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell: </strong>It is rich for the minister to talk about costing when he would 
not give me an answer about the costing of his class-size proposals. The proposals 
are in our policy and have been debated in Parliament and I would be happy to 
give him chapter and verse. The Executive could set a target in its school estate 
review, but it refuses to do so.</P><P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>What is 
the figure?</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Can I ask the minister one 
question?</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Very quickly.</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell: </strong>Why is it that although a class-size reduction programme has 
been put in place in Tennessee, California, Arkansas and most American states, 
such a programme is&#151;according to some members&#151;unachievable or impossible, 
which is nonsense? The Executive shows poverty of ambition.</P><P><strong>Nicol 
Stephen: </strong>Although&#151;from a sedentary position&#151;I encouraged Michael 
Russell to give us the figure, members will note that he failed to do so, because 
his proposals are uncosted. [<em>Interruption.</em>] Mr Russell protests too much,

<P>know that we have struck a raw nerve.</P><P>What is important in Scottish education 
is that we move forwards sensibly, together and in partnership&#151;Ian Jenkins 
referred to that&#151;with proposals that can be delivered and that will allow 
us to see progress on class sizes, and on the introduction of additional teachers 
and additional classroom assistants. That is the approach that the Executive has 
taken in the past four years. We have worked with teacher organisations, local 
authorities, schools, teachers, parents and pupils. I hope that we can build on 
that consensus and partnership approach in the next four years.</P><P>As Ian Jenkins 
said, what we propose is more about evolution than revolution. We should not be 
dogmatic about education. We experienced the politically driven agenda for too 
long during the Conservative years. We want rounded individuals. In &quot;Educating 
for Excellence&quot;, we take a rounded approach to education that does not concentrate 
only on exam results and attainment, but deals with issues such as citizenship 
and enterprise. Those matters are important.</P><P>&quot;Educating for Excellence&quot; 
is substantial and I wanted, in my summing-up speech, to review its substance, 
but time prevents me from doing that. I thank members for an interesting debate.</P><P>10:52</P><P><strong>Irene 
McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>On Saturday, <em>The Herald</em> 
contained an interesting article that reported on a study that was funded by the 
Economic and Social Research Council, which showed that people in Scotland, Wales 
and Northern Ireland are broadly disappointed with the impact of devolution. However, 
that emphatically does not mean that they want to lose their legislatures, because 
that disillusion resulted in a demand for more, not fewer, powers. Of the Scots 
who were surveyed, 70 per cent wanted the Scottish Parliament to become more important 
than the Westminster Parliament. That is interesting in itself, but I highlight 
from the same study the finding that only 27 per cent of those who were surveyed 
thought that the Scottish Parliament was increasing educational standards. That 
comment does not originate from the SNP; it is what a random selection of voters 
in Scotland think and it sets the context for the debate.</P><P>The national debate 
consultation exercise allowed many concerns to be expressed. Relentless target 
setting, over-assessment, league tables, the examination system and the unnecessary 
bureaucracy that stifles learning were criticised. <A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_22"></A>However, 
the Executive's response does nothing to address those criticisms and I have heard 
nothing today to change my mind about that. The response refers merely to </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18018">18018</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>current policy initiatives. The document is weak on substance and it is selective 
about the topics for action.</P><P>What the document calls a &quot;radical&quot; 
step&#151;a reduction in the exam burden&#151;is merely an announcement of a future 
review of the system. The response offers no solution to the excess targets issue. 
Despite concerns about a massive rise in school violence&#151;the number of recorded 
incidents has risen by 700 per cent since 1999&#151;the Executive will simply 
continue with existing policies and take &quot;further action where necessary&quot;. 
What action, and when will it become necessary?</P><P>In the past four years, 
we have heard Labour make numerous vague promises on education, but the document 
is its vaguest and poorest response yet. It contains nothing that will convince 
people that it is little more than a public relations exercise at taxpayers' expense.</P><P>The 
minister and the Executive have claimed&#151;it has been much mentioned today&#151;that 
the starting point is to improve literacy and numeracy, but the document says 
that the Executive will continue to implement current strategies.<A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_24"></A></P><P>Those 
current strategies have led to half of the children in S2 failing to achieve minimum 
levels of attainment in reading, writing and mathematics. That applies in West 
Dunbartonshire, so although I know that Jackie Baillie is very concerned about 
attainment, it is difficult to understand how she can justify the Executive's 
policies, given the statements that I have just made.</P><P><strong>Johann Lamont

Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Order.</P><P><strong>Irene McGugan: </strong>One 
of the Executive's social justice milestones was an increase in attainment levels 
in basic core skills, but statistics reveal that more and more pupils are not 
meeting the minimum levels as they progress through school.</P><P><strong>Johann 
Lamont: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Irene McGugan: </strong>No,

decline in modern language learning, although such learning is one of the greatest 
tools for improving literacy. The number of entrants to French exams has decreased 
by 50 per cent in 20 years and the figure is now 11 per cent lower than it was 
when Labour took power.</P><P>A reduction in class sizes would improve literacy 
and numeracy skills and it would allow those skills to be properly developed with 
a new emphasis on core skills. The SNP's number 1 pledge in education is to reduce 
class sizes in primaries 1, 2 and 3 to the internationally recognised optimum

<P>18. The Executive boasts that it has reduced class sizes in primaries 1 to 
3 to 30 or fewer, but that is a small drop.<A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_26"></A> It was 
achieved late and aided by a fall of more than 10,000 in pupil numbers, and it 
makes little difference to attainment.</P><P>&quot;It is often claimed that research 
results on class sizes are ambiguous. This is not true: small reductions have 
no measurable effect, but large reductions do. Reducing class sizes in primaries 
one to three to under 20 would increase attainment, strengthen pupils' self esteem 
and improve the quality of teachers' interactions with pupils.&quot;</P><P>If 
members have difficulty with that, they should take issue with Lindsay Paterson, 
who is the professor of educational policy at the University of Edinburgh, who 
wrote that in the <em>Scottish Educational Journal</em> in October last year. 
<A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_28"></A>If there were smaller class sizes, teachers would 
have more time to teach according to pupils' needs and discipline would improve. 
Smaller classes would also meet the requests from many pupils for more of teachers' 
attention.</P><P>The consensus for change is almost universal among parents and 
teachers. At the beginning of the year, the Educational Institute of Scotland&#151;the 
largest teaching union in Scotland&#151;launched its campaign to reduce class 
sizes significantly. It has recognised&#151;as all international experience shows&#151;that 
such a reduction would be the most important improvement and investment that the 
Government could make in education. However, in the past four years, the Government 
has made no significant progress. The Executive's complacent attitude and its 
lack of ambition for our schools and children have meant that Scotland has slipped 
down the international class-size league tables to sit below Poland and many other 
European countries.</P><P>We have said that it would cost an additional &#163;105 million 
a year over several years to build up the number of extra teachers that would 
be needed for class-size cuts in the early years. We have costed the expansion

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Economic Growth</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding 
Officer (Mr Murray Tosh): </STRONG>The next item of business is a debate on motion 
S1M-3880, in the name of Andrew Wilson, on Scottish economic growth.</P><P>10:59</P><P><strong>Andrew 
Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>After reading the weekend's press, all 
of us could be forgiven for thinking that we would see Angus MacKay, Tom McCabe 
and Wendy Alexander on the front bench today for this debate on the economy. Unfortunately, 
that was not to be&#151;with all good grace to Lewis Macdonald&#151;as those members 
are nowhere to be seen. Were those press reports a chimera? Was the briefing a 
briefing too far from Jack McConnell? Is Labour still as split as we all thought 
that it has been for so long?</P><P>Despite opening on a bum note, I want to broker 
some agreement in the debate as well as make some challenges about the economy. 
At the core of what I will say is a fundamental desire for a shift in the conduct 
of the political debate in Scotland. I will contend that all the political parties 
have been guilty since devolution of failing to place the economy centre stage.</P><P>All 
the parties, bar none, have been guilty of focusing to an extent on the symptoms 
of economic underperformance rather than acting on its root cause. I want that 
to change. The SNP has worked hard to change that attitude internally and within 
the wider political, economic and media agenda in Scotland. Throughout, we have 
been honest in accepting where we need to change our conduct and we hope that 
that approach has helped to open some minds in other parties and in the wider 
public. It is an approach that we mean to continue.</P><P>The SNP motion is an 
attempt to secure consensus in the Parliament. I guess that it was too much to 
hope that all sides would support the motion so close to an election. The motion 
is simple: it says that we have a problem. After four years of complacency, I 
am glad that the Government now accepts that. That said, the Government still 
has a tendency for self-congratulation and complacency at times.</P><P>Everyone 
agrees that the problem is getting worse. All of us who lead in whatever field 
we work in have a national duty to find unity of purpose in our dealings with 
the issue. We have to do so for the sake of the future of our country. We recognise 
that good people can disagree on how to tackle the problem, but we call for no 
more than open minds on the issue of the policy powers that we need to tackle 
the problem. We want and need </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18021">18021</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>to work with other parties on the issue.</P><P>All that I am asking for from 
my political opponents this morning is active thinking on some of the points that 
I am seeking to make. There is nothing sacred in the reserved powers that are 
codified in the Scotland Act 1998. All that that act did was to codify the existing 
powers of administrative devolution. In a host of areas, political devolution 
has made the financial centralism that is inherent in all of it unsustainable. 
Nowhere is the imperative for reform seen more starkly than in the need for reform 
of the economy.</P><P>There is a need for much greater competitiveness in Scotland 
and in the regions of the United Kingdom. I am asking today for some reasoned 
arguments and open minds. I am also asking for any criticisms of our case to be 
based on what we say rather than on demeaning and fatuous misrepresentations, 
which have been all too common to date.</P><P><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) 
(Con): </strong>Andrew Wilson talks of competitiveness. What will the imminent 
increase in national insurance contributions do for competitiveness in Scotland 
and in the wider UK?</P><P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>We can have arguments 
about the overall levels of taxation, but the key point that I want to make this 
morning to Phil Gallie and other members is that we need to keep a close eye on 
our relative competitiveness within the United Kingdom, as well as on the overall 
competitiveness of the UK&#151;I will move on to address that point.</P><P>At 
least national insurance is a tax that is applied across the board, which means 
that it does not reduce Scotland's relative competitiveness in the UK. We need 
to ensure that we undercut the growth regions in respect of the taxes that count 
on growth. That is a point to which I will return later in my speech.</P><P><strong>George 
Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD): </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Andrew 
Wilson: </strong>I want to move on, but I will take the member's intervention 
shortly.</P><P>As part of its contribution to a better debate on the subject, 
the SNP set out its support last week for much of what the Government is doing 
in this field. We might have expected an SNP press release that was headed &quot;SNP 
back Labour&quot; to have generated some coverage but, as Alf Young commented, 
the lack of coverage pointed to the need for both partners in the symbiotic relationship 
between politicians and the press to look to their conduct. Where there is agreement, 
perhaps there is scope to broadcast it so that we can build on the consensus and 
leave the arguments where they count.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18022">18022</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Anyone who analyses the world economy knows that the broad thrust of the Government's 
strategy is correct, as far as it goes. We cannot compete on cheap labour and 
subsidies, so we must go up the value chain. The whole thrust of &quot;A Smart, 
Successful Scotland&quot; is correct and we will back it. The idea behind Scottish 
Development International is good. The technology institutes are a huge risk for 
the Government, but they are a risk that is worth taking and we will back them. 
Science, training and skills are all key issues. We will examine the detail of 
what the Government is doing&#151;that is, of course, the job for the members 
of a democratic Opposition over the next few weeks before the Government replaces 
us in that role.</P><P>We will bring forward our own reform ideas about what more 
we have to do with the powers of the Parliament. The Government's approach to 
date has not, is not and will not be enough. In the words of an editorial in <em>The 
Scotsman</em> this week, the Government is using</P><P>&quot;a pea-shooter firing 
into a hurricane&quot;.</P><P>Whichever view is taken of the Government, the evidence 
is clear and compelling that Scotland is not achieving its potential.</P><P><strong>Miss 
Annabel Goldie (West of Scotland) (Con): </strong>Mr Wilson is five minutes into 
his speech. Is the peashooter going to produce something positive by way of the 
Scottish National Party's proposals for the economy?</P><P><strong>Andrew Wilson: 
</strong>I am surprised at Miss Goldie. First, I have to outline the areas on 
which I agree with the Government. In an election era, I cannot get more positive 
than to stand up and say that I agree. I try my best. I will examine my conscience 
tonight, but I make every effort to be positive.</P><P>If we examine the output 
of the Scottish economy, we will all agree that we have had a problem over the 
past 30 years and that the problem is getting worse. What we have to do to win 
the consensus across the political spectrum is to make the case that resources 
for investment in our public services come out of growth and wealth creation. 
We cannot increase the tax on a diminishing economic base and hope to succeed&#151;that 
has been the record over the past 15 years. Over the past 12 months, as the economy 
shrank, the picture has become particularly grave for Scotland. Our economy grew 
at one thirteenth of the UK rate&#151;the wealth gap is widening.</P><P>Recently, 
the Government pointed out that if electronics is stripped out, the economy is 
fine. I suggest to the Government with the greatest of respect that that sort 
of spin is wholly inappropriate. Energy, water, manufacturing, engineering, textiles, 
chemicals and petroleum </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18023">18023</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>products are all still in recession. Sectors producing less than they were 
one year ago include financial services, metal products, food, drink and tobacco, 
agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining and quarrying. All of them are major 
sectors and all of them have deep problems.</P><P><strong>George Lyon: </strong>Andrew 
Wilson highlights the problems that face the Scottish economy. Does he not agree 
that many other small, independent nations throughout Europe face exactly the 
same challenges?</P><P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Mr Lyon makes a very reasonable 
point. It is true that European and world economies are under pressure. My response 
is that Scotland is under the greatest pressure. We seem to be exposed more than 
any other country. In the period since Labour and the Liberal Democrats came to 
power, Scotland's growth record has been the poorest of any European Union member 
state. Even the economy of Germany, which has been under massive pressures since 
reunification, has grown 25 per cent faster than that of Scotland and the economy 
of Ireland has done so by a factor of seven.</P><P>I agree that we are under pressure, 
but I repeat that the UK economy grew 13 times faster than the Scottish economy 
over the past year. We are living in a tough world, but our economic performance 
is much worse than it should be.</P><P>I also point to the fact that, although 
all the evidence is clear and compelling, what we do not know about Scotland should 
also worry us. We will not know until next week the detail of the monetary policy 
committee thinking behind its interest rate cut last week. Although we welcome 
that cut in interest rates, I would be surprised if its thinking were not based 
on the collapse in business and other investment in the UK over the past year. 
The situation is very grave as it affects future productivity.</P><P>We know nothing 
about the figures for investment in the Scottish economy, because the analysis 
is not available to us. However, all the anecdotal evidence suggests that the 
investment that is taking place is going into rationalisation and downsizing and 
that capital accumulation is taking place abroad.</P><P><strong>Mr David Davidson 
(North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Andrew 
Wilson: </strong>No, thanks. I must move on.</P><P>We have very deep-seated problems. 
I suggest that the long-term picture, which has got worse over the past five years, 
is set to get much worse in the future.</P><P>If we look at what we are doing 
right, we can see that, in our educational performance in many fields in further 
and higher education, we are making a </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18024">18024</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>lot of investment and producing a lot of outputs. That does not suggest that 
the problem is qualifications in certain segments of the labour force. Although 
investment in that area is critical, it is not the whole answer.</P><P>We have 
to overcome the gravitational and magnetic pull of the economy of the south-east 
of the UK. We cannot continue to have a growth model in which there is one high-growth 
area and Scotland and the regions of England are placated with higher public spending. 
That is to treat the symptoms and not the root cause. It is a model that does 
not work. The UK is the 19<SUP>th</SUP> most successful economy in the world and 
its ranking is falling. We need to make a change: we need to tilt the playing 
field in our direction and overcome the gravitational pull.</P><P>Taxes on growth 
are not the silver bullet, but the SNP's argument is that they are a key part 
of the whole. We have to encourage corporate headquarters to register in Scotland, 
to declare profits here and to bring their top staff here.</P><P>The bottom line 
is that we have to out-compete the rest of the UK. To do so, we need to get the 
same competitive powers that our competitors have. We have to change the culture 
and the way in which we conduct the debate inside the Parliament, inside Scottish 
politics and in general. We need to make that change because politicians need 
to lead the truth that no one owes Scotland its lunch and that we have to earn 
it by being more competitive.</P><P>Why is it that we have a Chancellor of the 
Exchequer who opposes tax harmonisation in Europe yet argues for tax harmonisation 
in the UK? Why do we have a chancellor who is in favour of tax competition across 
Europe yet imposes a centrist model on the UK economy? As promotion of the economy 
is somewhere approaching fifth in the Labour party's pecking order, the minister 
will have to answer the contention that, of the six key areas for improving British 
competitiveness that the chancellor gave in his speech to the Social Market Foundation 
this week, only one is presently within the ambit of the minister. The chancellor 
knows that he needs the full range of powers with which to sort Britain's problems. 
We need the same powers to sort Scotland's problems.</P><P>I recognise that much 
work has still to be done to broker consensus among the parties. We have made 
our contribution by saying on which points we will agree with other parties, and 
I look to the Liberals Democrats, the Conservatives and Labour for open minds 
to what we have to say. There are issues at stake and the situation is grave. 
We need open minds and a change of approach if we are to deliver. That is how 
we will conduct the election and ourselves in the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18025">18025</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>chamber. I call on all members to back the SNP motion.</P><P>I move,</P><P>That 
the Parliament notes with concern the long-term underperformance of the Scottish 
economy and the growing gap in wealth created per head between Scotland and the 
rest of the UK and the south east of England in particular; recognises that the 
symptoms of economic underperformance cannot be dealt with on a sustainable basis 
until the root cause of economic underperformance is addressed directly; calls 
for all leaders in Scottish public life to work towards a national consensus around 
the drive to bridge the gap between Scotland's economic performance and economic 
potential, and, in working towards that consensus, further recognises that differences 
of opinion on policy prescriptions are a healthy part of the democratic debate 
but calls for an open mind on all sides in respect of the range of policy options 
that are, and should be, available to the Scottish Executive in working towards 
making Scotland as competitive as its competitors.</P><P>11:10</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning (Lewis Macdonald): 
</strong>I should like to begin in the spirit of Mr Wilson's welcome press release, 
rather than in that of his opening remarks today, because I want to begin with 
some agreement. Clearly, there are significant areas of agreement.</P><P>For example, 
we are agreed on the need for sustainable long-term growth in the Scottish economy. 
We are agreed that increased productivity is the key to such growth, and that 
only by generating more wealth can we pay for the public services that we want, 
create opportunities for all and lay the basis for sustainable development in 
the years ahead. A consensus within Scotland on how to achieve that growth, and 
sustain higher productivity, is certainly desirable. I welcome the SNP's recognition 
in its press release, which backs Labour, that&#151;and I think I use its words, 
not mine&#151;an enterprise strategy focused on science and skills, on global 
connectivity and on growing Scottish businesses provides a basis on which such 
a consensus can be built.</P><P>&quot;A Smart, Successful Scotland&quot; is that 
strategy for growth, but it does not stand in isolation from the wider economic 
and political context any more than Scotland's economy can grow in isolation from 
the wider world.</P><P>The political context of our enterprise strategy is the 
devolution settlement, which the SNP does not accept but which we see as critical 
to the successful delivery of our aims for sustainable future growth. The economic 
context is critical too, specifically the stable macroeconomic environment delivered 
by sound management of the UK economy.</P><P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Can 
the minister refer the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18026">18026</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>chamber to a single power that devolution has given us that we did not have 
previously under the Secretary of State for Scotland that can make a difference 
to the growth rate of the economy?</P><P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Devolution 
gives us the opportunity to concentrate on growth and skills, which is precisely 
what we need to do. We are able to address sustainable growth precisely because 
we are operating in a stable macroeconomic environment, which has delivered record 
low levels of inflation, record low interest rates and the lowest level of unemployment 
in a generation. Those indicators are significant in setting the context for growth 
and should not be taken for granted.</P><P>The debate is not just about the relationship 
with the rest of the UK, as important as that is. It is also about what kind of 
competitive advantage we should seek and where we should position ourselves in 
the global economy. We are clear about how we want Scotland to compete, which 
is as a high-skill, high-knowledge economy. That is why &quot;A Smart, Successful 
Scotland&quot; places such emphasis on investing in people and on the links between 
enterprise and lifelong learning. That is also why we do not want to depend in 
future on inward investment alone, or to make our pitch to overseas investors 
as a cheaper place to do business, be that on labour costs or tax rates on business 
profits.</P><P><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I am sure 
that we all agree that key to stimulating growth is investment in lifelong learning 
and education. Does the minister accept that even after the increases that have 
been announced in the past two years, our investment in higher and further education 
in Scotland is a third less than that per head of our European competitors? If 
we are to grow, that gap must be closed.</P><P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>&quot;Life 
Through Learning Through Life: The Lifelong Learning Strategy for Scotland&quot;, 
which was launched yesterday, points us in the direction of how we should be growing 
that sector of the economy and ensuring that it makes a contribution to the wider 
economic benefit.</P><P>I shall touch briefly on corporation tax rates, because 
the SNP has raised the issue in the past, although I was struck by the lack of 
direct reference to it in Andrew Wilson's introductory remarks this morning. Perhaps 
more light will be shed on that in due course. It is worth noting that the UK 
already has lower corporation tax rates than the United States and Japan, and 
the level is below the European Union average. The rates are competitive on the 
world stage and at the same time provide the revenues that we need to sustain 
investment in the wider economy.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18027">18027</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Will the minister give way?</P><P><strong>Lewis 
Macdonald: </strong>Yes.</P><P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>The minister is 
being very generous with his time. I agree with his comments on corporation tax, 
but it is one part of the whole. The point that we are making today is that our 
corporation tax rate is the same as the rate in the south-east of England. However 
the rate of growth in that part of the country is increasing exponentially faster 
than the growth rate in Scotland. We need to undercut our competitor regions.</P><P><strong>Lewis 
Macdonald: </strong>I do not agree. In fact, that is precisely the flaw at the 
heart of SNP policy. Instead, we need to sell Scotland as a high-quality, high-value, 
highly productive and enterprising economy. Seeking to undercut our competitors 
on labour or tax costs is the wrong direction to go in.</P><P>That argument is 
not abstract. After all, a penny on corporation tax means &#163;90 million in tax take 
for the Scottish economy. We do not need to take many pennies off that tax to 
remove the budgets for training and skills, research and development and business 
start-up and growth that Alex Neil mentioned. Some might think that that is a 
price worth paying for a few big inward investors&#151;we do not agree.</P><P>The 
same argument applies to business rates. Although business rate poundage in Scotland 
is higher, many comparable rateable values are lower. One could make a legitimate 
argument about the balance of burdens on individual businesses. However, complaining 
about differential tax rates in Scotland and England while in the same breath 
demanding full fiscal independence makes very little sense.</P><P>We will freeze 
business rates from 1 April, and will be delighted if that change results in increased 
business investment this year, next year and beyond. However, we do not concede 
the point that we should never diverge from England in devolved areas, and we 
recognise that there are opportunity costs in every measure we take that reduces 
public revenues.</P><P>It is self-evident that cutting business rates, as others 
intend to do, will impact on public spending. To meet its pledge, the SNP will 
have to take &#163;150 million out of the enterprise budget; the Tories will require 
to take even more. Those are legitimate choices to place before the electorate, 
as no doubt will be done in the next few weeks. However, no one should pretend 
that it is possible to reduce public revenues while increasing public investment. 
That simply cannot be done.</P><P>Targeted public investment is part of our strategy 
for growth. For example, we are seeking </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18028">18028</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>to support business through the intermediary technology institutes that the 
First Minister announced a few weeks ago. With an energy institute in Aberdeen, 
a life sciences institute in Dundee and an information technology institute in 
Glasgow, we are focusing on the real strengths of Scotland's knowledge economy. 
The ITIs will focus work on those issues through the investment of public money. 
Such an approach is jeopardised by reducing the revenues that are available to 
the enterprise network.</P><P><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab): </strong>Will 
the minister give way?</P><P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I am afraid not.</P><P>Of 
course, we are also investing our tax revenues in the electronic infrastructure 
and the transport infrastructure to give Scottish companies a competitive edge. 
All those investments are part and parcel of our strategy for growth, which is 
designed to overcome the gap between where we are and where we want to be. We 
welcome support from all sides for that strategic approach.</P><P>I move amendment

leaders in Scottish public life to work towards a national consensus around the 
drive to bridge the gap between Scotland's economic performance and economic potential, 
and endorses the work being undertaken by the Executive to use the powers of the

in transport and communications infrastructure.&quot;</P><P>11:18</P><P><strong>Miss 
Annabel Goldie (West of Scotland) (Con): </strong>Although I do not impugn the 
sincerity of Mr Andrew Wilson, it is difficult to take seriously an SNP motion 
on the economy. I say that for three reasons. First, enterprise and the economy 
do not seem to be political priorities for the SNP. In almost four years of the 
Parliament, it has managed to call only two debates on those matters&#151;Mr MacAskill 
secured a debate in 2001 and Mr Wilson called one in 2002. That is hardly indicative 
of a pulsating interest in those topics. In contrast, the Conservatives have secured 
five debates on the economy.</P><P>Secondly, in so far as the SNP takes a passing 
glance at these issues&#151;no doubt fuelled by some imminent boardroom visit&#151;its 
understanding of the acute problems that currently confront Scottish business 
seems remote. The motion has all the urgency of watching paint dry. Indeed, it 
is akin to </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18029">18029</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>looking at a haemorrhaging patient and resolving to take immediate action by 
forming a committee to discuss coagulation.</P><P>What is happening to Scottish 
business at the moment is grim and menacing. Growth was stunted in 2002. The second 
quarter showed a rise of 0.2 per cent, and the third a rise of 0.6 per cent, and 
that after the first recession in 20 years. Furthermore, according to figures 
released today for the three months up to December 2002, we have higher unemployment 
than the rest of the UK. In 2002, we lost more than 7,000 jobs in manufacturing 
and, to date in 2003, total job losses are running at more than 2,400.</P><P>In 
the third quarter of 2002, the number of business start-ups showed a decrease 
of 22.6 per cent from the previous quarter. In 2002, the number of company insolvencies 
increased by 23.6 per cent. Business rates are almost 9 per cent higher than in 
England because of the higher Scottish business rate poundage. New regulations 
are piling on cost to business. According to the Institute of Directors, between 
1997 and 2002, the annual cost to British business was &#163;6 billion. Compared with 
when it came to power in 1997, Labour now takes nearly &#163;2,000 a year more in tax 
for every man, woman and child in Britain.</P><P>That is a chronicle of economic 
epitaphs&#151;a chilling thumbnail sketch of how not to create a competitive, 
vibrant economy.</P><P>What is the Scottish National Party's dynamic and practical 
response to that situation? Its response is a motion that&#151;although it might 
aspire to be a record for verbosity&#151;in 151 words offers not one specific 
remedy or solution to the beleaguered Scottish business community. For SNP, read, 
&quot;Sorry, no proposals&quot;.</P><P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Will the 
member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Miss Goldie: </strong>And sorry, no 
intervention. In Mr Wilson's speech of nine minutes and 18 seconds, we had diagnosis. 
For one minute and 35 seconds we had two specific proposals&#151;more corporate 
headquarters should come to Scotland and we need to be more competitive. Well, 
that is a ringing aspiration for the business community&#151;I bet that it derives 
small comfort from the modesty of that proposition.</P><P><strong>Andrew Wilson: 
</strong>From political leaders of all parties, the business community needs some 
unity of purpose on an issue that is too grave for bickering of that nature. We 
must focus on increasing growth and we have to give credit where it is due and 
find some agreement. Miss Goldie's approach is not good enough.</P><P><strong>Miss 
Goldie: </strong>Those words could be spoken only by somebody who has never run 
a business. I </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18030">18030</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>will tell Mr Wilson what the business community needs now: it needs genuine 
solutions that can be delivered under the devolved settlement.</P><P>Even the 
most intrepid motion reader, persevering to the end of the SNP motion, would have 
cause for question because, remarkably, Mr Wilson never mentions the word independence, 
yet that is the Scottish National Party's fundamental credo.</P><P>Is Mr Wilson, 
recognising that independence finds little resonance with Scottish business, a 
duck-and-dive devolutionist? If he is, has he told the rest of his party? However, 
if he is, where are his specific proposals for improving the lot of Scottish business 
now, under the devolution settlement?</P><P>Mr Wilson is, of course, a devolution 
man, except he dare not speak the name&#151;he has to pretend the cause of independence. 
He knows that that is a difficult product to market.</P><P><strong>Shona Robison 
(North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Miss 
Goldie: </strong>I do not have time. Mr Wilson's economic case is not helped by 
the Business Strategies forecast that, under devolution this year, growth in gross 
domestic product, if delivered, will be higher in Scotland than in the UK. So, 
there is no intrinsic devolution bar to higher Scottish GDP.</P><P>The third reason 
why it is difficult to take the motion seriously is what the Scottish National 
Party represents as a political entity. It is a party that has brought to debates 
on public expenditure all the infinite elasticity of bungee jumping. It is a party 
to which profit is repugnant. That is why the business community can expect no 
comfort from the Scottish National Party. That is why the amendment in my name 
excises the linguistic froth of the nationalists and offers Scottish business 
what it is crying out for now&#151;specific solutions to restore competitiveness

<P>11:24</P><P><strong>Tavish Scott (Shetland) (LD): </strong>I apologise to colleagues 
for having to leave before the end of the debate because of another engagement 
today.</P><P>In contemplating Miss Goldie's speech, I am struck by the fact that 
she spends longer on her soundbites than she does on analysis of the current position 
of the Scottish economy. How can the Tories say what Scottish business needs? 
We all recall their record&#151;one business went bust every three minutes of 
every working day under the Tories and they had the worst-ever record for business 
start-ups. By 1997, investment in manufacturing was lower than when the Tories 
came to power. During 18 years, they presided over the two worst recessions since 
1945. In Shetland, we all remember Lord Lamont&#151;</P><P><strong>Miss Goldie<em>

not finished yet. We all remember Lord Lamont of Lerwick spending &#163;10 billion 
in the worst economic crisis caused by incompetence that the country can recall. 
I am very happy to give way to Miss Goldie so that she may defend that record.</P><P><strong>Miss 
Goldie: </strong>I ask Mr Scott to confirm whether the Scottish Executive was 
happy to inherit the Tory creation of a prosperous economy upon which it frequently 
founds so many of its arguments for expenditure? Will Mr Scott confirm which party 
in government introduced uniform business rates to respond to the overwhelming 
plea of Scottish business?</P><P><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Miss Goldie forgets 
that the Tories lost the election and that Scottish business&#151;like everyone 
else in Scotland&#151;voted no to the Tories, which is why they did not have one 
seat after the 1997 election. Their record was shown up by the electorate.</P><P>I 
take up Andrew Wilson's point about analysing the current position of the Scottish 
economy. It is entirely right to do that and the minister was right to illustrate 
what the Executive is doing in that regard. I share serious concern about the 
current situation, not just of Scotland, but of Europe and the world at this time, 
which is where I might differ from Mr Wilson. Any analysis of the figures that 
are currently available in the UK and international context is worrying, including 
the fact that one in five families is struggling to meet debt repayments at a 
time of high employment and when interest rates are at their lowest level since 
1956. There is worrying financial frailty in the UK economy.</P><P>On the day

<P>Therefore, it is right to consider these issues, but we should concentrate 
on the matters that come under the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament and 
what the Parliament and Government can do to promote those matters. That is where 
the SNP and the Liberal Democrats differ. Andrew Wilson would argue for further 
powers in that context. Those of us who believe in a federal United Kingdom would 
argue for the development of powers in that way.</P><P><strong>Andrew Wilson: 
</strong>I am grateful to the member for giving way with perfect timing. Given 
what Mr Scott has just said about the development of Liberal thinking on greater 
powers, we know that the Liberal Democrats have open minds. I suggest they introduce 
some urgency to that thinking and present some specific proposals for growth because 
the powers as they stand have not worked, are not working and will not work. We 
need to find consensus on how we grow from here.</P><P><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>I 
am always thinking urgently, but I will introduce our proposals at the time when 
all parties introduce theirs in the coming election campaign.</P><P>I will pick 
up on two areas of competitiveness, as that is the focus of the debate. The first 
relates to the slow business take-up of broadband connections, particularly among 
small and medium-sized enterprises. A study from the Federation of Small Businesses 
last year illustrated that 54 per cent of small businesses had modem connections, 
only 14 per cent were using ISDN links, only 4 per cent used broadband and 15 
per cent of surveyed businesses did not even have connection to a computer.</P><P>There 
is a challenge to take up the advantages of e-business. That is why the Scottish 
Executive strategy in that area is right. That is why the enterprise network must 
be at the heart of that. Incidentally, I noticed that neither the SNP nor the 
Tories were forthcoming on their proposals for the enterprise network. I understand 
that the Tories plan to abolish Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands 
Enterprise and that the SNP plans to regionalise the current structure. Those 
are important issues when there are others among us who believe that the enterprise 
network is at the heart of delivering skills. The Tories do not agree, obviously, 
because they plan to abolish the very body that concentrates on skills.</P><P><strong>Miss 
Goldie: </strong>I place on record the fact that the Scottish Conservatives will 
not abolish the enterprise network.</P><P><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Oh well, 
their policy has just changed. We look forward to discussing that further.</P><P>I 
was disappointed by the evidence given to the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18033">18033</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee last week that a business park in 
Aberdeen, fully wired for broadband telecommunications access, had been unplugged 
because there was not enough business interest. That is one of the challenges 
that the Parliament, the Executive and the Government face.</P><P>I will finish 
with a couple of points on renewables. It is important to pull together the commercialisation 
of research in our universities and the engineering skills that we have throughout 
Scotland. That is a particular challenge for Aberdeen and the north-east in the 
context of the changes that are happening in the oil and gas sector. There are 
considerable opportunities for Scotland as a whole.</P><P>This is an important 
debate. It is an opportunity to discuss such matters properly. I promise that 
my party will give full vent to our thoughts on the matters in the coming weeks 
and months. I implore Parliament today to support the Executive amendment, which 
is the only reasonable amendment before it.</P><P>11:30</P><P><strong>Mr Kenny 
MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>Annabel Goldie denigrates my colleague, Andrew 
Wilson, for his lack of business experience. Given that her experience as a city-centre 
senior partner in a law firm reflects mine, and I have never considered myself 
a business guru, I think that that is rather rich.</P><P>I want to make two specific 
points about the debate. We must recognise two matters: first, that there is a 
fundamental need for economic growth; and, secondly, that there is a need for 
political consensus around that. As other members have said, it is quite clear 
that nobody owes us a living. We are a small nation on the periphery of Europe 
and we need to punch our weight. We have not been doing so, and we have lagged 
behind as a consequence. As a result, we are paying the price in lowered living 
standards. We owe it not just to ourselves but to future generations to resolve 
that problem.</P><P>That leads me to my second point, on the creation of a cross-party 
consensus. There are historical lessons. Ireland and Finland have been referred 
to, not just by me but by other members. We must recognise that their structural 
difficulties, which were substantial and, arguably, far greater than the ones 
that we face, were addressed on the basis of national consensus built on political 
consensus. We must recognise that the matter will not be dealt with by one political 
party or in one term of Government. It needs longer-term action and it needs consensus 
across the board. We cannot continue to reflect the UK stop-start </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18034">18034</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>attitude, which got us into such difficulties and gave us the problems that 
we had in the latter part of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century. A Labour Government 
came in to change what had been done by a Tory Government, and being replaced 
by another Government fundamentally undermined us.</P><P>We must recognise that 
economic growth will be delivered by members of the Scottish business community, 
large and small. It is for politicians to allow them to get on with running their 
businesses, not to lecture them or tell them how to run them. However, Government 
must provide the framework to allow those businesses to prosper and to achieve 
their full potential.</P><P>That leads me to the role of the state and the Government, 
whose remit falls in key areas. Education and infrastructure are two examples. 
I have made it clear in previous debates that it is not an employer's responsibility 
to ensure that their employees can read and write&#151;sadly we have those difficulties 
in the present day. It is the Government's job to ensure that the work force is 
job ready&#151;employers can give specific training, but addressing that problem 
is a state responsibility.</P><P>The points that Tavish Scott made about telecoms 
are also true. The difficulty is that we must have a national strategy. An attempt 
to leave market forces to deal with telecoms will not work. We must ensure that, 
in areas of Scotland, there is state intervention&#151;</P><P><strong>Tavish Scott: 
</strong>Will Mr MacAskill give way?</P><P><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>I am 
sorry, but I am now into the final minute of my speech. I do not think that I 
would disagree with Tavish Scott in any way, but we must have intervention by 
the state in telecoms.</P><P>We must recognise that transport is important.</P><P><strong>David 
McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>Nationalisation!</P><P><strong>Mr MacAskill: 
</strong>It is a matter of getting our work force to their jobs and our goods 
to their markets. David McLetchie may shout, &quot;Nationalisation!&quot; but 
the fact is that privatisation of the railways was a failure that everyone in 
this country is paying for. It was brought about by a Tory Government and has 
brought misery to commuters, freight and the Scottish business sector in its entirety.</P><P>We 
must recognise that it is the job of the state to deal with those matters. That 
means that we must be proactive. We need transport authorities that can regulate 
the buses to ensure that we do not have the idiocy that we had in the City of 
Edinburgh, which resulted in the company that Mr McLetchie's firm supported losing 
&#163;4.2 million. That is hardly a raving business success. We must ensure that we 
can get access to the markets, </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18035">18035</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>which means having influence and control over our rail network. Today, we have 
even found out that the Strategic Rail Authority is trying to instruct ScotRail 
to cut its services. It is time to take charge of our own railways.</P><P>I support 
the motion.</P><P>11:34</P><P><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab): </strong>I 
welcome the recent SNP conversion to our policy for a smart, successful Scotland. 
It has taken nearly four years, but at last the SNP has admitted that its economic 
policies have been based on false, out-of-date premises that simply do not work 
in the kind of world that we now find ourselves in. We must acknowledge that conversion.</P><P>The 
Irish economy used to be the holy grail for the nationalists, but suddenly they 
have realised&#151;apart from Kenny MacAskill&#151;that exporting the Irish economy 
to Scotland is not the way forward. We could all have told them that a few years 
ago. Here are a few facts about the Irish economy that the SNP does not tell people. 
According to figures released on 31 January, national economic output has fallen 
in Ireland for the first time in 16 years. With growth falling in the third quartile 
of 2002, it is looking doubtful whether the increase in growth will top 2 per 
cent. The growth rate is plummeting compared with the 10 per cent growth rate 
of two years ago. Profit repatriation by multinational companies has soared to 
41 per cent, while incomes available to Irish people have fallen.</P><P><strong>Andrew 
Wilson: </strong>The troubles in the Irish economy are interesting, but I think 
that Rhona Brankin should focus on the troubles in the Scottish economy, which 
are exponentially worse than those in Ireland. We cannot import everything from 
Ireland, but I would really like to have had the problems that the Irish have 
had over the past 10 years, when their economy has grown at eight times the rate 
of the Scottish economy. Should not we be learning from their successes rather 
than demeaning them in times of trouble?</P><P><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>I 
thank Andrew Wilson for that speech, but it is important to recognise that the 
difficulties that are being experienced by many small nations in the global recession 
are not peculiar to Scotland. In fact, they are being experienced by many other 
small nations in the world, such as Ireland.</P><P>I want to highlight the difference 
between us and the Irish. Their January unemployment figures are the highest that 
they have been for three years. Inflation in Ireland is now twice the European 
average and, in recent months, 3 million of savings and cuts have been made in 
education, health and other areas. Let us contrast that with the management of 
the economy in the UK and in </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18036">18036</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Scotland. With a UK Labour Government, interest rates in Scotland are 4 per 
cent, inflation is under 2 per cent and unemployment is at its lowest for a generation.</P><P>I 
began by welcoming the SNP conversion to our strategy for a smart, successful 
Scotland, but it is not a real conversion. At the heart of the SNP economic strategy 
there is a huge black hole, and that hole is skills training. To finance their 
business tax cuts, the nationalists have come up with the election gimmick of 
taking &#163;150 million out of the Scottish Enterprise skills and training budget, 
at a time of emerging skill shortages in Scotland.</P><P>That is the fundamental 
difference. Our strategy for a smart, successful Scotland puts lifelong learning 
at the heart of our competitiveness. If we are to compete in a global marketplace 
against other advanced nations, we simply must invest in our infrastructure and, 
most important, in our people. It is simply not good enough to build a whole economic 
policy on business tax cuts. If different rates of business taxation made such 
a difference, why has not Northern Ireland been denuded of business? It is because 
running a successful business is about a lot more than cuts in business taxes.</P><P>What 
have we learned from the SNP's new economic policy? Lesson 1 is that independence 
is no defence against global recession. Lesson 2 is that cutting business rates 
is no defence against global recession. Lesson 3 is that the best defence at a 
time of global recession is to be part of a larger economy, as Scotland is part 
of the UK economy. Interest rates are at 4 per cent, inflation is under 2 per 
cent and unemployment is at its lowest for a generation.</P><P>We face serious 
challenges to our economy here in Scotland, as do many other nations in the world. 
The SNP's new economic policy has a huge black hole in it, and the SNP has now 
joined forces with the Tory party. It is a policy for a stupid, unsuccessful Scotland. 
How does Andrew Wilson think that we can build a consensus around that? I ask 
members to support the Executive amendment.</P><P>11:39</P><P><strong>Alex Neil 
(Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>After listening to that speech, I shall try 
to raise the tone of the debate. First, I suggest that Rhona Brankin reads the 
SNP manifesto from 1999, where we envisaged the establishment of Scottish Development 
International and promised the establishment of what we called &quot;Come to Scotland&quot;, 
which the Executive has called VisitScotland. We also said that we wanted to make 
Scotland the science capital of Europe and </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18037">18037</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>that we wanted to use the powers of this Parliament to maximum effect for the 
Scottish economy. It is not a case of us being converted to Labour policy. Labour 
has simply stolen our policy. Let us rise above that.</P><P>An unemployed worker 
in Ayrshire, or one of the Boots workers who faces the prospect of redundancy 
in the next couple of years, listening to this debate will want to know what the 
Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive will do for them. We are all signed 
up to the long-term strategy. We recognise the need to invest in science and skills 
as a way forward for Scotland. However, we also recognise the fact that we face 
short-term difficulty. One of the questions that the Parliament should address 
this morning is what we can do in the short term&#151;until we realise the benefits 
of the long-term strategy&#151;to improve job prospects for people in Scotland. 
I shall make several suggestions, which I hope the Executive will consider seriously.</P><P>First, 
there is an enormous latent demand in the building sector that is not being met 
either because of a lack of proper skills or because of a lack of appropriate 
land availability. One of the immediate things that the Executive can do to remove 
the barriers to growth in construction is to address the problem of the vested 
interests that run the Construction Industry Training Board in the UK and to ensure 
that we can go beyond the expansion of modern apprenticeships in construction 
skills. I would like the minister to address the fact that the expansion of modern 
apprenticeships in construction skills is not driven by employment-based traineeships, 
which is a problem. If that situation can be addressed, we will go a long way 
towards creating new jobs in the short term in the construction industry.</P><P>Secondly, 
there are problems with land availability and planning. I am currently dealing 
with a case in Ayrshire. The situation is nonsensical. A small, isolated piece 
of land that had planning permission for five houses no longer has planning permission 
because some bureaucrat in the council has decided that it has been rezoned. The 
land cannot be rezoned for anything other than housing, as it is too small for 
agriculture and is cut off by roads on each side. That is typical of what is happening 
the length and breadth of Scotland. Our planning laws are being implemented so 
restrictively that they are acting as a definite barrier to growth. We need to 
do something about that urgently.</P><P>Andrew Wilson has covered the issue of 
reducing business rates. That urgent measure is desperately needed to create a 
more even playing field between ourselves and the south of England.</P><P>Thirdly, 
there is an issue in relation to commercialisation. There is an underlying </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18038">18038</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>assumption that we need to wait for five or 10 years for that policy to work. 
Last week, I spoke to a company that specialises in, and has a successful track 
record in, the commercialisation of science throughout the United Kingdom. It 
told me that it has identified 60 projects that it could get up and running in 
the next two years, but that it cannot do so because of the slowness of decision 
making in our universities. I say to the Executive: for God's sake, do not just 
lie back and wait for Gordon Brown's budget&#151;get some action today, so that 
we can be seen to be doing something about the Scottish economy pending the achievement 
of our independence in the period ahead.</P><P>11:43</P><P><strong>David McLetchie 
(Lothians) (Con): </strong>The problem with the SNP's approach to improving the 
performance of the Scottish economy is that it talks constantly about extending 
the powers of the Parliament as if that, in itself, would magically increase our 
prosperity. What it does not address is the much more important and difficult 
question of what the SNP would do with those new powers if it had them. That is 
the question that the Scottish National Party is desperate to avoid, as that is 
where the theory falls down.</P><P>That is perhaps why Andrew Wilson was so vague 
on his policy prescriptions beyond telling us how much he agreed with the Scottish 
Executive. That admission&#151;which was underlined by Alex Neil, whose only quibble 
with Executive policy was who thought of it first&#151;exposes the fact that the 
Scottish National Party offers a change of country but not a genuine change of 
policy. It offers only a more extreme version of the tax-and-waste strategy that 
is currently being pursued by Gordon Brown, and which is enthusiastically backed 
by the Labour-Liberal Executive in Scotland.</P><P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>The 
motion seeks to broker agreement across the chamber about where the country needs 
to be. We will bring our election ideas to the election, not to the Parliament. 
Why does not the Conservative party have the grace to back a strategy that can 
unify people rather than leave people disillusioned by politicians' failure to 
take a lead in this country?</P><P><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>Andrew Wilson's 
approach is an admission of defeat and of a poverty of ideas. It is interesting 
to hear of the SNP's latest strategy to reduce business rates. The SNP thought 
of that a month ago, but the Conservatives have been advocating that in the Parliament 
for the best part of two years. That is the fundamental difference between the 
two parties.</P><P>Reference has been made to Ireland and the need to match the 
level of economic growth there, </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18039">18039</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>which has long been a favourite topic of the SNP. However, the truth is that 
the SNP has no wish to emulate the Irish approach, which is based on charging 
lower taxes and constraining growth in Government spending. For SNP members to 
talk about adopting such a strategy is political deception of the worst kind.</P><P>Members 
of all parties want a dynamic economy combined with generous provision for public 
services. However, that is a policy circle that the Scottish National Party simply 
cannot square. Its answer to every problem in Scotland is to blame the Treasury 
and to call for ever-higher public expenditure, and to disparage&#151;week after 
week, month after month&#151;the contribution that the private sector can make 
to our overall prosperity and to partnership working and the development of our 
public services. No clear explanation is ever given of how all the SNP's spending 
commitments are to be met.</P><P>What is clear is the fact that an independent 
Scotland, run by the SNP, would be a high-tax country similar to one of the party's 
favourite Scandinavian models, Sweden&#151;a country in which public spending 
accounted for 56 per cent of the gross domestic product in 2000 and which has 
one of the highest levels of taxation in the world. That is not much of a model. 
Despite what Mr Gordon Brown and the SNP might imagine, there is a real growth 
penalty in increasing public spending above the rate of growth in the economy 
as a whole. Recent research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development&#151;with which Andrew Wilson will be familiar&#151;has shown that 
a 1 per cent increase in the tax take is associated with a growth penalty of around 
a 0.6 per cent to 0.7 per cent reduction in GDP. No wonder that is the outcome 
of such a failed strategy.</P><P>There is no policy prescription in the motion 
beyond the vague wish that we should all get together to improve Scotland's economic 
performance. The Conservatives are not ashamed to say where we differ from other 
parties, and we will not be ashamed to say that in the coming weeks. We believe 
that a reduction in business rates, a reduction in regulation and a switch of 
resources from the present distribution of the enterprise budget to the improvement 
of Scotland's transport infrastructure are significant contributions that the 
Parliament and the Executive could make to the prosperity of Scotland. We will 
have no hesitation in continuing boldly to advocate those much-needed prescriptions.</P><P>11:48</P><P><strong>Bristow

that we all </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18040">18040</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>want the Scottish economic growth rate to rise. We also recognise the fact 
that, over the past 20 or 30 years, that growth rate has not been as healthy as 
we would have wished it to be. The issue, then, is about what prescriptions the 
Government can or should make to influence the growth rate and to contribute to 
its rise. I will address some of the approaches that are advocated by members 
of other parties later, and will begin by considering the approach that has been 
taken by the Scottish Executive.</P><P>Back in September, the First Minister made 
it clear that the stimulation of economic growth would be central to the policies 
of the Scottish Executive. There are three planks to that: to accelerate Scotland's 
rate of economic growth; to provide opportunities to all and close the opportunity 
gap; and to ensure that economic development is sustainable in the medium to longer 
term. In driving towards those goals, we need to recognise&#151;as Rhona Brankin 
recognised&#151;the stability of economic growth that the UK Government has provided 
for us. We have had low interest rates, low inflation levels, high employment 
levels and low unemployment levels&#151;the lowest levels of unemployment that 
we have seen for a whole generation.</P><P><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>On the 
issue of low unemployment, research from the University of Sheffield and the University 
of Warwick shows that the real level of unemployment is well over 300,000, not 
the figure of 100,000 that is given in official statistics.</P><P><strong>Bristow 
Muldoon: </strong>Without referring to those specific figures, I acknowledge the 
fact that even the International Labour Organisation figures are well below the 
levels that we inherited from the previous Conservative Government. They are also 
well below the levels that we have seen in Scotland for a considerable time.</P><P>In 
the UK and in Scotland, our stable economic base provides us with the opportunity 
to resist some of the international challenges that our economy faces. Alex Neil 
raised the potential job losses that people face. I can give an example from my 
own constituency of Government policies that have helped to see people through 
economic difficulties. Major closures at Motorola and NEC resulted in thousands 
of job losses. Two years later, with the intervention of the Government and the 
strength of the Scottish economy, unemployment in my constituency currently stands 
at 3.1 per cent, which is exactly the same level at which it stood before the 
closures to which I referred.</P><P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Mr Muldoon 
is generous with his time. He referred to the stability of our economic context. 
Will he reflect on the fact that, since Labour came to power in 1999, our growth 
rate has been one third of our long-term trend rate, </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18041">18041</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>which is dreadful? Is he aware of Calgacus's statement to his troops about 
the Romans in Scotland, which was that they made a desert and called it peace? 
What the Executive calls stability is actually contraction.</P><P><strong>Bristow 
Muldoon: </strong>A higher number of people are in employment now than we have 
seen for a generation and interest rates are low.</P><P>I have another example 
of success&#151;let us talk about successes in Scotland. At the weekend, I read 
in the <em>Sunday Herald</em> that the second highest concentration of banking 
in Europe at the moment is not in Denmark, Ireland, or Sweden but in Scotland. 
Scotland comes ahead of France, Switzerland, Spain, Germany and many other large 
countries. Let us examine some of the successes as well as some of the problems 
that the Scottish economy has.</P><P>Undoubtedly the Scottish economy needs to 
diversify and we need to improve our growth rate. I welcome Mr Wilson's acknowledgement 
that the smart, successful Scotland strategy is the correct one for us to follow.</P><P>I 
will concentrate on one aspect of that strategy. I welcome in particular the Executive's 
investment in our transport infrastructure. The Conservatives' position on that 
matter is ludicrous because their party presided over economic decline in Scotland 
for 18 years and presided over the decline of our transport infrastructure for 
many years.</P><P><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Will Mr Muldoon give way?</P><P><strong>Bristow 
Muldoon: </strong>No. I am over my time.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: 
</strong>Mr Muldoon is over his time.</P><P><strong>Bristow Muldoon: </strong>Because 
of the interventions I have taken, I have not had the opportunity to comment in 
detail on the SNP's contribution to the debate. I would welcome a mature debate 
about our economic future and how we use our powers to enhance the Scottish growth 
rate, but let us have a debate about using those powers to enhance Scotland's 
prosperity rather than another arid constitutional debate.</P><P>11:53</P><P><strong>Fiona 
Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>Economic growth is not just an abstract that

<P>revenue, which in turn affects the amount that is available for public services. 
However, to acknowledge that truism simply at British state level is to fail to 
acknowledge the responsibilities that we have in Scotland to grow the economy 
to fund the future that I am sure we all desperately want for our children. Those 
who fail to address the issue of the powers that are needed for economic growth 
in Scotland are the ones who are wearing the constitutional blinkers.</P><P>I 
listened carefully to what the minister said. He concentrated on competition from 
the perspective of quality. For those of us who have worked in the private sector&#151;and 
not in legal practice, I might add&#151;quality is one aspect of competition, 
but to base a competition strategy purely and simply on quality is to ignore the 
other factors. Cost most definitely is another aspect of competition. We all know 
that we do not want to compete on a low-wage, low-skills basis, because that is 
not the future for Scotland. If competition is not based on the cost aspect, on 
what other aspect is it based? We must ensure that we can drive down the costs 
for businesses, but we can do that only if we have real economic powers for the 
Scottish Parliament.</P><P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I take Ms Hyslop's 
point, but her party has described certain parliamentary powers. In what way and 
to what degree does the SNP propose to drive down the tax burden on business with 
powers other than those that the Scottish Parliament already has?</P><P><strong>Fiona 
Hyslop: </strong>We must consider business rates under devolution&#151;my colleague 
Andrew Wilson spelled that out&#151;but we must also acknowledge that 70 per cent 
of the Scottish people want financial independence for the Scottish Parliament. 
It is not a crazy economic analysis, but one that is sensible and has public support.</P><P>I 
would like to take on David McLetchie's point. He gave a narrow-minded, doom-laden 
analysis of public investment, which was that public investment inhibits economic 
growth. However, we must remember that economic growth supports greater public 
investment. For every &#163;1 billion in the economy, the Government can raise an extra 
&#163;400 million in revenue. To me, one of the starkest statistics in the whole debate 
is that if Scotland had matched the modest growth of the UK since Labour came 
to power, there would have been &#163;2 billion more to invest in the public purse. 
Had we copied the Irish growth rates, there would have been &#163;30 billion more.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con)</strong> <em>rose&#151;</em></P><P><strong>Fiona

<P>and get better-paid employment; and it would have meant that in West Lothian, 
instead of waiting for a start date for the Bathgate to Airdrie line, such a line 
would be being built and would be opening up Scotland's infrastructure. We would 
be ensuring that we had a growth consensus.</P><P>Under devolution, there is a 
disincentive to taking on the growth agenda because, even if the smart, successful 
Scotland strategy was successful, the profits and benefits would not come directly 
to the Scottish Parliament, because they would go to Westminster in a greater 
tax take. If we were relying on performance-related pay, the Scottish Government 
would be giving money back to the public.</P><P>I say to Rhona Brankin that it 
is no good saying that, in a global downturn, we are better shielded by a greater 
union with England. That is counterproductive for the Executive. It reinforces 
how bad successive Tory and Labour Governments have been for the economy and means 
that the Scottish Government is not facing up to its responsibilities.</P><P>I 
detect in the minister's amendment some movement towards an open mind, to allow 
the factors and powers that we need to control to be identified. What business 
wants is not just political will from one party but political will and leadership 
from all parties. If we learn anything from any of our European competitors, it 
is that they succeed when they have a national consensus on growth. We have the 
opportunity to do that&#151;please grasp it and support our motion.</P><P>11:57</P><P><strong>Brian 
Fitzpatrick (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Lab): </strong>I never thought that it 
would be appropriate to do so, but given recent interventions, perhaps I should 
declare my membership of the Faculty of Advocates, and intimate that I do not 
particularly want to intrude in a fight between Standard Life and the Law Society 
of Scotland. I suspect that that might be dangerous territory.</P><P>I have always 
been a self-propelling business. If I worked, I ate and could spend; if I did 
not work, I did not earn. I suspect that most country solicitors have a keen awareness 
of their clients' needs and demands. Sometimes I think that being a constituency 
MSP is a bit like being a country solicitor.</P><P>I hoped that we might have 
seen in the debate some of what Andrew Wilson promised in part of his motion. 
Given that May is on the horizon, I suspect that that was probably too ambitious; 
it could not be sustained in what I think were supposed to be the helpful and 
supportive contributions from those sitting behind Mr Wilson.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18044">18044</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>We should try to focus on where we disagree and where we agree&#151;if not 
now or in the run-up to May, then thereafter. Therefore, I emphasise that I welcome 
what Andrew Wilson said in support of the smart, successful Scotland strategy. 
To be honest, I do not care where good ideas come from as long as they are moved 
on and put into practice. That should be the watchword for all of us, because 
the challenge of what we do under devolution is whether we add value or subtract 
value. Both are possible, and no one should argue otherwise. I suggest that we 
can do that through the policy drivers that are available to us. Andrew Wilson 
said that we can do only one thing. I hope that we all agree that we can do many 
things around the key policy drivers in the areas of health, skills, training, 
and higher and further education.</P><P>I suggest that there is unlikely to be 
much agreement about the figures on employment, unemployment and the like. I say 
to Alex Neil that I welcome the fact that, in my constituency, unemployment is 
currently at 2.5 per cent. People used to say that such a rate was impossible 
to sustain and that there was a natural rate of unemployment. I agree with Alex 
Neil that the low unemployment figures can mask other problems. I am conscious 
of the fact that, in some parts of my constituency, there are high-value-added, 
high-income, graduate jobs. The percentage of graduates in my constituency is 
higher than in any other part of the United Kingdom. However, there are people 
who are carrying out jobs that do not challenge them enough and do not pay them 
enough. At the same time, employers tell me that there are people whom they cannot 
employ because to call them employable is a bit of a joke. Some people show up 
for interviews with six gold earrings and a shell suit and think that, somehow, 
they are going to be given a job. That is because no one has ever taken the time 
to support them, to assist them into an understanding of what they need to do 
to get a job and to tell them what training is available. We can address those 
problems.</P><P>The real problem with the SNP's motion lies in the mystical, magical 
section in the middle. To understand what the SNP thinks the underlying problem 
is, we have to stop listening to Andrew Wilson, who wants to be nicey-nicey in 
the chamber, and start listening to Mr MacAskill, who preaches the SNP's gospel 
truth, which is, of course, the love that dare not speak its name, not even in 
the motion. I could have subscribed wholly to the aims of the motion if Andrew 
Wilson had had the courage to say what it is that he wants to speak about. I thought 
that SNP members would speak about independence today, because it is quite clear 
that that is what the middle part of the motion is about. However, for some odd 
reason </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18045">18045</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Andrew Wilson did not mention it. Could it be because the Confederation of 
British Industry, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Scottish Trades Union 
Congress are listening that he would rather whisper about it then tiptoe off quietly?</P><P><strong>Andrew 
Wilson: </strong>Rubbish.</P><P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: </strong>Mr Wilson 
says from a sedentary position that I am speaking rubbish. Let us have an open 
debate, but let us also have some honesty. Because that is lacking, I cannot support 
the motion, although I support some of the warm words and prescriptions that it 
contains.</P><P>12:01</P><P><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP): 
</strong>After Brian Fitzpatrick's comments, I wondered whether I should remove 
my earrings before speaking. However, I will not do so, as I quite like them.</P><P>I 
do not often agree with Brian Fitzpatrick, but I agreed with him when he said 
that it does not matter where good ideas come from&#151;what matters is that they 
are developed. That is absolutely correct. The problem is that good ideas that 
relate to dealing with symptoms will do nothing to address the core problem of 
the Scottish economy, which is low growth. As Andrew Wilson said, we have a shrinking 
economy&#151;even according to the Executive's figures, the economy grew by only 
a miserable 0.1 per cent in the past year.</P><P>Of course, that has a direct 
impact on our ability to invest in our services and in the communities where we 
live and work. I will relate that to the city of Dundee. Every &#163;1 billion that 
we could raise in the economy would give us another &#163;400 million in revenues to 
invest. A sluggish economy means higher unemployment&#151;in parts of Dundee, 
more than 7 per cent of males are unemployed. It also means low wages&#151;the 
Dundee weekly average wage is even lower than the Scottish average.</P><P>A debate 
on the economy is not an abstract or arid constitutional debate. The issue impacts 
directly on the fortunes of cities such as Dundee. Dundee's traditionally large 
manufacturing base has been hit hard by inappropriate monetary policy. Dundee 
has huge potential in new industries such as the digital media and biosciences. 
It has a higher output per capita than Scotland and the UK. However, it also has 
a declining population, numerous factory closures and large areas of deprivation 
with poor health records and a life expectancy that is lower than the Scottish 
average.</P><P>I believe that only by tackling the underlying cause of our economic 
malaise&#151;low growth&#151;will we be able to tackle the problems that the Dundee

<P>economy and the Scottish economy face. Low growth is bad for Scottish living 
standards. Of course, in order to tackle that problem, we need the powers to do 
so, which we do not have. This Parliament has only 8 per cent control over the 
economic levers. Compare that with other devolved institutions: the Parliament 
in Catalonia has 33 per cent control and the one in Quebec has 80 per cent control. 
We need to be able to tackle the problems in the Scottish economy with home-grown 
solutions, not solutions designed for someone else's problems.</P><P>Higher growth 
delivers a higher tax take and less dependency, which is the SNP's objective. 
We know that that will be good for the people of Dundee and for the people of 
Scotland.</P><P>12:05</P><P><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD): </strong>We 
would all agree that Andrew Wilson's call for a debate on Scotland's economic 
performance is legitimate and that we all need to work towards a consensus on 
what the solutions might be. A good number of members have made suggestions in 
that regard. Unfortunately, Andrew Wilson undermined his position when he declared 
that giving more powers to the Scottish Parliament was the only solution to all 
Scotland's economic ills. That destroyed any prospect of consensus about his motion. 
He provided no evidence to show why what he suggests would work in Scotland. It 
would be interesting to see whether giving more powers to the Scottish Parliament 
would solve the many well-documented problems that the Scottish economy faces.</P><P><strong>Andrew 
Wilson: </strong>Notwithstanding what Mr Lyon has just said, the Liberal Democrats' 
position seems to be&#151;from what Tavish Scott said&#151;that, in the election, 
they will suggest greater powers for the Scottish Parliament, which is in line 
with what I am saying. When specifically will we get those commitments and what 
might they be?</P><P><strong>George Lyon: </strong>Like everyone else, Mr Wilson 
will just have to wait and see what we will say in the election campaign. I am 
sure that he will not be disappointed. It would be interesting to hear what the 
SNP would do with the extra powers, which is the fundamental question.</P><P><strong>Brian 
Fitzpatrick: </strong>I am sure that, as some of us do, George Lyon speaks to 
Charles Kennedy. Would George Lyon like to share with Andrew Wilson details of 
the work that the Liberal Democrats at Westminster do in their shadow budget each 
and every time a budget is announced? Perhaps George Lyon could discuss with Mr 
Kennedy the paucity of such work from the Conservatives and the SNP&#151;four 
years and no work.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18047">18047</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>George Lyon: </strong>I agree with that point. On many occasions, I 
have said to Andrew Wilson that we are still awaiting his first shadow budget. 
I expect that we will wait in vain for one in the next four years, which he will 
also spend in opposition.</P><P>As I said, it would be interesting to see whether 
giving more powers to the Scottish Parliament would solve the many well-documented 
problems that the Scottish economy faces. Currently, the downturn in the world 
economic situation is causing weak demand in virtually every country. That is 
hitting the Scottish economy hard. Would more powers insulate us from that? I 
think not.</P><P>It is surprising that no one has mentioned the fact that our 
strong currency is one of the reasons why our exports are uncompetitive. A strong 
currency hits hard at our manufacturing and primary sectors. Would more powers 
solve that problem? No. Indeed, if Andrew Wilson had his way and we were separated 
from the rest of the UK, the problem would be even worse&#151;as a small oil-based 
economy, Scotland would have a strong currency, which would cause major problems 
for the rest of our industries. Tavish Scott and I were in Norway earlier in the 
year and saw that that was one of their fundamental concerns.</P><P>Our narrow 
economic base and our over-reliance on the electronics sector are further problems 
that would not be solved by our having more powers. We need to upskill our work 
force and to become more entrepreneurial. We must ensure that Scotland's industry 
moves up the value chain through the commercialisation of research in our universities. 
That is imperative. Do we need more powers to deliver those objectives? No. We 
have the powers to do so. If we examine the notion that all small independent 
countries must be doing better than Scotland, what do we find?</P><P><strong>Fiona

Denmark's was minus 0.7 per cent, Finland's was 0.5 per cent and Norway's was 
minus 0.2 per cent. The notion that a small independent county automatically enjoys 
growth is utter nonsense.</P><P><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Has Mr Lyon sat 
down because he has finished speaking or because he is giving way?</P><P><strong>George

<P>past 30 years, small European economies have significantly outgrown larger 
European economies? The larger economies have grown at only 2.6 per cent a year 
while the smaller ones have grown at 3.2 per cent a year. In Europe, in many ways, 
small is beautiful.</P><P><strong>George Lyon: </strong>The example of Ireland 
from independence in 1921 through to 1986 can be considered. The figures would 
not support the member's proposition at all.</P><P>I want to make some headway. 
The Scottish economy faces huge challenges, but the constitutional argument is 
a complete distraction from the serious issues that businesses in Scotland face. 
Andrew Wilson's glib soundbites that more tools in the box are the answer to our 
economic woes find little support from company boardrooms in Scotland. Businesses' 
priorities are clear. They want more investment in our transport infrastructure, 
better connectivity in Scotland and more investment in our skills base. They support 
the commercialisation of research in our universities; they want Scotland to move 
away from its over-reliance on screwdriver jobs and to move up the value chain. 
Most important, they want to widen our economic base, the narrowness of which 
is one of Scotland's fundamental problems.</P><P>It is clear that the biggest 
challenge lies in encouraging Scots to become more enterprising, more willing 
to take risks and more willing to set up their own businesses. Business recognises 
that challenge, which is huge. Even Andrew Wilson would acknowledge that there 
are no easy answers in that respect.</P><P>I have talked about the priorities 
of business and the coalition. There are huge challenges that cannot be solved 
overnight. There are no easy and glib answers to our fundamental economic problems. 
We will turn around our economy and ensure success only by sticking with the coalition's 
long-term strategy, as outlined in &quot;A Smart, Successful Scotland&quot;.</P><P>12:11</P><P><strong>Mr

Does she not understand that that has nothing to do with growth rates? There is 
already almost 20 per cent more public spending per head in Scotland. Kenny MacAskill 
nicely highlighted a difference. State intervention was his one contribution to 
the economy debate. That is where the SNP seems to come from. It fails to realise 
that, although the state has a role in the economy&#151;we all agree that it does&#151;that 
role is to provide highly skilled people for employment and to deal with the infrastructure 
for which it is responsible.</P><P>Everything comes down to one word that the 
SNP has not mentioned: profit. Profit is not a dirty word. I accept that taxation 
was mentioned.</P><P><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Mr 
Davidson: </strong>Not yet.</P><P>If profits are taxed, there is a choice about 
what that money will be spent on. The money must benefit many things, but it cannot 
be spent before it is made, as my colleague David McLetchie said. Growth and profit 
are needed, so that there can be taxes and public services, but those things cannot 
be out of kilter. There is a fine balance, but that has not been recognised today.</P><P><strong>Bristow 
Muldoon: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: 
</strong>Not yet.</P><P>Andrew Wilson asked whether we would agree with him, but 
we have not been told what he wants us to agree to. We want to hear the policy 
lines. Alex Neil, who is no longer in the chamber and has been remarkably subdued 
today, echoed what Andrew Wilson said about rates relief. Will Mr Wilson tell 
us exactly what the rates relief package would be, how much the SNP would be prepared 
to put into it and where the money would come from? All I can hear is a long silence.</P><P><strong>Andrew 
Wilson: </strong>The member has given way&#151;I love it when interventions are 
invited rather than given. The SNP's policies are clear. We want business rates 
below the prevailing United Kingdom level. The motion shows that we seek to put 
the economy at the heart of the debate. Perhaps finding agreement was too much 
to hope for. The question deserves to be put back to David Davidson. As far as 
I can tell from the Conservatives' amendment, their proposal to reduce business 
rates will cost in excess of a quarter of a billion pounds. Where will that money 
come from?</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>We have made our policy clear.

address and how we should address it&#151;perhaps the SNP could have asked us 
to join in. Brian Fitzpatrick made a good speech&#151;it was honest and open&#151;and 
I commend him for it. He is right. What is the point of members being asked to 
come to the chamber to debate the subject at the SNP's request&#151;it called 
the debate in its time&#151;if we have to listen to nothing? The SNP must spell 
out what it wants support for so that we can decide whether we agree with it and 
so that the public can have some faith in what is going on.</P><P>I look forward 
to hearing what Lewis Macdonald will come up with in his response. I suspect that 
we will hear much of what I heard on Monday morning at the Confederation of British 
Industry breakfast that we did together.</P><P>The fact of life is that the Government 
does not produce wealth. Government has a role in releasing business potential 
and creating an environment that encourages wealth and entrepreneurial activity. 
We have not heard from the SNP whether it wants a state-run economy or a marketplace, 
or whether it believes that there should be a mix. Will there be partnership between 
the public and private sectors? That is decidedly unclear from what the SNP has 
been saying over the past few weeks. To the SNP, it is always somebody else's 
fault; it is always nicer somewhere else. However, now that Ireland is perhaps 
dropping off and Sweden is dropping off, which country will be the SNP's next 
victim to use as evidence?</P><P>The debate has been a missed opportunity to spell 
out matters on which the parties might be able to agree. We agree that we need 
to improve the skills base in Scotland and we agree where the skills shortages 
are. We also agree that improvements must be made to the infrastructure, even 
though we might not have exactly the same priorities. We must spell out for the 
Scottish people the different means of delivering the successful economy that 
the Conservatives certainly believe in.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18051">18051</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>12:18</P><P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>From the Executive's point of 
view, the objective is clear: an economy that is based on competitive advantages. 
The advantages will be a highly skilled and flexible work force, a culture of 
enterprise and support for innovation. Those are the only ways in which to bring 
our productivity levels up to and beyond those that obtain elsewhere and to achieve 
sustained economic growth. I hope that we can build a consensus around our strategy 
for a smart, successful Scotland, although it is clear from the debate that that 
will be easier in some aspects of policy than in others.</P><P>We are rolling 
out our strategy for the medium to long term, while delivering the things that 
matter to business now. Our strategy is not based on promoting Scotland as a cheaper 
place in which to do business, although we certainly compete already on those 
terms; it is based on science and skills. Driving down costs is fine&#151;any 
business will seek to do that&#151;but undercutting the competition is not the 
primary basis on which Scotland will compete in the wider world.</P><P>I recognise 
the difficulties that sectors of the Scottish economy have faced in the recent 
past and the impact of global economic conditions on many of our exporters. We 
were hit particularly hard in the last reported quarter by the restructuring of 
the electronics sector, which has become so important to the wider economy in 
recent years.</P><P>Of course, I regret last week's announcement by Boots of its 
intention to close its manufacturing plant in Airdrie over the next two years. 
Our immediate priority in that case is to ensure that everything possible is done 
to assist the people who are likely to lose their jobs. Job losses are always 
regrettable, but, compared with a few short years ago, the Lanarkshire economy 
and labour market is now buoyant. As Bristow Muldoon said in reference to West 
Lothian, those who are affected can, with the right support, move quickly into 
other jobs or training.</P><P>Alex Neil raised some important points, but I disagree 
profoundly with his attempt to talk down the importance to the Scottish economy 
of increased employment. Today's labour market figures show that the number of 
jobs increased by 47,000 in the last quarter of 2002. Not just on the claimant 
count, but on the International Labour Organisation count, unemployment is down 
to just above 150,000, which means that unemployment in Scotland is lower than 
unemployment in London. I would not suggest for a moment that the gain in jobs 
is a ground for complacency, but I reject the suggestion that employment, interest 
rate and inflation levels are irrelevant to economic growth.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18052">18052</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

the heart of the Government's approach. The reality for many people in Lanarkshire

Perhaps Adam Ingram will tell us what his plans on business rates would cost the

entitled to know which of those measures the other parties intend to sacrifice. 
No doubt we will find out, if not today, at least in the next few weeks.</P><P>We 
welcome the debate and the drive for consensus, which we have led. We have no 
interest in arguing about the source of good ideas; we want good ideas and we 
will apply them with whatever support we can obtain. Our focus is on implementing 
our policies and strategies and on the effectiveness of those policies in boosting 
the Scottish economy.</P><P>We are also focused on using our present powers. We 
do not see any purpose in being distracted by arguments about powers that the 
Parliament does not possess. We are not prepared to jeopardise any part of our 
strategy in pursuit of quick headlines, but we are keen to ensure that our strategy 
is applied fully. We have a coherent, focused and balanced set of policies for 
achieving economic growth in Scotland in the years ahead. We will work to increase 
our policies' impact in partnership with business and any political party that 
chooses to support us in our objectives.</P><P>12:24</P><P><strong>Mr Adam Ingram 
(South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Occasional observers of these debates and 
even some of the participants would be forgiven for experiencing a certain amount 
of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu today. From the SNP benches, the case for the expansion 
of the Parliament's economic and financial powers to stimulate economic growth 
and to release our potential as a nation has again been presented with vigour 
and clarity, despite the cloth ears of the Tories. From the not-so-serried ranks 
of the unionists, we have had the usual sneering, scornful rejection of anything 
other than the status quo&#151;witness the contributions from Annabel Goldie, 
Rhona Brankin and others.</P><P>To be fair, other members have raised the tenor 
of the debate, so I shall deal with some of the points that were raised. The Deputy 
Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning claims that cutting business 
taxes will have a negative impact on public revenues. Cutting taxes stimulates 
economic activity, expanding the tax base and increasing revenues. That has been 
the experience of a host of small European countries over the past 10 years. Greece, 
Ireland, Finland, Denmark, Portugal and Sweden have cut corporation taxes by half, 
but corporation tax take has increased by 87 per cent in those countries.</P><P><strong>David 
McLetchie: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Mr Ingram: </strong>No, 
I will not give way.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18054">18054</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Tavish Scott, who I am sorry is no longer in the chamber, indicated that the 
development of Liberal Democrat thinking on transferring powers to the Parliament 
related to a federal future, although George Lyon directly contradicted that. 
Perhaps the Liberals will tell us whether they will be pushing for such powers 
as part of their negotiating position with future coalition partners. The Scottish 
public are entitled to know the Liberals' position before the elections.</P><P><strong>Brian 
Fitzpatrick: </strong>I wonder whether the member can help with a genuine point 
of information. Andrew Wilson said that the SNP recognises that the symptoms of 
economic underperformance cannot be dealt with until the root cause is addressed 
directly. Is he referring to independence? If so, the consensus that he calls 
for is based on a false premise. If we are to have open, honest and perhaps on-our-feet 
debate, we should not seek to build it on a false consensus. We should recognise 
that there are differences, which are part of democratic politics, and we should 
have the debate.</P><P><strong>Mr Ingram: </strong>We are arguing for more powers 
for the Scottish Parliament. Different parties might take different positions 
on the powers that are required. I reiterate that the SNP is in favour of independence 
and of assuming all the independent powers that Chancellor Brown currently exercises.</P><P>More 
seasoned and discerning observers of these debates will notice that areas of agreement 
and even consensus are emerging in our analysis and in policy prescription. We 
can all agree on measures designed to develop the skills base of our work force, 
to internationalise our business and to increase research and development and 
innovation, especially in the knowledge economy. All those measures are necessary 
to improve productivity and to increase competitiveness. However, we should also 
be aware that they will not be sufficient to achieve the step change in competitiveness 
that we need to boost our long-term growth rate to the UK level, never mind to 
the level of other small European countries.</P><P>It is a step forward that the 
minister is now prepared to accept publicly that low growth is the fundamental 
problem, even if he and his colleagues remain in denial about the fact that the 
only way in which to effect the necessary changes involves the Parliament's assumption 
of the fiscal powers that the Chancellor of the Exchequer currently exercises.</P><P><strong>George

more powers. I ask him to name all the powers that he wants. What is it that the

<P><strong>Mr Ingram: </strong>We want the Scottish Parliament to have all the 
fiscal powers that the Chancellor of the Exchequer exercises.</P><P>I want to 
move on. Contrary to what Labour propaganda would have us believe, Gordon Brown 
has not turned round the Scottish economy, which is neither strong nor stable 
in comparison with the economies of our competitors. We have consistently had 
lower growth and higher unemployment than the British average. We have also had 
much lower population growth than England has had. That low population growth 
has turned into absolute decline. Those are hard, incontrovertible facts.</P><P>The 
Scottish economy is not stable; it is not in a state of equilibrium. That has 
been the case for decades and the fact that it continues to be the case is evidenced 
by the constant drain of capital and labour out of this country, mostly as a result 
of the huge pulling power of London and the south-east of England. We can educate 
and train our people as much as we like but, if we fail to generate our own economic 
magnetism by exercising the full fiscal powers of an independent Parliament, the 
self-perpetuating spiral of decline will remain unchecked and our best and brightest 
people will continue to leave us. At the moment, 10 per cent of Scottish graduates 
from Scottish universities get their first job outside Scotland. That is where 
our entrepreneurs go. We still produce entrepreneurs, but they have to go elsewhere 
to fulfil their ambitions.</P><P>There are few policy levers that can give us 
the step change in competitiveness that we need to break out of our decline. Winning 
the power to set and change our tax rates across the whole economy is the key 
to turning round our historic underperformance under Westminster rule. The sooner 
we all sign up to that goal, the sooner we will be able to get on with the job.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18056">18056</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

notes the contribution made over the years by groups such as the TAG Theatre Company, 
7:84, Borderline, Theatre in Education and TWE Edinburgh; further notes the looming 
funding crisis for repertory theatre, especially the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh; 
notes that unless funding equivalent to the funding available to theatre in England 
and Wales is made available, there will be a drift of talent southwards that will 
result in the ability of professional theatre to survive in Scotland being undermined 
in the near future.</P><P>12:33</P><P><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green): 
</strong>I must first declare my interests as a member of Equity, a patron of 
Forth Children's Theatre and Sounds of Progress and a member of the board of the 
Traverse Theatre. I also hope to join the board of the Communicado Theatre Company 
in the near future.</P><P>The support of public institutions for the arts, which 
until recently was characterised by relative apathy, is now characterised by relative 
complacency. The gap between those two attitudes has not been filled by anything 
that could justify the optimistic view that the Executive and local government 
in Scotland appear to take. The Deputy Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport 
no doubt has a prepared response that reflects such complacency. If nothing else, 
I hope to disabuse her of the idea that that position is tenable or justified.</P><P>Since 
I lodged my motion, Scottish theatre funding has hardly been out of the headlines. 
The theatre community in Scotland has no argument with the Scottish Arts Council&#151;nor 
do I. Indeed, I pay tribute to the outspoken energy of James Boyle, who is the 
chairman of the Scottish Arts Council.</P><P>I want to clarify a few points. Funding 
for mainstream theatre has still not increased. In fact, core funding has more 
or less been at a standstill for the past two years. As this is a members' business 
debate, I make no apology for drawing the Executive's attention to problems that 
are faced by two theatres in the area that I represent&#151;the Royal Lyceum Theatre 
Company and the Traverse Theatre.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18057">18057</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The SAC has told the Executive that per-head funding for theatre in Scotland 
is roughly equivalent to that in England and Wales. That might or might not be 
so. I am sure that the minister has the relevant figure to hand. Equity has three 
yardsticks for testing whether the new Arts Council of England money is being 
put to proper use: larger casts, longer rehearsals and more new productions. I 
have no news from any Scottish theatre that it will be able to afford any of those.</P><P>Equity 
hopes that the boost will produce those advances, but the position in Scotland 
is causing great concern. This year, average funding for a grade 1 theatre will 
rise to &#163;1,358,000 in England and to &#163;1,346,000 in Wales. We can see how big the 
difference is between the two funding positions when we consider that each of 
Scotland's two grade 1 theatres currently receives approximately &#163;0.5 million 
per annum less than that.</P><P>Let me move on to deal with local authority funding. 
The Traverse Theatre, which is Scotland's leading new writers' theatre, received 
a paltry &#163;43,000 from the City of Edinburgh Council for 2002-03. That places it 
right at the bottom of the funding list. By comparison, the Tron Theatre Company 
and the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow received &#163;103,000 and &#163;475,000 respectively, 
whereas the Eden Court Theatre in Inverness received &#163;0.5 million or more from 
local authority funds. It is clear that both the Royal Lyceum Theatre Company 
and the Traverse Theatre are facing genuine financial hardship.</P><P>Theatres 
throughout Scotland have been calling for funds to help deal with the creeping 
crisis that has developed as a result of recent years of standstill funding and 
effective cutbacks. In some cases, the problems date back to the unfortunate results 
of local authority reorganisation. Only last year, there was a united call for 
extra funding to help resolve entrenched on-going problems and to fund a national 
theatre organisation. We are pleased that the Executive has at last recognised 
the crisis and has diverted money that was originally destined to set up a national 
theatre organisation to support existing theatres, such as Dundee Rep and the 
Byre Theatre in St Andrews.</P><P>This year, following a &#163;25 million investment 
in England and Wales, Equity and the Theatrical Management Association have agreed 
a 17 per cent increase in the previously appallingly low wages of Equity members. 
The agreement covers the whole of the UK, so Scottish theatres will also be required 
to foot the extra bill. The Scottish theatres have no alternative and, anyway, 
the deal has met with unanimous approval. The money has been found temporarily 
by raiding the funds that were set aside for a national theatre and by the Scottish 
Arts Council's juggling some of its core </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18058">18058</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>and lottery funding. However, it is important to recognise that that is not 
a long-term solution but an emergency measure to shore things up for the immediate 
future.</P><P>The reason for having a national theatre organisation in the first 
place was to stop the drift southwards of writers, producers and actors and to 
deliver top-quality work throughout Scotland that would link into schools and 
communities. The national theatre organisation was also to mount ambitious main-stage 
productions. The health of all of Scottish theatre depends very much on supporting 
the top of the tree to the fullest extent.</P><P>The theatre community takes extremely 
seriously its role in education outreach, particularly in poor and geographically 
remote communities. It is unfortunate that that vital work is under most threat 
when money is tight. There are very little box office returns from outreach and 
educational work. As a consequence, such work relies heavily on cross-subsidies.</P><P>Let 
me give the Executive a couple of reasonable comparisons. If we include national 
museums, libraries and Historic Scotland, we give 0.7 per cent of our budget to 
culture. Finland, which has a similar population, gives 0.9 per cent of the state 
budget, whereas Denmark gives 1 per cent of its national budget. The raw figures 
work out at &#163;161 million for Scotland, &#163;175 million for Finland and &#163;350 million 
for Denmark. In all three countries, local authorities also make a huge contribution, 
but it is absolutely clear that, however one juggles the figures, Scotland comes 
out poorly when one compares the state, local and absolute levels of support for 
the arts in general and for the theatre in particular. Sweden is another country 
that puts enormous value on supporting culture and the theatre.</P><P>We must 
recognise that Scotland has three poverty problems: straightforward financial 
poverty; environmental poverty, particularly in our worst urban areas; and a poverty 
of mind and spirit, which extends into all levels of national and local government. 
We must recognise that the third of those failings can, and must, be addressed 
within the term of the next Scottish Parliament. Let us have no more talk about 
cities of culture until we put more of our national money where our mouth is. 
There are cities in Europe that have bigger budgets than does the Scottish Arts 
Council. We should be ashamed of ourselves.</P><P>If we ask whether we can afford 
to treble the subsidy to the arts, I suggest that we are already asking the wrong 
question. We should be saying that there must be a way to find those vital funds. 
It is a trifling sum of money compared with what we spend on other budgets. [<em>Interruption.</em>]</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18059">18059</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>May I say&#151;gently&#151;to 
the people applauding in the galleries that this is not a public meeting. We do 
not allow applause in the Parliament because it might lead to boos on other occasions.</P><P>12:40</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I congratulate Robin Harper on achieving 
the debate. I declare an interest as a director of the board of the 2000 &amp; 
3 Estaites Ltd theatre company.</P><P>Robin Harper has expressed well, eloquently 
and accurately some of the problems facing Scottish theatre and Scottish culture. 
Most disturbing is the Scottish Executive's response to all those questions. Time 
and again, the Scottish Executive attempts to make a virtue out of having created 
a crisis. The problems within Scottish theatre, as within Scottish culture, arise 
from that long-term failure to support Scottish culture, by the Executive and 
its predecessor Westminster Governments.</P><P>The situation with Scottish theatre 
is particularly stark. I was struck by the Scottish Arts Council briefing, which 
I find somewhat disingenuous. We can juggle the figures, but any increases that 
are going into Scottish theatre, no matter how small, are going there only by 
sacrificing part of the whole.</P><P>I do not regard the national theatre as an 
idea that has still to be achieved. I regard it as something to which there is 
an overwhelming commitment agreed by every party in the chamber, and endorsed 
by the Education, Culture and Sport Committee. The national theatre exists; it 
simply has to be funded. The Executive made proposals to fund the national theatre. 
Each year between 2003 and 2006, it would get &#163;1 million. However, the Executive 
knew that the steering group for the national theatre in Scotland&#151;tremendously 
well chaired by Donald Smith&#151;had proposed a different set of figures. Those 
figures are for the minimal requirement.</P><P>However, the Executive made a financial 
commitment. It walked away from that commitment time after time. Any increases 
that are available to Scottish theatre next year&#151;and they are minimal&#151;are 
coming from money that should be used for the national theatre. It is not an either/or 
situation.</P><P>The Executive has also forced good people from the theatre community 
to make that choice by putting them on either side of the debate. It is a choice 
between existing with the jobs that they have, and doing less, and welcoming something 
that would top out the provision of theatre in Scotland, which would deepen and 
enrich and </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18060">18060</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>which would feed back new work and new activity. That is something that everyone 
in Scotland wants.</P><P>It is particularly tragic that after the long debate 
leading up to publication of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee's report, 
we managed to get a consensus among the members of the Scottish theatre community 
for the first time ever. The national theatre should be funded as part of that 
complete and complex package. Having got that agreement, the Executive has sought 
to divide and rule ever since. It has told people that they cannot have money 
because it would not leave any money for the core work.</P><P>I notice that Robin 
Harper is agreeing with me and the minister is disagreeing. I know what the members 
of the theatre community and the arts community are saying. Robin Harper will 
confirm it. The Executive has a policy of divide and rule and it is damaging in 
the short, medium and long term for theatre in Scotland.</P><P>We need to make 
a commitment. After the mess that the Executive has made of cultural funding in 
the past four years, and of the ludicrous national cultural strategy, we need 
a fresh start. We need to make amends for the mistakes that have been made.</P><P>We 
can do that quite easily. We can have an urgent baseline review of the arts in 
Scotland after 1 May. We can consider our nation's cultural requirements. We can 
debate the figures that Robin Harper has brought to the chamber and we can set 
our cultural priorities. Then we can plan properly for the future.</P><P>A core 
part of those plans will be the national theatre with national companies being 
funded directly by the Government. We now need that national debate. After years 
of cutting, sparing and pinching pennies, after years of confusion from the Executive 
and its predecessors, the time is right for a fresh start in Scottish culture.</P><P>Robin 
Harper's motion is correct, and although it will not be voted on, it should be 
supported by the chamber. We should no longer listen to the excuses and evasions 
of the Executive because, frankly, it has failed Scotland in these matters and 
in so many more.</P><P>12:45</P><P><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab): </strong>I

Company or Glasgow's Citizens Theatre, or through smaller spaces such as the Traverse 
Theatre, which gives </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18061">18061</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>young aspiring playwrights an opportunity to showcase new work. I have had 
the privilege as an MSP to work alongside Tag Theatre Company in its work with 
children through its Parliament project. That was a great project. Many other 
MSPs also had that opportunity.</P><P>We have great playwrights in Scotland, be 
they established writers such as John Clifford, increasingly recognised playwrights 
such as David Greig, or new young playwrights such as Isabel Wright, whose most 
recent work I saw last night at the Traverse.</P><P>While I am happy to speak 
about Scottish theatre all day, I must disagree with Robin Harper's motion. Come 
on, Robin. Let us be fair about this. One would think from his motion that we 
were seeing a complete meltdown in Scottish theatre. We are not seeing that. Let 
us set out the facts on the table. Let us get the facts right. On a per capita 
basis, the increase in funding for drama in Scotland compares favourably with 
that in England. That is a fact.</P><P>That is not to say that there are no problems 
in the sector. Robin Harper mentioned some of them. The trend in the number of 
productions performed by each theatre has declined. That has been compounded by 
significant increases in the wages of actors and stage management&#151;quite rightly, 
and I agree with that. However, there are significant increases in funding. The 
Scottish Arts Council has achieved a total increase of 42 per cent for the theatre 
sector for the next two years, although I recognise that that will take some time 
to impact on the sector.</P><P>We have to remain firmly committed to the concept 
of a national theatre. There is a consensus on that. However, I recognise that 
the Scottish Arts Council's decision to ensure that regional theatre is put on 
a sure footing before we fund a national theatre is sensible. I ask the minister 
to restate the commitment to a national theatre. It is a centrepiece of our national 
cultural strategy. A huge amount of work has been done by the Scottish theatre 
community on the plan for a Scottish national theatre. Let us get on with it. 
Let us do it.</P><P>12:48</P><P><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) 
(Con): </strong>I should also declare my interest as a board member of 2000 &amp; 
3 Estaites.</P><P>I congratulate Robin Harper on securing the debate. It is a 
necessary debate, because the arts in Scotland face a real predicament. We have 
not had a statement on which we could question the minister. We have not had a 
debate so far. Questions that have been asked have received evasive answers, so 
I welcome the debate.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18062">18062</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The debate is necessary because over the past few years&#151;since 2001-02&#151;we 
have seen a real-terms cut in Scottish Arts Council funding, from &#163;37.7 million 
to &#163;35.5 million next year. That is in real terms, using 2001 prices that are 
published and available. Of course the result, as we saw at the recent Scottish 
Arts Council meeting, is to freeze national company income and cut Scottish Opera 
income, and then to raid yet again the money that was earmarked for a national 
theatre company. Fundamentally, that is a flawed approach. The reality is that 
the delivery of a national theatre company has been substantially undermined, 
to the point where I believe that it is difficult to foresee it being delivered 
by the Executive, even if it is re-elected at the forthcoming elections.</P><P>The 
credibility of the Executive with regard to a national theatre company is shot 
to pieces. The ministers' reputations are in tatters, for they alone of all the 
culture ministers we have had in the Executive have presided over a real-terms 
cut in their department's budget. That information comes from official figures.</P><P><strong>The 
Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Mike Watson): </strong>The member is 
not very good at counting.</P><P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>I happen to have 
the figures with me.</P><P>Having won the debate on the need for a national theatre 
and obtained the cross-party support that Mike Russell talked about, we are in 
danger of having to revisit that debate. Every time that funding for a national 
theatre is cut, we must revisit the idea behind a national theatre and justify 
expenditure again.</P><P>The case for a national theatre company is clear. It 
is built on commissioning work from existing theatre companies, investing more 
in them, helping them to achieve perfection and driving up the quality of their 
work. A national theatre company would use work such as Theatre Babel's &quot;Medea&quot; 
and the Royal Lyceum Theatre Company's recent success with &quot;The Prime of 
Miss Jean Brodie&quot; and take it internationally. People who have made themselves 
known are willing to provide money for a national theatre company, but not for 
regional theatres.</P><P>As the national theatre company's budget has been raided 
twice, we must revisit the argument. What can be done? In the short term, the 
Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport could review his budget and find the money. 
That remains possible, even at this late stage. The minister must also argue for 
additional funding from the Executive's budgets. Recently, a saving of &#163;3 million 
from the advertising budget was announced. Such savings could be reallocated to 
a national theatre and the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18063">18063</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Scottish Arts Council. I would close the Scotland Office and remove Helen Liddell 
from her job. I would rather have more thespians than politicians, but that is 
not for this Parliament to deliver.</P><P>We must ensure that we need not debate 
theatre funding next year. In the longer term, we must find solutions that leverage 
more money from the private sector into theatre and arts generally. We cannot 
rely on state funding, because it cannot always be delivered. That puts Scotland's 
culture at peril. We must change our ways. I look forward to hearing how the minister 
will change his ways.</P><P>12:52</P><P><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) 
(LD): </strong>I congratulate Robin Harper on securing the debate and on his speech, 
which was the best that I have heard him give.</P><P>The ministers who are responsible 
for the arts are not to blame&#151;Scotland has traditionally undervalued the 
arts. We have a huge backlog of investment to clear. We need more investment. 
Ministers, who I am sure are committed to the arts, could persuade the Government 
machine, which is less committed, that investment in the arts is helpful.</P><P>Other 
members have made some of the points that I will make. Quality of life affects 
everything. If people are happier, they will work harder and make more money, 
which is what people seem to be interested in. If we had good national dramas 
and good national companies were scattered about Scotland, that would increase 
national self-confidence. At the local level, community drama and learning about 
drama in schools would increase self-confidence. Drama is good for self-confidence, 
which it is regrettable that many Scots lack.</P><P>A good arts facility attracts 
entrepreneurs: Japanese businessmen might set up in Edinburgh because they like 
golf, opera and theatre. Investment in the arts has a good cash value and educational 
value. Many people learn much more from acting in a play than they do in a classroom, 
and they can continue to learn as adults. Such investment would mean savings in 
police budgets and a reduction in crime, for example.</P><P>We must invest more. 
An issue in theatre is the pay increase in the English regional companies, which 
are roughly equivalent to our large city companies. The English companies have 
an advantage and will be able to pay wages that we cannot.</P><P>We must pursue 
the national theatre idea. I accept the line that the minister and the Scottish 
Arts Council advance: that if we are setting out to build the Parthenon and have 
designed some </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18064">18064</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>lovely pillars, we must have a foundation or the whole thing will fall down. 
There is also not much value in having a nice site like the Acropolis, building 
the foundations and not building the pillars. We have to have the foundations, 
but we also have to have the pillars&#151;to do otherwise is to waste our time.</P><P>As 
others have said, the idea of the national theatre is to build on the existing 
companies and invest in them so that they can provide bigger, better-rehearsed 
productions and tour them around the country. In the years that I was involved 
in the Royal Lyceum Theatre Company, I could never understand why really good 
projects that the Lyceum and the other big theatre companies produced could not 
be toured around the country for the benefit of all.</P><P>We know what the national 
theatre is aiming at: somehow, we have to find the money for it. I urge ministers 
to fight their corner even harder than I am sure they have fought already to get 
the money and direct it towards the overall improvement of the quality of life 
in Scotland through the theatre.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>We 
move on to three-minute speeches. I call Lloyd Quinan.</P><P>12:55</P><P><strong>Mr 
Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I need to declare an interest. 
I was a member of Equity for 20 years. I am the ex-associate director of the Scottish 
Theatre Company, which was one of the attempts to create a national company in 
this country. I was also associate director of the Traverse Theatre and the artistic 
director of United Artists Scotland. I am one of the people who had to leave the 
theatre because of underfunding. To some degree, this is groundhog day for me, 
as I have been having this debate since I left college in 1978.</P><P>I want to 
talk about theatre workers, which is an issue that should be of concern to members 
of the Labour party. It is theatre workers who subsidise theatre: not the Scottish 
Arts Council and not the Scottish Executive. It is the theatre workers, their 
families and children who subsidise theatre through the low levels of theatre 
workers' salaries and wages. They also suffer the insecurity of short-term contracts, 
which can prevent them from being able to get mortgages or credit of any kind. 
We are happy to go and watch them, but we will not pay them properly.</P><P>In 
Scotland, many actors were able to work in the theatre in the 1970s, 1980s and 
early 1990s because of the existence of a fairly lively television drama production 
scene, which we no longer have. Today, actors may be asked to go and work in an 
ensemble piece that is being produced by </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18065">18065</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the BBC on the banks of the river Clyde at &#163;500 per episode. If they are on 
housing benefit and do that one episode in one week of their life, they risk losing 
their benefit. There are actors right across this country who cannot afford to 
take work in the theatre because they have families.</P><P>I have not even mentioned 
the many hundreds of writers, designers and lighting designers who also live in 
that same world of insecurity&#151;in fact, writers probably have it worst of 
all. We have a canon of writing in this country that is seldom treated with the 
same respect that the canon of writing in any other European country is given.</P><P>Iceland, 
which has a population of less than 400,000, has a national theatre that is open 
51 weeks of the year. It is an ensemble company of 35 actors with a supporting 
directorial, music and production staff and a canon of work that has been developed 
practically since 1901 or 1902.</P><P>Why is it that we cannot have in Scotland 
what an island on the edge of the Arctic is capable of giving to the world? The 
National Theatre of Iceland tours the world on a regular basis. It is recognised 
and respected while Scotland continues to have the same debate that we were having 
in 1978 when I left college.</P><P>I accept what Donald Gorrie said. It is not 
the fault of these particular ministers, but if they do not do something it will 
be their fault. To paraphrase Irvine Welsh, to be a Scottish actor is shite.</P><P>12:59</P><P><strong>Ian 
Jenkins (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD): </strong>I, too, am a director 
of the 3 Estaites. As others have done, I congratulate Robin Harper on bringing 
the debate to the chamber. I agree broadly with the drift of the contributions 
that we have had so far.</P><P>I do not want to become overly involved in the 
detail and the figures involved in funding and funding deficits or to indulge 
in attacks on ministers. Mike Watson has a strong and commendable personal track 
record in supporting the Scottish Youth Theatre. He has promoted its cause with 
vigour and zeal. I also know that the deputy minister's work in the Convention 
of Scottish Local Authorities is well regarded.</P><P>It is clear to everybody 
that the theatre in Scotland needs to be funded on a more secure and sustainable 
basis. Nobody would disagree with that.</P><P>I am convinced that, across Executive 
ministries, parties and the Parliament, we must make more effort to recognise 
the importance of the arts in general in the life of Scotland at local, regional, 
national and international level. Especially today in this debate, we recognise 
the potential of the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18066">18066</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>theatre to enrich the lives of the individuals who fall under its spell. To 
me, the theatre is a special place where we have a multiplicity of talent; there, 
we can share experiences with others and wonderful, memorable things take place 
before our very eyes. The theatre brings together the talents of writers, directors, 
actors, designers and musicians. It can surprise and excite us and, at best, it 
promises enchantment, enrichment and enhancement of our lives.</P><P>As politicians, 
we can talk sincerely and with real justification about social inclusion&#151;I 
have spoken before about the work of Dundee repertory theatre in that regard. 
We can argue for the theatre on the basis of its importance for tourism and economics; 
there are times when that argument is needed. However, we should always have in 
our minds the ways in which theatre can bring inspiration, vision and insight 
into our lives. As policy makers, we must have a vision of the ethos that we wish 
to create in Scotland, to foster creativity in the arts. We need the kind of vision 
that brought us the Edinburgh festival and saw the possibility of staging &quot;Ane 
Satyre of the Thrie Estaites&quot; and other wonderful acting performances in 
this very arena.</P><P>My theatre visits began with the entertainers in Rothesay, 
where I saw comedians such as Chic Murray. I later saw Shakespeare productions 
in Stratford, great Scottish theatrical events such as 7:84's production of &quot;The 
Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil&quot;, and Bill Bryden's &quot;Willie 
Rough&quot; and his portrayals of the first world war and of the shipyard workers 
of Greenock.</P><P>I have a list of individual cases that I would have liked to 
mention. Indeed, I have spent time on this subject because my life has been enriched 
by the theatre. We cannot measure such experiences in pounds, shillings and pence 
or treat the arts as tick-box, readily measurable commodities. As a nation, we 
must recognise and acknowledge the value of the kind of vision, inspiration and 
social commentary that the theatre can offer us.</P><P>I conclude by quoting from 
James Boyle's article in <em>The Scotsman</em> on Monday:</P><P>&quot;Above all, 
encourage great ideas and great writing that will break through theatre walls 
and create excitement with performance in new spaces and in the open air. Archive 
all the performances and give them to schools. Bring great stars to Scotland. 
Go for broke: create glamour, romance, thrills...</P><P>Let's have the national 
theatre and let's have the full funding stream. The arts will repay the country 
in full measure.&quot;</P><P>I agree with that final comment.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18067">18067</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>13:02</P><P><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>I thank Robin 
Harper for securing this debate. I am not a member of any theatre board and I 
certainly do not have Lloyd Quinan's experience, but I am very fortunate to come 
from a family that talked about the theatre a lot and, from the age of two, I 
was taken to theatres such as the Panopticon, the Alhambra, the Pavilion and the 
Kings. I am greatly interested in the theatre: it has certainly brought great 
joy and I have taken my own children along to it.</P><P>The country needs alternative, 
satirical and thought-provoking theatre that is properly funded. For example, 
last Friday, I attended a performance of 7:84's excellent production of Dario 
Fo's &quot;Can't Pay? Won't Pay!&quot; More people should be able to get out and 
about and see such productions.</P><P>Robin Harper touched on the important issue 
of community theatre. On Rhona Brankin's point about funding, I should tell her 
that, at Christmas, I attended a performance of Team Pinewood's excellent pantomime 
in Drumchapel, which involved all the kids, parents, teachers and so on from five 
to 55 years old. David Bell must be thanked for his work on that production. However, 
the company is about to fold due to lack of funding.</P><P>As for other theatre 
companies, I must congratulate David Wallace for starting up PACE Theatre Company&#151;indeed, 
I was involved in that myself through Renfrewshire Council. However, although 
the company has become one of the biggest wee theatre companies in the whole of 
Scotland, it is also desperately short of funds.</P><P>Lloyd Quinan mentioned 
theatre hands and their families and the fact that they have to work for very 
little money. I should remind Rhona Brankin that, not so long ago, the Citizens 
Theatre had to close down between September and November because it could not 
pay anyone in the company. There is a shortfall in funding for the theatre and 
the arts in Scotland.</P><P>It would be very sad if the Parliament let great theatre 
companies such as TAG, Borderline, 7:84 and other community theatres such as I 
have already mentioned go to the wall for lack not so much of funding as of support 
from the Scottish Parliament and the Executive.</P><P>I call on the Parliament 
and Executive to consider the figures already quoted and to please support the 
local arts. They bring a great joy to people and they help to give us our Scottish 
identity and culture.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Dr 
Elaine Murray will respond to the debate on behalf of the Executive. You have 
seven minutes, minister.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18068">18068</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>13:05</P><P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Dr 
Elaine Murray): </strong>I congratulate Robin Harper on securing the debate and 
on giving us an opportunity to respond to members' concerns on a number of issues 
and not only the text of the motion.</P><P>In view of his rather snide comment 
about prepared speeches, I reassure Robin Harper that I prepare my own notes from 
various bits of advice that I get from officials, so he can blame me if he does 
not like my speech.</P><P>It is unfortunate that there seems to be a tendency 
to concentrate only on the negative at the moment. Contrary to the impression 
given by some sections of Scotland's media, Scotland's theatre is very strong. 
That is not to say that it is without its problems, but Scotland's theatre is 
successful. We should spend more time thinking about those successes and being 
proud of them and not just talk about the problems of funding.</P><P>Rhona Brankin 
was correct to draw attention to some of the fine playwrights we have at the moment. 
There were eight nominations of Scottish companies at the Barclay Awards and three 
of the successful four were theatre companies. As Brian Monteith mentioned, there 
have been sell-out runs of &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; at the Royal 
Lyceum Theatre. There is also the Traverse Theatre's 40<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary 
programme. The fact that companies south of the border are looking to recruit 
some of our top directors is a demonstration of how successful some of those people 
have been rather than a cause for complaint and dissent.</P><P>Much has been made 
of comparisons between theatre funding in Scotland and in England. Rhona Brankin 
is correct&#151;the levels of funding per head of population are similar.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Quinan: </strong>Will the minister give way?</P><P><strong>Dr Murray: </strong>No, 
I would like to continue.</P><P>There has been a 33 per cent increase in theatre 
funding from 2002 to 2004&#151;16 per cent last year and 17 per cent this year. 
Twenty-three core funded organisations received almost &#163;7 million from the Scottish 
Arts Council. The Arts Council of England is bringing up its support to &#163;70 million 
a year. Given that England has 10 times the population of Scotland, similar amounts 
of money are being invested in theatre.</P><P><strong>Mr Quinan: </strong>Will 
the minister give way?</P><P><strong>Dr Murray: </strong>No, I am not giving way. 
I have only seven minutes and I want to get on.</P><P>The Arts Council of England 
supports 209 core funded organisations, which is a similar number, per head of 
population, to the number supported </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18069">18069</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>by the Scottish Arts Council. If we consider the figures&#151;as I have&#151;we 
find a much wider divergence in the amount of funding. Some theatres in England 
receive very small amounts&#151;perhaps &#163;10,000 or &#163;20,000&#151;whereas&#151;<em>[Interruption]</em>. 
Will Mr Quinan please not shout from a seated position: it is quite unnecessary.</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> Order, Mr Quinan.</P><P><strong>Dr Murray: 
</strong>Let us be honest: some theatres are also getting large sums of money. 
In Scotland, the smallest awards are around &#163;50,000 or &#163;60,000. We have a narrower 
range of funding.</P><P>Robin Harper rightly said that there has been a problem 
concerning local authority supported funding&#151;particularly to building-based 
core funded organisations, which has fallen since 1994-95. There is now a shortfall 
of some &#163;405,000. We discovered last year that additional funding provided through 
the Executive and the Scottish Arts Council to some of our core funded organisations 
resulted in a reduction in support from local authorities. The unfortunate result 
was that those CFOs did not get the benefit we hoped they would get from the reallocation.</P><P>I 
do not have time to go through the settlements for individual theatres, but they 
go up by as much as 30 per cent for Borderline Theatre Company. Admittedly the 
increase has been made through the reallocation of &#163;1 million, but there have 
been significant increases for a number of CFOs.</P><P>Much has been made of the 
total funding of the Scottish Arts Council. Brian Monteith is wrong: I do not 
know where he got his figures. The figures I have show that in real terms the 
Scottish Arts Council is faring slightly better than the Scottish Executive, because 
the Scottish Executive budget will fall in real terms from &#163;18.428 billion in 
2000-01 to &#163;18.286 billion in 2003-04, or by 0.77 per cent. Over the same period, 
the Scottish Arts Council budget will increase from &#163;35 million to &#163;37.2 million, 
or by 6.6 per cent.</P><P>For those who want Mike Watson and me to vire other 
parts of the tourism, culture and sport budget over to the Scottish Arts Council&#151;</P><P><strong>Mr 
Monteith: </strong>Will Elaine Murray give way?</P><P><strong>Dr Murray: </strong>I 
do not have time. I ask those people to explain what parts of our budget they 
would cut. Would they cut&#151;</P><P><strong>Mr Quinan: </strong>I will explain 
if she will give way.</P><P><strong>Dr Murray: </strong>Mr Quinan should sit down. 
I have told him that I will not take an intervention from him.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Quinan: </strong>She should not ask rhetorical questions, then.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18070">18070</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Dr Murray: </strong>Do they want to take money from VisitScotland, 
from sports programmes in schools, from support for our historic environment or 
from support for Gaelic? They have to answer some of those questions before they 
make such allegations.</P><P>There has been significant debate about the national 
theatre. I want to take the opportunity to restate the Executive's position. The 
national theatre remains an Executive commitment. However, we consider that without 
a secure package of funding for the full project, it would be inadvisable to proceed 
with detailed implementation at this stage. We believe that the theatre infrastructure 
needs to be secured in advance&#151;Donald Gorrie made some good points about 
that.</P><P>We recognise that the Equity and Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph 
and Theatre Union settlement places additional burdens on theatres. As a trade 
unionist, I would not agree to the funding of the national theatre on the back 
of not paying union rates to theatre workers.</P><P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Will 
Elaine Murray give way?</P><P><strong>Dr Murray: </strong>No, I will not.</P><P>There 
have been many calls for a review of arts funding. We would be happy to consider 
that. We have not yet heard any formal proposals from the Scottish Arts Council 
but, as Mike Watson said in his recent interview with <em>The Scotsman</em>, it 
would have to be a root-and-branch review and it would have to include the role 
and structure of the Scottish Arts Council. I remind people who call for a McCrone 
of the arts that the McCrone settlement was based on modernisation to release 
funds.</P><P>All I want to say in summing up is that&#151;as Mike Watson and I 
do personally&#151;the Scottish Executive does and will continue to value and 
support, and wishes to fund more fully, the Scottish theatre.</P><P>13:12</P><P><em>Meeting

<P>Members might remember that we last had a debate on fishing on 12 December 
last year, in advance of the European Union negotiations. During the Christmas 
recess, I asked&#151;the request was probably unpopular&#151;for the Parliament 
to be recalled so that we could have a debate on fishing. I was told that there 
would be no debate, because the Minister for Environment and Rural Development 
would give a statement to the Parliament in January and that that would give more 
opportunity for members to get more information.</P><P>The minister did that. 
During that statement, the minister said in answer to my question that there would 
be a debate in a few weeks. A few weeks from then would have been the end of January. 
The Scottish National Party did not use its time in January or its time in February 
to debate fishing because the Executive promised, not only in December but in 
January, to have a debate.</P><P>The substance&#151;the biggest crisis that faces 
any community in Scotland&#151;concerns me. The only thing that we have been able 
to do in the Parliament is to ask questions. While everybody else is asked their 
opinion in debate and discussion, the Parliament has never had the opportunity 
to have a debate, discussion or vote.</P><P><strong>Alex Johnstone (North-East 
Scotland) (Con): </strong>I make it clear that, on this issue, the Conservative 
party supports the opposition that Fiona Hyslop has expressed towards the business 
motion. I invite her to express my view that the Liberals have a choice today, 
in that they can be on the winning side of the argument whichever way they decide 
to vote.</P><P><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>I remind members that, the first 
time that the Government was defeated in the Parliament was on a fishing vote. 
Perhaps the minister is frightened to come to the Parliament and to have a vote 
because he knows that, last time, he was defeated.</P><P>The minister has said 
that the reason that he wants to move&#151;or cancel&#151;the debate from today's 
business programme and have it next week is that the Executive wants more time 
to consider the results of the consultation. If that is the case, why did the 
Deputy Minister for Parliamentary Business, who is sitting behind him, agree two 
days before the minister issued the consultation that it was right to have a debate? 
There is a bit of inconsistency in that, which is no big deal, because we recognise 
inconsistency in the minister's track record on the subject.</P><P>The issue is 
one of substance. We must have the chance to debate what happened in Europe. We 
have not even had the chance to do that, and the minister now wants to change 
the goalposts and have us debate a consultation on a </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18074">18074</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>redundancy deal&#151;it is not even a recovery package. The Parliament has 
to wait as the minister changes the terms of the debate as he goes along.</P><P>Will 
the minister assure us that, next week, he will not say, &quot;Oh, I'm sorry&#151;we've 
not had enough time to see the consultation results. Let's have the debate at 
another opportunity&quot;? The consultation was issued on&#151;I think&#151;Friday; 
the deadline for responses is 2 o'clock tomorrow. Why had one of the people on 
the circulation list for that consultation not received the documents by yesterday? 
Members of the Rural Development Committee had to give that person the consultation 
documents. The minister cannot come back next week bleating that we will have 
to have another debate at another time.</P><P>Perhaps the more serious point from 
the Parliament's point of view is the process, which is important. [<em>Interruption.</em>]</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>Order. I want to hear.</P><P><strong>Fiona Hyslop: 
</strong>I ask members, even if they are not interested in the substance of the 
fishing issue&#151;as many obviously are not&#151;to acknowledge the fact that 
there is an issue over the process. Until we vote in two minutes' time, this Parliament's 
wishes, on which it voted, are to hold a debate this afternoon. The Executive 
now wants to cancel that debate. There is now a minute to go&#151;until then, 
the situation is that the Parliament has democratically agreed that there should 
be a debate on fishing this afternoon.</P><P>The Presiding Officer may wish to 
reflect on whether it is appropriate that, last night, the Executive issued a 
press notice, which said that the fisheries debate</P><P>&quot;has been postponed 
until next week.&quot;</P><P>What authority did the Executive have to make that 
announcement? It was not made with the Parliament's authority.</P><P>I ask the 
Minister for Parliamentary Business to reflect on some of the comments that she 
has made to me at the Parliamentary Bureau. I have serious concerns that the processes 
of the Parliament are being abused. If for no other reason than to defend the 
Parliament's integrity, when the Parliament decides to hold a debate, it must 
follow through with that debate. Any decision on whether to postpone that debate 
must be made in the chamber not by ministers, and must not be sneaked out late 
at night because it suits the minister in question.</P><P>There has been inconsistency

I ask members to vote against the business motion and to return us to holding 
the fisheries debate this afternoon.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18075">18075</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>14:36</P><P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Parliamentary Business (Euan Robson): 
</strong>The Executive regrets that the time of the fisheries debate has had to 
be altered, but the decision was not taken lightly. It was taken with the interests 
of Parliament in mind. It has always been the Executive's intention to allow a 
full and proper debate on fisheries, and that has not changed. In fact, by changing 
the time of the debate to next week, we are adding half an hour to it.</P><P>The 
Executive considered it very important for members to have as much information 
as possible available to them before the debate, including the finalised Scottish 
statutory instruments. With that in mind, Ross Finnie sought agreement from business 
managers to postpone the debate until next week, so that Parliament will have 
the fullest possible information available to it when the debate takes place. 
By the time of next week's debate, consultation with the industry will be complete 
and the full SSI package will have been laid before Parliament.</P><P>It is important 
to note that the Executive has been quite open about the process, and has ensured 
that the non-Executive party spokespeople on the Rural Development Committee have 
been kept fully in the picture. Indeed, they were copied into the consultation 
exercise. This is simply a deferment of the debate for one week, which will make 
available more information for members.</P><P>I am afraid that we have witnessed 
some rather vacuous posturing on the part of the Opposition. I wonder, Presiding 
Officer, whether you recall the point of order that you raised, when Mr Reid was 
in the chair, at 5.01 on 24 January 2001. Mr Reid announced:</P><P>&quot;There 
is a point of order and, strangely, it comes from the Presiding Officer.&quot;</P><P>Sir 
David Steel said:</P><P>&quot;It is unusual for me to raise a point of order, 
but members should be made aware that one of the parties gave me notice, a very 
short time ago, of a change of the motion for the second debate tomorrow. I am 
not obliged to tell members of that change, but I think it is only courteous to 
do so, as otherwise members will see the change for the first time in tomorrow's 
business bulletin.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, 24 January 2001; Vol 
10, c 547.]</P><P>That was, of course, when the Scottish National Party altered 
its business to debate the Sutherland report. According to the SNP, therefore, 
it is not acceptable for the Executive to give two days' notice of a week's delay 
on a known subject, while the SNP was prepared to give members three or four hours' 
notice of a change in its business.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18076">18076</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

they be necessary.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Section 3&#151;Reference by employment<BR>

first group of amendments relates to the duty to make a referral. Amendment 1

People (Cathy Jamieson): </strong>Amendments 1 and 2 will extend the duty to make 
referrals to employment businesses. That duty will be backed up by the offence 
that all organisations will commit if they fail to comply.</P><P>It is worth reminding 
members why we are lodging the amendments at this stage. Employment businesses 
employ staff who are deployed to work in other organisations. Employment agencies 
that operate simply as an introductory service will not be covered by the duty, 
because there are already provisions in the bill that will allow them to make 
referrals in appropriate circumstances.</P><P>An amendment that was lodged at 
stage 2 would have extended the duty to refer to all organisations. There is no 
reason to distinguish between employment businesses and other organisations that 
directly employ staff in child care positions. They have the same employment relationships 
with their staff and have responsibilities for disciplinary and dismissal action. 
It is therefore reasonable that the duty to make referrals should also apply to 
them. We must ensure consistency and close all potential loopholes.</P><P>I did 
not consider it appropriate at stage 2 to extend the duty to make referrals to 
employment businesses as there had been no opportunity to consult them. We have 
now contacted and consulted a range of employment businesses, and they do not 
object to the proposal.</P><P>We intend to produce comprehensive guidance during 
implementation to ensure that all organisations understand their new duties.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18082">18082</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I move amendment 1.</P><P><strong>Irene McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP): 
</strong>I am not rising to speak against amendment 1. In fact, the SNP will not 
oppose any of the amendments that have been lodged at stage 3.</P><P>The stage 
2 amendment to which the minister referred would have extended the duty to make 
a referral beyond registered child care agencies to all organisations. That provision 
was widely welcomed. However, the minister will recall that concern was expressed 
that it would increase the already heavy administrative and financial burden on 
voluntary organisations. It was reassuring to hear the commitment that the minister 
gave to putting in place support, guidance and training to ensure that the voluntary 
sector can fulfil its duties and responsibilities under the bill.</P><P>I seek 
further clarification from the minister on the level and nature of that training, 
support and guidance. When the minister is assessing what is required, will she 
take into account fully the practical and resourcing issues that many voluntary 
organisations will face, both when implementing part V of the Police Act 1997 
and when dealing with the additional administrative and financial burdens that 
are imposed by the bill? I am sure that the minister will agree that it is very 
important that sufficient resources are made available to the voluntary sector 
to enable it to implement the legislation effectively.</P><P>14:45</P><P><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>I welcome Irene McGugan's commitment that the SNP will support 
the amendments that have been lodged. I hope that that is an example of good practice, 
because we discussed a lot of the issues fully at stage 2.</P><P>I state for the 
record the same information that I gave at stage 2. It is important to recognise 
that the voluntary sector comprises organisations of a range of types, sizes and 
natures. Some voluntary organisations have well-developed employment practices 
and disciplinary procedures and will be ready to pick up the small amount of additional 
work that might be required in relation to the bill. I am aware that many other 
organisations, particularly those that rely on volunteers rather than on paid 
staff, will need time to gear up and will need to be supported in the process.</P><P>I 
intend to work with representatives of a range of voluntary sector organisations 
in developing the appropriate guidance so that we can consider the nature of support 
that the organisations will need. I am happy to restate that commitment today.</P><P><em>Amendment

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Section 7&#151;Provisional inclusion in list</STRONG></P><P> 
<strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </STRONG>The second group of amendments 
is on the extension of provisional listing. Amendment 3 is in a group on its own.</P><P><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>Amendment 3 will allow ministers to apply to the sheriff for 
an extension to the six-month limit on provisional listing. The sheriff would 
be able to grant an extension of no more than one period of up to six months if 
they were satisfied that there was a good reason for doing so.</P><P>We believe 
that provisional listing is an essential part of the safeguards for preventing 
unsuitable people from moving undetected from one post to another. We recognise 
the need to keep provisional listing to an absolute minimum to avoid any undue 
distress to the individual concerned. That is why we have said that a determination 
will be reached within six months. However, we must provide for cases where that 
will simply not be possible. There could be a case where an individual was in 
hospital and could not submit observations on the evidence submitted with the 
referral. It would not be appropriate to move to a determination without giving 
the individual the opportunity to comment, but nor would it be appropriate in 
all instances simply to remove the individual from the provisional list.</P><P>A 
non-Executive amendment at stage 2 removed the provision for any extension because 
of concerns about the scope for provisional listing running indefinitely. We have 
addressed those concerns in amendment 3. The provision will be used in exceptional 
circumstances once only and for a maximum period of six months. The amendment 
is essentially for practical purposes and I believe that it addresses the concern 
that was expressed by the Education, Culture and Sport Committee.</P><P>I move 
amendment 3.</P><P><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I 
am grateful to the minister for her moving amendment 3. I moved a large number 
of amendments at stage 2 and the amendment to which she referred is the only one 
that was successful. I am glad that the minister has come back with a sensible 
wording. There was considerable concern&#151;and concern remains in many quarters&#151;about 
the scope of provisional listing and the fact that, in essence, it makes people 
provisionally guilty, a concept that is unknown in law.</P><P>Even in the circumstances 
in which provisional listing might be justified, there needed to be a limit on 
an extended period. If there were no limit on the extended period, somebody could 
be in legal limbo indefinitely. As Irene McGugan said, we will </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18084">18084</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>support all the Executive amendments. Amendment 3 will ensure that the committee's 
views are honoured in the bill.</P><P><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland 
and Fife) (Con): </strong>We, too, support amendment 3. We supported Mike Russell's 
amendment at stage 2 to remove provisional listing, but we are content that limiting 
it to one period of six months is the right step. It gives a degree of protection 
but also allows the Executive to keep provisional listing. The reasons that the 
minister outlined, both in the committee and today, to keep provisional listing 
with that qualification make sense.</P><P><strong>Ian Jenkins (Tweeddale, Ettrick 
and Lauderdale) (LD): </strong>I endorse the comments of the two previous speakers 
and I thank the minister for taking note of the committee's feelings.<em> </em>As 
the minister knows, I am hesitant about the whole idea of provisional listing. 
However, amendment 3 represents a sensible compromise that will help to protect 
children without infringing human rights to the extent that the original provision 
threatened to do.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I thank members for their 
support for amendment 3. I acknowledge the concerns about provisional listing 
that were expressed during stage 1 and stage 2. We must recognise that there is 
a fine balance between protecting children and highly vulnerable young people 
who might have no one to speak up for them and protecting the rights of individuals 
who could be subject to listing. Amendment 3 is the result of a commonsense compromise 
approach and I am glad to have members' support.</P><P><em>Amendment 3 agreed 
to.</em></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>After section 8</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </STRONG>The third group of amendments deals with protection 
from defamation. Amendment 9 is in a group on its own.</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: 
</strong>Amendment 9 seeks to clarify the laws on defamation as they apply to 
the bill. Any information that is submitted with a reference for inclusion in 
the list of people who are unsuitable to work with children will attract qualified 
privilege. Observations that are made on the information that is submitted with 
such a reference will also be covered by qualified privilege. As a consequence, 
those who provide information in connection with the list will have a defence 
against defamation, unless they were motivated by malice.</P><P>During earlier 
stages, I listened carefully to the arguments for protecting people from being 
sued for damages as a result of referring individuals to the list. It is important 
that any obstacles are removed and that people can confidently pass on </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18085">18085</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the information that we need to strengthen procedures for the protection of 
children. However, it would certainly not be appropriate to protect referrals 
that were made maliciously.</P><P>Amendment 9 puts it beyond doubt that qualified 
privilege will attach to communications relating to inclusion in the list and 
removes any doubt about whether the existing laws of qualified privilege would 
apply. Therefore, those who make statements in good faith will be protected. We 
have taken account of the concerns that have been raised and adopted a commonsense 
approach. Our compromise proposal seeks to clarify the existing legislation in 
the context of the Protection of Children (Scotland) Bill. Amendment 9 sets out 
the right level of protection.</P><P>I move amendment 9.</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell: </strong>During stage 2, in response to my moving of an amendment, the 
minister made a commitment to reconsider the issue. I am grateful that she has 
returned with a solution.</P><P>The issue is particularly important in the context 
of the Protection of Children (Scotland) Bill. As the bill is based not on legal 
convictions, but on tribunals and decisions by employing authorities, it is possible 
that an allegation that is made might result in legal action against the person 
who makes the allegation. Amendment 9 moves us forward.</P><P>I hope that amendment 
9 also sets a legislative precedent for tackling the difficulties that have arisen 
in the case in Dumfries of Michael MacKinnon, whose appeal in relation to a complaint 
that he had made on a teaching matter failed yesterday. I do not want to go into 
the merits or otherwise of that case, which many people still believe in strongly. 
It is vital to ensure that young people and their parents who come forward do 
not become the subjects of legal action on the ground of malicious allegation 
if the accusations that they have made are believed by the organisation that goes 
on to take proceedings. That is the key issue.</P><P>Malicious allegations should 
always be acted against but, if a body&#151;in the case of Michael MacKinnon,

the position in the bill and that is why I have moved amendment 9 today. I believe 
that the amendment is the right course of action. It would simply not be appropriate 
if the bill were to cover anyone who made any statement at all, whether maliciously 
or otherwise. It is important to get the balance of protection right, and I believe 
that the amendment achieves that. Once again, I am glad to have the support of

to speak to and move the motion. In the circumstances, I think that I can be fairly 
flexible about the timing of speeches.</P><P>14:59</P><P><strong>The Minister 
for Education and Young People (Cathy Jamieson): </strong>I am sure that the Presiding 
Officer does not want me to be so flexible that I take up the next two hours.</P><P>I 
begin by thanking everyone who was involved in the bill, from the policy development 
and consultation stages through to the preparation of the draft bill and the detailed 
scrutiny of the bill. In particular, I thank the bill team for steering the legislation 
through, and the Education, Culture and Sport Committee for engaging so fully 
in the process by scrutinising the bill in detail with the Justice 1 Committee. 
Once again, we have seen an example of how the Executive and committee members 
can work to improve legislation at each stage and ensure that we have a bill that 
is fit for its purpose.</P><P>The stage 1 debate demonstrated that there was unanimous 
support for the general principles of the bill. We have worked hard since then 
to resolve concerns about specific provisions. I am certain that members will 
want to comment on those issues during the afternoon's debate.</P><P>It is important 
to stress again why the bill is so important. Those of us who have worked in child 
care and who have followed the course of some recent inquiries, or those of us 
who have taken an interest since becoming members of the Scottish Parliament, 
will be all too aware of shocking cases of child abuse in which the perpetrators 
have been free to move on to other child care posts. We simply had to find a way 
of stopping that.</P><P>Despite other measures that have been put in place to 
improve safeguards for children&#151;such as increased access to criminal record 
checks and the establishment of the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of

that allowed some unscrupulous people to move freely from post to post. The bill 
will plug that loophole.</P><P>The protection of children is our top priority.

<P>balance of protecting children from abuse and protecting adults from inappropriate 
referrals. That is a difficult balance to strike and I hope and believe that the 
bill has done that. As I said in an earlier debate, it is a balance that many 
people who work in the front line of child protection must strike daily.</P><P><strong>Cathy 
Peattie (Falkirk East) (Lab): </strong>The minister is talking about striking 
a balance between children's rights and employment rights, but is she aware of 
the Scottish Trades Union Congress's concerns? Will the minister ensure that the 
STUC and other stakeholders are involved in drawing up guidance for the implementation 
of the bill?</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I am happy to give Cathy Peattie 
that assurance and I will come on to that issue in a moment or two.</P><P>We have 
been careful to ensure that there is no scope for malicious referrals. Any referral 
that is not properly made will be weeded out early in the process. An organisation 
that makes a referral will have to back it up with evidence that it has followed 
the appropriate dismissal or disciplinary procedures in reaching its decision 
to sack or move a person away from working with children. We will not entertain 
referrals that are not backed up with such robust evidence and we will certainly 
not entertain referrals to the list from individuals who merely have suspicions 
or concerns about a person. The legislation does not provide for that. Such concerns 
should be dealt with through each organisation's procedures and investigated where 
that is necessary and appropriate.</P><P>There are concerns that not all employers 
will have in place the necessary mechanisms to enable them to provide the required 
information in support of a referral to the list. Cathy Peattie, the deputy convener 
of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, referred to the STUC. I had a very 
helpful meeting with representatives of the STUC to discuss those issues and we 
agreed that those matters should be covered in the implementation guidance. I 
will involve the STUC and, of course, other interested organisations at an early 
stage in the development of that guidance. The STUC has made it very clear that 
it wants to help in the process and I will be glad to take up its offer.</P><P>We 
must also consider how best to ensure that voluntary organisations have the support, 
training and guidance that they will need to help them meet the new requirements 
of the bill. I know that they are keen to play their part in strengthening child 
protection and we will work with them to help equip them for that role. I can 
give an assurance that, in bringing the new legislation into force, we will take 
account of the time that organisations will need to gear up for implementation.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18090">18090</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I would like to reinforce the importance of referrals from the courts. Those 
provisions have attracted little debate during the passage of the bill but, nonetheless, 
will play an important part in strengthening the protection of children. It is 
worth spelling out again that those who are convicted of the most serious offences 
against children&#151;which are listed in schedule 1 of the bill&#151;will be 
referred to the list and included on it automatically.</P><P>For other offences 
involving children, the court will refer a person to the list unless it is satisfied 
that the individual is unlikely to commit more offences against children. I expect 
that those measures will act as a strong deterrent, because those who are included 
on the list will commit an offence if they try to obtain work with children, or 
if they continue to work with children. Any organisation that employs a person 
on the list to work with children will also be guilty of an offence. That sends 
a very clear message about responsibilities.</P><P>I am keen to see the measures 
in the bill take effect as soon as possible, so although I recognise that it will 
take some time for organisations to be equipped for their new duty to make referrals 
to the list, I intend to press ahead as quickly as possible with the processes 
that are required for referrals from the courts. We will, as a priority, establish 
the required links and the databases that will be needed.</P><P>Throughout the 
preparation of the bill, we were careful to ensure that the rights of the individual 
are respected and protected. I am confident that the listing process, together 
with the extensive appeals procedure, will protect those rights adequately.</P><P>Finally, 
I stress&#151;as others and I have stressed during the debates on the bill&#151;that 
the new safeguards are not a panacea for every situation. The bill on its own 
cannot and will not safeguard every child in every situation anywhere, but it 
will complement the other measures that are in place. There is no substitute for 
rigorous recruitment practices, including thorough interviews, checking of references, 
supervision during probationary periods and regular supervision and support of 
staff and volunteers. Most of all, as the recent report of the child protection 
review&#151;so aptly called &quot;It's everyone's job to make sure I'm alright&quot;&#151;says, 
we all have a responsibility to ensure that children can grow up safe from harm 
in all areas of their lives. That puts the onus on everyone in society&#151;everyone 
in communities&#151;to take child protection seriously.</P><P>Parliament has a 
good record in its support of children and young people. Today marks another historic 
step in ensuring that all our children get the best possible start in life. I 
am therefore pleased to move,</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18091">18091</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>That the Parliament agrees that the Protection of Children (Scotland) Bill 
be passed.</P><P>15:07</P><P><strong>Irene McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP): 
</strong>No one is in any doubt that we in Parliament need to do all that we can 
to increase the protection that we afford our children. The bill, as the minister 
said, is another tool to assist us in that, but it certainly comes none too soon; 
Lord Cullen's inquiry following the Dunblane tragedy and his report, which addressed 
the vetting and supervision of adults working with children, was published some 
years ago.</P><P>Central to the bill has been the need to balance carefully the 
rights of children with those of individuals. Concerns were expressed about the 
extent to which incidents will be thoroughly investigated, and about the mechanisms 
by which individuals will have the opportunity to defend their actions during 
any disciplinary or dismissal process. However, reassurance was sought and was 
given that referral to the list will be properly made, appropriate and backed 
up by robust evidence and relevant procedures.</P><P>That brings me to the need 
for information and guidance for all employers. The Education, Culture and Sport 
Committee noted in its stage 1 report that it is vital that training and guidance 
are provided to organisations to enable them to make consistent and fair decisions. 
Guidance on what constitutes harm was also recommended. I am pleased that the 
minister took all of that on board, and I am also pleased to hear that she intends 
to involve the STUC and others in the development of the guidance. I hope that 
&quot;others&quot; includes voluntary sector interests&#151;I am sure it will&#151;because 
some voluntary organisations are concerned about the impact of implementation.</P><P>It 
is vital that everyone view the bill's proposals as fair and transparent, because 
at the end of the day the main point is that the legislation will introduce further 
safeguards that will help minimise the risk of unsuitable individuals' being able 
to work with children. As such, it is a welcome initiative, and by implementing 
it Parliament can take credit for improving the situation of some of Scotland's 
most vulnerable children.</P><P>15:09</P><P><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland 
and Fife) (Con): </strong>I, too, am pleased to lend my support to the bill. I 
congratulate the minister and her team on their success in taking the bill through 
Parliament; I also congratulate the minister on the speed with which she has done 
that. I am aware that her interest stems from her professional background and 
I am sure that she is pleased that the bill </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18092">18092</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>gathered cross-party support as it underwent the various stages of legislative 
scrutiny.</P><P>The bill had to deal with particular problems and it was important 
that we were concerned about the movement of employees who work with children, 
whether between employers or across jurisdictions. The bill goes a long way towards 
allaying concerns about those matters.</P><P>At stage 2, many concerns were tackled 
about the balance between the rights of children and the rights of the employees 
who work with them. Thanks to many amendments that Michael Russell lodged, questions 
about tribunals, provisional listing and hearings were aired. With the support 
of Ian Jenkins&#151;a Liberal&#151;we changed the bill, which allowed the Executive 
to think again. That represents a message to the Parliament. Voting need not be 
whipped on non-partisan bills on which agreement exists, because if a committee 
agrees to some amendments to a bill, the Executive thinks again and proposes an 
improved bill. That happened with the Protection of Children (Scotland) Bill.</P><P>Many 
of us are familiar with the costs to voluntary organisations, particularly those 
in the youth sector, of Scottish Criminal Record Office checks. Voluntary organisations 
will incur some costs that are not yet apparent, in particular from the administrative 
work load that some might face. I appeal to the minister to have an open mind&#151;once 
the bill has bedded down and practices begin to be understood&#151;about whether 
support for voluntary organisations will be required, if some organisations find 
that the administrative demands are onerous and make a call on their finances. 
It would be regrettable if any organisation tried to cut corners because it had 
to make savings.</P><P>I congratulate the minister on succeeding with the bill 
and I thank her team and the clerks to the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, 
who helped us to amend the bill.</P><P>15:12</P><P><strong>Ian Jenkins (Tweeddale, 
Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD): </strong>I, too, thank everyone who was involved 
in the bill's production, including the witnesses who spoke to the Education, 
Culture and Sport Committee, our clerks and the bill team, which was headed by 
the minister. I also thank the minister for the way in which engagement between 
the committee and the Executive was handled. The other day, I attended as a substitute 
member a Health and Community Care Committee meeting at which the complicated 
Mental Health (Scotland) Bill was being dealt with. I am impressed by the way 
in which committees work together with ministers to improve bills at stage 2. 
That is to the Parliament's credit.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18093">18093</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>At stage 1, I said that the bill spoke of a loss of innocence. I accepted that 
the bill's central provisions were necessary and, although I did not like the 
idea, I accepted with regret the argument that provisional listing was probably 
a necessary evil. I expressed reservations about the looseness of the definitions 
of harm and of putting children at risk of harm. I highlighted the gravity of 
labelling, without absolute proof, someone as being unfit to work with children, 
because such a label would impose on that individual an indelible stigma that 
would probably deprive them of their career and lead to their becoming a pariah.</P><P>Even 
now, all those reservations remain to a degree, but I have been considerably reassured 
by the minister's comments to the committee and during today's debate, by her 
letter to the committee and by the stage 2 and stage 3 amendments to safeguard 
against malicious or ill-founded accusations leading to permanent or even provisional 
listing.</P><P>I speak of my hesitation, but since the stage 1 debate, we have 
read in the papers of, and seen on television, incidents that show the need for 
care and protection of children and the dilemmas that we face in deciding who 
is fit for, and capable of, looking after children. We have read of abductions, 
desperate cruelty and malicious and reckless mistreatment of children. I fear 
that much of that has been inflicted by close family members and other relatives, 
who are not the subject of the bill. However, we have also read about the workings 
of internet networks involving chatrooms and pornographic materials.</P><P>In 
normal life, we would expect a parent to sacrifice a great deal to protect his 
or her children. In our society, we too must be prepared to sacrifice something 
to protect the children who are, as Cathy Jamieson said, everyone's responsibility. 
When a child's human rights are threatened, and there is a conflict of interest 
between the rights of a child and those of an adult, it is right that we should 
move in favour of the rights of the more vulnerable child who cannot so readily 
defend him or herself. However, we must also do what we can to preserve the rights 
of the adult and ensure that injustice is avoided by enabling individuals to get 
a fair hearing and a right of appeal against potential injustice. I am satisfied 
that we have tried to do that and that we have managed to do it reasonably effectively 
in the bill.</P><P>If we are to stand back a little from the detailed provisions 
of the bill, we will see that we have to guard against the pervasive tendency 
to engender fear in the way in which we regard the safety and protection of children. 
I do not wish to see a society in which, out of fear, we reduce the kind of life 
experiences and opportunities that we offer our </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18094">18094</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>children and, indeed, that we offer ourselves as parents and carers of children.</P><P>I 
do not want a society in which parents feel unable to photograph their children 
at school events that are held in public. When a child is hurt before one's very 
eyes, I do not wish to be constrained by fear of misinterpretation from putting 
my arm around the child who is hurt to offer comfort. I do not want a society 
in which teachers and voluntary workers do not feel confident enough to take youngsters 
on school trips and outdoor activities because they fear blame and prosecution 
if things go wrong in some form of accident or incident over which they could 
not reasonably be expected to have total control, any more than a parent could 
be expected to do so.</P><P>In earlier discussions, I spoke about the position 
of social workers who face serious dilemmas and have to make difficult moral judgments 
day in and day out. Although it might be possible with 20:20 hindsight to say 
that their judgments are wrong, I believe that social workers deserve our protection 
in the situations that they face.</P><P>The Liberal Democrats support the bill. 
It contains substantial and important safeguards. Let us protect our children 
from danger wherever we can, but let us not live our lives, or expect them to 
live theirs, in an unnecessarily overprotected and cosseted manner that limits 
their life experiences in a negative way.</P><P>15:17</P><P><strong>Karen Gillon 
(Clydesdale) (Lab): </strong>I welcome the bill and look forward to its becoming 
an act. For many of us, it has been difficult to come to terms with some of the 
detail of the bill, but the passage of the bill has shown the close working relationship 
that can be formed between a minister and a parliamentary committee. The few amendments 
that were before the Parliament today show that the changes that were made were 
significant and worth while. The minister has provided the reassurances that the 
Education, Culture and Sport Committee sought to enable us to work with her and 
to see the bill reach fruition today.</P><P>The process has not been easy: none 
of us likes to believe or accept that our children are in danger from people who 
are in positions of care or responsibility, but the sharp reality is that some 
dangerous people will be and are in such positions. The bill is not a panacea 
for everything: it will neither stop child abuse nor will it stop children being 
hurt by adults. It will, however, go some way towards closing existing loopholes.</P><P>I 
remember the contributions that members of other parties made to the stage 1 debate, 
most </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18095">18095</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>notably Kay Ullrich, who told of her experience as a social worker in Ayrshire. 
It was a valuable contribution, which helped the committee to understand that 
people were being moved on because of the perceived threat that they posed to 
children. The cause of the threat was not dealt with adequately, but was swept 
under the carpet.</P><P>The bill is not an excuse for bad employment practices. 
Many of the concerns that were expressed in the evidence to the Education, Culture 
and Sport Committee showed that people felt that proper practices would not be 
followed. However, those practices must be followed if the bill is to be a success; 
the passage of the bill cannot be stopped because people do not have in place 
proper and adequate employment practices.</P><P>We need to ensure that protection 
is given to the work force, but also to the most vulnerable members of our society&#151;children 
and young people. They deserve nothing less than what is being given to them today. 
I hope that the bill will move the debate forward, and allow us to close one of 
the loopholes that exist. However, I hope that it does not engender more fear 
in our children and young people that there is somebody out there waiting to get 
them&#151;the bill is about a small number of people. We need to take action, 
but we must not allow that to be blown out of proportion or to create among children 
and young people fear of something that simply does not exist.</P><P>15:20</P><P><strong>Michael 
Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>It shows what a varied life the members 
of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee have that this morning we were all 
engaged in a battle of ideas and wills, and this afternoon we are agreeing&#151;essentially&#151;on 
a piece of legislation. The <em>Official Report</em> shows that during stage 2 
of the bill, Brian Monteith noted that we voted in a variety of different ways. 
Column 3910 is the only recorded instance of Irene McGugan and I voting on different 
sides, but as I was supported only by Brian Monteith, I suspect that Irene was 
right in the circumstances&#151;it is always wise to change one's mind.</P><P>The 
bill is essentially the last brick in the wall, and results from the Cullen inquiry 
into the shootings in Dunblane. It has taken so long to put that brick into the 
wall because of the difficult issue at the heart of the bill. The difficulty is 
balancing the undoubted need to protect our children against the obvious need 
for natural justice for those who are accused. That has been the central difficulty 
for every member of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee during the passage 
of the bill. It was a difficulty during stage 1 and it became an acute difficulty 
during stage 2, because we listened carefully to a variety of organisations that

<P>had genuine fears about the balance being struck. In particular, I mention 
the STUC, which was concerned about some of the bill's implications for employment 
practices. A variety of others, such as the NHS Confederation, gave evidence to 
the committee, but we were most struck by the evidence from children's charities 
and parents.</P><P>It has taken some time for me to be persuaded that the balance 
is right&#151;I am not totally persuaded as yet. It is clearly the will of the 
committee and the chamber that the bill should pass, and do so without opposition. 
However, we should maintain concern about some of the key aspects of the bill. 
Ian Jenkins indicated that well in his speech.</P><P>There is, for example, the 
issue of tribunals. The bill itself does not establish any independent tribunals; 
instead, it establishes a procedure for which the minister is responsible. She 
has said on more than one occasion that she will devolve responsibility for that 
to another group, which will presumably be made up of senior civil servants. I 
concur with the Justice 1 Committee, which said in its report on the bill that 
it would have been better to establish an independent tribunal system. However, 
that was not the will of the committee when it finally came to a vote. That said, 
we should bear the issue in mind, because in time it might be necessary to consider 
it.</P><P>I am very glad that we have dealt with defamation and with one of the 
issues in connection with provisional listing, but we have not dealt with other 
issues in that regard. I return to the point that the bill might create a unique 
concept that might be known as being provisionally guilty. I accept the reason 
for doing so and that there is a need to protect our children. I also accept that, 
in the light of the Cullen inquiry into Dunblane, there might be a need to recognise 
that some people are guilty although they cannot be totally found out at a crucial 
time because of the nature of their actions. That said, I am still uncomfortable 
with some of the bill's detail&#151;I see Ian Jenkins indicating his assent to 
that remark. We will have to move forward with the bill and examine carefully 
how it is implemented.</P><P>Finally, I want to thank not only the individual 
committee members, the minister and others with whom we have worked, but the clerks 
to the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, who bore the brunt of the work 
on the 81 amendments&#151;a record total&#151;that I lodged at stage 2. It is 
appropriate that one of those clerks is sitting in one of the hot seats today 
to watch what happens at the very end of the process.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18097">18097</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>15:24</P><P><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab): </strong>The bill is 
very much about recognising children's vulnerability and the importance of choosing 
the right people to work with them. We must remember that the vast majority of 
adults who work with children are driven by a commitment to child development 
and welfare. However, we must acknowledge that some adults&#151;albeit a small 
minority&#151;might want to harm children. We need not dwell on particular examples, 
but even here in Scotland, we know that abuse happens.</P><P>Child abuse is not 
just about scenes in gritty dramas; we cannot just switch off the television. 
Real life demands real action, and the proposed new list of adults who are unsuitable 
to work with children is a considerable improvement to our child protection system. 
However, as others have said, it is important to remember that the bill does not 
substitute for robust child protection policies, nor does it tackle the problem 
of child abuse that occurs behind closed doors in family homes. Nevertheless, 
the bill is a positive step that seeks to minimise opportunities for people who 
are intent on harming children.</P><P>Up until now, organisations in Scotland 
that work with children have used criminal records to check the suitability of 
future employees. Experience shows us that some of the worst incidences of child 
abuse have been by people with no previous convictions. Although Thomas Hamilton 
had no convictions, there was information on the files of a number of organisations 
to suggest that he was a risk. However, that information was not available to 
potential employers, nor was it collated or able to be shared.</P><P>The bill 
will enable the collation of so-called soft information on those people suspected 
of child abuse, including details of dismissals or resignations where child welfare 
was an issue, which will form the basis of a list of people banned from working 
with children. As members know, an equivalent list already exists in England and 
Wales. Scotland is clearly no less committed to protecting its children.</P><P>The 
bill has teeth. It will become a requirement for relevant organisations to consult 
the list. Organisations that employ a named individual will be committing a criminal 
offence. Organisations will also be obliged to contribute information so that 
the list is kept up to date. Why? It is because we want a system of child protection 
that works, not one that simply looks good.</P><P>I welcome the amendment lodged 
by the minister at stage 2 to encompass all child care organisations. We could 
not leave a potentially dangerous loophole through which adults who wish to abuse 
children could simply leave the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18098">18098</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>statutory sector and move into employment in the voluntary sector. That loophole 
would have created a two-tier system that is not in the interests of children. 
Indeed, the consultation process showed that voluntary organisations agree. Some 
of them have said that even if they were not legally required to check and report 
to the list, they would feel morally obliged to do so. Good laws reflect sound 
moral reasoning and the bill is no exception. However, we must ensure that voluntary 
organisations have the means to comply with the requirements. I know that the 
minister will ensure that consulting the list and referring individuals are as 
easy as possible. If necessary, additional support will be made available, in 
particular to small voluntary organisations.</P><P>As the minister has said, the 
bill acknowledges the careful balance needed to respect the rights and interests 
of individuals as well as the special rights of the child. I believe that, between 
the efforts of the committee and the considerable efforts of the minister, we 
have got that balance right.</P><P>Like others, I commend the minister for the 
bill. I thank all those involved in getting it to this stage&#151;the bill team, 
the clerks to the Education, Culture and Sport Committee and all those people 
who gave evidence. The bill has been strengthened by their input.</P><P>I remind 
the chamber that, under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
we are required to take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and 
educational measures to protect children from all forms of physical or mental 
violence, injury or abuse. To accept the bill is to accept our obligations.</P><P>15:29</P><P><strong>Donald 
Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>I welcome the minister's assurance about 
giving support, guidance and training&#151;or words to that effect&#151;to the 
voluntary sector, which has to deal with its side of the bill. However, I would 
like to press the minister on the issue of money. The voluntary organisations 
face a triple whammy of more expense: first, there is their part in administering 
the police checks under part 5 of the Police Act 1997; secondly, there will be 
duties imposed on them under the bill; and thirdly, there will be insurance costs 
arising from the bill and from related issues.</P><P>The police checks are very 
complicated. One large youth organisation says that 66 per cent of its people 
have not yet gone through the checks, and the minister could help by reducing 
the bureaucracy involved. Although individual checks are paid for by the Executive, 
which is most welcome, the considerable administrative costs </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18099">18099</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>sometimes go well into five figures for national youth organisations, and into 
smaller thousands for smaller organisations. That is big money for them. The cost 
of implementing the bill, which involves training and recruiting staff who know 
about the process and who can train others, and of the legal and other expenses 
is also estimated in five figures for some of the large organisations.</P><P>Insurance 
costs will also arise. We are an increasingly litigious society, and organisations 
could be sued by people who have been recommended to be put on the list and who 
see that as a slur on their character. There could also be suits from parents 
whose children have had bad experiences and who feel that the organisation did 
not check adequately. Both ways, the cost will be significant, and again some 
of the organisations quote estimates well into five figures.</P><P>I urge the 
minister to give an assurance that there will be money to help those organisations, 
as well as guidance. For them, tens of thousands of pounds is very big money, 
but it is quite small money for the minister's budget. The bill is an important 
measure and a good one, but it is only fair that those who have to co-operate 
with it and who do not have the money should get that money, and are paid to administer 
the provisions correctly.</P><P>15:32</P><P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I 
will deal with the points that Donald Gorrie has just raised before commenting 
on the rest of the debate.</P><P>I am aware that YouthLink Scotland has circulated 
information to MSPs highlighting some of the concerns of the voluntary sector. 
Indeed, many organisations highlighted those concerns during the course of our 
debates on the bill. I have given an assurance today that we will continue to 
work with the voluntary sector, and particularly with the youth organisations 
that have expressed concern, to get more information about the kind of support, 
training, advice and guidance that they will need.</P><P>However, I want to keep 
the matter in perspective, and Ian Jenkins outlined the situation clearly. I do 
not want a situation in which voluntary and youth organisations begin to see their 
core business as dealing with bureaucracy rather than providing services for young 
people. If there is a way of making the process simpler, by providing support, 
we want to do that. I am also concerned to ensure that smaller organisations have 
access to advice on issues that they are concerned about, on when they need to 
make decisions on whether to make a referral and on appropriate employment and 
disciplinary procedures. That is important. We </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18100">18100</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>need to have a clearer indication of exactly what the responsibilities will 
be in such organisations, and we must get a clearer fix on any financial implications. 
We want to make progress on that during the implementation stage.</P><P>It is 
perhaps worth reflecting on some of the comments that have been made by members 
in the debate. Mike Russell commented on the fact that, throughout our debates, 
a difficult central issue has been balancing children's right to protection and 
the rights of adults. Anybody who has ever been involved in child protection work 
will be acutely aware that that is constantly the difficult central issue. Of 
course, there was a time when child abuse, or the possibility that children would 
be abused, either by people in their own families or by people in the wider community, 
simply was not talked about. It was not allowed to be talked about. People pretended 
that it did not happen, kept it behind closed doors, swept it under the carpet 
or simply would not face up to it.</P><P>Thankfully, things have changed to the 
extent that young people now are much more able to talk about such issues and 
to come forward and report difficulties. Legislation and the support that is provided 
to children and young people have also moved on. The bill takes another step forward 
in closing loopholes that have been around for quite a long time. The Cullen report 
on the Dunblane tragedy crystallised people's concerns. People who have worked 
with children over many years will know that previous reports highlighted the 
same issues and went some way towards addressing the issues, but did not plug 
all the gaps.</P><P>Brian Monteith referred to the fact that it has taken only 
a relatively short time to draft the bill. That is of interest to me, given my 
professional background. A relatively short period in parliamentary time can seem 
like a lifetime for children and young people who are at risk. We must ensure 
that such young people do not feel vulnerable or at risk of abuse. They must have 
confidence that people will act on their concerns. Inquiries such as the Edinburgh 
child abuse inquiry and the Kent report highlighted circumstances that could perhaps 
have been avoided if this kind of legislation had been in place years ago.</P><P>Members 
have commented on whether we have got the balance right, and I will make a couple 
of points about the suggestion that was made at stage 2 that there should be a 
tribunal system rather than ministers' having responsibility. Last week, I laid 
out clearly in a letter to Karen Gillon, the convener of the Education, Culture 
and Sport Committee, why we continue to believe that the situation that we have 
developed is the right one, whereby delegated powers will be given to a </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18101">18101</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>senior member of the civil service, someone from Her Majesty's Inspectorate 
of Education and someone from the social work services inspectorate to consider 
all the evidence and, if necessary, to seek the back-up of legal opinion on employment 
practices. I hope and trust that that deals with that issue. It is important that 
people have the opportunity to make appeals to the court, and we have taken account 
of the comments that committee members made at various stages.</P><P>Several members 
referred to the fact that we do not want our children's lives to be so over-regulated 
that their innocence is lost or that they cannot have the experiences that we 
want them to have. I agree with those sentiments. As a parent, I know&#151;and 
many others will share this view&#151;that one of the worst fears that a parent 
can have is that something will happen to their child. When people put their children 
in the care of professionals, whether for a short period during the day or for 
an extended period, such as when young people have to be looked after by the state, 
they must be confident that those people genuinely care about children and young 
people and will not abuse the trust that has been placed in them. That is why 
the bill is so important.</P><P>Karen Gillon and Jackie Baillie referred to the 
fact that the soft information that has been held on individuals has perhaps gone 
around the system without anyone being able to collate it or take action. Jackie 
Baillie said that real life demands real action. The bill gives us an opportunity 
to take real action and to ensure that young people are protected in real-life 
difficult situations.</P><P>Karen Gillon also highlighted the important fact that 
the bill is not an excuse for bad employment practices. I state that fact clearly 
for the record. I expect organisations to take the bill seriously. If there are 
concerns or suspicions about people, organisations should investigate them thoroughly 
and properly. It is not the case that rumour or malicious comment will allow people 
to be listed. The processes will be scrutinised thoroughly, and the whole reason 
for bringing such cases before ministers will be to ensure that the investigation 
has been done properly.</P><P>I could continue to speak for a considerable length 
of time, but I will resist the temptation to do so. I record my thanks to everyone 
who has been involved in the bill at all stages, including the Education, Culture 
and Sport Committee and officials. The Parliament has a good record of trying 
to improve the lives of vulnerable children. The bill is another example of the 
Executive and the committee recognising the action that needed to be taken to 
deal with the real situations that young people out there in the real world face 
and putting in place legislation that will make a difference to their lives.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18102">18102</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>On a point of order, Presiding Officer. We are 
now in an unfortunate position&#151;parliamentary business could finish at about 
a quarter to 4 and we had expected to be here until 7 o'clock, which means that 
we are facing a void for the next couple of hours, although there is, of course, 
Tom McCabe's important members' business debate, which I hope members will stay 
to hear.</P><P>Will the Presiding Officer give guidance on whether there is anything 
in our procedures&#151;a motion without notice or another mechanism&#151;that 
would allow us to instate business at this late stage? What has happened this 
afternoon is that Parliament, on the Executive's initiative, has not replaced 
an Executive debate on fishing with something else but has cancelled business&#151;unlike 
the proposals put forward by Euan Robson. Is there any mechanism that could instate 
other business now? If not, what guidance can the Presiding Officer give business 
managers to ensure that this does not happen again? It was made clear that the 
stage 3 debate on the Protection of Children (Scotland) Bill would take only an 
hour and a half. It is important that we use the Parliament's time valuably.</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel): </strong>I think that the only point of order 
for me in that was whether there is a mechanism whereby other parliamentary business 
can be brought forward. The answer is no. The only way that that can be done is 
by a business motion, which must come from the Parliamentary Bureau. We debated 
the issue earlier and the Parliament was well aware when we took the vote this 
afternoon that business was being removed, and the only addition was the extra 
members' business debate. The matter is entirely in the hands of the Parliament.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18104">18104</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Young People in Sport</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The Deputy 
Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </STRONG>The next item of business is a members' 
business debate on motion S1M-3840, in the name of Tom McCabe, on young people 
in sport.</P><P><em>Motion debated,</em></P><P>That the Parliament commends Hamilton 
International Sports Trust, which seeks to aid young amateur sports people in 
competition at the highest levels, for their support given to young people in 
South Lanarkshire; congratulates the young people supported by the trust on the 
success they have achieved; notes the work of sportScotland in this area, working 
to ensure that sport is more widely available to all with investment of &#163;8.1 million 
per year; believes that such initiatives and investment promote confidence and 
community spirit among our young people; further believes that this type of community-based 
support from the local community would benefit other communities across Scotland, 
and believes that such initiatives, promoting access to sport and promotion of 
sporting excellence among young people, are worthy of suitable support from the 
Scottish Executive.</P><P>15:46</P><P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe (Hamilton South) (Lab): 
</strong>It would be a great honour to represent one's country in one's chosen 
sport and a great challenge to compete at the highest level. I am sure that many 
in the chamber have harboured dreams of scoring a goal or being the first at the 
finish line for Scotland or Britain. While, for most of us, that is only a dream, 
others have the aptitude, the ability and the determination to make their dreams 
a reality. They have managed to get near or even to the top of their chosen sport.</P><P>However, 
some sports do not have enough resources to fund all the costs of their athletes. 
In some sports in Scotland, it is even mandatory for international athletes to 
purchase squad tracksuits or other equipment from their own funds. That can be 
an expensive business, especially for those from low-income backgrounds.</P><P>That 
is one area in which the Hamilton International Sports Trust comes into its own. 
I pay tribute to the work that the trust has done and continues to do to promote 
sport and assist athletes to achieve the best that they can. I pay tribute also 
to the athletes from Hamilton and Blantyre&#151;and indeed from a wider area&#151;who 
have achieved recognition.</P><P>As members will realise, it is not all about 
recognition. I am sure that members will agree on the important broader benefits 
of sport&#151;health and fitness, personal confidence and community spirit.</P><P>The 
<em>Hamilton Advertiser</em> is one of the best-known local papers in Scotland. 
It is currently campaigning against the anti-social behaviour that </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18116">18116</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>blights so many people's lives. Headlines such as</P><P>&quot;Call halt to 
neighbours from hell&quot;</P><P>appear all too often in that campaign. The <em>Hamilton 
Advertiser</em> would rather spend its time highlighting more of the successes 
that organisations such as the Hamilton International Sports Trust can inspire. 
I have no doubt that the same could be said in a great many communities throughout 
Scotland.</P><P>The Hamilton International Sports Trust was established in 1986 
for local amateur athletes who are of, or are potentially of, international standard 
in their chosen sport. The trust provides up to 75 per cent of the expenses that 
are incurred in representing Scotland or Great Britain. It also provides a &#163;250 
grant towards general training costs which, in some sports, can be a considerable 
burden.</P><P>The trust has gone from strength to strength over the years since 
1986 and has increased the aid that it provides by a factor of around 20. The 
trust's main fundraising efforts&#151;an annual gala dinner and a professional-amateur 
golf tournament&#151;are a big hit locally. Prominent local individuals, businesses 
and other groups contribute to the events' success. That a very high percentage 
of the businesses that supported the idea 16 years ago are still sponsors is a 
testament to the commitment of some of the long-standing trustees, such as Hugh 
Waters, Ronnie Smith, Jim Raeburn and Alastair Murning. The partnership between 
the local council, local business and trustees to give freely of their time is 
a model that could be repeated throughout Scotland.</P><P>I acknowledge sportscotland's 
work in encouraging and promoting athletic involvement. A recent award of &#163;10,000 
to the Blantyre and north Hamilton social inclusion partnership was most welcome. 
However, the Hamilton International Sports Trust received a start-up grant of 
just &#163;1,000 16 years ago and has received nothing since. I believe that the template 
that it has established could be a model for the rest of Scotland, with adjustments 
to suit local circumstances. There is also a case for start-up grants that are 
meaningful in today's terms&#151;for example, &#163;10,000 per trust&#151;and for some 
form of match funding to act as an incentive to any trust when it sets its targets 
for each year.</P><P>The Hamilton International Sports Trust's expenditure last 
year was around &#163;30,000. That is not bad for a locally based group. However, that 
figure is meaningless until we know how that money is put to good use. The trust 
has given aid in the form of nearly 1,000 grants and scholarships. Aid has been 
given to many different sports, from aquatics to athletics, and in particular 
to minority sports.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18117">18117</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>There have been many success stories. The trust has supported Pamela Pretzwell, 
a young tennis star. She is now number 1 in Scotland and number 2 in Britain in 
her age group. The trust also builds long-term relationships. It has supported 
a young badminton player named Jamie Neil for seven years, starting when he was 
in the under-12 age group. He is now in the under-19 group, number 1 in Scotland 
and challenging hard for the top in the United Kingdom and beyond. Such examples 
demonstrate the opportunities that exist for young people whom the trust and the 
local public support.</P><P>The impact of sport and physical activity on young 
people is enormously positive. Sport provides an opportunity for personal and 
social development, as well as a positive alternative to crime, drugs and alcohol 
abuse. Sport channels young people's energies constructively. With essential assistance 
from family members and a local community, it can be a means of bringing and area 
together.</P><P>There is nothing like people getting together and supporting their 
local school team or children's sports squad. Sport has so much to offer young 
people. It improves health and fitness and it can boost confidence and self-esteem. 
It teaches leadership, teamwork and social skills that can be used in all aspects 
of life. Sport also offers worthwhile lessons on the value of both winning and 
losing, and teaches the benefits of hard work and how to treat others with respect.</P><P>Television, 
video, computers and increasing concerns over children's safety have led to a 
decrease in the activity levels of children and young people. Although most children 
take part in some form of sport or physical activity in the course of an average 
week, there are worrying trends with regard to the level and frequency of that 
experience.</P><P>Local sports trusts can offer real benefit to communities such 
as mine in Hamilton. Too many communities are blighted with the results of poor 
diet and dangerous lifestyle choices, such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. 
If we start with people at a young age and provide positive role models, we can 
change behaviour and improve our communities. That is why initiatives such as 
the Hamilton International Sports Trust and investment in sport, particularly 
in disadvantaged areas, are important if we are to combat those trends.</P><P>The 
Hamilton International Sports Trust is unique. It assists excellence in sport 
and encourages others to strive towards it. It is an example to other communities, 
with the local community collectively backing its own people. I commend the Hamilton 
International Sports Trust for its work. I believe that it and local projects 
like it </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18118">18118</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>are worthy of suitable support from the Scottish Executive, and I look forward 
to the Executive's response today.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: 
</strong>We now come to open debate. I will allow four minutes for the first three 
speeches and three minutes per speech thereafter.</P><P>15:56</P><P><strong>Irene 
McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I congratulate Tom McCabe on bringing 
forward the matter for debate. I was unfamiliar with Hamilton International Sports 
Trust, but I have enjoyed hearing about its work and achievements. I commend the 
trust for its efforts.</P><P>My comments on young people in sport will be more 
general. Most people have their first experience of sport at school. Despite widespread 
agreement that we need to improve the participation of young people in sport when 
they are at school because of the major role that sport plays in improving health, 
motivation and achievement among young people across the social spectrum, there 
are difficulties and concerns about, for example, the shortage of trained physical 
education teachers and there are difficulties in accessing swimming pools and 
playing fields. We cannot ignore such issues. A lack of facilities and infrastructure 
at an early stage in life will seriously impact on the potential of our young 
high achievers.</P><P>If we really want to nurture young people towards competing 
at the highest levels, we need to establish an unbroken chain of sporting opportunity 
from school to club. We must also develop links between schools and universities 
and colleges; up to 60 per cent of young people now go straight from school into 
further or higher education. We also need links from those establishments to clubs. 
We lose talented athletes at all those stages, so there should be better co-operation 
between local authorities, sports clubs, sports councils and sport's governing 
bodies. They all have pivotal roles to play, and have specific obligations to 
promote sport and excellence in young people.</P><P>Nutrition is an aspect of 
sporting performance that I think is grossly neglected. Everybody would acknowledge 
that sporting youngsters need a healthy and nutritious diet. Some major sporting 
agencies, including Sport England and the English national football team, are 
sponsored by multinational confectionery companies and their products, including 
Jaffa Cakes and Mars bars. Most recently, we have heard that McDonald's has become 
sponsor of the Scottish Football Association. Such a level of sponsorship certainly 
brings in much-needed revenue to sport&#151;I do not </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18119">18119</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>decry that&#151;but for youngsters without an adequate knowledge of the proper 
nutritional fuel that is needed for sporting excellence, that sponsorship perhaps 
sends out the wrong kind of message.</P><P>It is accepted that, to excel at any 
sport, athletes need strength. If athletes do not know how to fuel their bodies 
properly for training and sport, they will lack the strength to achieve their 
full potential. We in Scotland are notorious for our very poor diet. For athletes 
at the elite end of the spectrum it is imperative that they get adequate nutritional 
and dietary guidance and support. In reality, however, very few do. There seemed 
to be a shortage of such advice even for our athletes at last year's Commonwealth 
games in Manchester.</P><P>Many athletes receive tuition and supplement their 
training regime privately. However, they are required to seek out that tuition 
and to fund it at their own expense. The new regulations in the food supplements 
directive might make that more difficult. Some people are not madly enthusiastic 
about any pills, even vitamin and mineral pills, but elite athletes cannot get 
all that they need from food and so must rely on supplements for optimum performance.</P><P>I 
would like nutrition to be given priority. There should be a programme of awareness 
raising and there should be much more discussion, involving everyone from children 
through to the sporting agencies and governing bodies. Knowing how to build a 
healthy body correctly is everyone's responsibility. Only in that way can we meaningfully 
support sporting excellence.</P><P>16:01</P><P><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid 
Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>I am very pleased to take part in the debate 
and I congratulate Tom McCabe on having his motion selected. I did not know about 
the debate until this morning, but I am delighted to participate, because I am 
particularly interested in sport for young people&#151;as a parent, I am involved 
in it most weekends.</P><P>I did not know a great deal about the Hamilton International 
Sports Trust, but I made an effort to find out about it. Needless to say, all 
the details that I found have already been relayed to the Parliament by Tom McCabe. 
For that reason, I will not focus my remarks on the trust. However, the extent 
of the trust's involvement is admirable and highly impressive, given that it received 
only a small amount of seedcorn funding. The trust has succeeded in attracting 
and channelling funds, with the aim not just of involving people in sport but 
of encouraging sporting excellence. As Tom McCabe said, it is a tremendous template. 
We should promote that template and encourage other </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18120">18120</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>bodies to take on board what the trust has done. They should see what they 
can learn from it and follow its example.</P><P>In the time that is allotted to 
me, I would like to mention a similar organisation&#151;Leith Athletic Football 
Club. Leith Athletic was set up in the mid '90s, essentially by local parents 
in Leith, to encourage children to play football on Leith links and&#151;as the 
parents put it&#151;to get them off the streets. It was felt that not enough was 
being done for young people. Although they liked to kick a ball, nothing was being 
organised for them. Soccer sevens were organised, and teams were set up and entered 
in the local juvenile leagues. The idea was to play not so much to win as for 
the fun of the game and for the coaching, which enabled people to pass on skills 
and help others to learn, and which took children away from the boredom of standing 
on street corners.</P><P>The club started to grow. It is now not just one of the 
biggest in Edinburgh, but in recent years the most successful. Last year Leith 
Athletic won the Scottish cup for under-12s. Its under-13 team, which the previous 
year had won the same trophy, took part in the tournament for its age group, where 
it lost to a team from Fife. The club now attracts players not just from Leith, 
but from Portobello and other neighbouring areas of Edinburgh. Leith Athletic 
has also established a successful girls football team. The club recognised that 
football is not just for boys and that there is a wider audience for it&#151;many 
girls want to become involved.</P><P>However, Leith Athletic has to put up with 
fairly poor facilities. I have accompanied the club to tournaments in other countries, 
where the facilities were considerably better. Leith Athletic is not sitting back&#151;it 
wants to improve its facilities and to work with other organisations such as sportscotland 
and the local authority. For some time, Leith Athletic has been waiting to develop 
the local tennis courts.</P><P>Just this week, we found that the local authority, 
which is planning to plant some trees on Leith links, had decided to plant one 
on the goal line, next to corner flag, thereby obstructing play. The tree had 
to be relocated. The relationship with clubs and organising bodies is not good 
enough and more work has to be done on that. We have to take the template that 
Tom McCabe outlined, make it work throughout Scotland, learn from clubs such as 
Leith Athletic and show that with the voluntary spirit, in partnership with the 
authorities, we can raise funds and improve excellence.</P><P>16:05</P><P><strong>Donald 
Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>It is helpful that Tom McCabe lodged 
the motion. He </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18121">18121</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>has certainly explained about the Hamilton International Sports Trust, which 
I did not know about and which could be copied elsewhere. I am the honorary president 
of a couple of athletics clubs and the people who run those clubs have to waste 
a huge amount of their time trying to get low-grade sponsorship for their activities. 
If we got local business communities to co-ordinate and set up a fund that would 
help clubs and individuals, that would avoid there being a huge amount of wasted 
time.</P><P>I will talk about clubs, which other members have covered aspects 
of well. Local clubs are the basis of most of our sport, but we do not give them 
enough attention or financial support. In Denmark, instead of having one organisation, 
like our sportscotland, there are two separate organisations. One supports higher-level, 
professional or international sport and the other supports amateur and local sport. 
We could copy that structure. Too much effort goes into projects such as building 
Hampden park rather than supporting local sports clubs.</P><P>We could support 
clubs more&#151;very small sums can help. Even &#163;1,000 for a small athletic club 
to help pay for the buses to go to away tournaments in different parts of the 
country would be a huge benefit. We are not talking about big money, because well-directed 
small amounts would do a great deal of good.</P><P>We could do more to encourage 
people to qualify as coaches, because quite often there is considerable expense 
involved in attending residential courses. Coaches and officials are the key to 
many activities, but football officials get so much flak that it is becoming increasingly 
difficult to find referees and linesmen. We want to encourage people and ease 
the path for them to become coaches, club organisers or officials.</P><P>Brian 
Monteith referred to the relationship with local authorities. In my view some 
local authorities charge far too much for their facilities, which is a drain on 
clubs' resources. Councils are obviously under pressure to make as much money 
as possible, but we could do more to help the clubs by meeting those charges.</P><P>I 
urge the Executive to talk to sportscotland and local authorities to find ways 
of channelling money directly to clubs in order to add to whatever the local authority 
is doing and to offer recognition of the importance of clubs to the community. 
I am sure that a little bit of money could be taken from social inclusion budgets 
or other budgets of that sort.</P><P>Without the clubs, many of which are really 
struggling, we will not progress. We need to have a really strong foundation that 
will produce excellent athletes and sportsmen at the highest </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18122">18122</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>level. It is better that 1,000 people play sport than that one person plays 
it well.</P><P>16:09</P><P><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab): </strong>I 
congratulate Tom McCabe on securing the debate and on the role that he played 
when he was leader of South Lanarkshire Council in developing the Hamilton International 
Sports Trust. I have a particular interest in the debate because the trust covers 
part of my constituency. Talented sportspeople from Larkhall, Stonehouse, Ashgill 
and Netherburn are able to access, and have accessed, support from the trust. 
They have certainly benefited from that support and have welcomed it. Traditionally, 
incomes in those communities have not been high and parents are not able to provide 
some of the finances that are required to perform at the elite level. The trust 
has been able to step in and help.</P><P>As Tom McCabe said, many of us dream 
of being a superstar. Scots up and down the country will dream of scoring the 
winning goal at Hampden tonight, or of running the length of the pitch and scoring 
between the posts at Murrayfield on Saturday. Although it is a dream, history 
has shown us that some will make it.</P><P>It is important to get right the balance 
between elite and grass-roots sports development. I fully buy into the idea that 
we must invest in the grass roots because, if we do not, we will never have elite 
performers. We must encourage far more physical activity in our schools. That 
is why I support the idea of prescribing minimum weekly levels of physical activity 
in primary schools and of physical education in secondary schools. I welcome the 
Executive's commitment to considering how it can make it easier for PE teachers 
to move into primary schools to engage in such activity.</P><P>Sport is our most 
undersold resource. It can increase educational achievement and can promote self-esteem 
and motivation. That is why I welcome North Lanarkshire Council's development 
of sports comprehensives. I want sport in Scotland to be used much more effectively 
and positively.</P><P>As I have said, dreams are important, too, but without the 
inspiration of elite athletes and role models, for many young people sport will 
be nothing but a dream. Many young people who live in our most deprived communities 
aspire to become like those role models. Following in their footsteps offers a 
way out&#151;it represents a vehicle to a different world. Some young people will 
make it, but some will do so only with the support of organisations such as the 
Hamilton International Sports Trust. That is why my local sports council is considering 
the development of a sports trust. I </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18123">18123</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>hope that the Executive will look positively at how it can support the development 
of such sports trusts and at how it can encourage greater grass roots and elite 
sport in Scotland.</P><P>16:12</P><P><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland 
and Easter Ross) (LD): </strong>I will take Irene McGugan's reference to infrastructure 
as my main point. During the rush to local government reform in 1995, there was 
a rush to spend and to put up facilities in many parts of Scotland. That was true 
of Ross and Cromarty District Council and of Inverness District Council. A series 
of fine sports centres were built in much of Ross-shire and Inverness. A stop 
was put to that in 1995.</P><P>Although we still have those centres, at present 
there are virtually no facilities for the bigger towns north of my home town of 
Tain. In the most remote areas, village halls are quite well catered for, as there 
has been a good building programme, but Wick, Thurso, Tain and the villages of 
east Sutherland are very short of sports facilities.</P><P>Highland Council's 
capital allocation means that it will never be realistic to build such centres, 
which typically cost between &#163;2 million and &#163;2.5 million. The days of the old 
district councils, when we could do things in the far north, have gone. My young 
constituents, who are the seedcorn of the future, do not have the facilities that 
are necessary to get people into sport at that key early age. I have made that 
point before.</P><P>In rolling out its schemes, the Scottish Executive should 
remember that some areas of Scotland are behind in their facilities. Therefore, 
my concluding point is to urge the minister, when she undertakes her good work 
in the future, to remember that the far north&#151;Wick, Thurso, Tain and east 
Sutherland&#151;are badly provided for. I make no apologies for saying so. There 
will be ways of establishing the necessary centres.</P><P>I compliment Tom McCabe 
for securing the debate and for offering us a methodology that could be developed. 
I will ask bodies in my area to consider what Tom McCabe has outlined to identify 
whether it represents a suitable model. I ask the minister to remember some of 
the poorer areas such as those that I represent.</P><P>16:14</P><P><strong>Johann 
Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab): </strong>In congratulating Tom McCabe on securing 
this evening's debate, I recognise the important work that is being done both 
in his area and in my constituency. Across Glasgow, there are excellent examples 
of efforts to encourage young people to be active and involved in sports. One 
important example is the free swimming and free swimming </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18124">18124</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>lessons that Glasgow now offers to all its young people. We now need to consider 
who is taking up that opportunity to see whether more needs to be done.</P><P>Two 
voices can be heard when we talk about a sports strategy. One discussion concerns 
how we promote excellence and how we get our young athletes to represent Scotland 
and the UK on the international stage. In that regard, I am sure that many members 
would share my regret that some young sportspeople, who would have done Scotland 
proud on the international stage, have been denied the right to participate in 
the paralympics because of the bizarre decision to exclude people with learning 
disabilities. That is a matter of regret.</P><P>Achieving excellence and representing 
one's country is important, but I will concentrate my remarks on the importance 
of sport in encouraging the involvement in and take up of activities. Our health 
statistics clearly underpin the importance of exercise and of being involved in 
sport. We know that tackling ill health is not just about buildings, no matter 
how important they may be, but about addressing lifestyle issues.</P><P>As the 
motion says, sport can also offer an important lesson about community spirit and 
involvement. I have a friend whose son is a young footballer, whose talents are, 
I am happy to say, currently being used in the east end of Glasgow. In discussing 
that with his parents, I made the point that they must be very proud of him. His 
mother, as wise as ever, said, &quot;Yes, I am proud of him and, if he doesn't 
make it, I will at least know that, for the next five or six years, he will be 
doing something positive with his life rather than perhaps taking some of the 
dead-end options that might be open to him in the city of Glasgow.&quot; If for 
no other reason, I am sure that that is why many people welcome the importance 
of sport.</P><P>We need to consider how we support activity locally, particularly 
in disadvantaged communities. We need to consider the groups that are more reluctant 
to be involved in sport. We also need to consider how people get access to sporting 
facilities. Not every young person has a mum and dad who can run around in a car 
to take them from one place to another. We need to consider that issue imaginatively.</P><P>Before 
mentioning Euro 2008, let me say that we perhaps need to recognise that, sometimes, 
when we talk about sport, we talk too much about sports that encourage only the 
passive spectator in us all. In my view, football can be particularly troubling, 
given the fact that the closest that people get to activity is not even to go 
to the game but to sit and watch it in the pub. Here I make a plug for participation 
in sports such as running, in which the elites run with the poorest and lamest, 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18125">18125</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>such as myself. That is perhaps an important egalitarian principle that we 
should consider.</P><P>I want to ask the minister where the moneys that have been 
released from the Euro 2008 bid are going. A number of local initiatives in my 
constituency would benefit from that money. For example, Hillwood boys club and 
Mosspark boys club&#151;which run teams for boys and girls&#151;serve an important 
community need, but their only resources are the people who run them, so their 
means are extremely limited.</P><P>It is important that we consider initiatives 
to support young girls in sport. Again, we should consider the models that have 
been developed in Glasgow through initiatives such as the women's 10K and the 
Glasgow women's jogging network, which recognise that girls are less likely to 
take up sport than boys.</P><P>Finally, I ask the minister to address the lack 
of access to funding for organisations such as local sports clubs. Sometimes, 
as in the case of Mosspark boys club in my constituency, such organisations are 
encircled by social inclusion partnership areas but still cannot get access to 
funds, despite the fact that they are meeting the same needs as are being met 
by other groups in the SIPs.</P><P>I welcome the debate. I urge the Executive 
to examine the anomalies in funding and to address not only the delivery of sports 
initiatives but the factors that will improve access to those sports initiatives 
for youngsters in my constituency and elsewhere.</P><P>16:19</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Dr Elaine Murray): </strong>I, 
too, congratulate Tom McCabe on securing tonight's debate. It was only yesterday 
afternoon that I learned that the debate was to take place, so I was only slightly 
in advance of Brian Monteith on that. I congratulate all the members who have 
managed to contribute so well to the debate at such short notice. My only regret 
is that, in order to get my notes together last night, I had to forgo the first 
night of &quot;Rigoletto&quot;.</P><P><strong>Mr Stone: </strong>Aw.</P><P><strong>Dr 
Murray: </strong>I am glad that someone is sorry for me.</P><P><strong>Mr Monteith: 
</strong>The minister missed herself.</P><P><strong>Dr Murray: </strong>I know 
that I did. I was most disappointed, but it was perhaps worth it to hear about 
and celebrate the good work of Hamilton International Sports Trust. It is also 
important to have the opportunity to talk about the importance of youth sports.</P><P>I 
believe that seven competitors from the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18126">18126</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Hamilton area competed at the Commonwealth games in Manchester, including the 
judo bronze medal winner, Fiona Robertson, who I had the pleasure of meeting when 
I was in Manchester. That demonstrates the success that the trust has had in bringing 
on young athletes. The trust is an excellent example of a number of agencies working 
together.</P><P>I find it refreshing to hear about an organisation that received 
&#163;1,000 16 years ago and has not come back for more since then. That bears testament 
to the organisation's tremendous fundraising record.</P><P>I am also pleased that 
the Hamilton International Sports Trust is promoting minority sports. Promotion 
of excellence and community involvement are important and we cannot have one without 
the other. As other members have said, we need grass-roots involvement and youth 
involvement to produce the elite athletes of the future. At the same time, elite 
athletes should be able to inspire the young people who are coming on.</P><P>As 
many members have said, sport is central to the promotion of social justice. It 
is also essential to the delivery of national priorities in education and health 
improvement. The Executive's physical activities strategy will be published tomorrow.</P><P>There 
is a desperate need to address the low level of physical activity in our population. 
We must foster habits of physical activity in young people. That will enable them 
not only to live longer&#151;medical intervention can enable people to live longer&#151;but 
to live healthier.</P><P>As we have heard, sport has the potential to regenerate 
communities. It empowers citizens and contributes to crime prevention by providing 
alternatives to anti-social behaviour. I agree with Tom McCabe that, unfortunately, 
the local and national media tend to prefer to concentrate on the bad things that 
young people do rather than the great successes that many young people achieve. 
It is a pity that we do not see better reporting of young people's successes in 
the field of sport.</P><P>Donald Gorrie is quite correct to say that the clubs 
are the cornerstone of sport in Scotland. We acknowledge that and are in discussions 
with sportscotland. One of sport 21's original aims was to foster more coaches 
and to provide better training for them. Unfortunately, we have not been able 
to deliver on that as well as we wanted to and we will return to that issue in 
the review of sport 21.</P><P>Johann Lamont made an important point about girls 
and young women. Unfortunately, girls' level of physical activity declines much 
faster than that of boys. By the age of 14, the majority of young girls are not 
taking sufficient physical exercise and </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18127">18127</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>we must address that in a number of ways. The same is true of older women, 
and I say that as someone who does not take enough exercise.</P><P>We have a number 
of programmes aimed at young people. I will not use up all my time by going through 
them, but examples include the new opportunities fund, the quality of life funding 
and end-year flexibility money. School sports development officers have been around 
for almost four years but that programme will be extended and we hope that it 
will be taken up in all schools, so that we can introduce young people to as many 
different sports as possible and give them choices, so that they can find a sport 
that they like and which they will continue to do in later life.</P><P>A scheme 
that is being worked up at the moment is the sports ambassador scheme. In that, 
we are aiming to use top sportspeople, such as the Commonwealth games medal winners, 
to work with young people and to provide good role models for them, and to promote 
healthy lifestyles and activities. I hope that we will be making an announcement 
on that soon.</P><P>A number of members mentioned sports facilities. The 2002 
spending review includes a commitment to a national indoor facility. Certainly, 
part of the Euro 2008 bid legacy will focus on community and youth sports. Unfortunately, 
I cannot yet give Johann Lamont details, but I am sure that someone will be making 
an announcement in the future. We have been engaged in recent discussions with 
sportscotland and others about future requirements for indoor training facilities. 
We have also had discussions with the Scottish Football Association about its 
review of youth football and about the sort of training facilities that are required 
to improve our football chances.</P><P>Jamie Stone mentioned the problems of rural 
and remote areas. I recognise those problems because I come from a rural area. 
I know that access can be more difficult in more geographically remote areas. 
Access will be part of the review strategy.</P><P>While I am on that subject, 
members might be aware of the sportscotland consultation document &quot;Time to 
Speak Up&quot;. The final review document will be launched at the end of March, 
and I hope that members of all parties will come to the launch. The document is 
not party political; it is about Scotland's sports strategy, and I hope that we 
will all be able to sign up to it.</P><P>On support for young athletes and their 
kit, which Tom McCabe has raised with me, the governing bodies are responsible 
for sending out representative teams that are properly prepared. The talented 
athletes programme includes some contributions towards kit. The junior groups 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18128">18128</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>funding can also provide some funding towards kit, but that would go through 
the governing bodies.</P><P>On start-up grants for trusts, I am happy to discuss 
that with sportscotland. Off the top of my head, I wonder whether some of them 
might qualify for awards from the Community Fund. I am taking a stab in saying 
that, but I am happy to look into the matter.</P><P>Irene McGugan made the point 
that people do not know about diets and supplements. The Scottish Institute of 
Sport at elite level provides a sports medicine department and advice on diet 
and appropriate exercise. That advice is also available through the six area institutes, 
so mechanisms and structures are in place to provide that sort of advice to young 
people.</P><P>There is not much more for me to say, because my seven minutes are
