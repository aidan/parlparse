<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>The
purpose of this amendment and the consequential amendment 10 is to clarify
the standard of proof that is to be applied by the sheriff in consideration
of appeals presented under sections 64 and 66 of the Mental Health (Scotland)
Act 1984.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section 1 covers the burden of proof, but
the standard of proof requires separate consideration. Does the minister
consider that, in weighing the evidence, the sheriff need only be satisfied
in accordance with the civil law test-that is, on the balance of probabilities-or
does he require to satisfy himself in accordance with the criminal law
test of beyond reasonable doubt?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the minister takes the view, as I trust
he does, that the balance of probabilities test is the appropriate standard
of proof, is he satisfied that that does not require to be expressly stated
in the bill as being the appropriate test in relation to the prior issue
of protection of the public from serious harm that the sheriff will now
be required to consider in proceedings under this section and section 66
as amended?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those are my comments on amendment 1. I
am down to speak on a number of other amendments and, before I move amendment
1, I want to comment on amendment 6, which has also been lodged in my name.
Phil Gallie will, if he is invited to, speak to the other amendments that
are in my name in this group on the order paper.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On amendment 6, I wish to highlight some
concerns about the bill that have been raised by the Scottish Association
for Mental Health, based on the sheriff's findings in the Ruddle case.
The sheriff commented that there was not simply a therapeutic delay in
the receipt by Mr Ruddle of specific focus psychological treatment, but
that, in fact, treatment was never made available to him, nor was it available.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In his judgment, the sheriff also expressed
disappointment that the board or management committee of the state hospital
was unable to make necessary arrangements to provide the treatment that
was considered clinically necessary&nbsp;</font></td>

medical officer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The new provisions, which we support, require
the sheriff to give prior consideration to the issue of public safety.
If the sheriff is not satisfied that it would be safe to order the discharge
of the patient, that is the end of the matter and the other issues that
are covered by section 64 do not require to be decided.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Given the failures to provide treatment
and to protect the interests of the patient that were identified by the
sheriff in the Ruddle case, we believe that it would be desirable to empower
the sheriff to make recommendations in his judgment as to the suitability
of the health care that is being provided to the patient in the hospital
in which he is to continue to be detained in the interests of public safety.
In our view, that strikes an important balance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Roseanna Cunningham has raised a similar
point in amendment 7 and she will wish to expand on that line of reasoning
when she addresses the committee. The difference between her approach and
ours is that her amendment would empower the sheriff to make a mandatory
order in relation to treatment, whereas our view is that a less prescriptive
approach is required.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The recommendations that my amendment would
empower the sheriff to make would carry considerable weight and authority,
while giving the minister, hospital officials and expert medical staff
the necessary flexibility to determine how such recommendations were implemented
in the interests of the patient.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I refer briefly
to a letter that was handed to me shortly before the start of the debate.
The letter is from Bruce Millan to Jim Wallace, the Minister for Justice
and Deputy First Minister; Bruce Millan is writing in his capacity as chairman
of the review committee of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Along with other members, I have known
Bruce Millan, the former Secretary of State for Scotland, for many years.
There is a great deal of respect for him throughout the country, so members
should listen carefully to what he has to say. In some respects he might
have been able to write the speech that I gave last week in which I criticised
the way in which this legislation-on a complex matter-was being dealt with
in a rush, without the serious consideration that it requires.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy First Minister and Minister
for Justice (Mr Jim Wallace): </strong>I am sure that Dennis Canavan will acknowledge
that the letter was given to him as a member who has lodged amendments.
It has been published, along with a written answer from me, because Mr
Millan wanted the contents to be made available to the Parliament. Indeed,
copies of the correspondence are available at the information point at
the back of the chamber.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>I am grateful to
the Deputy First Minister for that intervention and I strongly recommend
that members read Bruce Millan's letter before voting on the amendments.
Writing on behalf of his committee, Bruce Millan says that the committee
has asked him</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"to express serious concern about the effect
of the Scottish Executive's response to the Sheriff's decision in the case
of Noel Ruddle".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He goes on to say that</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"it is a matter of great regret to us that
a complex and difficult area is being dealt with by emergency legislation,
in a timescale which has made it impossible for us to consider the terms
of the Bill with the care that it requires."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He also says-and this has relevance to
my group of amendments-that the committee</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"feels that the scope of the legislation
seems to us to go beyond a limited response to the Ruddle case, and elevates
a necessary regard for public safety above matters of treatment and appropriate
care, in a manner which is damaging to the way in which we deal with mental
health problems generally."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He states:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We would add that mental health legislation
is intended to deal with many people with differing needs, not only the
tiny number who pose a serious danger to the public."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

in Scotland who are suffering from mental ill health and who are dangerous
or potentially dangerous. We should&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">target that group
of people in a precise way. I am not convinced that the wording of the
legislation does that, which is why I lodged the amendments. They would
ensure not only that there was still adequate protection for public safety,
but that people who presented a threat to public safety were precisely
targeted by the emergency legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Amendments 4, 13, 19 and 23 are similarly
worded, as are 5, 14, 20 and 24. If someone has a condition which cannot
be treated and the sheriff, in hearing an appeal, comes to the conclusion
that, on the evidence given to him, the person's condition cannot be treated,
why should that person be detained in a hospital? If the person constitutes
such a danger or potential danger to the public that he or she ought to
be detained, the question arises whether a hospital is the best place for
that person to be detained. Would not a high-security prison be a more
appropriate place for someone who has a condition that cannot be treated
in hospital? What is the point of sending someone back to hospital if that
person cannot be given adequate, required treatment?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Under the Scotland Act 1998, we have a
responsibility to ensure that all the legislation passed by this Parliament
is in accordance with the European convention on human rights. However,
doubts have been expressed about whether the bill conforms to it. The Law
Society of Scotland wrote to me-I assume that it wrote a similar letter
to all members-saying:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The Parliament in enacting such legislation
will need to be satisfied that the Bill is consistent with provisions of
Section 29 of the Scotland Act 1998, especially in relation to compliance
with the European Convention on Human Rights. This is particularly pertinent
due to the creation of the new ground of detention in section 1".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It refers to that ground of detention as</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"a form of preventative detention",</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and says that it is</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"important to know what rights will attach
to those affected by this bill and what resources will be applied."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Roseanna Cunningham may deal with this
matter when she speaks to her amendment-the principles behind which I also
support-but I would like the Minister for Justice or Lord Advocate or whoever
is replying in this debate to tell us what study they have given to possible
conflict with the European convention on human rights and how they can
justify saying that this legislation is consistent with the terms of the
convention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

is important that the correspondence which the Minister for Justice has
released in a written answer should be known, but I would not want members
to go beyond the strict terms of the amendments that we are debating.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>Amendment 3 follows in part the amendments lodged by Mr Canavan, but
it is slightly different. I would like the word "serious" to be removed
from the definition of serious harm because I feel that confusion could
arise in the minds of the public, if not in that of the sheriff. What does
it mean when we use "serious" as an adjective for "harm"? Does it cover
physical or psychological harm, or does it cover harm as far as individuals'
property interests are concerned? Does the bill consider that sexual interference
is serious-or that physical violence that results in the hospitalisation
of an individual is not so serious? I would appreciate it if the minister
would clarify the intent behind the use of the word "serious".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Amendment 8 refers to the burden of proof
on Scottish ministers in judging the public risk if an individual were
to be released or allowed to leave the institution. Who will the ministers
take advice from? Is it intended that they should have medical back-up?
If so, would that medical expertise come from within the hospital? If it
comes from within the hospital, will the familiarity with the individual
perhaps mean that some aspects of that individual's suitability are missed?
Should there be an independent element to the medical advice offered to
the ministers? Will the ministers seek guidance from the police and from
others about the public risk? Will they have regard to what has happened
in the past, to the reasons why that individual was taken into the institution
and to that individual's criminal track record? Those questions must be
answered; again, I seek clarification from the minister.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Amendment 9 is a probing amendment. It
seeks to remove proposed subsection (C1) in section 1, which states:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Nothing in section 102 (State Hospitals)
of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 prevents or restricts
the detention of a patient".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am sure that a range of acts and sections
do not affect that action, so why did the minister feel it necessary to
insert subsection (C1) in the bill?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Convener:</strong> Thank you. I call

amendment 7.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP): </strong>The
SNP amendments are designed to focus on those areas over which we consider
there to be question marks and to which we consider significant improvements
can be made while retaining the core point of the legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In that spirit, amendment 7, which stands
in my name and in the name of my colleague, Michael Matheson, has been
designed to deal with a situation that arose in the Ruddle case. It relates
not to the question of his release, but to the debate about his treatment
while he was in Carstairs. We have dubbed this question the "treatability
question". I will not refer at length to Bruce Millan's letter, but I note
that he refers to his concern about the bill's involvement in</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"matters of treatment and appropriate care".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The amendment was lodged in that context.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last week, I argued that, rather than being
untreatable, Noel Ruddle was, in fact, treatable but that the state hospital
at Carstairs did not have the means by which to treat him. To support that
comment, I refer to the sheriff's judgment in the Ruddle case. Under the
general heading "Progress in the State Hospital", the sheriff makes a number
of findings. I make no apology for quoting him at some length, as what
he says is extremely important in the context of our discussion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">15:00</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Paragraph 7.4 of the sheriff's judgment
says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The applicant was referred for psychological
treatment interventions or therapy packages in October 1994 and April 1995
but, apart from being assessed for psychological treatment, none was made
available to the applicant and, in January 1997, his Responsible Medical
Officer was informed that the psychology department in the hospital had
no-one then providing a service to patients with addiction problems."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Paragraph 7.15 says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"By the time the Medical Sub-Committee
came to review the applicant's case in 1998, it was known that none of
the psychological treatment planned since 1994, and expected at the State
Hospital up to 1997, had taken place".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should not be hugely surprised that,
after that catalogue of non-treatment, Mr Ruddle was reclassified as "untreatable".
That is to use the word untreatable in a rather different context from
the one in which most people in this debate apprehend it. The suspicion
looms large that "untreatable" in the context of the above meant "untreatable
at Carstairs", given the resources that were available at the time. Nothing
that was said&nbsp;</font></td>

debate or anywhere else removes that suspicion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The suspicion that such circumstances could
arise again could be removed if we built into the legislation what is proposed
in this amendment. The sheriff could make an order on the delivery of treatment
to an individual-not on the treatment itself, which is not the sheriff's
responsibility-and ensure that the authorities complied with it within
a reasonable time scale. The provision would be discretionary. I heard
what Mr McLetchie said, but we are not for making it mandatory. If Mr McLetchie
reads the amendment carefully, he will realise that the order would be
made only if the sheriff considered it appropriate in all the circumstances
that he has heard in a case.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not think that that is an outrageous
imposition. In any civilised society, if people are detained in such circumstances
the utmost must be done to ensure that treatment is made available to them.
The bill's total lack of any such assurance is causing much of the concern
that is being expressed by many external commentators, including some who
have already been mentioned.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scottish Association for Mental Health
has flagged up the failure to treat Ruddle over a period of five years
as a major issue in the provision of mental health services. Things should
never have come to that. If the treatment that was deemed appropriate had
been delivered to Mr Ruddle, we would not be here now. However, there is
no mention in the bill of any measures that would ensure that patients
will have the right to access treatment where that treatment exists. Without
this amendment, we are in danger of defining a small category of individuals
who can be dumped, apparently with impunity. We should not do that and
we should not allow the suspicion that we are doing it to arise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is not the place for a full-scale
debate on the provision of mental health services, although I hope that
such a debate will have been triggered as a result of our deliberations
over the past few weeks. We can at least ensure that this bill, which covers
only a small number of people, contains a safeguard that no one will be
left, as Noel Ruddle was for years, without the treatment that his doctors
at the time thought appropriate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Now that all the
amendments have been spoken to, it might be helpful if I were to give some
indication of the Executive's response to them. There will be an opportunity
for other members to intervene in the debate and I shall be happy to respond
to their points.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">safety. It is not
surprising that there are so many amendments to the section, as public
safety is at the heart of our proposals to close the gap that has been
identified in the Ruddle case. We seek to close that gap by ensuring that
mentally disordered patients are not discharged from hospital if they are
still considered to present a risk of serious harm to the public. I hope
that I can give reassurance through my response to the amendments that
we have closed the loophole that was highlighted in the recent case.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr McLetchie moved amendment 1, which seeks
to ensure that the sheriff, in considering an appeal, is satisfied that,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"on the balance of probabilities,"</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the patient is suffering from a mental
disorder and that it is necessary for reasons of public safety to continue
to detain him in hospital. Amendment 10, which is linked to that, raises
the same point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I can assure Mr McLetchie and other members
that the sheriff, when hearing such appeals, sits in a civil capacity and
is, therefore, required to consider evidence on the basis of the balance
of probabilities-not beyond reasonable doubt. The presumption in all such
civil cases is that the sheriff proceeds on the basis of the balance of
probability, as is reflected in current practice. Therefore, while I understand
where Mr McLetchie's amendment is coming from, there is no need for that
to be put in the bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I shall take the amendments in the order
in which they appear on the marshalled list, rather than in the order in
which they were spoken to. Amendment 2, lodged by Mr Canavan, seeks to
replace our public safety test with one that would</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"prevent the patient constituting a danger
to himself or to the public".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That provides for a far less stringent
public safety test than the bill envisages for appeals to the sheriff.
Mr Canavan asked whether there were precedents for the test. Section 68
of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 applies the same test and some
criminal legislation refers to a similar one. If the bill is passed as
I propose, section 64(1)(a) of the 1984 act will state that if the sheriff

Bruce Millan's committee is doing. One of the things that we were concerned
about and about which we took great care when drafting the legislation
was the need to restrict the scope of the bill to that which was necessary
to cope with the situation that we faced. We also wanted to put it on record
that the legislation was an interim measure, pending the result of a more
wide-ranging review of the 1984 act.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</strong>Does not the minister consider that, if the bill is not more explicit,
precisely the same set of circumstances that led to Ruddle's release might
recur? If we put something specific in the bill along the lines that I
suggested, we will ensure that such a recurrence is, if not impossible,
at least guarded against. Currently, there is no safeguard.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>When I come to deal
specifically with Ms Cunningham's amendments, I will try to give her some
reassurances about the provision for patients in the state hospital.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that amendment 2 falls short of what we are trying to achieve in the bill,
and that he will not press it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Amendment 3 was spoken to by Mr Gallie.
It seeks to amend the test of "serious harm" to the public to the lesser
test of simply "harm". Some of the points that I addressed to Mr Canavan
are relevant. When considering the crucial provision, we chose the term
"serious harm" with care. It is a term that is used in criminal law and
in mental health legislation. Its meaning is well understood, and is applied
by sheriffs and judges. It achieves our aim of detaining only patients
who present a serious risk to the public. It is not the intention of this
Parliament that any person with a mental disorder who has committed an
offence should be detained in hospital for ever and a day. That would be
well beyond what we feel is required to protect the public. Indeed, it
is questionable whether that would comply with our obligations under the
European convention on human rights. I repeat our view that the bill as
drafted achieves the correct balance between the safety of the public and
the rights of those with mental disorders. In doing so, it uses a legislative
term that is already familiar.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Amendment 4 seeks to leave out "hospital"
as a place where a patient can be detained to protect the public from serious
harm. The fact is that a patient on a hospital order and a restriction
order who loses his appeal must continue to be detained in hospital. If
that is the sentence of the court, there is no power that allows for that
person to be transferred to a prison. The European convention on human
rights makes it absolutely clear that a patient must continue to be detained
in a hospital; there is not an alternative. Where a patient is on a transfer
direction and a restriction direction, and the sheriff is satisfied that
the patient has a mental disorder that meets the public safety test, the
patient will remain detained in hospital. He will not be transferred to
prison; there is no power that allows him to be transferred to prison.
That relates to the Ruddle case.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

is now a provision whereby a court may impose a hospital direction that
allows a person convicted of an offence to go first to hospital and then,
if he recovers, to prison. However, that can happen only in cases where
a hospital direction has been imposed by the courts. That was not the case
with Ruddle; nor is it the case with others whose cases came to court before
the introduction of that order, which came into force on, I think, 1 January
1998.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Getting the balance right between hospital
and prison for people who commit crimes and have personality disorders
is an issue that the MacLean committee is considering.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>If, in a particular
case, the sheriff comes to the conclusion that the patient cannot be treated,
what is the point of sending the patient back to hospital? Is not that
just reducing the role of hospital staff and nurses to that of prison warders?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>The sheriff has to decide
whether the patient is suffering from a mental disorder, and then decide-and
this is the loophole that we are trying to close with the legislation-whether
the person poses a threat of serious harm to the public. The person must
continue to be detained if the sheriff believes that the First Minister
has discharged his burden of proof in establishing that the person could
cause serious harm to the public. The purpose is to ensure continuous detention
in the interests of public safety.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That goes to the heart of what we are trying
to do with the bill-to close a loophole. Under the law as it stands-and
as it was applied to cases before the introduction of hospital directions-there
is no power to transfer to prison a person who has been committed to a
hospital by the court. It might be contrary to the European convention
on human rights to do so. We are saying that a person who has a mental
disorder must remain in hospital.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Gallie spoke to amendment 9. Our concern
is that if it is accepted, it could cast doubt on the ability of the state
hospital to hold patients who might be regarded as untreatable. That could
well undermine the bill. One can imagine a clever lawyer using the argument
that the state hospital could not hold a patient deemed untreatable by
the sheriff. I am not saying that would succeed, but it is an argument
that could be used. That might be another loophole; this is an effort to
close it. We want to ensure that that argument is not available to a future
case.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That raises many similar arguments. Mr
Ruddle was successful in his appeal as he was deemed to be untreatable.
To remove those words from the section would mean that someone who was
deemed to be untreatable could not be detained in hospital, irrespective
of the fact that he continued to be a serious risk to the public. That
would strike at the heart of what the bill is trying to achieve.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr McLetchie and Ms Cunningham mentioned
the availability of treatment. Amendments 6 and 7 would allow sheriffs
to make recommendations on the suitability of keeping a patient in hospital
and on the facilities and services that could be made available to the
patient. Amendment 7 would further give a permissive power to sheriffs
to make an order requiring the provision of particular treatment services,
with which Scottish ministers would have to comply.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This bill asserts the primacy of public
safety when a sheriff considers an appeal. The Government is concerned
that linking public safety and service issues in the way that such amendments
tend to do would run counter to the aim of the bill. The bill singles out
public safety as the principal test to which sheriffs must have regard.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I accept that it is right that no hospital
should be just a place to which patients are sent, with the key then thrown
away without attention being paid to what is necessary for the patients'
welfare and well-being.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important that hospital management
and ministers have regard to those considerations, and we do. The aim of
the inquiry that we requested of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland
was to give us guidance in relation to the services and facilities that
could be provided for patients who are untreatable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am pleased to give the assurance that
the state hospital will be allocated the resources that it needs to provide
the care and treatment that are determined by clinicians as being appropriate
to their patients. It is important that clinicians, not sheriffs, determine
the treatment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Gallie also referred to amendment 8.
The burden of proof in relation to the new public safety provision falls
on Scottish ministers. We take it seriously, and we will make sure that
the best possible advice is taken in reaching a view on any case and in
presenting a case to a sheriff.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

people who are so detained while at the same time taking away their liberty.

capable of being treated but was released nevertheless. That would not

at the patient's unit. For instance, Carstairs might not have the appropriate
facilities and the sheriff would be able to take a different course of
action.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The state is thus obliged to provide the
sheriff with sufficient evidence about the patient's historic treatment
and about treatment prevailing generally when he considers an appeal. Such
evidence was not available to the sheriff in the Ruddle case. He says in
his report that the treatments</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"have not been made available and the evidence
is unsatisfactory as to whether they would now be likely to alleviate or
prevent a deterioration in the applicant's condition."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The sheriff does not say that the treatment
was not there, but says that the quality of the Crown's evidence in the
case was not good. The state is obliged to provide evidence for the sheriff,
to make sure that the right action is being taken for an individual. I
think that that raises the issue of the European convention on human rights,
which Mr Canavan mentioned. We need to strike a balance between the state's
duty to the public and its duty to the individual.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the state takes away an individual's
liberty by detaining him or her in a mental hospital, that should place
a duty on the state to exhibit on appeal the availability of treatment
for that individual. That information should not come out in later evidence,
but should be one of the first considerations in a case. It also means
that, if such evidence is not exhibited during the first appeal, there
should be a further appeal should the sheriff find that such evidence has
not been brought.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

our sensible amendment strengthens the bill and will provide a fair balance

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">difficult. Those
in psychiatry are debating the issue at considerable length, for example
in reference to confidentiality. One of the problems currently facing psychiatrists
is the duty of the psychiatrist when a patient reveals information during
a clinical discussion about harm or possible harm that they intend towards
the public. It is emerging from the discussions-and it is relevant to the
debate-that psychiatrists are suggesting, as are some of the judgments
in other countries, that the harm intended by the patient should be quite
specific. It should not be a generality of harm, but should be specific
to one individual. In other words, it should be focused and serious in
its nature. To leave out the word "serious" could lead to the detention
of many people in the state hospital who would, as a result of a personality
disorder, cause some harm to the public. I think that that would be wrong
and is against the general tenor of Mr Canavan's speech. The balance that
Mr Wallace referred to is crucial and we must not affect it by removing
the word "serious".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I shall deal with the question of detention
in a hospital as opposed to detention in prison. I worked in Cornton Vale
prison for 23 years. We saw inmates who were transferred to the state hospital
at Carstairs and back during that time. In my view, those who suffered
from a serious personality disorder were much better managed- not treated,
but managed-in the state system. The difference between treatment and management
lies at the heart of the problem that the Parliament faces. As I said last
week, we would not have had to deal with the Ruddle loophole if the treatability
test had been met. In the past 15 years since the 1984 act was introduced,
there has been movement in psychiatrists' views about what is and is not
treatable, which has caused the loophole in the act.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our colleagues in England and Wales have
been lucky because so far there has not been a successful appeal under
a similar act in England and Wales. I understand that, like us, they are
considering the act under similar reviews to that of MacLean and Millan.
I hope that they are not faced with a similar difficulty to this one. I
suggest that treatment in the state hospital is to the advantage of the
patient, because their welfare and well-being can be better managed there
than in the prison service.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

specific.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

they propose to go out and kill a specific individual, that is clearly
a serious matter. If, on the other hand, they express a general threat

indictment of the inability to provide the treatment required. I do not
think that the answers given so far have reassured anybody.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have had two strands of thought. Mr
Wallace said we should not worry about it; it will not happen again. I
am afraid that if we are to trust him he will have to have a bit more of
a track record than he has displayed so far. Then he said we should not
worry because the matter has gone to the Mental Welfare Commission. That
means that he is not confident that the facilities existed. I welcome that
move, but if what is being considered is a one-off assessment of needs
and services to find out whether they are adequate, why not extend that
logic and enable the court to do exactly the same as is being suggested
in this case? If it is worth examining the facilities this time to find
out if they are adequate, why not do that in each case, as is suggested
by the SNP amendment?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Minister for Community Care
(Iain Gray): </strong>We must get beyond the confusion about this. Is Mr Hamilton
aware that until 9 March this year the RMO was convinced of the treatability
of Mr Ruddle? On that date he changed his view on the basis of discussions
with his colleagues and decided that Mr Ruddle was not treatable. On 10
March, the appeal began. The basis of Mr Ruddle's appeal and release is
that he was considered to be untreatable, not the lack of treatment, as
Mr Hamilton says. Criticisms were made in the sheriff's report and that
is why the Mental Welfare Commission report has been asked for. Let us
be clear that the decision was that Mr Ruddle was not treatable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Hamilton: </strong>Yes, but the sting
in the tail was at the end. For four years the reports were very clear,
as the sheriff said in his judgment-that the treatment was not being provided.
As has been said, that is why the commission was set up. How can a guarantee
be given that it will not happen again? It all comes back to what Richard
Simpson said: that there is a lot of agreement with what we are saying
but you do not want to put it into legislation. That is an odd view of
legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the rights and interests of society as a whole and of the individual. If
you believe in the amendment in&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">principle it seems
odd not to take that principle forward in legislation. The amendment directs
the sheriff to look not only at the nature of the treatment that is being
given in the institution but at the delivery of treatment. That was another
area of confusion-it is a question not of the sheriff directing treatment
but of the sheriff directing the delivery of treatment and, if treatment
is not available, ensuring that it is, whether by its being brought in
or by moving the patient. We must be clear about the difference between
treatment and the delivery of treatment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is fair enough to talk about public
safety and the public interest, but it is also in the public interest that
people who are treatable should be given treatment. It is not in anyone's
interest to say that they are not treatable, so we will lock them up on
a technicality and throw away the key. We must guard against that in the
bill and that is what the amendment tries to do.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Patients' rights are being paid no more
than lip service. It is not enough to assume that, in the public interest
and for reasons of public safety, society has an absolute right to ride
roughshod over every other right-that is not acceptable in a modern, democratic
society. The Government is obsessed with the phrase, "rights and responsibilities"-if
you take on yourself the right to remove somebody's liberty, you have the
responsibility to ensure that they receive treatment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that responsibility.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire)
(LD): </strong>I will confine my remarks to amendment 7, and in particular the
process that is described therein, as I do not understand it well. It appears
from the amendment that the appeal and the sheriff's order can happen only
once, and that ministers must then apply the sheriff's order.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Does the facility exist to repeat the process
if circumstances change? The way the amendment is phrased means that it
is a one-off process. There is no mechanism in the amendment to allow the
situation to be revisited if circumstances change after the order has been
made and the timetable has been set. My difficulty with the amendment may
be obscure, but it is serious, because if the amendment is agreed to and
the process can operate only once and with no amending facility, in my
view it is defective.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

enough to propose to use national health service resources as an extension
of the prison service.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

you know where to find the answer, or you know a man or woman who might

Commission for Scotland, I was appalled by the first paragraph:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The commission has had to consider the
above Bill very quickly, since its Director was invited to a briefing by
civil servants on Friday 27 August. The commission was not consulted about
the proposed Bill."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That seems to me to compound the errors
the Administration made over the previous months. It is now introducing
legislation that it has failed to discuss properly with one of the principal
organisations that should have been consulted. That may come back to haunt
us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The difficulty is dealing with various
amendments at this juncture. We are dealing with matters only for a limited
period of time. The number of people involved is limited. I will refer
to information provided to me by other organisations. The people we are
discussing are referred to in a Home Office paper on England and Wales,
"Managing Dangerous People with Severe Personality Disorder", which has
just been issued. It estimates that there are about 300 to 600 such men.
It suggests that if the numbers are in proportion there are about 30 to
60 in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The paper says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"personality disorders are common. People
with personality disorders fall on a continuum from near normal behaviour
to extreme disruption in personal and social functioning. The overwhelming
majority do not pose a risk to the public and live reasonably ordered,
crime-free lives. The small proportion of such people who do pose a risk
often suffer from the type of personality disorder that manifests in serious
anti-social behaviour. It is a minority even of this sub group who pose
a very high risk to society."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the bill, we are dealing with some people
who remain in the state system in Carstairs who are not subject to a section
74 hospital order and who are not free on the public streets or free to
be released from prison in due course. That is a small number of people
so we must bear in mind two key factors.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First, steps must be taken to deal with
the issue of treatability. Secondly, we must deal with the issue of personality
disorders. We will debate later whether the definition requires to be tighter.
It seems insufficient to leave it as a matter of personality disorder.
We must be tight in our definition and clear about what we are discussing,
otherwise there is a danger that individuals will suffer injustice because
they suffer from a personality disorder as a result of which they are no
danger to other members of the public. That issue must be addressed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I will try to be
brief. Mrs Grahame is right about balancing the interests and rights of
detainees with the right of the public to safety. We have sought to achieve
that balance in framing this bill. We recognise the rights of detainees,
but we also recognise the rights of the&nbsp;</font></td>

duty as a Parliament to secure public safety. That is why I gave an undertaking
that the bill would comply with the European convention on human rights-which,
independently, the Presiding Officer has also done. We are trying to strike
the right balance between those rights.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Richard Simpson mentioned the use of the
term "serious". Serious harm is a well-known term and it is one that those
practised in psychiatry are able to identify. In each case, it will be
a matter for the evidence that is brought before the sheriff. Some of the
evidence will come from those who have treated the patient. It may come
from independent people-some of whom have been mentioned in the amendments.
It may also come from police, security personnel and at Carstairs there
may have been social work involvement in some cases. The sheriff will have
to decide on the balance of all that evidence whether ministers have discharged
the burden of proof on them that, on a balance of probabilities, to protect
the public from serious harm, the appeal should not be granted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Gallie asked, "What kind of behaviour?"
Again, it depends on the circumstances of the case. He asked, for example,
whether opportuning would be sufficiently alarming and damaging to be covered
by serious harm. If it were of a dimension that could give rise to evidence
that it was likely to cause serious harm, that would be the kind of evidence
that would be placed before the sheriff, and the sheriff would have to
make a determination on that basis.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Much of the debate has hinged on the question
of treatability. It should be remembered that in paragraph 10.6 of his
judgment, the sheriff said that</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"since the medical treatment that the applicant
has received and is at present receiving has not alleviated or prevented
and is not likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of his condition,
he does not meet the 'treatability test' and it is not appropriate for
him to be liable to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment, nor
to remain liable to be recalled to hospital for further treatment."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>To help this
part of the debate, will the minister consider setting aside the issue
of Noel Ruddle? Is the minister saying that he can envisage no circumstances
in which someone who was deemed to be untreatable by one institution might
be treatable elsewhere?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>As Mr Galbraith said,
such a person would be considered treatable. Kay Ullrich and others suggested
that untreatable people could be sent to prison. I made it clear earlier
that if the original disposal of a case resulted in a hospital order with
no imprisonment-it is possible to get a hospital order in conjunction with
a sentence of imprisonment-it would not be permissible for the patient
to be sent to prison. It&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That raises the interesting question of
what the sheriff should do when, on taking account of the facilities, as
he would be obliged to do, he finds them to be unsuitable. Would we be
creating another loophole? We are trying to remain focused on what we are
trying to do with this bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>With respect,
I think that Mr Wallace's criticism might apply to Mr McLetchie's amendment
but it does not apply to mine. It is because of the point that Mr Wallace
raises that my amendment suggests what the sheriff might do if there are
concerns about the suitability of the facility.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>The amendment says that

not want legislation on those areas at this stage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">long in moving
this amendment. This probing amendment has serious implications. It refers
to subsection 1(5), and to the inclusion of the date of 1 September 1999
as a starting point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I query that date. Our reason for suggesting
a date of 2 September is that we agree in principle with what we believe
the aim of the legislation to be. As such, this amendment would have no
effect on the bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Retrospection does not sit easily with
the law. The bill itself was not approved for progression by Parliament
until 2 September. I am concerned that the date of 1 September was set.
Why was that date selected by the minister? What is the effect of that
date and can it be challenged in the future?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I move amendment 25.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Convener (Ms Patricia Ferguson):
</strong>Thank you, Mr Gallie.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>I would like to
speak briefly to amendment 31 in my name. It proposes to delete section
3(2) of the bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Like Mr Gallie, I am concerned about the
retrospective nature of this legislation. Any legislator in a democracy
must be very wary indeed about retrospective legislation, and I am not
alone in expressing that concern.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have received representations from the
Law Society of Scotland. The society is concerned about the possibility
of aspects of this legislation being retrospective. There should be no
disjunction between the coming into force of sections 1 and 3 and section
2. That includes, for example, the application of the prior test, the definition
of personality disorder and the appeal provisions. All provisions of the
bill should come into force at the same time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section 3(2), however, states:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The amendment made by subsection (1) above
has effect . . . as from 1 September 1999."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That date has already passed. That part
of the bill, under the bill's proposals, would therefore be retrospective.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The European convention on human rights
also has something to say about retrospective legislation. I reiterate
what I said earlier about the fact that all the legislation passed by this
Parliament must be consistent with the European convention on human rights.
Under article 7, it says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"No one shall be held guilty of any criminal
offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal
offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed.
Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable
at the time the criminal offence was committed."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Minister is going
to say in his reply. He will say that, in debating this bill, we are considering
civil law rather than criminal law. Unlike the minister, I am not a lawyer.
It appears to me, however, that this is a hazy area that impinges on both
criminal and civil law.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I said, the convention clearly prohibits
the imposition of a heavier penalty than was applicable at the time that
the criminal offence was committed. The question is whether detention in
a state hospital is a penalty or enforced detention for treatment. In certain
cases, detention in a state hospital is a consequence of being found guilty
of a crime. In the case that gave rise to the introduction of the emergency
legislation, I think that I am right in saying that Mr Ruddle was found
guilty of a criminal offence. We must consider whether in legal terms his
detention in Carstairs was a punishment, a penalty, or simply a compulsory
form of detention for treatment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

appears to be an element of retrospection-or retrospectivity as the clerks
have put it-that touches on both criminal law and civil law. Therefore,
there might be conflict with the European convention on human rights. It
would be better to delete section 3(2) and have all the legislation under
the bill coming into force at one time, rather than certain aspects of
it coming into force retrospectively.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The amendments both
deal with the issue of the retrospective application of the provisions
and I will deal with them together. Our objective, and the purpose underlying
the bill as it stands, is to ensure that the hearing of any appeal to the
sheriff by a restricted patient, subsequent to the Ruddle case, should
be caught by the public safety test that is set out in the bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is why we have proceeded by way of
emergency procedures in the Parliament. To ensure that every appeal hearing
is brought within the scope of section 1 of the bill, section 1(5) provides
that any appeals proceedings under section 64, 65 or 66 of the 1984 Act,
in which a hearing takes place on or after 1 September, will be considered
in the light of the new public safety test. In the same way, cases of patients
considered for discharge by Scottish ministers on or after that date will
also be subject to that new test.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Mr Gallie's point, 1 September is the
date on which the bill was published. In other words, it is the date on
which public notice of the detailed intentions was given. It is fair to
say that a general indication had already been flagged up, but that was
the date on which the bill was in the public domain. The amendment seeks
to change the operative date. I accept it as a probing amendment, and I
hope that Mr Gallie is satisfied&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">that that is why
that date was chosen. I am satisfied that it will catch the hearing of
all appeals currently in train, and that there is no argument for letting
the date slip by a day.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am also satisfied to address Mr Canavan's
point on whether what we are doing is compatible with the requirements
of the European convention on human rights. Mr Canavan's amendment seeks
to delete section 3(2), which ensures that the meaning of mental disorder
is clarified. There will be a section of amendments dealing with that issue
later, Ms Ferguson.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The effect of Mr Canavan's amendment would
be that that definition section would not come into effect on 1 September.
In short, section 3(2) is required to ensure consistency in the operation
of the public safety provisions and the definition of mental disorder.
Without section 3(2) there is the possibility of undermining the operation
of the new public safety test, as there would be a disjuncture between
that and the rest of the bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Canavan specifically referred to article
7 of the European convention on human rights. As he indicated, that article
prevents the imposition of a heavier penalty than that applicable at the
time of the relevant criminal offence. In the case of Mr Ruddle, he was
guilty of culpable homicide. Patients who can appeal have been before a
court of law, and detention under the 1984 Act-now to be amended-is for
the purpose of treatment or for protection of the public, both of which
will have to have been satisfied on the patient's admission with a restriction
order or equivalent. The admission criteria in section 17 of the 1984 act
have to be met, and the bill does not provide anything that could be categorised
as a penalty under the European convention on human rights.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is, in fact, no general prohibition
on retrospective legislation in the ECHR. We have considered this matter
and I am confident that the measure that has been put forward complies
with our obligations. As I have already indicated, the Presiding Officer
had, on separate advice, equally to be satisfied. Mr Gallie asked whether
the legislation could be challenged. It can, of course, but we are confident
that we can successfully resist any such challenge.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>Will the minister
clarify one point? If the date of 1 September in section 3(2) were replaced
by a later date, so that all the provisions of this bill came into effect
at the same time-at a later date than today-how many, if any, appeals would
be affected?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>That would depend on
at what later date the bill came into effect. The date of 1 September-the
date of publication of the bill-covers any appeal that is currently outstanding
and still to have a hearing. The date of the hearing&nbsp;</font></td>

him regarding both public safety and the treatability of the patient.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>But today is 8 September.
Why does the bill have to stipulate 1 September? I could understand the
minister's point if some appeals that were pending might result in the
release of people who would constitute a danger to the public, but it seems
from his reply that that is not the case. Why has this date of 1 September,
a retrospective date, been picked? Supposing that the bill were passed
by this Parliament today, the Queen could presumably signify her assent
tomorrow. Why not, therefore, insert tomorrow's date?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>As I have indicated,
1 September is the date when the bill was published. We were trying to
be careful. While it was our expectation from our discussions with the
Parliamentary Bureau that we could deal with stage 1 on 2 September and
with stage 2 tomorrow-that was the initial suggestion-we could not take
this Parliament for granted and assume that that timetable would be met.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the question of royal assent, as Mr
Canavan knows, the Scotland Act 1998 allows a period of four weeks after
the completion of stage 3 for the UK law officers and the Secretary of
State for Scotland to consider whether the bill complies with the ECHR.
I do not wish to prejudge that process, but we hope that it can be carried
out much more quickly than that. However, the choice of 1 September 1999
was made on the basis that we could not take for granted some matters,
including the period of time before royal assent.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

amendment 26 is to explore the scope of the appeal that can be taken to
the Court of Session under the new section 66A(1).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Is the appeal intended to involve a rehearing
of the case, thereby inviting the Court of Session to consider the matter
anew? Or is the scope of the appeal to the Court of Session to be limited
to a review of the sheriff's exercise of the judicial discretion vested
in him at first instance? If the scope of the appeal is limited, it would
not be open to the Court of Session to interfere with the sheriff's decision
merely on the ground that it would have exercised its discretion in a different
manner. This could give rise to a situation in which the Court of Session
is satisfied that there is evidence to justify a finding that a patient
should be kept in custody in the interests of public safety, and would
have made such a finding itself, but is not prepared to interfere with
the sheriff's finding to the contrary because there are no legal grounds
for doing so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I wish it to be made explicit in the bill
that the court may review the evidence anew and may come, if necessary,
to a different decision based on the facts and not simply on the sheriff's
application of the law to the facts or on points of law alone. If the minister
is not prepared to accept the amendment, I seek an assurance from him that
the scope of re-appeal is sufficiently wide, in the bill as drafted, to
cover the points that I have raised in the amendment and that there is
no need for the matter to be clarified in the legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">amendment, which
has been drawn to our attention by the Law Society, expresses some concern
over timetables. The amendment seeks to ensure that a fixed timetable will
be applied to any appeal. It must surely be the view that appeals under
section 2 are of such public importance that they should be dealt with
promptly. The timetable that has been suggested seems to comply with that
and to be fair. I ask the minister to take that on board.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>I wish to make
one or two brief comments. As Mr Gallie said, this amendment emanates from
the Law Society in recognition of the serious steps that we are taking,
which will affect the liberties of a certain category of individuals. We
are doing so rightly but we should nevertheless recognise that what we
are doing is extremely important and that we must ensure safeguards where
possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This amendment is one possible safeguard.
In effect, by building in a prearranged time scale for hearing the appeals,
we will guard against people continuing to be detained over what may become
an almost indefinite period pending an appeal hearing. Such a hearing may
take a very long time to arrange, or-heaven forfend-proceedings may be
deliberately stalled at the convenience of ministers, who would rather
that matters did not come to a conclusion too quickly. This amendment seeks
to build in a time scale for the appeals to be heard within an expedited
period.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Amendment 26, which
was moved by Mr McLetchie, seeks to clarify that an appeal under section
66A of the bill may be on the grounds of fact or law. I can assure Mr McLetchie
that that is the case-the appeal is not limited and can be taken on either
ground. That means that the Court of Session would be able to consider
the whole case. It is not envisaged that there would be a complete rehearing,
but transcripts of the evidence, for example, would be made available to
the court. In the circumstances surrounding that kind of appeal, the Court
of Session cannot take a view on the credibility of witnesses, but it can
examine the evidence and have regard to its sufficiency, as well as to
points of law. Indeed, the court could come to a view that is different
from that of the sheriff. The intention is that an appeal can be lodged
on the grounds of both fact and law.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the question of the timetable under
the bill, within which appeals to the Court of Session should be completed,
I recognise the desire that such appeals be conducted with due speed. Mr
Gallie referred to issues surrounding the fact that such cases will inevitably
be of public importance and Ms Cunningham referred to issues surrounding
questions of individual liberty. However, I do not believe that setting
a rigid time scale is the answer.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is accepted
that the issues raised by Mr Gallie and Ms Cunningham are important. Parties
to an appeal involving a restricted patient will undoubtedly be anxious
to have the appeal heard quickly. The Court of Session has to balance competing
claims for the allocation of time to consider appeals, which, by their
nature, require to be dealt with as quickly as possible; disputes involving
children are often given some priority.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">New procedures have been introduced which
provide that either party may enrol for an early disposal of the appeal.
Those procedures would apply to appeals under the new act and I am assured
that, in practice, they have been found to work satisfactorily. It seems
preferable to apply the existing procedures, which allow for flexibility
in disposing of such appeals, rather than trying to provide a fixed timetable.
A fixed timetable may well be found to be unworkable for reasons outwith
the control of the court or the parties involved. In some cases, such a
timetable could inhibit early resolution of appeals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am satisfied that the present arrangements
are flexible enough to ensure that appeals can be dealt with without undue
delay. I recognise the importance of doing so, and a specific power of

the Parliament to reject amendment 26.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

was and is about public safety. It was and is about ensuring that there
are no further releases from detention of those patients whose diagnosis
and condition is similar to that of Noel Ruddle. It is about closing that
door-that is all. The bill is certainly not about reforming or modernising
mental health legislation. That is why the insertion of "personality disorder"
as a mental illness, which was always implicit in the Mental Health (Scotland)
Act 1984, is made express in the bill. The amendments which we move, 37,
38 and 39, make it plainer still that "personality disorder" was included
under mental illness-and it still is. It has been the aim not to change
that, but to clarify it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is not the time or place to change
that; this is about closing the door-that is all. It is not about, as some
have implied, opening the doors of the state hospital to a cohort of new
people with mental illnesses, whether they are currently in the community
or in prison. The bill will not do that because hospital admission will
still require section 17 of the 1984 act to be satisfied: it will still
need to be shown that, if the mental disorder from which a patient suffers
is persistent, manifested only by abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible
conduct, treatment in hospital is likely to alleviate the condition or
prevent it from deteriorating, and that it is necessary for the health
or safety of the person, or for the protection of others, for him to receive
such treatment in hospital. That is a very important sentence, although
a particularly difficult one to read.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is clearly for doctors to reach that
view; in our view, the bill imposes no new responsibilities on doctors
or psychiatrists in that respect. The bill affects those seeking to leave
detention in hospital; it does not change the process of admission. I gave
this assurance yesterday to the Royal College of Psychiatrists and I am
happy to give it again in this chamber. We are closing a door; that is
all. We are not opening new ones.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive is in no doubt about the
importance of mental health and the issues surrounding it. We well understand
the complexity and difficulty of the definitions of mental disorder, and
are conscious of the differing and deeply held convictions regarding such
matters, even within the mental health community. That is why we will not
open the door to that debate today. Involved in that debate is the MacLean
committee, which is examining how to deal with serious offenders, including
those with personality disorders. Also involved is the Millan committee,
which is, as we asked, reviewing mental health legislation-a difficult
job. We will not and must not burst in on those deliberations-they are
too important. I acknowledge that even to think about such matters without
beginning to stray into MacLean's and Millan's territory is extremely difficult,

improving public safety is what the bill does, and it goes no further.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I say again: the bill does not seek to
allow anyone to be admitted to hospital who could not be detained under
the existing law. For those few-and it is a few-whom the bill affects,
we give the assurance, as the Deputy First Minister has already done, that
resources will be available for treatment which is considered to be appropriate
by clinicians in the state hospital. However, we will not try to define
that today, which is why Susan Deacon has asked the Mental Welfare Commission
for Scotland to report on this matter properly and separately from the
consideration of public safety, with which we are involved today. All around
us are interesting and important doors that we need to open, but not today.
Today, we have one door to close and these amendments will help us to do

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland)

statement, he will join us in agreeing to the amendment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dr Jim Dyer, for whom I have considerable
respect, having been a student in acute psychiatry under him at the Royal
Edinburgh hospital, is the director of the Mental Welfare Commission for
Scotland. He echoes the concerns about the wide definition of personality
disorder in the bill; he, too, wants the bill to be brought into line with
current medical thinking. He has gone on record and has written to all
members of the Scottish Parliament to indicate his concern on this issue.
Given his public statement and his statutory responsibility to highlight
such issues to the Scottish Executive and the responsible ministers, I
hope that the Executive will recognise that this amendment seeks to address
the same concerns as those highlighted by the Mental Welfare Commission
for Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Amendment 28 also seeks to focus the bill
on those individuals with a particular type of personality disorder who
are a marked risk to society. In last week's debate, several members expressed
the concern that the bill fails to take account of the fact that the majority
of those with such a personality disorder pose no risk to society. Dennis
Canavan remarked that if we did not tighten up the bill's definition of
personality disorder, this chamber could be rather empty. In my view, it
is likely that the press benches will be even emptier. [<i>Laughter.</i>]
I am sure that I will get good copy for that tomorrow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

with a personality disorder pose no risk to society. The Government paper,
"Managing Dangerous People With Severe Personality Disorder", which was

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"the overwhelming majority do not pose
a risk to the public and live reasonably ordered, crime free, lives".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland

its concerns, which is why this amendment has been lodged.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I, therefore move amendment 28.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>The purpose of
amendment 29 is similar to the one that Mr Matheson indicated in speaking
to amendment 28. I do not think that I need take up the committee's time
in replicating many of the points that he made in his substantial contribution
to the debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is a great pity that the Parliament
was unable to give fuller consideration to the definition of mental disorder
when it discussed stage 1 of the bill. I was advised by the clerk that,
because mental disorder is mentioned in the long title of the bill, the
amendment of its definition is one of the bill's general principles and
that an amendment to delete section 3 in its entirety, as recommended by
the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, would not be competent. I assure
members that that was the ruling that was given to me. Whether it is correct,
I do not know. The matter might be investigated.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The memorandum from the Mental Welfare
Commission to the minister on 6 September arrived too late for the matter
to be considered at stage 1 of the bill. That is not a criticism of the
commission, but it does give rise to the concern flagged up by Kenny MacAskill
that, in preparing the bill and presenting it to Parliament for approval,
the Executive was remiss in not consulting the commission.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was interested to hear Jim Wallace talking
about the need to maintain the narrow focus of the bill so as to concentrate
on the specific problem that the bill is designed to remedy, which arose
as a result of the decision in Mr Ruddle's case. In essence, Mr Gray made
the same point, although he did so in a more colourful way and, being a
master of metaphor, introduced more windows and doors into the debate than
C R Smith could. His point was that we should not be opening doors or closing
windows-or whatever the case may&nbsp;</font></td>

might prejudice the outcome of the Millan committee review.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That throws into focus the point made by
the Mental Welfare Commission-it is not necessary, for the purposes of
remedying the deficiency in the law highlighted by the Ruddle case, to
go as far as to amend the definition of mental disorder or mental illness
to include persons affected by a generality of personality disorders. That
is why in amendment 29 we have sought, like Mr Matheson in amendment 28,
to narrow the definition so that it applies to a smaller category of people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It cannot be right-given that the amendment
relates to a definition in the principal act-that all forms of personality
disorder be treated as mental disorders or mental illnesses for the purposes
of the act. So wide a definition could extend the scope of the whole act
so that many individuals who have never come within the scope of the criminal
justice system could now be subject to civil detention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I invite the minister to explain more fully
why he considers the amended definition to be absolutely necessary to fulfil
the purpose of the bill, which-as the Minister for Justice acknowledged
in the debate on earlier amendments-is limited.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In that context, I also ask the minister
whether the expansion of the definition of mental disorder and mental illness
to encompass personality disorders has implications for criminal law in
Scotland and for the plea of diminished responsibility. As he will be aware,
one line of defence open to an accused charged with murder is to establish
that he was suffering from diminished responsibility at the time of the
killing. A finding to that effect would enable the jury to reduce the conviction
from murder to culpable homicide so that the accused received a determinate
sentence instead of the mandatory life sentence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Criminal case law indicates that a judge
will allow the plea of diminished responsibility to go to the jury for
decision only if there is evidence of mental disorder, mental illness or
disease. Evidence of severe personality disorder may not in itself be sufficient.
If a personality disorder is now treated as a mental illness for the purposes
of the act, that may impact on the plea of diminished responsibility under
criminal law. It cannot be right that persons who are simply wicked by
nature may be able to exploit such a change in the law to reduce the charge
on which they are convicted in the criminal courts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section 3(1) will insert the phrase "(including
personality disorder)" into the 1984 act. I think that it would be in the
general interest if the words "personality disorder" were more focused.
A considerable proportion of the people of Scotland suffer from personality
disorders, but I hope that they will never come within the scope of this
bill, and I hope that it is not the Executive's intention that they should
ever do so. So why on earth should they be included by the use of such
a wide phrase as "personality disorder"? That is what is proposed in the
wording of the bill as it stands.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last week, I lodged some parliamentary
questions about the issue-I do not know whether the minister knows about
that, but I hope that I will get a reply in due course. I did not really
expect to get a reply before today's debate, but perhaps the minister will
give some indication of the official estimate of the number of people in
Scotland who suffer from a personality disorder. How many people in Carstairs
state hospital or other state hospitals suffer from personality disorders?
How many of those people have personality disorders that can be classified
as presenting some danger to the public?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Bruce Millan said in his letter to the
Deputy First Minister, it is very important that we do not imagine, or
put across to the general public, that people who suffer from mental illness
are all going to pose some threat to the general public, because that is
untrue. Unlike Dr Simpson, I am not a psychiatrist, but I imagine that
the overwhelming majority of people with personality disorders do not present
any threat to the general public at all. I do not see why they should be
included within the scope of this bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From my reading in preparation for this
debate, I understand that some people use the term "psychopath" similarly,
if not synonymously, to the way in which they use the phrase "someone with
an anti-social personality disorder". Is that correct? Is that an accurate
definition in the eyes of psychiatrists, the law or both? I would welcome
an explanation from the minister.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As members can see, I have proposed that,
instead of the phrase "(including personality disorder)", we should have
"(including dangerous anti-social personality disorder)". As Michael Matheson
said, that would help to focus this emergency legislation on the small
minority of people on whom it is meant to be focused.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

between people who exhibit dangerous, aggressive, anti-social behaviour,
and people who are neither dangerous nor anti-social, but who may suffer
from a non-aggressive personality disorder. Surely we cannot allow personality
disorder to become a blanket term that covers a range of conditions, most
of which would not normally attract the description of mental illness.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Personality disorders are not uncommon.
As Michael Matheson pointed out, it is fair to say that many members in
the chamber today have a personality disorder of one kind or another. If
one believes what has been written in some of the newspapers, our disorders
range from having a somewhat suspect personality to being deemed to have
had a complete personality bypass.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the description is not amended it will
include people who may have an obsession with washing their hands and cleanliness,
or those who suffer from agoraphobia or claustrophobia.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must realise the importance of ensuring
that the definition does not become a catch-all, which could have serious

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I said during a presentation that I
made last week, the legislation is designed to close a loophole. The reference
that Kay Ullrich made is unhelpful. Such references have been made consistently
and they paint a false picture of what the legislation is intended to do.
Will she comment on that?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Jamieson thinks that she knows better than the Mental Welfare Commission

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Let us not lose sight of the fact that
the vast majority of people who have a personality disorder live what are
by popular definition normal lives. They do not commit crimes and they
do not pose a threat to public safety. Let us be precise in the group that
we target. We are targeting the Ruddles of this world-those with a personality
disorder that makes them seriously anti-social, violent and a danger to
society.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Matheson. I
observed last week and I repeat that I am not persuaded that the bill is
the best long-term solution to the problem. I have reservations about including
personality disorder in the category of mental illness.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have heard the minister say that this
is simply a clarification of the existing law. We may or may not agree
about that, but it will certainly have legal consequences. David McLetchie
spoke of the possibility of it being used in a plea of diminished responsibility.
Undoubtedly that will happen. I would like to say two things to David about
that. First, one cannot have it both ways. People cannot be defined as
bad and wicked for the purposes of conviction, but be defined as ill for
some other purpose. Secondly, it will still be for the courts to decide
how a person is disposed of. If a jail sentence or life imprisonment is
appropriate, that is what will happen. That is not a serious consequence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Despite my reservations about the bill,
I firmly believe that amendment 28 does not help. It is not a better way
forward. It involves a detailed definition of a particular kind of personality
disorder, which may or may not turn out to be helpful. It puts a particular
kind of personality disorder in a class of its own in the overall category
of mental disorder. Without boring members to death, I will say that that
will also have problems of application and interpretation. Whichever way
we approach the problem is not without difficulty.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The bottom line is that we urgently need
to review the subject, which is what will happen when the Millan committee
and the MacLean committee report. I hope that any changes that we make
will be in the round, not in isolation, because anything less than that
is not ideal. However, for the moment, we need to close the loophole in
the interests of public safety. The simplest, most direct and most effective
short-term way of doing that is to create a stated sub-category of personality
disorder within the broad category of mental disorder and mental illness.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should not be scaremongering. The legislation
does not mean that anyone with a personality disorder will somehow be whipped
off to Carstairs, any more than it means that any person with a degree
of mental illness will be taken into custody. There will always be other
safeguards and other important criteria to take into account. We must recognise
that the legislation means that people-not those with personality disorders
such as ourselves, but those who have killed other human beings or who
are seriously violent and are a continuing danger because of their mental
state-can be kept in a secure environment. That must be our priority.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that, and for that reason we should simply leave it alone.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>One of the drawbacks
of being called towards the end of a debate is that everyone has said what
you were going to say. However, the benefit is that you can work out the
terms of the debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I listened to the minister, to Mr McLetchie
and to Mr Jackson, and there appears to be much unanimity and consensus
on many areas-and on two areas in particular. First, everyone accepts that
we are focusing on a narrow area of law. Secondly, we are not undertaking
a fundamental review. I will not canvass how we arrived at that position,
but it is accepted that a fundamental review will have to be considered
by the MacLean committee and the Millan committee. At some stage-either
next year or the year after-the Parliament will doubtless have to revisit
and reconsider the matter, because we are debating and discussing an area
of law and psychiatry that has proved to be fundamental over the past 20
to 40 years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need to be clear about what we are trying
to achieve in the interim. I have a great deal of sympathy with Dr Dyer,
who was mentioned earlier. I appreciate his point of view, because the
number of people we seek to address in the legislation is relatively few.
Everyone accepts that there are a significant number of people in Carstairs,
but the number who will be affected by the legislation can be counted,
if not on the fingers on one hand, on not many more. The number of those
who will be affected will also be reduced on the recommendations of the
Millan committee and MacLean committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I can understand why Dr Dyer says that
we should seek to amend section 3; I can appreciate his position. However,
I think that the public would view the Parliament as being derelict in
its duty if it failed to address the possibility that the people affected,
who may be counted on the fingers of one hand, might be released without
conditions or without any element of treatability being addressed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On page 3 of his briefing, Dr Dyer says
that we should not do that. He says that should Parliament wish to add
the term "personality disorder" to the category of mental disorder, it
should do so in addition to the terms "mental illness" and "mental handicap",
as that is in keeping with current psychiatric thinking, which views the
concept of personality disorder as different from the concept of mental
illness. That point was canvassed by other MSPs, in particular Mr Jackson.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

dealt with by the MacLean committee, not by a fundamental review. The failure

Health (Scotland) Act 1984 is a glaring anomaly that has occurred because

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17:00</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As my colleague Mr Matheson commented,
the difficulty is that the term "personality disorder" affects many people
and is wide-ranging. Numerous people in Carstairs, the state hospital institution,
might be affected by the proposal and, although they might not be the most
sympathetic of those we choose to associate with, we have a duty to look
after their interest and to take cognisance of their rights. That means
that the definition of "personality disorder" must be tight. We are talking
not about someone who is slightly eccentric, but about people who are a
danger. That is what the public wish us to address and where I differ from
Dr Dyer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In considering personality disorder, we
have a duty to ensure that the remit is as tight as possible, which means
that we must specify those with whom we are dealing. I believe that amendment
28 deals with that. It shows that we are dealing not with personality disorder
per se, but with</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"personality disorder manifested principally
by abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The public have charged us as parliamentarians
with dealing with those people. We have to be quite strict and tight in
our definition, so that in the general rush to introduce the emergency
legislation, we do not catch the innocent among those whose position needs
to be addressed seriously and which we have a duty to investigate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>I, too, have some sympathy
with amendment 28 moved by Mr Matheson, but our problem is that we are
trying to do something specific and limited. The members who support the
SNP amendment and others are trying to move everything forward to 1999
from 1984 instead of considering the parts that we need to amend to achieve
our focused objective.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have a dilemma. When the Millan committee
considers the issue, it will need to investigate this aspect in detail
and with extreme care, but it is not necessary for us to amend the bill
in the way suggested by the amendment. I am unhappy with the terms that
are used in the amendment. It is unnecessary and goes beyond the scope
of the change that is needed. As I understand it, section 17 still applies-I
hope that the minister will confirm that, because I am not a lawyer-and
that is the test that must be passed before one comes to the tests that
we are now talking about. If that is&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I share Mr McLetchie's concerns about the
speed with which the legislation is being dealt with. I think that everyone
has a great deal of sympathy with the fact that it has to be rushed through,
but that excuse cannot be used to justify a slap-dash approach, which is
evident in this wide definition.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the things that has been forgotten
is that in the Parliament's infancy members decided that it would listen
a lot more to expert evidence and that it would be a fully inclusive Parliament.
If that is so, and we have agreement across the board-including that of
the Law Society of Scotland, the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland
and, from its own publications, the Government-on the differentiation between
personality disorder and mental illness, it seems odd that we are deliberately
turning away from that. If we are turning away from that, I need more of
an explanation of why it is an advantageous move. It is not good enough
to say, "We want to focus on today and that is the only reason why we are
turning away from it."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the Government wants to focus, it needs
to really focus and to get down to the nuts and bolts of the people it
is trying to affect. That is why amendment 28 was lodged. It tries to specify
the group of people who are targeted by the amendment and, in that way,
tries to protect the rights of others.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I listened to what Mr Jackson said with
some interest; he made some excellent points. I noted his reservations
about the Government's position against the background of his long and
distinguished legal career.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are left with one of two positions.
Either we can get it wrong and choose the wide and unfocused definition
that is before us, in the interest of a catch-all, or we can opt for a
more thoughtful and focused definition in the short term and look forward
to the committees dealing with the issue in the longer term.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Mr MacAskill said, this is an interim
measure. That is the point, so let us make it absolutely focused. If that
is the driving force behind the Government, I cannot see its logic in refusing
to accept the amendment. We are trying to close loopholes-the Parliament
and the Government owe it to the public to ensure that those loopholes
are shut-and we must do it together and cleverly. The bill does not meet
those criteria. What is the advantage in being deliberately out of date?

We have also listened to the concerns of the mental health community. I

different views, as do the various bodies in the mental health community.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dr Richard Simpson
made a particularly authoritative contribution to this debate. I was fascinated
to hear his description of the boundaries between the treatment and management
of patients and the way in which in many respects-if I understood him correctly-the
boundaries merge.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The purpose of this amendment is to seek
to make it clear that medical treatment should be held to include</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"the provision of support and counselling
aimed at preventing any deterioration or relapse in the patient's mental
disorder".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is arguable that had the sheriff been
required to consider the issue of treatability in those terms he might
have arrived at a different decision in the Ruddle case. If so, it would
be desirable for medical treatment to be considered in that wider context
in future cases that come before the courts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I move amendment 32.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Mr McLetchie has
explained why he wishes a definition of medical treatment to be included
in the bill. I can assure him that medical treatment is already defined
in section 125 of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. It</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"includes nursing, and also includes care
and training under medical supervision".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With regard to the Reid case, which may
not have been referred to today but was referred to in our debates last
week, the House of Lords gave medical treatment a wide definition. For
example, Lord Hope held that</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Medication or other psychiatric treatment
which is designed to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the mental
disorder plainly falls within the scope of the expression".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He then went on to say:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"But I think that its scope is wide enough
to include other things which are done for either of those two purposes
under medical supervision in the State Hospital. It is also wide enough
to include treatment which alleviates or prevents a deterioration of the
symptoms of the mental disorder, not the disorder itself which gives rise
to them."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That definition encompasses the treatment
referred to in the amendment and it is current law. The Millan committee
will consider that issue during its review of the 1984 act, and it would
be wrong to pre-empt its conclusions in this emergency bill. This amendment
is unnecessary, and it could pre-empt some of the Millan committee's work.
I hope that given my explanation, Mr McLetchie will feel able to withdraw
his amendment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</strong>I am more than happy to accept the minister's explanation, so I withdraw

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Convener:</strong> We now move on to
amendment 33, with which we shall debate amendments 34 to 36.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><strong><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dennis Canavan: </font></strong><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Amendment
33 places a statutory obligation on the Scottish Executive to review this
legislation after the Millan and MacLean committees have completed their
work. The Millan committee is the one examining the Mental Health (Scotland)
Act 1984 and the MacLean committee is examining the sentencing and treatment
of serious violent and sexual offenders.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In its declarations, the Executive has
said that it must take into account the workings of those committees, so
this emergency legislation will almost certainly have to be repealed or
amended months from now. I am proposing that we put into statute an obligation
on the Scottish Executive to do what it has said it will do. Similarly,
in amendment 36, I have said that after a six-month period, a statutory
instrument should be placed before this Parliament for approval-or otherwise.
That would give Parliament the opportunity to repeal this emergency legislation
or decide if it should continue for another period.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During my many years at the Westminster
Parliament, ministers have laid various emergency provisions before the
House saying that it will be only for a period of six months or a year.
Some of those so-called temporary, emergency provisions have lasted for
more than 20 years. This is the first bill to come before our Scottish
Parliament. There are many people-including Bruce Millan and me-who do
not like the emergency nature of this legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It would be a great pity and might bring
our Parliament into disrepute if this bill, which is being passed in too
much haste today, became permanent rather than temporary legislation. It
is therefore important that amendment 36 is passed to give the Scottish
Parliament the opportunity, in six months' time, to decide whether this
legislation is still necessary or should be repealed or amended in the
light of the work of Bruce Millan and Lord MacLean.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Amendment 35 was intended to ensure that
all of the sections of the act came into force on the same day. I dealt
with that point during the debate on retrospectivity, so members know my
views on that matter. I do not like retrospective legislation, but I do
not want to bore the Parliament by going over the same old ground. I ask
the minister to look sympathetically at amendments 33 and 36.</font></td>

33.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>I will perhaps surprise
Mr Canavan when I say that we agree with him on deleting "Section 2 of".
In amendment 34, we go further by asking that the whole of subsections
(2) and (3) be deleted, in the belief that by so doing this bill will come
in as a oner. There is no need to space out the dates when parts of it
come into effect. What we propose would be the quickest way to get it on
the statute book. We do not agree with Mr Canavan's comments about his
other amendments. We look to the minister to explain why he feels subsections
(2) and (3) are necessary.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>I rise to speak
to amendment 34, which I think is straightforward. It deals with the disjunction
involved in bringing in parts of the act. I raised this issue last Thursday,
and listened carefully to the reply of the Deputy Minister for Community
Care. He referred to the disjunction being necessary to allow the Court
of Session procedures to be put in place. While that might be an argument
for delay, it is not an argument for disjunction. If this Parliament can
move speedily-and, after all, we could have moved and dealt with this emergency
legislation in one day-we should also demand that the Court of Session
move immediately. That is why the amendment is being proposed. I hope that
the minister accepts that it is not unreasonable to demand of the Court
of Session what we demand of ourselves.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I am grateful to
those who have moved the amendments.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In moving amendment 33, Mr Canavan has
quite rightly drawn to the attention of the committee the importance of
the committees that are chaired by Bruce Millan and Lord MacLean. Lord
MacLean's committee is dealing with the sentencing and treatment of serious
violent and sexual offenders, including those with personality disorders,
and the Millan committee is dealing with the Mental Health (Scotland) Act
1984. Quite clearly-judging by the amount of references to those committees
during our debates on this subject-all members are aware of the importance
and the relevance of the committees. They are moving ahead with speed but
they are examining serious issues seriously. They are aware of the importance
that the Executive attaches to their work, and the case that has resulted
in this bill provides confirmation of the rightness of establishing the
committees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We anticipate that the MacLean committee
will report in March 2000 and that the Millan committee, which will take
into account MacLean's recommendations, should report in summer 2000. I
assure Parliament that we will consider the reports with all possible speed
and will give&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">members full opportunity
to debate the reports and the Executive's response to them. In those circumstances,
it would be premature to have the six-month time limit that Mr Canavan
suggests. Almost certainly, the Millan committee will not have reported
by then and the Parliament will not have had a chance to make a considered
response to the report of the MacLean committee. We are all agreed that
those reports will require careful consideration. It would be unwise to
deal with the reports in a piecemeal or premature fashion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With regard to amendment 36, I repeat that
the bill is an interim measure until Parliament can enact legislation based
on the Millan and MacLean reports. That should reassure Mr Canavan that
this legislation will not continue for ever and a day, as he said sometimes
happens at Westminster. The fact that the Parliament will have to address
the issues in the context of the MacLean and Millan committees means that
there will be an opportunity for the emergency legislation to be considered.
Indeed, committees in this Parliament could take the initiative if they
felt that the issue was being swept under the carpet, although I do not
suggest for one moment that that would happen. I repeat my earlier assurance
that it would be the Executive's intention that the Parliament should debate
the reports shortly after they are published.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With regard to amendment 34, I can understand
why concerns have been expressed. In recent days, there has been discussion
with the Lord President of the Court of Session to ensure that new appeal
procedures can be put in place quickly so that appeals to the sheriff that
are conducted under the provisions of the bill can attract a new right
of appeal to the Court of Session. The Lord President has confirmed that
there is no bar to the appeal provisions coming into operation and-as a
final gesture in committee-I am pleased to accept amendment 34.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP): </strong>This
has been an arduous, although not very long, procedure. I hope that we
will not have to do this too often.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It needs to be said again that it is a
matter of regret that we found ourselves in this position. The tone of
the letters on the legislation that we have received from the Mental Welfare
Commission for Scotland, and from Bruce Millan, is also a matter for regret.
It is obvious that they are grievously concerned about aspects of the legislation.
Notwithstanding their concerns, we all feel that we must push ahead.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are not here as lawyers or medical professionals.
Although we may take the advice of such people, we are here to express
our concerns about public safety-that has been paramount. The concern that
we on the SNP seats-I was going to say benches-have had throughout these
proceedings has focused principally on compliance with the European convention
on human rights. We have been assured, both earlier and again today, that
compliance has been achieved. I would have wished to receive greater specification,
but I accept the assurances that have been given. I serve notice that we
will hold the minister to all the assurances that have been given in all
the debates, both last Thursday and this afternoon. Nevertheless, we accept
those assurances in the spirit in which I sincerely hope they were given.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">None of us can be happy about the procedure
being forced through. In the interests of public safety, however, it has
been necessary to legislate. We can only hope and pray that the assurances
that have been made throughout the debates, last Thursday and today, will
be adhered to, and that none of what we now pass into legislation will
come back to haunt us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh (Central Scotland)
(Con): </strong>It falls to me to seek a moment of time for reflection-although
I am not pre-empting tomorrow's debate-on the whole matter of the legislation
that is before us today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There can be no doubt that the Noel Ruddle
affair has become the hot potato of the summer. No one wanted it to be
so, but the Executive's action, or lack thereof, has forced us to the unfortunate
point at which legislation of such a complex and sensitive nature has had
to be rushed through as an emergency, with little time for thorough debate
and measured consideration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Conservatives regard the bill as, at
best, a temporary expediency, born out of necessity. It is, in other words,
a sticking-plaster, and will have to&nbsp;</font></td>
