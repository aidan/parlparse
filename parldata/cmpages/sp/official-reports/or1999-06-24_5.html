<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):
</strong>We now move to the next item, which is a ministerial statement on financial
issues. There will be no interventions during this statement because the
minister will take questions at the end.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">15:15</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Finance (Mr Jack McConnell):
</strong>I wish to make a statement on two aspects of our financial affairs:
first, the procedures for this Parliament to approve expenditure by the
Executive, for our accounting to Parliament for that expenditure, for the
auditing of those accounts, and for the accountability of officials undertaking
the expenditure; secondly, the infrastructure required to support the tax-varying
power of the Scottish Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Moving on from the debates and disagreements
of the past four weeks, I am pleased to have this opportunity to address
our financial affairs. As Minister for Finance, I want to develop an open
and constructive dialogue with the new Parliament and its committees. We
have huge financial responsibilities to spend our money wisely, to decide
our priorities openly, and to account for our use of the nation's resources
through this chamber to the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should seek to ensure minimum waste
and maximum output, minimum duplication and maximum partnership in our
financial dealings. Scottish taxpayers rightly expect the new Executive
and this Parliament to spend money wisely and to try to extract more from
the pot that we inherit. As Minister for Finance, I intend to do all I
can to achieve that goal.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The legislative programme announced by
the First Minister last week included a bill on financial procedures and
auditing. Indeed, the Scotland Act 1998 requires this Parliament to legislate
on those matters. However, the act does not go into great detail. It sets
out a framework-no more than that. It is for this Parliament to decide
on its own detailed procedures. That is, of course, right. As the First
Minister said in his statement, the bill</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"will go to the heart of the relationship
between the Parliament and the Executive".-[<i>Official Report</i>, 16
June 1999; Vol 1, c 407.]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In that relationship, we want the Parliament
to be constructive, but we also want our decisions as an Executive to be
transparent and sure of Parliament's support. I am particularly keen to
endorse the new political system that we are developing here in Scotland
and, to emphasise that new approach, I propose that the draft bill on financial
procedures and auditing arrangements be named the accountability, budgeting
and audit&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">bill, to reflect
that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We also want the Parliament to have a world-class
financial management system. We want a framework that helps to ensure that
the Parliament's budget is spent to the best possible effect. We must have
a system that encourages Parliament and the Executive constantly to secure
the most from our financial resources. At the same time, we have to ensure
that at all times the people's money is handled with the highest standards
of honesty and integrity. I hope that, in time, other Parliaments will
look to us when searching for the best ways in which to manage the financial
affairs of government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On this matter, we cannot afford delay.
The transitional financial arrangements under which we are operating expire
next March. We must have our own system in place well before then if we
are going to be able to continue to spend money. Fortunately, we have a
flying start. In February last year, the financial issues advisory group
was established as a sub-committee of the consultative steering group.
Its task was to make proposals that</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"the Scottish Parliament might be invited
to adopt for handling financial issues".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Over the following 12 months or so, that
group of finance professionals and other experts developed ideas that address
the range of financial issues to be faced by this Parliament. The group's
report covers everything from setting budgets to value for money audits.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The group's recommendations were endorsed
by the CSG and have been welcomed by specialists and lay people alike.
I would like to add my thanks to the members of the group. Their work has
been critical to the future success of this Parliament, and I am very pleased
to welcome members of the group here today to view the debate on this statement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The group's recommendations give us the
chance to take financial issues away from the preserve of the specialists
and to make them accessible to the Parliament and the people of Scotland.
The new Scottish Executive has considered the group's report in the light
of Parliament's need to set up a sound system of financial management,
and this Executive warmly welcomes accountability for its stewardship of
taxpayers' money. Holding the Executive to account is a basic function
of any Parliament, one which goes far beyond the day-to-day knockabout
of party politics, which we saw this morning. We intend to broadly accept
the report and will be considering, with the Finance and Audit Committees,
how best to implement the recommendations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">will this weekend
place before the Finance and Audit Committees a memorandum setting out
our proposals to accept the recommendations of the financial issues advisory
group, and proposals for their detailed implementation. My officials and
I will be available to the committees before the recess, so that they can
discuss the details with us. Among the matters that I want to draw to the
committees' attention are the advantages and disadvantages of primary and
secondary legislation for budget approvals and amendments, and the management
of and responsibility for public audit in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We hope that the committees will be able
to give an initial response before the summer recess. That will enable
the Executive to adjust its proposals, if that is necessary, before going
out to wider consultation over the summer. It is our intention to introduce
a bill immediately after the summer recess, with a view to seeking the
approval of the Parliament by Christmas. That timetable will result in
the Parliament's having sufficient time to consider the Executive's spending
proposals for the year 2000-01.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Expenditure decisions on Government and
public service priorities here in Scotland are a central feature of our
new devolution settlement. It is vital that citizens of Scotland are aware
of, and are included in, our annual deliberations on the Scottish budget.
I therefore intend to invite the Parliament's committees to comment on
proposals for wider public consultation at an appropriate stage in our
budget decision-making timetable. Transparency and accountability do not
stop at the doors of this chamber. We must integrate our deliberations
into the lives of Scots, who experience the impact of our decisions in
their daily lives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I now turn to the Executive's proposals
for the tax-varying power-the power to vary the basic rate of income tax
in Scotland up or down, by a maximum of 3p in the pound. On 6 May, the
Scottish electorate said that it did not support the use of that power,
and we are determined to focus our efforts on maximising the benefits to
Scotland of planned increases in spending that have already been announced.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The comprehensive spending review has delivered
a very generous overall settlement for Scotland. By 2001-02, public spending
in real terms on programmes for which this Parliament is responsible will
be at a record high. However, we have made it clear-in the partnership
agreement and subsequently-that we will not use the tax-varying power during
the lifetime of this Parliament and will not impose a new income tax burden
on ordinary Scots.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Against that background, we have nevertheless
been considering what level of infrastructure, if&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">any, we should
maintain to take account of the possibility that a future Scottish Executive
might decide to use the tax-varying power. We have concluded that it would
be financially irresponsible and politically unacceptable to abandon all
the implementation work that has already been done. If we were to do that,
it would mean that a new Administration would have to wait up to three
years before it could implement the power-obviously, we would not want
to deny the Scottish National party that opportunity should it ever succeed
in forming an Administration. The period would have to be spent painstakingly-and
expensively-repeating all the implementation work that has already been
done, but that quickly will go out of date if it is not maintained.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In close consultation with Inland Revenue,
we have devised an option that would allow the tax to be introduced in
the financial year immediately following a Scottish election that was held
on the normal cycle-that is to say, in the April following a May election.
In practice, that is the first opportunity at which the tax-varying power
could be used, as changes cannot be introduced in mid-financial year.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The option will involve Inland Revenue,
and to a lesser extent the Department of Social Security, in maintaining
internally a range of supporting systems, including, in the case of Inland
Revenue, a database of Scottish taxpayers. Those systems can be updated
and activated quite quickly if a decision is taken to use the tax-varying
power. We estimate that, once all outstanding implementation costs have
been incurred-those fall mainly in the current year-the option will give
rise to an annual running cost of around &pound;2 million to &pound;2.5
million.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, we have decided to halt all other
preparations, including the appointment of the additional staff that would
have been necessary in other circumstances. That is a prudent decision,
which will save vital resources and avoid waste. Indeed, it means that
over the lifetime of this Parliament we can expect to realise savings of
around &pound;20 million on the provision for implementing and running
the tax that was previously included in forward budgets.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our decision to pursue this option will
mean that employers of Scottish taxpayers will face significantly less
work and cost in preparing for the tax. A typical small employer, for example,
will face no additional work or costs until the rate has been varied. Where
a computerised payroll is operated, minor changes will be required to keep
in step with the Inland Revenue's IT changes, but set-up costs will be
less than half of those previously estimated.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In conclusion, the course that we are proposing
to maintain an infrastructure for the tax-varying power is sensible and
pragmatic. Our decision not&nbsp;</font></td>

in the course of this Parliament will mean lower levels of income tax in
Scotland from April 2000, a much-reduced administrative burden for the
estimated 91,000 UK employers who have employees who are Scottish taxpayers,
and a saving of around &pound;20 million on the tax's implementation and
operating costs over the lifetime of the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We intend to make those resources, which
are available as a direct result of our decision not to use the tax-varying
power, available for the Holyrood building project. As the First Minister
promised, other budgets will not be affected to meet the Holyrood contract.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I therefore commend these proposals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George
Reid): </strong>The Minister for Finance will now take questions on the issues
raised in his statement. If there are sufficient questions, I will allow
about 15 minutes for that, after which we will move on to the next item
of business.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>I begin by formally congratulating Mr McConnell on his appointment.
I and my party support the appointment of a Minister for Finance to the
Scottish Parliament. That is a key role, which I hope Mr McConnell performs
successfully. I commend the outstanding FIAG report. I also commend the
aim of the minister's statement: for us to become a world leader in how
we treat public financial management. It is right to pursue that goal and
I await the substance of how the Government intends to deliver it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Could
you please ask a question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>I am coming to it.
I am sure that we will all welcome the fact that, before the recess, Mr
McConnell will appear before committees. I understand the reason for the
tax decision, and in the current context I accept and support it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some key questions arise from the report
and need to be answered. Can the minister confirm whether any aspects of
the report were announced before his statement to the Parliament? In his
statement, he commented that the comprehensive spending review had delivered
a record high for public spending in Scotland. Does he agree, however,
that, in the first three years of the Labour Administration, the Scottish
budget has been cut by &pound;1.1 billion compared to the last three years
of the Conservative Administration? Will he recognise that, in the coming
three years, the Barnett squeeze means that, in the relative areas of the
budget, the increase will be two and a half times faster in England than
in Scotland? That is according to Brian Ashcroft, not me. Does he therefore&nbsp;</font></td>

to the statement, if Keith would stop interrupting.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The minister's point of clarification on
the tax structure being used to pay for the Holyrood project and the changes
to it is welcome. Will he now explain how he intends to find the extra
&pound;80 million of spending announced in the partnership agreement?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>I welcome Andrew Wilson's
comments about the work of the Minister for Finance, and I look forward
to a constructive and positive relationship with him. I hope that the first
half, rather than the second half, of his questions-in the form of a statement-sets
the tone for the way things might continue. It is important that we try
as parties to work together in this Parliament to secure the best financial
accountability. I look forward to that process unfolding.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Mr Wilson's specific questions, no elements
of my statement on the specific details of the FIAG report or any other
elements of my statement were pre-announced. I cleared the press release
only about half an hour ago-if that is a helpful clarification. The only
element of my statement to which I referred in advance of today was not
in the FIAG report: my proposal to extend consultation outwith this Parliament
to the public of Scotland. I hope that Mr Wilson will appreciate the Scottish
public being aware of that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that Mr Wilson will, in due course,
accept that the Government's budgets in the past two years-and indeed for
this year-are larger than those estimated by the previous Conservative
Government, and that the budget totals in Scotland in three years' time
will indeed be at a record high. I await his welcoming of that with interest
and anticipation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the subject of the Barnett formula,
I welcome the decision of the Finance Committee this week to look at the
formula and decisions associated with it. Brian Ashcroft's report today
states again that public expenditure in Scotland will be moving towards
a record high level in three years' time-it is important to note that.
When we are discussing financial matters, the Parliament should accept
two principles from the outset: that we will not compare everything that
we do to what is happening south of the border but have our own debates
and make our own decisions in a mature and responsible way; and that we
will accept that, across the United Kingdom, budgets are, and should be,
determined on the basis of need and we support the continuation of that
principle.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the fourth point
that Mr Wilson raised, I intend to make a statement in the autumn on the
financial expenditures announced in the partnership agreement and on other
supplementary estimates that will have to be dealt with at that time. I
intend to deal with them as a complete package because I want our budgeting
to be as sensible and as comprehensive across departments as possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland)
(Con): </strong>Excuse me, my throat is a bit sore-it is not for the want of
counting the money that is going through this system. I welcome<strong> </strong>Mr
McConnell's statement today, particularly what he said about the relationship
with the committees, which is very important. Following my question to
the Finance Committee on Monday morning about the early establishment of
protocols on the relationship and information flows between him and the
committee, may I assume that this will be expedited at an early date?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I agree with the philosophy of minimum
waste and maximum output. When does the minister intend to apply that to
the rest of government spending, both locally and through government agencies?
I congratulate FIAG on its work, which is a superb start to the working
of the Parliament. I am, however, a little concerned about Mr McConnell's
phrase</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We intend to broadly accept the report".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Perhaps he will detail the parts he does
not accept? Is the part about parliamentary controls one of them?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the comments on public consultations,
but ask for a guarantee that the bill will go back to committee before
it comes to this chamber. I notice that Mr McConnell made a comment about
ordinary Scots. Is he saving some tax-raising powers for extraordinary
Scots? He claims to be saving &pound;20 million. Is the use of that money
on the Holyrood project the best possible use of it? He could save &pound;10
million on maintenance by scrapping the scheme, instead of leaving it hanging
over Scottish taxpayers. It is refreshing to hear that he accepts the cost
to business of taxation and extra bureaucracy. Will that be the first of
a series of steps by which he will reduce the burden on business in Scotland
that is imposed by government bureaucracy?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

earlier comments to Mr Wilson in relation to a working relationship with
Mr Davidson. If we include Mr Watson, the Convener of the Finance Committee,

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I understand that a time has been set for
a joint meeting of the Finance and Audit Committees and that it will take
place before further public consultation over the summer. That will be
followed by a statement to the Parliament after the summer on our specific
proposals for a bill, which will then go into the decision-making stages
in committee where it can be looked at in detail. My target for completion
of that process will be the end of the year. It is important that we have
completed the passing of this bill when we discuss next year's budget in
Parliament in January 2000, so that the procedures that we are working
with have a statutory basis.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am very keen to expand the principles
of best value to different levels of government. At the moment, we impose
those on local government more than on central government. During the summer,
I intend to look over the whole process of the modernising government agenda,
and I will report back to this Parliament as early as possible with a way
forward for the Executive to modernise systems of government and ensure
best value operations in government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I now address the issue of the tax-raising
power and whether we would end all preparations to use it. Given the record
of the former Conservative Government between 1992 and 1997, when there
were successive tax hikes, I suspect that the comment that I made earlier
about the Scottish National party being keen to have the tax-raising power
available to it in the year 2003 may apply to the Conservatives too. We
will keep a basic infrastructure in place. That is right because it is
democratic. In 2003, the people of Scotland will have the right to choose
between parties that want to raise taxes and those that do not. If they
vote for parties that want to raise taxes, they have a democratic right
to expect those parties to implement those plans.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

universities, local authorities, colleges, and independent voluntary organisations

Can Mr McConnell give us an example of a more enlightened way of getting

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>There are many examples,
both in central Government agencies and in local government, of best value
initiatives. They are producing not only better use of resources, but better
performance in public services. I would like to think that this Administration-and
I take this on board as a responsibility during the summer and autumn-will
examine the activities of central Government and its various agencies,
in particular from a best value perspective.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The UK Government produced a white paper
in March, "Modernising Government", which does not cover the devolved Administrations
in Scotland and Wales. One of the issues that I intend to address in the
first half of the recess, during what I hope will be a busy July for me,
is that white paper. I hope that we can start afresh in Scotland, and I

those who are involved will be inquisitive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The minister mentioned the FIAG report,
which everybody has welcomed, including myself. It is an excellent document,
and I am pleased that the Executive has given it broad approval. That report
raised the issue of budget approvals. Both the Audit Committee and the
Finance Committee will be asked to examine primary versus secondary legislation
to make those approvals. I ask the minister to clarify that that means
the endorsement of some sort of amendment bills by order. Can he assure
me, on behalf of the Finance Committee, that that will not preclude any
kind of consideration? FIAG set out a fairly elaborate three-stage process
for the approval of the budget bills themselves. Will the amendment bills,
if not using the same process, at least have adequate Finance Committee
consideration? Of course, the final decision will rest with the Parliament
as a whole.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>I can give Mr Watson
a firm assurance that the final decisions will always rest with the Parliament.
The most significant of a number of points that I want to raise in the
Finance Committee is that, if during the year we were to go through a system
of budget amendment bills as well as a main budget bill early in the year,
a four-week period would be required-after those amendment bills had been
agreed in this Parliament-during which the Law Officers could refer them
to the Privy Council.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">week delay may
be something that this Parliament would not want to happen when its budget
decisions are being implemented. That is a specific point that the committees
might want to consider. There would be no reduction or removal of rights
over financial decision making in this chamber; it would be a way of ensuring
that the Parliament's financial decisions could be implemented as quickly
as possible if we choose to go down that road.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I
shall take three more quick questions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>On a point of order,
Mr Deputy Presiding Officer. I asked the minister to clarify whether, when
he used the phrase "broadly accept the report", he meant that there were
other parts of the report that were not accepted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>That
is not a point of order.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>I welcome the minister's
statement and his commitment to openness and a constructive dialogue with
Parliament and its committees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have two points. First, how lengthy and
complex does he expect the proposed accountability, budgeting and audit
bill to be, and is he satisfied that there will be sufficient time for
pre-legislative scrutiny, bearing in mind that we are working to a very
tight timetable?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, I also welcome the FIAG report.
In setting out the budget process, it makes clear that consideration of
strategic priorities for the financial year 2001-02 cannot begin until
the current financial year, 1999-2000, ends next April. That obviously
means that consideration of spending for the next year, 2000-01, will be
severely curtailed, as the Parliament has only just come into existence.
We have already lost two months. Will Mr McConnell comment on that and
say when he expects to be able to publish a preliminary draft budget for
2000-01?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>I would like to answer
Mr Davidson's point because the issue of broadly accepting the report is
important. In my statement I specifically mentioned the two issues on which
I want to consult with the committees: one is the use of primary and secondary
legislation and the other is the future of public audit arrangements in
Scotland. That information was in my statement and I furnished Mr Davidson
with a copy in advance, so I hope that he was able to look at it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am happy to confirm that we will have
time for adequate pre-legislative scrutiny. The FIAG report has been in
the public domain for some time now and we have already had a lot of feedback
on its contents. The bill will be based on that report.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am conscious that, based on the FIAG
report,&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we are two months
behind schedule at this stage on the budget for next year. I hope that
we will be able to apply some creative effort to ensuring that Parliament
is able to consider, both in committees and here in the chamber, proposals
for next year's budget at the earliest possible date after the summer recess.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>Will
the minister confirm, notwithstanding the terms of his statement today,
that the tartan tax is not dead and that what we have heard is an uncharacteristic
temporary respite care for Scottish taxpayers? Will he confirm that the
members of the Lib-Lab Administration believe in the tax-varying power
and do not rule out its application to Scottish taxpayers in the future
if we have the misfortune to return them at another election?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>It must be a matter
of great regret for Mr McLetchie that the Administration has taken this
decision in a united and unanimous way. We are sure that we will spend
the resources of this Parliament and this Executive well during the next
four years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When it comes to financial matters, there
is a duty on all four main parties and on the others represented in this
chamber not to make financial matters merely a political football during
the next four years, but to ensure that we go into the detail of the budget,
identify savings and spend resources on the priorities of the people of
Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP): </strong>If
I heard Mr McConnell aright, he said that the memorandum on the bill would
be made available to the Finance Committee and the Audit Committee by this
weekend. Why not today?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Will he also tell us what time scale he
envisages for the creation of Audit Scotland?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>The issue of the creation
of Audit Scotland is one of the matters on which I want to report in detail
to the committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The memorandum cannot be made available
today because I was not prepared to finalise its contents until I had heard
feedback from members in the chamber this afternoon. This evening, I intend
to finalise the memorandum on the basis of comments that have been made
today, so that any new points can be taken on board. The memorandum will
be circulated first thing tomorrow morning.</font></td>
