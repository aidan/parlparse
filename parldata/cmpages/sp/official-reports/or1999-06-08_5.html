<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That the Parliament:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; recognises the importance
of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park, the first National Park
in Scotland, as an area to be maintained as one of outstanding natural
beauty and for potential in terms of social and economic development.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(b)&nbsp; encourages the Scottish Executive
to consider bringing forward the necessary legislation in relation to the
setting up of the first National Park for Scotland at an early opportunity.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17:07</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):
</strong>I am sorry to see that so many Scottish National party members have
left, but not to worry. In February, the Government announced its intention
of establishing Loch Lomond and the Trossachs as the first national park
in Scotland. The designation recognises the world-class character of this
natural resource and tourist attraction. It is an initiative that deserves
and has received widespread support, and that could offer a model for developments
elsewhere in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are, however, many issues still to
be considered, and I would like to highlight three of them. First, the
national park offers an opportunity to safeguard an area of great natural
beauty and the potential sensitively to promote the social and economic
development of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs area. Together, those objectives
provide a major opportunity for the achievement of sustainable development
that creates jobs and also sustain communities in a way that conserves
the outstanding landscape. It would, however, be foolish to underestimate
the tensions between the two objectives, but those must be resolved.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, the precise boundaries of the
national park for Loch Lomond and the Trossachs need to be decided. Such
a decision must be made with as much local consultation as possible, but
we must learn from the experience in England and Wales. It is important
that boundaries can be reviewed and changed as local circumstances change.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thirdly, I will turn directly to the issue
of democratic accountability. As Scottish Natural Heritage has argued,
we need to promote local community involvement in the identification, governance
and management of national parks. The present interim committee, which
encompasses the three council areas involved and includes individuals from
the various interested groups will, with legislation, be replaced by a&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">national park authority.
Through the legislative process, Parliament must look further into the
methods and rules for appointing members to a national park authority.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My local authority, Stirling Council, is
keenly concerned with the development of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs
national park. Through a phase of extensive consultation with key partners,
the council has already drawn up a comprehensive and far-reaching rural
strategy that recognises that the rural landscape around Stirling is a
major resource. It is a key amenity for residents and it plays a significant
role in the local and national economy. The Loch Lomond and Trossachs park
initiative must be developed alongside and as part of the broader rural
strategy for Stirling and the adjacent areas of Argyll and Bute and west
Dunbartonshire.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Much remains to be done if the vision of
the first national park for Scotland is to become a reality. The Parliament
must view this development as a priority and must ensure that the necessary
legislation is brought forward at an early opportunity.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17:10</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>My first concern when there is talk of setting up new Government organisations
and of changing things is always the control of such organisations, which
Dr Jackson mentioned. That concern is understandable, given the years of
Conservative rule when privatisation was the name of the game and when
decision making, even for institutions with a public remit, was controlled
by unelected representatives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unfortunately, despite Labour's promises
at the 1997 election of quango bonfires, the quangos of Scotland are still
with us and their number has increased. Will Dr Jackson let us know today
her party's real intention for the control of the national park? Will it
be controlled by Labour party selection or by democratic election?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George
Reid): </strong>There is a problem with the computer screens, so I need to clarify
who wants to speak. Dr Simpson, do you want to contribute to this debate?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>No.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17:11</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Keith Raffan (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(LD): </strong>I support everything that Dr Jackson has said. I am sorry that
I was not able to ask her for permission in advance to speak in this, the
first debate on members' business. I hope that she will not object to my
speaking.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important
to have debates on constituency issues such as this, and I am glad that
the first debate is on this issue. I have not attended any consultation
meetings on the Loch Lomond and Trossachs national park, although I have
attended a meeting on the proposed Cairngorms national park.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is right that we should set up such
parks and I support the Administration in doing so. Scotland is way behind
the rest of the country on this issue. I was a member of Parliament in
Wales for nine years and saw how valuable the Snowdonia and Brecon Beacons
national parks were to conservation and to ensuring an integrated approach,
so that the difficult balance between conservation and the environment
on the one hand and local economic development on the other could be struck.
I do not agree with much that Lord Sewel says, but he has said that it
is important that initiatives such as the national parks do not become
"a living museum". He is right about that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During the European by-election, I participated
in a consultation exercise in Ballater. One of the most valuable things
that I learnt from that-certainly more valuable than the election result-was
the importance of participation by local people in the running of national
parks. Ballater is a relatively small village, so I was immensely impressed
by the number of local people from every aspect of community life, including
mountain rescue, who turned up because they wanted to have a say in how
the national park would be set up and run. At one point, when we broke
up into small working groups, I sat with members of the mountain rescue
team. They had detailed inside knowledge of the entire Cairngorms area,
which made the consultation a fascinating exercise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important not only to involve local
people in committees when national parks are set up, but also to ensure
that local people, who know the area inside out, help manage the parks.
At the meeting that I attended, one or two people pontificated who had
probably never been up a hill in their lives-not even the ones outside
Ballater, which are not particularly high. However, some of the people
there, such as the mountain rescue team, had a tremendous contribution
to make.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The success or failure of the national
parks will depend on the extent to which we involve local people in their
management. Such parks mark a tremendous advance across the board, in conservation
of the environment and in planning, as the parks will have planning authority
devolved to them from local councils. In effect, they will take over responsibility
for the entire area, which makes a lot of sense.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I strongly support the principle of national
parks, on which I believe Lord James Douglas-Hamilton&nbsp;</font></td>

the initiative when he was a minister some time ago. In an article in <i>The
Scotsman </i>in January 1989 he was reported as saying that he hoped to
encourage the setting up of national parks in Scotland. I hope that real
progress can now be made. We have been way behind England and Wales and
it is time that we caught up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to speak will be able to do so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17:15</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland)
(Con): </strong>I must declare an interest in this issue. I have spent many
years representing the Trossachs-for the past five years as a member of
the local council and before that as a community councillor and community
councillor chairman covering the area up to Strath Ard-and am especially
interested in the welfare of the people who would be affected by this measure.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hate to think how many meetings I have
attended where fears have been expressed about the interests of those who
live and try to earn a living in a particular area. Time and again, under
the previous Labour administration in Stirling, many of the comments that
were made were not listened to. At one stage, no one living in the park
was sitting on the various bodies that then existed to discuss the issue
or to represent the views of those living in the park. I found that distasteful.
I will make the point-Dr Jackson has passed it on and I hope that the minister
gets the message-that there is a vital need for input from the people who
live and work in that area. They must be present at and able to participate
in any discussions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The community councils in the area fought
hard for representation. I, as their councillor, fought hard to try to
ensure that we would have a two-tier management system; one for the Trossachs
and one for Loch Lomond. I am afraid I have to say that the lord who was
responsible refused that and decided that we were only going to have one
body. In one stroke, local accountability and input were removed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am sure that that is not what this Parliament
is about. I know that earlier on I accused someone of being parochial.
I admit to being parochial now, but it is because we must get these things
right. In the future, when we consider national parks in other areas of
Scotland, I am sure that things will roll out. It is vital that we convey
the need for local democratic input. Much lip service is paid to that principle,
but I would like to see it in action for the people of the Trossachs.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green): </strong>My
concerns about the setting up of national parks reflect some of the things
that have already been said. With respect to rural Scotland, Scottish Green
party policy is that we would like much of it to be considered not as a
wonderful and beautiful wilderness, but as a devastated land that was once
heavily forested with incredible biodiversity and which was also well populated.
When setting up a national park, one should keep in mind that we do not
want to see the rest of rural Scotland as a national park.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second point is the concept of carrying
capacity. National parks are going to become extremely popular. I have
been down to the lake district on a couple of occasions-indeed I was looking
at a woodland area there just a few weeks ago-and in the summer the area
becomes intolerable for the people who live there. The number of people
visiting the park begins to impinge on the area that one wishes to protect
and keep beautiful.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is much to learn from Yosemite national
park and we would benefit from sending one person there-or perhaps we should
invite one person from there to address us so that we cannot be accused
of junketing-to learn about the problems that they have had, which, to
a large extent, they have solved extremely well.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>With
members' agreement, I propose to allow the debate to continue for an extra

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn

on a matter which the people of Scotland will expect us to solve in a way
relatively free from party political considerations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would like to declare a number of interests.
The second proposed national park in the Cairngorms falls within my constituency
and many of the general issues that Dr Jackson touched upon have a similar,
if slightly different, effect in my constituency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The approach of this chamber should be
to select the best elements from the rest of the world's experience of
national parks and to learn from them, especially the lake district where
the pressure has been unacceptable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I should perhaps declare a further interest.
Early this morning I went for a run, although that is perhaps an exaggeration
of the speed, on the west Highland way. I ventured up Conic hill. The view

I happened to meet a local shepherd and I asked him his views about this
debate, because I was aware that it was in the business bulletin. He said
that we must not have another quango, and a national park where the board
of management is dominated by people who are not based in the area and
who are not knowledgeable about local issues. I would like to see an elected
body, comprising a majority of local residents, which has access to expert
advice. That is suitable and necessary.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second issue is one of expense. How
much will the park cost per year? How will it be funded? Will the Labour
party take this opportunity to rule out local road tolls, which were proposed
by Scottish Natural Heritage as one method of funding?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17:21</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and
Fife) (Con): </strong>Dr Jackson will recall from the debate that we had on
26 April in Aberfoyle that there is a great deal of local concern about
what the term national-or perhaps I should say nationalised-park really
means. Much of the concern is about funding-for example, what funding might
there be to mitigate the infrastructure problems that will undoubtedly
occur?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There has been a lot of talk about using
national parks as a branding exercise to bring more people into the Loch
Lomond area. Certainly, many of the people who are in favour of a national
park see it as a way to attract more tourists. As has been said, that can
cause great problems, as the additional tourist load can erode the beautiful
things that we are trying to preserve. National parks are a double-edged
sword.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must examine what can be done about
viewing points, single-track roads and additional lay-bys, and we must
ensure not only that there are toilets, but that they are kept open. Sylvia
knows fine well what I mean by that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have no doubt that we will return to
the issues of boundaries and who runs the park, but we are seeing undue
haste on this matter-there is by no means a consensus that a national park
is needed in the locality of Loch Lomond. The issue is not simply one of
preserving the beautiful environment. The proposal will undoubtedly affect
people's lifestyles and businesses. Indeed, in trying to preserve what
needs to be preserved, we may be disrupting it. I recommend that the Administration
resists the temptation to legislate immediately.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

at the outset, as other members have been inclined to do. I am the directly
elected member of the Dumbarton constituency, which covers the eastern
part of the proposed national park for Loch Lomond and the Trossachs. It
is undoubtedly an area of outstanding natural beauty, enjoyed by people
from across Scotland and from across the world.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Until the park authority is established
as a legal entity, the interim committee is considering four key aims:
to safeguard the cultural and natural heritage of the area; to promote
the sustainable use of natural resources; to promote the social and economic
well-being of local communities; and to provide for public enjoyment and
understanding. I will focus briefly on the potential for economic development.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The constituents of Dumbarton and I are
clear about the need for sustainable development. We must balance the need
to protect the environment with the need to create employment opportunities.
There is no doubt that that will be an extremely sensitive issue, but it
is clear that where we can, and where it is appropriate, we should develop
job opportunities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tourism continues to be important to the
Scottish economy, contributing approximately &pound;2.6 billion per annum
and supporting 178,000 jobs. The potential to create tourism-related employment
in the context of the national park is evident. We should encourage local
agencies to work together to maximise the opportunities, and above all
to connect people who are unemployed with those opportunities. That will
provide added value to our efforts. Equally, there will be development
potential in the supply chain, education services, park ranger services
and general recreation, all of which should be exploited.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the same time, we must ensure that our
heritage and environment are protected. I believe that the national park
authority for Loch Lomond and the Trossachs is the mechanism to promote
sustainable development and to protect the environment. I therefore support
the motion calling for the establishment of a national park for Loch Lomond
and the Trossachs, and commend it to the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is widespread
agreement about the need for a national park, but I will respond to some
of the specific questions that have been raised. This is not a new issue;
it has been with us for a long time. It is not a mark of haste to suggest
that it should be one of the priorities for an incoming Scottish Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For centuries, Loch Lomond and the Trossachs
have been celebrated for their outstanding scenic qualities. The area supports
a rich mix of water, wild land, forest, woodland, farmland and people.
It is an exceptional landscape throughout the year and is of the highest
importance, both nationally and internationally, in terms of natural heritage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To those who suggest that a national park
would create pressures, I say that there are already pressures. The real
question that we must address is how to manage existing problems in an
integrated and effective way. Somewhere in the region of 5 million people
visit Loch Lomond and the Trossachs each summer. Many of them are stopping
locally, but many are staying for a longer period. Many of them arrive
by car: about 93 per cent of visitors travel privately, the vast majority
by car. Mr Monteith's comments about parking and infrastructure are absolutely
critical and must be addressed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The west Highland way, which was mentioned
by Fergus Ewing, attracts more than 50,000 walkers per year. There are
already problems in Loch Lomond and the Trossachs. Robin Harper was absolutely
correct with his comments on managing the critical and carrying capacities
of the area, but we need a mechanism to do that. Although we do not currently
have such a mechanism, the national park may provide us with one.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I offer one last snapshot of the issue's
importance. Around 70 per cent of Scotland's population can travel to Loch
Lomond and the Trossachs in less than an hour. That is an awful lot of
us for a day trip, and does not include visitors from abroad.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Since the election of the Labour Government
in 1997, we have made substantial progress. Scottish Natural Heritage has
carried out a huge amount of research, in two phases. Initially, people
were asked to give their views; those consulted included local authorities,
community councils, public agencies and everyone in the area who was interested.
Reviews of national park structures elsewhere were commissioned, and the
experience-which Mr Raffan mentioned-both nationally within the UK and
internationally, was considered. A huge number of meetings were also held.
In the second phase of the consultation, more than 10,000 copies of Scottish
Natural Heritage's proposals and consultation paper were issued.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is less support overall for such
a measure in the Cairngorms, as was mentioned by other members. I acknowledge
that there is less enthusiasm in the Cairngorms, but we need to consider

areas. We as a Parliament need to steer a consultation process, initiated

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>No one is suggesting
that there should be one blueprint for the whole of Scotland. The question
is how Labour will fund a national park in Loch Lomond. How much will such
a park cost per year? Will the Executive rule out imposing local road tolls
to fund it?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Funding depends on
the kind of national park that we in this Parliament collectively agree
on. We can speculate-SNH predicted how much particular kinds of national
park would cost-but until we know what kind of park there will be, it is
impossible to answer Mr Ewing's question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to emphasise the crucial point made
by Jackie Baillie and Sylvia Jackson about balancing social and economic
objectives with long-term environmental objectives. We need to get the
balance right. That is the challenge and that is why establishing national
parks is an exciting idea-it is an exciting issue for the Parliament to
take up. We have had a lot of consultation and there is a lot of enthusiasm
for a national park at Loch Lomond and the Trossachs. Our challenge is
to take the debate forward and to continue to involve people in that process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
