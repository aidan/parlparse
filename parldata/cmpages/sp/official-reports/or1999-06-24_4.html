</strong>The first item of business this afternoon is question time. I remind
members that, during the closed question period, the member asking the
question should do so without departing from the terms of the question
as published in the business bulletin. Supplementary questions should be
brief and should refer to the same subject as the question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I call Michael Russell to ask the first
question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><strong><font face="Arial,Helvetica">SCOTTISH EXECUTIVE</font></strong><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><center><strong><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scottish Arts Council</font></strong></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>1. Michael Russell (South of Scotland)
(SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to bring forward
proposals for a review of the structure and function of the Scottish Arts
Council. (S1O-82)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Children and Education
(Mr Sam Galbraith): </strong>No. The SAC will have a continuing and evolving
role at the centre of cultural life in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>I thank the minister
for his answer, although it was not the one that I was hoping for.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I draw his attention to the information
bulletin from the Arts Council, a document which, as he is the minister
responsible, I am sure he has read. It lists the council's committees.
There are around 180 people on the list, of whom only 30 are working artists.
Does the minister agree that it is important, even if the structure and
function are not to be reviewed, that we find a mechanism whereby working
artists can feel some ownership of the Arts Council, rather than seeing
it owned by people who might have a more limited involvement in the arts?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>That is a dreadful
slur on the people who give their time freely to the Arts Council; Michael
Russell should be wary about making it. He makes a point about involving
working artists, but he should bear it in mind that such people often have
a vested interest in the distribution of funding.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As with the Sports Council, the difficulty
in trying to engage people who are active in the field is that they say
that, although they would love to be involved, they do not have the time.
However, I take Mr Russell's point and we will consider ways in which to
involve more working artists in the Arts Council.</font></td>

that the funding of area tourist boards operates on a sustainable basis

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Minister for Highlands and
Islands and Gaelic (Mr Alasdair Morrison):</strong> I intend to seek views as
to whether any change should be made in the method by which area tourist
boards are funded.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Bruce Crawford: </strong>Years of local authority
cuts have had an impact on many services, including support for area tourist
boards. Several area tourist boards are on the verge of bankruptcy-or they
were at the end of the previous financial year-and that makes it extremely
difficult for them. It is also difficult for local authorities to maintain
their previous levels of support.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is required is a funding package,
stretching over three years, as promised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer
in some of his early statements to the House of Commons. When can we expect
the Scottish Executive to introduce plans for three-year budgeting for
local authorities and other bodies-on an individual council basis-to ensure
sustainability and security not only for ATBs, but for other public service
organisations?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Morrison: </strong>I understand and appreciate
the concerns of the ATBs. However, any review that we undertake will be
done properly and will be well thought out. We will not be rushed or forced
to arrive at hasty conclusions. We will initiate a review and, most important,
we will listen to the views of local partners over the next few months.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>As well as providing
resources for the training of staff in the early-years sector, will the
minister consider some of the models of provision that are currently available,
such as the excellent Foxlea centre in my constituency, which was inspected
recently? Those centres are flexible models of provision that are open
much longer than traditional nurseries and in which nursery nurses play
a fundamental and responsible role. Will he encourage that type of provision?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>Yes, I certainly will.
Perhaps Mr Henry knows that I visited a family centre in his former local
authority and was impressed by its flexibility and the range of services
on offer: that is what we want. Our policy for children is based on the
child, but it must also be flexible, to ensure that we meet the needs of
the parents as well. Provided that we keep those two things in mind-the
needs of the parent, the needs of the child, which are paramount-I am certain
that we will get it right well into the future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Target setting is important and we will work with schools and education
authorities to make it as effective as possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>I will take that
as a no. Does the minister accept that the current method of target setting
in schools has almost no support among teachers, education authorities
and parents? In fact, the Scottish Parent Teacher Council has been one
of the method's most outspoken critics. Does he further accept that the
targets have little or no statistical validity because of their reliance
on free school meal entitlement, which is an inadequate measure of the
differences in school intake characteristics? Finally, does he accept that
if we are to have targets that can assist in raising standards, they must
be more sophisticated and bear more relevance to the individual circumstances
of schools?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>I do not agree with
Nicola's first point. The teaching profession has shown support for this
method of setting targets. My colleague Peter Peacock was at St Francis
Primary School in Niddrie, at which teachers said that the targets were
absolutely essential to enhance their school's status.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Once again, I detect the general vein of
complaining about things but never coming up with something constructive.
Target setting as a principle is not negotiable. What is negotiable is
the ways in which target setting can be improved. I look forward to Nicola
bringing her suggestions to me.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Health and Community
Care (Susan Deacon): </strong>Dental decay is a serious problem among children
in Scotland. Health boards are tackling it now through health education,
incentives to dentists and other initiatives. The Scottish Executive will
build on that and will develop the agenda set out in the public health
white paper, working towards the target of 60 per cent of five-year-olds
with no experience of dental disease by 2010.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>Dental decay and oral
cancer is the most common reason for admission of under-14-year-olds to
in-patient and day-care beds in Scotland. Alleviation of the problem of
dental decay and oral cancer would reduce preventable pain and save money
in primary and secondary health care. Will the minister take up the British
Dental Association's suggestion of including oral hygiene, diet advice
and registration with a dentist in standard health checks, or as part of
the pre-school education programme?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>As Mrs Scanlon rightly
suggests, the British Dental Association has published a comprehensive

I think the Parliament ought to consider. We in Scotland have a poor record
of dental health, and we need to improve the dental health of children
in particular. We will have to consider diet, oral and dental hygiene and
education. I also think that this Parliament should consider the fluoridation

for breaches of the peace where there is evidence of harassment or where
there are overtones of domestic violence, and enhanced penalties for what
are effectively domestic violence assaults, so that-without necessarily
creating a specific crime-we nevertheless get the action that we require
in the courts?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>Sentencing in individual
cases is a matter for the courts. However, it is important to recognise,
as Ms Cunningham does, that breach of the peace can apply to some very
serious offences. The Crown often recognises that and brings the cases
on indictment. In 1997, 11 breach of the peace cases were taken on indictment
and a total of 1,378 people received custodial sentences for that offence.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning (Henry McLeish): </strong>On many of the standard indicators, the Scottish
economy is performing well. Unemployment in Scotland is falling, employment
is increasing and youth and long-term unemployment are both at historically
low levels. Scottish manufacturers and exporters have performed resiliently
in the face of difficult trading conditions. This is a tribute to the Government's
very successful management of the UK economy over the past two years. Devolution

our economic success, which we will do on the basis of the principles and
initiatives set out in "Partnership for Scotland".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to the Scottish economy?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Yes. In the dynamic
financial services sector it is vital to the Scottish economy. It is important
that members of the Scottish Parliament are seen to support enterprise
when jobs and headquarters are being secured. Scottish Widows' customer
base is being widened from 2 million to 15 million in the United Kingdom
and more than 2,200 outlets are being opened to it. The funds under management
will increase from more than &pound;30 billion to more than &pound;80 billion,
which will mean that the financial services sector in Edinburgh will deal
with more than &pound;250 billion-worth of funds under management. That
will take it to the level of Frankfurt, and will probably mean that it
overtakes Frankfurt as the fifth largest financial centre that deals with
new unit trusts and management funding.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

What is important is that the alliance between Scottish Widows and Lloyds

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the First Minister will recall from
his days at law school-if not, I am sure the Deputy First Minister will
remind him-the essence of a duty is that it is an enforceable obligation.

wherewithal. That provides a good basis for co-operation to work towards

the First Minister will be aware that there were reports this morning that
a number of local education authorities in England are being rapped over
the knuckles by his opposite number down south for spending too much money
on red tape and not enough on schools. Will the First Minister please tell
us how he intends to ensure that that situation does not occur in Scotland
and that additional funding is directed towards our schools and not to
expanding council bureaucracy?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

extraordinary that having rapped me rather pompously over the knuckles

that clearly implies that he thinks that too much is being spent on bureaucracy

importance of the strategic trunk roads network to businesses and communities.
It is important that trunk roads are used effectively and that goods can
be transported around the country in good time. We need to consider ways
in which to improve the effectiveness of that network. The Government has
put in money, through the comprehensive spending review, to ensure that
we can maintain the roads network effectively and to the proper standard,
and to examine a range of measures such as taking freight off roads and
encouraging it on to rail. That will ensure that we make the most&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Malcolm Chisholm (Edinburgh North and
Leith) (Lab): </strong>I welcome the fact that, for the first time, we will
have a road programme that is based on an integrated transport policy rather
than an uncosted and unaffordable wish list such as we had under the previous
Government. Will the minister undertake to consider safety and environmental
factors when making decisions about road developments?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>I am happy to agree.
We need to take a broad look at the role of the roads network and how it
fits into our integrated transport strategy. Safety issues, environmental
issues, access issues, integration with the rest of the network and economic
development are all important. The strategic roads review will consider
those key things to ensure that we do not have a wish list of roads, but
a sensible approach so that we can prioritise effectively for the good
of the country.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>We
have been waiting a long time for the roads review and, in some cases,
it has been a very long time indeed. When I was first elected to the House
of Commons, I remember people in the Scottish Office talking about a motorway
between Haggs and Stepps. A quarter of a century later we are still waiting.
They are still talking about it and they have apparently not even decided
on the line of route.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>Ask a question,
please.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>Will the minister
give an early announcement about upgrading the A80 route to a motorway
rather than constructing a new motorway through the Kelvin valley?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>It would be premature
for me to announce an individual option from the strategic roads review
before we have conducted that review. As I mentioned to Malcolm Chisholm,
the key issues are to do with access, integration, safety and economy.
We are investigating those things in the roads review. When Parliament
returns in the autumn, we can consider those issues and decide on our priorities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>That brings
open question time to an end. I know that it is early days, but both questions
and answers need to be a little briefer if more members are to be called.</font></td>
