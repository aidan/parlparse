<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On resuming-</font></i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):
</strong>We now continue with the debate on the Executive's legislative proposals.
It would be nice if some members of the Executive turned up for the debate.
[M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>: "Hear, hear."]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although I have some requests to speak
left over from this morning, I invite any members who want to speak in
this afternoon's debate to confirm their intention by pressing their request
buttons. If there is an insufficient number of members who want to speak,
I will consider taking a motion to close the debate. As a result of that
we would move on, earlier than 5 o'clock, to Mr David Mundell's motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>On a point of order,
Sir David. Your observation is quite a serious one. There is a convention,
certainly in the Westminster Parliament and perhaps in other Parliaments
throughout the world, that at least one member of the Executive should
be available to hear the points being made. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I see
that the Deputy First Minister is now arriving. I do not know whether he
was on duty and is late, or whether his appearance is simply a fortuitous
performance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I thought,
Mr Salmond, that I had made that point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">14:31</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP): </strong>Thank
you, Sir David. I will not pursue the issue of who is where at any given
time, because many games can be played with it, as you and I well know
from our experiences in other places.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is my maiden speech in this assembly.
I am not sure how many times one is allowed to make a maiden speech in
a lifetime, but here I go again. In this chamber, at least, I cannot be
called a retread, as I was, rather ungraciously, in 1987, when I rematerialised
as the member of Parliament for Moray. To continue the analogy of being
a retread, after some 17 years as part of the Scottish minority at Westminster,
I decided that I wanted to come home because I genuinely believed that
there was an opportunity for new direction, new steering and even new highways.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introducing the legislative programme,
the First Minister referred to his statement as starting the line-up. He
may be in pole position in the race but, as many drivers can verify, that
does not guarantee that a chequered flag will come down on his behalf at
the end of the race.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

our political interests at the turbulent chamber known&nbsp;</font></td>

Union; I know that other members have survived that initiation. The difference,
however, between the First Minister and myself-and I say, "Vive la diff&eacute;rence"-is
that he sees this assembly as the completion of what was described as the
unfinished business of the much-respected John Smith. I see this assembly
as only the beginning of that unfinished business. The terminal point of
this organisation will be chosen by the voters of Scotland in the democratic
process that is offered to them by us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As an unashamed nationalist, I have never
hidden my belief in independence, and I will continue to argue for the
right of Scotland to be an independent nation within the community of the
world.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For various personal reasons, I have not
been able to be present in this chamber as much as I would have liked during
the past weeks. However, I have watched, I have listened and I have read
the reports. Sadly, what has taken place has not been particularly edifying.
I do not know whether summer charm schools or makeovers will make any difference
to elected members, including myself-perhaps my husband will want to comment
on that. What I have gleaned from watching the deliberations of this Parliament
is that the electors, the people, the voters, the taxpayers and the commentators
have been disappointed with what we have done so far.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister said this morning that
this programme was another milestone. He then proceeded down what seemed
to be a dead end. He referred to</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"exceptional and limited circumstances
where it is sensible and proper that the Westminster Parliament legislates
in devolved areas of responsibility."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I wonder whether anyone from the rather
empty benches of the Executive could tell me what those exceptional and
limited circumstances are. Who will define those circumstances? Will it
be the 129 of us who have been elected to this assembly, or will it happen
by the recall of Peter Mandelson to No 10? That is one of the fundamental
issues which we must address.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The legislative programme will impact on
my constituency of Moray in a number of ways. I have the pleasure of being
the MP who represents the area that produces over 50 per cent of Scotch
whisky. It is very tempting sometimes to name all my distilleries, but
I will spare members that ordeal this afternoon. Everyone knows, however,
that the whisky industry is hugely important to Speyside. It is responsible
for many jobs-12,000 directly and 60,000 indirectly-and pays a great deal
of money to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is a strategic industry
that is listed among the top five UK industries. Over the years I have
campaigned seriously for whisky industry taxation to be&nbsp;</font></td>

that of the beer and wine industries. Now the fuel escalator will have
an adverse effect on the whisky industry-French cognac producers will escape
that problem.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In this week's <i>Sunday Herald</i>, Mr
McLeish said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"In the spirit of the new politics, the
parliament will listen to the industry, learn and champion its wider concerns
in relation to taxation and other issues."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yesterday, I met representatives of the
Treasury, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that the
Scottish Parliament could lobby on behalf of the Scotch whisky industry
as much as it wanted, but taxation is a reserved matter.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Is that what was meant by the First Minister's
comments this morning? Do we, as a Parliament, agree that we can only eavesdrop,
or are we prepared to go centre stage and take an industry such as the
Scotch whisky industry on board and ensure that the money that it brings
to our economy and the service that it provides are regarded as fundamental
to this assembly?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The fishing industry was not mentioned
this morning. My honourable friend-I am sorry, I keep using these Westminster
phrases-Mr Salmond, Alex as we know him, knows only too well, as do many
of us, the misfortunes of the Scottish fishing industry. Many of us have
had to attend the funerals and memorial services of our men lost at sea.
In particular, I recall the loss several years ago of the Premier, from
Lossiemouth, where a mother and father lost three sons, just before Christmas.
Anyone who has been to a memorial service or a funeral for one lost at
sea, knows full well how much passion is given to the singing of the hymn:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"O hear us when we cry to thee,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For those in peril on the sea."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Where will the Parliament stand on the
impact on the fishing industry of legislation introduced by Europe? Will
the First Minister or his deputy argue at the top table about the significance
of the fishing industry to our rural economy and to the economy as a whole?
Or will we in this Parliament be eavesdropping on decisions that will impact
on the lives and the livelihoods of so many families?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister made no reference in
his statement to freedom of information. We have spoken about an inclusive
Parliament, which will reach out to people, involving voluntary and statutory
organisations alike in the decisions that we reach. There should be involvement
of the people, for the people and by the people. Nothing was said about
freedom of information, yet Scotland has its own legal system. If we talk
about an inclusive Parliament, it is fundamental that we should mention
the right to freedom of information. Are we expected not just to eavesdrop,
but to tap&nbsp;</font></td>

from Westminster?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have an amazing responsibility, 129
of us, elected in various ways to the first Parliament for 300 years. It
is a challenge that we must not take lightly; all of us have to work extremely
hard. I did not come here to wreck-a word used by the First Minister in
his speech-the Parliament. I agree that there will be vigorous debate,
but it should be healthy debate. As details of the programme are eventually
spelled out, consultation and all, I will continue to advocate that the
Parliament should be in the van of forward thinking, if we as individuals
take on that responsibility. I shall not be dragged along on the coat tails
of an outdated Victorian system. The people of Scotland are not pawns;
I am not here to be a pawn of any political system. I came here to work
for Scotland and to take Scotland forward to full independence and the
rights that she deserves in the international community.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> Before I
call the next speaker, I should like to say that if members stick to about
four minutes each, everybody should be able to speak. If members go much
beyond that, there will be many disappointed people at the end of the afternoon.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">14:43</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>The
last speech did not sound like a maiden speech. It was a polished performance,
but did it address the proposed legislation that was put before us by the
Executive today? Apart from the freedom of information question, which
will have to be discussed at some point, it did not. It did raise significant
and important issues, and there is no doubt that members will wish to discuss
them-opportunities to do so will arise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am beginning to get a strong feeling
that many of the Opposition speakers are confusing action that can be taken,
using current laws, with areas where new law is clearly needed. Rushing
in haste to make laws on individual issues is not the best solution.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One example from this morning is Mary Scanlon
who, among others, wanted a new law on health. The new NHS structures in
Scotland have been put in place only within the past two months. The health
professionals and the public in Scotland would not thank the Parliament
for embarking on yet further legislation before we see how the new legislation
changes our structures for the better. The Health and Community Care Committee
will have the opportunity to look at how the legislation is working to
achieve the goal on which most of us agree-a health service that truly
meets the needs of the Scottish people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

do not need additional legislation. I should have liked health to be further
up the agenda, but I made it clear that I was not asking for restructuring
of the health service.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>That makes my point
extremely well. I thought that this debate was about the alternate legislation
that was required, not about actions that might-appropriately, I agree
with Mary Scanlon-be taken.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although Mrs Ewing said that she, and the
public, had not been impressed, I have been impressed that a number of
speakers from different parties have already shown a passion and a determination
to tackle the scourge of drugs, which affects so many communities in Scotland.
However, does the issue of drugs require new laws? No; it needs a joined-up,
multi-faceted approach-to which Keith Raffan referred-which deals with
education, treatment and effective policing. Above all else, it needs the
involvement of the people: unless our citizens are genuinely on our side-on
that, we can provide leadership without new laws-we will not achieve our
objectives. Mary Scanlon referred to Mothers Against Drugs; a group in
my community-Locals Against Drugs in Alloa, or LADA-represents another
sign that individual groups are beginning to get together to tackle the
issue of drugs. We must provide the leadership, without legislation, to
enable them to do so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am sorry that Alex Salmond is not here,
because I have asked the SNP twice whether it is prepared to go against
the advice of the chief medical officer on the beef-on-the-bone ban. It
is important that we should know and, at some point, I should like a clear
answer. I know the SNP's policy on the ban and I have already said that
we all wish it to be lifted at an appropriate time, but to go against the
chief medical officer's advice is an extremely dangerous course of action.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Opposition members have said that the legislation
that was outlined today is inadequate and does not meet the needs of the
Scottish people. The 100,000 Scots who are affected by the incapable adults
bill would not agree with them. That bill sets a stamp on what this chamber
is about; it deals with a group of people who are the subject of archaic
and unfair laws, which are higgledy-piggledy, fragmented and all over the
place. If the Parliament can address such issues in its first session,
we will deal with them effectively.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the misfortune of still having to work out my notice in my previous job.

to patients, accept what they say, put living wills into their case notes-as
I have done throughout my professional life-and respect the wishes and
dignity of the individual patient. Health professionals should take people's
clearly expressed prior wishes into account, and I think that they are
beginning to do so. Through this chamber, we can encourage them to do so,
but I question whether we need specific legislation on living wills.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need legislation on the general issue,
because it is an important area in which difficult questions need to be
answered. For example, in accident and emergency departments today-at this
very moment-a junior doctor is probably technically assaulting a patient.
Junior doctors do not have the authority or permission, in law, to undertake
the necessary tests to produce a diagnosis and to go on to manage that
patient. Indeed, if a junior doctor goes on to administer treatment to
a still-unconscious patient, for example to reduce brain swelling, the
doctor is technically assaulting the patient. Our hard-pressed junior doctors,
to whom Opposition members referred this morning, have enough problems
on their hands without worrying about the legal position. The chamber has
a duty to ensure that the health professionals have clear laws that support
them and allow them to proceed appropriately.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing: </strong>Does that mean
that the Labour party now supports regarding the hours directive that applies
to junior doctors as significant in their contract of employment? I agree
with those sentiments.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>I cannot speak on behalf
of the Labour party, but I can speak as a doctor and as someone whose son
is an accident and emergency doctor. We have reduced junior doctors' hours
already and have agreements in place with junior doctors. I, along with
everybody else, will certainly question the Executive to ensure that those
agreements are met, and that the health authorities and trusts in Scotland
fulfil their obligations to junior doctors, who are still treated extremely
badly. The treatment of junior doctors is not just a question of hours.
Most junior doctors are dedicated and will work the hours that are necessary
to complete the job rather than fixed hours. We should also consider their
accommodation and support, and the dignity with which they are treated
as employees. The situation is not good at the moment and we need to address
it. I am sorry that I cannot give Mrs Ewing a straight answer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

and on welfare. I have significant experience in that area. As Karen Whitefield
pointed out in her excellent speech this morning, it is tragic and extremely
upsetting that a couple's joint bank account should be frozen when the
husband falls ill and is incapable; we cannot manage such situations. I
very much welcome the statement that the proposed bill makes to our country:
we care about people and will do something about it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">14:51</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>Margaret Ewing's umpteenth maiden speech was a good one. It was expressed
with all the sincerity that I have always recognised in her, but I will
pick up on one phrase: she said that she would use this Parliament as a
stepping stone to independence. I do not criticise her, but I see it as
a warning to all the unionist parties in this chamber to ensure that she
does not achieve that aim.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I take Dr Simpson's point about rushing
into legislation. There was another absence in the First Minister's speech.
He failed to make a statement about getting rid of archaic laws. Members
should consider the recommendations of the Law Society of Scotland, which
has suggested that Scotland is overburdened with laws that date from way
back. Karen Whitefield made that point this morning. The Parliament has
a duty to consider those laws and to get rid of them-the quicker the better-before
we begin a heavy work load of eight bills in the coming year. That is a
heck of a time scale in which to achieve good legislation. I am concerned
that the Executive has come forward with so many bills. However, in a few
minutes I will point out some omissions: areas that should have been included.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Among the bills that the Executive is pushing
through I welcome the bill on standards in local government. The First
Minister suggested that the problems in local government were distinct
Scottish problems. I think that they are wider than that, but I will take
his word for it. Perhaps we Conservatives can relax a bit; we have not
been in an administration in any authority in Scotland recently, so we
cannot be regarded as the party that is at fault over ethical issues in
local government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I go along entirely with the incapable
adults bill and look forward to it being presented. It will offer much
and is very much needed. I agree with Dr Simpson that Karen Whitefield
made a good speech this morning. She presented the facts. I honestly do
not think that any other member needs to go into detail on that bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

improvements to the environment. I refer him to the arguments that we had
about the link between the A77 and the M8 in Glasgow; the provision of
the M77 by the Tory Government has improved environmental conditions hugely
in the Thornliebank area of Glasgow and elsewhere. That road has brought
benefits to Ayrshire, as well as to people in Glasgow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Money spent wisely on roads can bring great

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Can Phil Gallie tell us some of the environmental
benefits of the M77 to the people of Glasgow, particularly those of Corkerhill
and greater Pollok, whose suffering through increased pollution and the
loss of public transport services is a damning indictment of the construction
of that road? I am sure that Robin would agree that the &pound;53 million
that was spent on constructing that road would have been better spent on
improving the public transport infrastructure in and around greater Pollok.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>I can describe the
environmental benefits without doubt. Consider the fumes that are emitted
by slow-moving traffic, travelling in stops and starts through Thornliebank.
I know that the same thing happened in Pollok, as I used to travel that
way from Ayr to Glasgow. There has been a great environmental improvement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Think of the children in Glasgow who had
difficulty crossing roads because of the traffic. Think of the improvement
for them. If Tommy Sheridan would like, I could list improvements for a
week, but I will not.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When I read "Partnership for Scotland",
the commitment to law and order that it expressed gave me reason to rejoice.
It said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of crime . . . We will be tough on crime and the criminals who blight our
communities."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, nothing in the First Minister's
statement reflected that commitment. The Executive might say that crime
figures are going down and that we do not have the same problems that we
had a year or two ago, but I ask the Deputy First Minister to look at the
figures. Between 1990 and 1997, crime figures went down. In 1998, however,
that trend was reversed. Non-sexual violence was up by 10 per cent; serious
assault by 9 per cent; crimes involving offensive weapons by 13 per cent;
and robbery by 9 per cent-once again, I could go on to cover a range of
serious issues. People are concerned about living their lives peaceably

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many members have raised the issue of drug
misuse; once again I commend the comments of Trish Godman and others on
that issue. I am very disappointed that the Labour party has not lived

says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

new powers of confiscation to strip convicted drug dealers of their assets."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Dr Simpson said that, in many ways, there is no need for new legislation

Mr Dewar offers us a bill to raise standards in Scottish schools. I would
like to point out that acts of Parliament do not raise standards, ministers
do not raise standards and even local councils do not raise standards;
teachers and parents raise standards. I am worried because the mood music
around the issue is not right.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We cannot raise standards in schools unless
we have a motivated and committed teaching force. We do not motivate our
teachers by denigrating them as many Government ministers have done for
years. We do not motivate our teachers by confrontation on salaries and
conditions-a dangerous prospect on the horizon. We do not raise standards
by backing national testing-which does not test what it is supposed to
and which gives results that are unsafe-or by setting standards that are
plucked out of the air and that people have then to negotiate away. We
do not raise standards by issuing statistics through which schools can
be placed in order and which demotivate schools that, however hard the
teachers try to do their job, are not near the top of the list.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another matter
on the horizon troubles me deeply: the higher still programme. The programme
is going ahead, but there are real problems with higher still English.
It is not going ahead as it should be because the professionals-the people
who are in schools all day, every day-seriously believe that there are
difficulties in the content, delivery and assessment of that course.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Moreover, there are flaws in the examination
system and worries about its validity and integrity. Outside influences
have too many opportunities to interfere to make the results safe. Higher
still is the flagship of the Scottish education system, and something needs
to be done to restore the confidence of the teachers, as well as, in the
long term, that of the public and of the pupils who will sit the examination.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are talking about the introduction of
new bills for education and about consultation, so it is important that
teachers-not just the Educational Institute of Scotland, of which I am
proud to be a member, but teachers on the ground-are asked about how things
should be done. Their views must be taken seriously. I assure members that
people complain about higher still English not because they are skiving,
but because they are worried about their professional status. That problem
needs to be addressed. The Executive and the Parliament need to take account
of the professional views of teachers both before legislation is introduced
and during all our other negotiations with them and others in the education
system.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister spoke about the expansion
of pre-school education. I do not know exactly what the terms of that expansion
will be, but consultation on that issue might also have been helpful. In
rural areas, there is a real problem with nursery places for pre-school
pupils. For example, the kids from Walkerburn are given places in Innerleithen,
but there is nothing in the legislation to make local authorities bus them
there. Local authorities have to help children to travel to school, but
nursery pupils get nothing. There are young, perhaps single, mothers whose
kids have nursery places 12 or 14 miles away, and yet no one has thought
that they need transport.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is the kind of important issue that
we can affect if our procedures change to give people who are concerned
a real chance to make an input before the arrangements are finalised and
the legislation is put on to the statute book.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>(Lab): </strong>I
want to express my appreciation for what the forthcoming legislation will
do for the Highlands and Islands, in particular for Gaelic-medium education
and in the plans for land reform.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tha mi duilich. Chan eil moran G&agrave;idhlig
agam. That means, "I am sorry. I do not have much Gaelic"-when I was a
child, it was educated out of me. I went to a school where there were four
Gaelic-speaking teachers and most of the children came from Gaelic-speaking
homes, yet not a word of Gaelic was spoken in the classroom. I know of
schools where all the children came from Gaelic-speaking homes, and where
the teacher could not speak any Gaelic. Thus, a language was almost lost.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The educational establishment in those
days was indifferent, sometimes even hostile. It was thought that Gaelic
would hold children back; they thought that it would somehow prevent children
from reading and writing properly in English and that it would be an educational
disadvantage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thankfully, educationists abandoned that
position long ago, realising the positive value of learning, or being taught
from an early age in, a language other than English. Ability in two languages
engenders in children a linguistic confidence and one hopes that it will
make a difference in the way in which they approach learning French or
German in later years. Parents recognise that, and even non-Gaelic-speaking
parents recognise the value of Gaelic-medium education. A report to be
published in the autumn will confirm that that is the case and that Gaelic-medium
education has a positive educational advantage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The majority of children in Gaelic-medium
nursery education and playgroups come from non-Gaelic-speaking homes. It
is wonderful that parents whose families lost their Gaelic perhaps two
generations ago are beginning to learn it again with their children through
simple fun, games and drama. I know of three women who learned Gaelic again
that way. Two of them are now working in Gaelic-medium education; the other
is doing her PhD in Gaelic poetry at Edinburgh University. The culture
is being revived and strengthened.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course, Gaelic-medium education is not
confined to the Highlands and Islands; it takes place throughout Scotland.
Someone asked me to mention in particular the Gaelic-medium school in Glasgow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>I, too, am a member

who wants a bit of Highland hill to impress his friends?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have to examine the problem of shadowy
landowners. Where companies own land, we do not know which individuals
have real control over it. It is crucial to the furtherance of our proposals
that we formulate strategies to discover the real owners of Highland land.
Landlordism-whether practised by traditional landlords or by shadowy companies-has
almost destroyed the Highland environment. Landlords introduced sheep and
expanded deer forests. They have stifled enterprise by refusing to countenance
any development that might spoil the view. I want legislation that will
give power to communities who want such power and that will allow the Highlands

the SNP is open-minded and prepared to be persuaded on the matter. However,
what does the statement tell us? We all know that Scotland's natural heritage
is unique and that we must manage it. The First Minister went on to say
that there would be enabling legislation, but all that he told us was that
the first national park would be Loch Lomond and the Trossachs. I am not
a betting man-I leave that to my leader, who is a syndicated columnist
on that subject-but I would have thought that, on a wager, it was a nap
that the first national park would be Loch Lomond and the Trossachs. It
was hardly going to be Craigmillar or Castlemilk. However, that is all
that the First Minister told us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Before we make a proper judgment on the
national park, we want to know who will fund it and what the funding will
be. Who will control it and how will it be administered? To whom will the
people who control the parks be accountable and what democratic input will
individuals, councils and this Parliament have? The First Minister answered
none of those questions. All that we were told was that the national park

I picked up a copy of Mr Dewar's statement at 10 pm last night because
I was so worried about the heavyweight legislation that was going to be
in it and what I would have to comment on. It said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We will introduce a bill to address Scotland's
many and diverse transport challenges."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not think that anybody in the privileged

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We need local solutions to local problems,
within a coherent strategic framework."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are local problems but we have to
go beyond them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are many important points missing
from the First Minister's statement. At lunchtime, I and others, including
some Liberal Democrats, met a delegation from Skye and Kyle Against Tolls
who complained about the injustice of the imposition of the Skye bridge
tolls on Skye and Lochalsh and on Scotland as a whole. Despite a clear
and unequivocal promise by some members in this chamber, there is nothing
in the proposals about eradicating the iniquities of the Skye bridge tolls,
which are the highest in Europe. The Liberal Democrats should hang their
heads in shame.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the proposed legislation there is a
road-user charge and a parking tax. The SNP do not disagree with those
proposals-they are fine in principle-but perhaps there is too much stick
and not enough carrot. There is a lot about the taxation that may be levied
and nothing about how it will be used. We want answers to two questions.
Will the revenue from the taxation be ring-fenced for transport? If it
is ring-fenced, will it be for sustainable transport or, like cigarette
levies and excise duty, will it go into the Exchequer pot and not be used
to make the improvements in public transport that Scotland requires?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

tawdry and tatty and contained nothing more than we could expect from Strathclyde
region writ large. It was not a national document; it was a glorified regional
transport portfolio. Labour has failed to recognise that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We recognise that, in this Parliament,
there are expenditure limitations on any party in the Executive. However,
we are aware of the money that individuals in Scotland contribute through

industry has been treated over the past two years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

contained proposals for three bills that will affect Scotland's farming
industry. I accept that there is nothing in those proposals that is not
there for a good reason. However, my concern is that the three bills have
been put forward to the exclusion of anything that can really help our
farming industry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would have expected that the coalition
group that formed the Government would have had considerable expertise
in the farming industry, which could have been applied to solving the problems.
However, the priorities of Scottish Labour are the priorities of a predominantly
urban party, which has superimposed its values on the rural communities
of Scotland. I ask it to take the opportunity to look more closely at what
can be done for Scotland's farming industry. We have always said that a
strong farming industry underpins Scotland's rural economy. If we are not
very careful, we will soon have no farming industry to do that underpinning.
I ask that due consideration be given to that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we want to know what priorities we should
pursue, we need look no further than the partnership document drawn up
by the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats, from which I draw my evidence
that this Administration understands the problems better than it is prepared
to admit. The document says that the Government will promote the Scottish
food industry and that it is prepared to introduce an independent appeals
mechanism for farmers who face penalties relating to their European Union
subsidy claims. Those are among the priorities that I hear about every
day.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Rural Affairs (Ross
Finnie): </strong>Mr Johnstone said that the partnership document made no reference
to how we could deal with the farming industry and he questioned why there
was no legislation. Does he accept that it was perhaps more helpful that
the Government was this morning launching the food chain strategy, which
is aimed at taking the cost out of the food chain for the benefit of the
primary producer? That is what the Government was doing this morning.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alex Johnstone: </strong>I accept every Government
action that will benefit Scotland's farming industry. My problem with the
legislative programme that was set out this morning is that it largely
deals with problems that are not perceived as being top priorities in much

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alex Johnstone: </strong>I am not here to
defend the actions of the previous UK Government, but I must remind Mr
Raffan that in the two years since the election in 1997 the economic position
of the farming industry in Scotland has been radically altered. There is
a sound argument that the problems of the beef industry have their roots
in the problems of BSE, but nothing in the problems associated with BSE
can account for the problems that now cause our dairy farmers-of whom I
am one-to be in a desperate financial position. Nothing in the problems
associated with BSE has caused the collapse in grain prices; nothing in
them has resulted in the collapse of the sheep industry; nothing in them
has caused the unprecedented across-the-board collapse in Scottish agriculture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, nothing associated with BSE has
seriously undermined the pig industry in Scotland. The problems in the
pig industry have been caused entirely because the British Government has
introduced welfare regulations faster than other European Governments have.
That puts pig farmers in an unfair position in competing with their European
counterparts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD):
</strong>It is hard to accept some of the statements that Mr Johnstone has just
made about BSE and its impact on the industry. As he is probably well aware,
the dairy industry is afflicted by the problem of the over-30-months scheme.
That scheme is a direct result of total mismanagement of the BSE crisis
by the Conservative Government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Johnstone is also aware that the calf-processing
scheme is a direct result of BSE; it was introduced to counteract the effects
of BSE. Again, that was down to Mr Johnstone's party when it was in power.
The pig industry is suffering from extra costs as a result of the ban on
the use of meat and bonemeal material in pig rations. I suggest that Mr
Johnstone does some homework on his party's track record before claiming
that the problems have nothing to do with the Conservatives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Duncan McNeil (Greenock and Inverclyde)
(Lab): </strong>I was anxious to speak today for a selfish reason. I do not
know whether this is appropriate, but I would like to announce that, yesterday
afternoon in Harrow, my daughter gave birth to my first granddaughter.
She weighed in at 6lb 14oz-members can tell that she does not take after
my side of the family. I felt that in this family-friendly Parliament,
I could not miss the opportunity to make that announcement. [<i>Applause</i>.]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That applause has just spurred me on, so
I will continue with an apology. I have never participated in or witnessed
a public school debate and I have never been to Australia. However, I have
been forced to debate my arguments and present my case in shipyards on
the Clyde, in the bottling halls of Dumbarton and in the mills of Falkirk
and Grangemouth. There were no formal rules, but if people made personal
attacks on others they were more likely to get a black eye than a debate.
That rarely happened, although sometimes people got a sore nose. The basic
rule was that if someone was talking nonsense, they were told that they
were talking nonsense. Much nonsense has been talked-or has been reported-during
the past few weeks. I think that we all feel relief today that we are now
reaching a sense of purpose about the business of the Parliament and are
getting down to it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister's statement set out
a programme that we can all support and that understands the power of education.
We should all rally behind it, as I hope we will. The programme will raise
expectations-rightly so, because the expectations of the people whom I
represent are extremely low.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that, as was said this morning,
the programme will support the regeneration of our economy. Some people
say that we need a bill before Parliament to discuss unemployment or to
tackle the problems of redundancies and jobs. However, we did not need
a bill or a debate to send a task force into Govan, which the workers were
discussing this morning. I hope that the task force will bear fruit for
the more than 200 people in my constituency who depend on the Kvaerner&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the First Minister's stated priority
of targeting heart disease and cancer. Greenock and Inverclyde have a high
incidence of disease and ill health, which needs to be fought relentlessly.
I also welcome the priority of building strong and stable communities that
are not overshadowed by the fear of crime. We do not need to have legislation
in place to attack drugs, but drugs are the big issue on the streets and
we must get a grip of the situation. We know that drug-related crime is
up and that drug-related deaths are on the increase.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Against that background, the need for action
cannot be questioned. A lot can be done through education, as Trish Godman
said, and by providing rehabilitation centres where there are none for
people who want to come off drugs. I say to Phil Gallie that where there
are no places in a rehabilitation centre, people come through your back
window. The issue needs to be addressed urgently. If we address it and
some of the other issues, I am confident that my constituents will support
the priorities of the Parliament and the programme.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">15:33</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>I begin by pointing out to Phil Gallie, in relation to his comments
to Margaret Ewing on unionist parties, that six parties are represented
in this chamber, three of which support independence as an end aim, albeit
that two of those parties have only one member in the chamber. I call that
constitutional progress.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Also, after Paul Martin's outrageous attack
on the people of Bearsden this morning, the Minister for Children and Education
may want to defend his constituents at the next Labour group meeting and
bridge the yawning chasm inside the Labour party group.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I thank the Executive for its courtesy
in allowing Opposition front benchers foresight of the statement and for
not announcing some of the measures before they were heard by the Scottish
Parliament, although the <i>Inverness Courier </i>appears to have foresight
of something on Gaelic that we have not been warned about. That is a precedent
that should be followed at all times in this chamber. A little less action
from those responsible for the hyperspin that comes from the publicly funded
Labour press office and a bit more representation in the chamber would
be a good thing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That said, the programme is, to say the
least, very light indeed. Some of the helium that filled the balloons of
the election campaign has clearly found its way into the legislative programme.&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is, however,
much in the programme that we welcome. This morning and this afternoon,
Labour spokespeople have said much about social justice and other such
measures. I would say to them, as was said all through the debate, that
it is all very well expounding in rhetorical flourishes the great aims
of the Labour movement as was, but there is nothing in this programme to
tackle jobs, poverty or housing. This morning Alex Neil made a similar
point: we have three pages of rhetoric in the First Minister's statement
followed by no action. On the Executive benches, there is a growing trend
to say a lot on one thing and then to act entirely differently.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The legislative programme contains nothing
on freedom of information, an issue from Labour's own programme, which
is mentioned in its manifesto and other statements. We are told by press
briefings that Mr Wallace will make an announcement on the issue, but why
is it not on the legislative programme? There is nothing on the status
of the Gaelic language, notwithstanding the report in the <i>Inverness
Courier</i>; nothing on a national waste strategy despite a Scottish Environment
Protection Agency green paper to that effect; nothing that develops the
white paper on social work; and nothing on a drug enforcement agency. From
my perspective most important of all, there is nothing on housing. After
Fiona Hyslop's contribution this morning, the Government must surely act
on a homelessness strategy and we must hear something about what it is
going to do to tackle homelessness.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I see that Mr McConnell has left for coffee,
but I will discuss the financial strategy. I welcome the idea of openness
and clarity in a financial strategy which is put before the Parliament.
I point out that my colleague Mr Swinney and I have been calling for such
a strategy since February 1998 and before. It took Labour 10 months in
the Scottish Office to respond to our request and, when we got a response,
there was a distinct lack of clarity and detail in its expenditure plans.
For example, the plans were broken down to the detail of a &pound;3.5 billion
expenditure line on health.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We want to pursue the issue of a financial
strategy. Before the bill comes to the chamber or, more accurately, before
the financial issues statement is discussed, I hope that the Government
will allow Opposition spokespeople foresight on what will be said so that
we can prepare adequately in advance and scrutinise the Government's programme.
I have written to the head of the civil service asking for such a briefing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that the financial strategy will
bring an end to the practice of announcing cash rises that disguise the
fact that we are experiencing real-terms cuts in public spending. Michael
Forsyth started the trend and the Labour party has taken it&nbsp;</font></td>

its first budgets. I hope that there will not be any more repeat announcements
of the same spending plans, trying to dress them up with new PR every day
to give the publicly funded Labour spin office something to do. I hope
that Labour will open up the accounts and expenditure plans of the entire
Scottish government community, which includes local government. I hope
that it will publish the cost of the statutory requirements placed on local
government rather than just the spending grants that they have been given.
That will reveal the mismatch and the gaping black hole in local government
finance for the coming four years which will lead, without fear of peradventure,
to rises in council tax as a direct result of Labour cuts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I see Cathy Craigie at the back. She has
heard me go on about Labour cuts throughout the election campaign and I
apologise for the fact that she is about to have to do so again.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should examine the context in which
we are discussing the Government's legislative programme, which is one
of serious stringency in public expenditure. I will run through one or
two examples from the Government's published figures. Labour is spending
&pound;121 million less on education in its first three years in power
than Michael Forsyth, that great beneficiary of public services, did in
the Tories' final three years. Labour is spending &pound;176 million less
on housing in its first three years in power than the Tories did in their
final three years. Labour, the guardians of the people's councils, spent
&pound;1.31 billion less on local authorities than the Tories in their
final three years. The list goes on and on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">More important, there is the issue of the
Barnett squeeze, which was raised in an SNP Saltire paper last summer and
taken up by the Fraser of Allander Institute during the election campaign.
Will the Government answer for the fact that spending in the area of the
Scottish block will increase two and a half times more slowly than the
equivalent spending in England? Why is it that health spending in Scotland
can take that hit? Is it because our health standards are becoming so much
better than those in England are? Of course not. If spending that amount
today is justified, why is spending that amount over the next period not
justified? During the next three years, we will have &pound;387 million
less spent on the health service in Scotland than if the increases were
in line with those in England. The Government's health spokesperson should
consider that point closely.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In that context, I would like to draw to
members' attention, as Mr Salmond did earlier, the Liberal Democrat approach
to the issue of tax-varying powers. Given the context that I have just
laid out, why is it that during the election campaign the Liberal Democrats
said that, if necessary, they&nbsp;</font></td>

public partnerships. During the election we proposed a Scottish public
service trust to fund public services by the issuing of, for example, low-priced
bonds on the open market, and holding services in trust for the nation.
The Minister for Children and Education scoffed at that in a press release
on the Sunday afterwards in a somewhat ill-informed comment. I was delighted
to read the document "Pathfinders to the Parliament", the business agenda
launched by Lord Macdonald of Tradeston three weeks ago. On the issue of
transport, page 68, paragraph 3 states that one</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Transport Bond".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We believe this innovative financial arrangement

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thanks very much for that endorsement of
Scottish public service trusts. Maybe some of the back benchers in the
Labour party who opposed PFI, such as Mr McAllion who made the statement
during the election that PFI was another Tory idea living on, would do
well to try to have open minds in government. If we can give the Executive
any ideas and help with its research on that matter, we would be delighted
to do so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In closing, I say to the Government that
a lot more substance and a lot more open minds would be useful in this

There are two routes into that process: not just through the Executive

of action. Members who sit on those committees should address that and
face up to the challenges of the committee structure.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will make brief points on two bills that
I think are particularly important: the transport bill and the land reform
bill. The transport bill needs to focus on a number of key issues, including
the difference in transport issues for those of us who live in rural areas,
as opposed to focusing on the congestion in Scotland's cities. We should
face and focus on the question of air pollution, which causes health problems,
and the related costs to society and to business, which Ms Goldie mentioned
this morning in the context of the Confederation of British Industry report.
We need to consider those issues in the context of the bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is widely accepted that there is a need
for a strategic transport rethink. Investment is needed to improve our
public transport and to encourage the transfer of freight from road to
rail. This morning I listened to the director-general of the CBI on the
radio. In a useful contribution that illustrated the organisation's thinking,
he argued that in a tight public expenditure round progress can be made
if, where there is road charging and where local authorities can consider
charging for workplace parking, revenue from those charges is used to improve
public transport and facilitate the movement of freight from rail to road.
I hope that those issues will be addressed when the bill is discussed in
committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Earlier, Mrs Ewing mentioned the importance
of this Parliament being able to discuss other matters. In the part of
the world that I represent and, I know, the whole of the Highlands and
Islands, petrol prices were a huge issue in the election campaign. I see
nothing wrong with the Transport and the Environment Committee or another
appropriate committee considering all measures that impinge on car use
in the Highlands and Islands. The committee should accept that the car
is a lifeline, just as shipping and air services are, rather than a luxury.
It should be able to consider not only the introduction of rate relief
for petrol stations or infrastructure improvements such as grants for petrol
tanks, but measures such as differential VAT rates. It should carry out
a proper investigation of those issues to see where matters can be improved
for the rural and island areas of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
