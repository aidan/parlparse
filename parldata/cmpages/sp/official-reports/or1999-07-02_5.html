<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George
Reid): </strong>The next item of business is a debate on motion S1M-82, in the
name of Henry McLeish, on the independent committee of inquiry on student
finance. I call Mr McLeish to speak briefly on, and move, the motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">12:09</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning (Henry McLeish): </strong>I intend, Mr Reid, to be reasonably brief.
The history of the issue of student finance is now fairly well documented.
There was a lively exchange of views on tuition fees during the general
election campaign. On 17 June, this Parliament decided that it wanted to
look seriously at all the contextual issues surrounding tuition fees, and
we agreed to set up a committee of inquiry: the motion was passed by this
Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Today, I hope-for two reasons-that the
terms of reference, the time scale and the membership will be accepted.
The first is that, in our deliberations, we always distinguish between
the institution that we are in and the party political differences that
might divide us on certain issues. Passing this motion today will reflect
55 days in the Parliament; it will also reflect that this institution is
big enough to say that there are political differences in the Parliament
and that we want all those differences to be the subject of an objective
examination by an expert committee that this chamber has agreed to set
up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second reason is that the people on
the committee have been picked very carefully. In setting up the inquiry,
I have met the two education spokespersons of the major opposition parties.
That is the first time that that has happened in post-war Britain. I have
also talked with Dennis, Tommy and Robin, to try to achieve consensus.
Those discussions have been constructive and we have absorbed some of the
points that others have made.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the minutes unfold, there will still
be outstanding differences, but I appeal to all members to try to establish
unity around the committee after those differences have been voiced. That
will not mean making concessions, which was my theme when I spoke before;
it will mean that 14 people who have the confidence of Scotland and, I
hope, the confidence of the Parliament, will be able to get on with a serious
piece of work over the next six months. It will illustrate that, after
55 meeting days and a wonderful opening day yesterday, we can progress
towards the new politics.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The committee is
broadly based and reflects diversity in geography and gender. Higher and
further education institutions are represented, and an independent element
is involved. The committee's task is to take written or oral evidence,
and to have a debate to which all organisations will have the opportunity
to submit their views. After that, it will rightly be for the whole Parliament
to review the committee's findings and to deliberate on what should be
done.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that all parties can unite around
this inquiry. No one who speaks during the next 20 minutes should think
that they are making a concession. It is vital that we put that fear aside
and get on with the matter that is before us. If we can do that, I hope
that we will have six months of debate. Politics is about the general election-that
is absolutely right. This Parliament has also had its chance. What is wrong
with letting the people loose on this important issue and asking those
with an interest in education in every college, university, union and workplace
to make their views known?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

before the end of 1999, and calls upon the Executive to lay a copy of the
Committee's report before the Parliament-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr John Swinney (North Tayside) (SNP):
</strong>I will begin with three constructive remarks. The First Minister should
not be surprised that I make constructive remarks; it happens quite frequently.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First, the minister spoke of consultation.
I appreciated the opportunity to discuss this issue with him. We have had
input, some-although not all-of which he has taken on board.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, what I shall say about the committee
of inquiry has nothing to do with the individuals that have been recommended
for appointment by the minister. If individuals are prepared to offer their
services to such an inquiry, they should be protected from being knocked
about in the chamber. I have no intention of doing that today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My third constructive remark-to complete
the hat trick-concerns the minister's closing remarks. I was not surprised
when he said that politics is about the general election. He is absolutely
right. We had a general election that made it quite clear that the majority
of this Parliament wanted the abolition of tuition fees. That inescapable
fact has been rehearsed in this debate already and it has been the subject
of an enormous amount of debate in this Parliament. By deciding to pass
the decision elsewhere, thinking that we are serving our election mandate,
this Parliament is losing sight of exactly what the people voted for at
the general election.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A student came to see me at my surgery
on Monday. She told me that in the first election ballot she had voted
for the SNP in North Tayside because she believed that the abolition of
tuition fees would be at the top of our priorities. She was confident that
I would come to the Parliament and vote for the abolition of tuition fees.
She voted for the Liberal Democrats in the second ballot, however, because
she wanted the Labour party to be held to ransom over tuition fees. That
is an example of the sort of discussions that I have had with my constituents,
and it provides real evidence on which this Parliament ought to reflect.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During question time, Alex Salmond asked
the First Minister how he felt the Parliament would meet the expectations
of the people of Scotland. The Parliament would have been expected to take
early steps to abolish tuition fees. The proposal before us today begins
to cast doubt on the practicality of abolishing tuition fees for the academic
year that will start next autumn. Practicality is an important word in
this debate and one that was used by Mr Rumbles in our debate on the subject
a couple of weeks ago.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Even with this inquiry, we may face practical
difficulties in achieving the abolition of fees. That is a difficult prospect
for students to face up to. An increasing number of students tell me that
there is&nbsp;</font></td>

gaining access to higher education because it is perceived that going to
university costs a lot of money. Until we do something dramatic-and substantial-to
change the situation, we will not deliver the expectations of the people
of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The minister has presented his recommendations
to Parliament today and we will have the opportunity to vote for them in
a few moments. Members of my party will register our principled commitment
to immediate action to abolish tuition fees, and we will cast our votes
accordingly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and
Fife) (Con): </strong>I do not propose to revisit the debate on tuition fees.
It would be too painful for Liberal Democrat members to be reminded of
the treachery that they visited upon the Scottish electorate when they
entered into their deal with Labour.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

smiling.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>People who know me,
Donald, know that I smile a great deal.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scottish Tories have made it clear
that we oppose the creation of the committee of inquiry because we believe
that free higher education is non-negotiable. To link tuition fees to the
important question of student hardship is to give up on that principle,
to betray it and to put it on the negotiating table. We think it important
that there should be a committee of inquiry into student hardship, but
that is not what is on offer here.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome, however, the consultation that
was provided. That is an important step forward. Although we had some useful
input, we are disappointed that there were some matters about which we
were unable to convince the minister to change his mind. It is not our
committee, nor is it Henry McLeish's committee; it is Jim Wallace's committee
and we shall see how the Liberal Democrats respond to its findings.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The committee, who sits on it and who chairs
it, are not particularly important issues for us in the chamber today;
it is not our committee. We had something to say about the committee's
remit and construction and, although Mr McLeish took into account some
of what we said about our concerns for Scotland-domiciled students, we
were disappointed that there is only one student on the committee, not
two. In limiting representation on the committee to one student, it was

the establishment of the committee, purely because we want to make it clear
that, as a matter of consistency, we believe that there is no need for
that committee to discuss tuition fees. It is a matter of principle. Were

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">clear, as I said
to the minister, that I do not see the need for an inquiry. The majority
of the members of this chamber were elected on commitments to abolish tuition
fees. Now that we have our powers, we should go ahead and legislate to
abolish tuition fees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was interesting to hear Wendy Alexander
say, in the previous debate, that the Executive is unwilling to outsource
the important matter of local government finance to an independent committee
of inquiry, as it is apparently willing to outsource the equally important
matter of higher education finance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tommy Sheridan and I have lodged an amendment
to the motion that would add Kenny Hannah's name to the committee's membership.
I understand that the amendment has not been selected for debate, which
is unfortunate. We are not alone in wanting more students to be members
of the committee of inquiry. Kenny is president of the students' association
at Glasgow Caledonian University, and an executive member of the National
Union of Students. He also organised and led yesterday's successful student
march from Glasgow to Edinburgh to lobby the Scottish Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are different strands of opinion
in the NUS on tuition fees. Some, like Kenny Hannah, are absolutely opposed
to them. Others seem to take a more ambivalent stand, possibly because
of new Labour influence and careerism in student politics. For example,
during the election campaign in Falkirk West, some Labour students from
the University of Strathclyde were bussed into the constituency to campaign
for the only candidate who was committed to keeping tuition fees. That
must have been a first in the history of Scottish education-students being
bussed from one end of Scotland to the other to campaign for tuition fees.
The election result speaks for itself, but I do not want to rub it in.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not know David Welsh. It may be that
he is absolutely opposed to tuition fees, but will Henry McLeish tell us
whether David Welsh was nominated by the NUS, or simply hand-picked by
the minister? As I said, there are different strands of opinion among students.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Henry McLeish also said that he would like
the matter of tuition fees to be taken out of the hands of the politicians
and put into the hands of an independent committee of inquiry. That sounds
almost like passing the buck. The committee of inquiry will report back,
not only to the Executive, but to this Parliament, and it is this Parliament
that will take the ultimate decision about the matter, and legislate on
it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the people of Scotland and build a better future for them. Investment in
higher education is an investment in that future. By eventually legislating

families, we can help to build a better future, especially for the young
people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">12:25</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>I fear that after
55 days we should not be too optimistic-the new politics has some way to
go. Nothing that has been said this morning nullifies the need for an independent
examination of the major issues that are at stake. I say to Brian Monteith
that of course student hardship will be examined. It is important that
it is examined in relation to widening access and to tuition fees and their
impact on the number of school pupils applying to university. That is already
in the committee's terms of reference.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I say to Dennis that everyone signs up
to the new politics and then says that they want the people to get loose
vis-&agrave;-vis representatives on an inquiry. Well, hang on a minute.
Politicians can use the general election, parliamentarians can use the
Parliament, so what has anyone got to fear from 14 people-who might be
representative of real substantive issues-looking at the matter and giving
the Parliament and the Executive the wisdom of that inquiry?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):
</strong>Will Mr McLeish give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>No, I am not giving
way Alex.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It comes back to the main stream of politics,
because politics is about policies and resources, which it is clear the
inquiry will address. I believe that the Executive has attempted to be
constructive-the comments have reflected that and I welcome them. On the
other hand, we as parliamentarians should never be afraid of putting big
issues out for consideration and coming back to the Parliament and the
Executive to take the final decisions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My final point relates to the time scale.
Other members have made the point about next year's university applications.
I have tried to balance that important issue with the need for a comprehensive
inquiry. Six months may seem too short in some people's eyes, but it achieves
a balance between having a comprehensive committee of inquiry and providing
an important opportunity to acknowledge the politics of the matter.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
