<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>The first
item of business this morning is a debate on motion S1M-67, in the name
of Mr Alex Salmond, on the privatisation of public services. This debate
will conclude at around 12.20 pm.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_8"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael
Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>On a point of order, Mr Presiding
Officer. I have raised the matter of the procedure for Opposition day debates
with you before. There has been discussion about whether we should follow
the Westminster precedent of the Executive winding up and having the last
word in each debate, or whether we should apply a different rule, similar
to that applied in local authorities and elsewhere in such circumstances.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I understand that you have ruled today
that the Executive should close the debate, but I ask you to consider how
we could examine the matter at greater length and come to a conclusion.
Will you assure us that today's decision is not a precedent for Opposition
day debates-of which this is the first-but merely a convenience at this
stage?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>This is the
first Opposition day debate that we have had, so we are feeling our way,
as in so many other matters. In this case, I have decided that the Executive
should have the last word, as is the practice at Westminster, but I have
taken into account our brief discussion in the Parliamentary Bureau. I
believe that the matter ought to be considered sympathetically by the Procedures
Committee when it comes into being. Today's decision should not be taken
as a precedent.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">09:33</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nicola Sturgeon (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>This
morning's debate is extremely significant, although I see that most of
my Labour colleagues and all of my Liberal Democrat colleagues take a somewhat
different view. The debate is significant because the subject matter is
so important, but also because this is the first opportunity for the Parliament
to discuss Opposition business.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

National party is a constructive Opposition. We will criticise and oppose
vigorously, where appropriate, but we will do more than that. As a party
that aspires to government, we will also propose real alternatives, as
we are doing today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have chosen the topic for this morning's
debate for very good reasons. The privatisation of public services through
the private finance initiative was one of the election campaign's central

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Parliament oppose
PFI, or at the very least have grave reservations about it. The SNP stood
on a platform of opposition, as did the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish
Socialist party, the Greens and Dennis Canavan. In the "Newsnight" poll,
conducted before the election, 24 Labour candidates said that they were
in favour of reducing the reliance on PFI. Admittedly, as we do not know
the identity of those 24, we do not know how many of them are now MSPs,
but we know that Labour is far from united on the issue. John McAllion
once said that Tory ideas live on under the initials PFI. He was right,
and he reiterated his opposition to PFI during the election campaign. It
was, and is, only the Tories who, to a person, are enthusiastic supporters
of the scheme.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Despite the opposition, which is shared
by the vast majority of people in Scotland who want education and health
to be retained in public hands, Labour is determined to press on. Labour
is aided and abetted in that determination, I am sad to say, by members
on the Liberal Democrat front bench, one of whom has now decided to join
us in the chamber.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was somewhat surprised to read in the
partnership agreement about the commitment to &pound;600 million of investment
in school infrastructure. I was surprised because I had not heard any Liberal
Democrat member boasting about that seemingly remarkable achievement. At
that point, alarm bells began to ring and I asked a parliamentary question,
the answer to which confirmed my suspicions. Of that &pound;600 million,
&pound;400 million is money to support the PFI-yet another breathtaking
U-turn by the Liberal Democrats. In April this year, a spokesman for the
Liberal Democrats said that if they were in a position of power at Holyrood,
they would press for the abolition of PFI. Here they are, in that position
of power, and in just a couple of weeks they have gone from a manifesto
promise to replace the expensive and inefficient PFI agreements to Jim
Wallace's go-ahead for the privatisation of 100 schools.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SNP's opposition to PFI remains, because
it is expensive to the taxpayer. Currently, the Treasury can borrow money
by issuing gilts at a rate of around 4.5 per cent, but the interest rate
on PFI contracts is around 9.5 per cent. Common sense tells us that that
is inevitable with PFI, because if private investors cannot get an attractive
enough return on their investment, they will not invest. The Government
tries to use the cover of commercial confidentiality to shroud the PFI
deals in secrecy, but the public should know what PFI is costing them.
That is why our motion calls for publication of the details and the rates
of return. Jack McConnell is smiling, but if the Government is confident
that PFI represents value for money, surely as Minister for Finance he
will&nbsp;</font></td>

about full public disclosure.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">PFI is also grossly inefficient. The negotiations
take an age; in the world of private finance, time is money and profits
always come before the public interest. On "Channel 4 News" on Monday night,
the chief executive of Jarvis said that his company's first loyalty is
to its shareholders and that any enterprise only exists because it makes
money. That may be so, but it is also the reason why companies such as
Jarvis should not be allowed to own schools and hospitals. The first loyalty
of the people who own schools should be to the children and the first loyalty
of those who own hospitals should be to the patients.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The overriding reason for the SNP's opposition
to PFI is that it represents, as Mr McConnell's successor, Alex Rowley,
said in 1996, the privatisation of public services: privatisation of the
education system, the national health service and transport services. The
assets that are created by PFI will never return to public ownership. PFI
contracts are frequently referred to as mortgages, but in the real world,
when someone pays off their mortgage, they own their house. That is not
so in the case of private finance. Under PFI, the investor gets his money
back, makes a profit and keeps the goods.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_11"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister
for Finance (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>Will Ms Sturgeon name one PFI project
in which that option is not available to the public sector?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

including Margo MacDonald, will return to the issue of the Edinburgh royal
infirmary later on, but I believe that it is one. [M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>:
"Answer the question."] I have taken Mr McConnell's point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Government's answer to the privatisation
charge is that while it may be selling the asset, it is not privatising
the service. That is absolute nonsense.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

PFI. Perhaps she could explain why Perth and Kinross Council, when it was

why Angus Council, which is still under SNP control, has also gone ahead
with a local PFI project. The SNP cannot have its cake and eat it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Council always delivered a process under which its citizens got value for
money. [M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>: "This is a speech."] This is an answer
to a question and an interjection at the same time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>It is an
intervention in Nicola Sturgeon's speech and must be short.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> Three years ago
in Perth and Kinross-there is a question here for Nicola-capital spend
was &pound;25 million; this year it is only &pound;12 million. In effect,
the hand was up the back of the SNP-controlled council at that time. I
had no option but to proceed with a completely failed regime. Is Nicola
happy with the unholy alliance of the Labour, Tory and Liberal Democrat
parties that now controls Perth and Kinross Council?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>It was only right
to allow the former leader of Perth and Kinross Council to intervene. We
will be seeing a lot more in the future of the alliance to which he referred.
Like other councils, Perth and Kinross Council has to play the only game
in town. We do not accept the policies, so our attacks should be aimed
at the policy makers rather than the deliverers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I now return to privatisation and, no doubt,
the denials that will come from Labour members. Let us put aside the question
of how long it will be before the jobs of teachers as well as those of
janitors are outsourced; before we ask the private sector to provide mainstream
education services; and before we go down the road of education action
zones, which exist in England, or of charter schools, which exist in the
United States. The fact remains that school buildings and ancillary workers
cannot be separated from the delivery of the whole education service. According
to Unison,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"the operation of buildings and facilities
for local services are an intrinsic part of service delivery."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is privatisation. With privatisation
comes the deterioration of services, jobs and workers' conditions. I cannot
be the only person who felt a shiver down their spine on Monday night when
listening to the chief executive of Jarvis on Channel 4. He was asked whether
he hoped to be running a couple of hundred schools in two or three years'
time. He answered yes. The interviewer then suggested that that would make
Jarvis a very powerful player in Britain's education system. The chief
executive answered that he hoped so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope not, because that chief executive's
first loyalty-remember-is to his shareholders. In other words, he does
not consider himself accountable to the public.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> No, I have taken
several interventions already.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This Parliament can and will hold Sam Galbraith
and Susan Deacon responsible and accountable for the state of our education
and health services. We might not always be satisfied with their answers,
but at least we can ask them questions. That is not so with companies such
as Jarvis, as their only loyalty is to shareholders.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is very easy, as I think I have ably
demonstrated, to demolish the case for the private finance initiative.
The challenge is to come up with an alternative; the SNP has risen to that
challenge. The SNP's alternative is one that the Liberal Democrats gave
support to in the election campaign. We proposed the introduction of Scottish
public service trusts that would be non-profit-making and would be charged
to act in the public interest. Such trusts would not have to satisfy shareholders,
and could issue bonds at keener borrowing rates than those that are available
to the private sector-the trusts would supply services at a cheaper cost.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our proposals have been described by the
leading financier, Bill McCall, as "financially doable" and have received
support from people such as Dennis Canavan, the Liberal Democrats-although
I understand that they have changed their minds-and Bob Thomson of Unison.
Our proposals are extremely worthy of consideration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>Will the member give
way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> No, I am winding
up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that in the interests of the new
politics, Mr McConnell will agree to consider these proposals. He will
find that they are infinitely more sensible and acceptable than his own.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In conclusion, I call on this Parliament
to take an honest decision. No doubt the Labour and Liberal Democrat ministers
will line up behind the Tories to support the private finance initiative,
but I tell members on the Liberal Democrat back benches to honour their
manifesto commitment-to do so for the first time. I tell members on the
Labour back benches who know that PFI is wrong to prove a certain-absent-minister
wrong and prove that, when it is right to do so, they and this Parliament
are not afraid to depart from the London line.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

for Finance (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>I start by thanking Nicola, who showed
the modesty of Frank McAveety in describing her speech, for the opportunity
to reaffirm our plans for modernising public services. I was disappointed
to hear that Mr Russell believes that we should adopt the procedures of
local government rather than a national Parliament. We will have to agree
to disagree on that point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Public services are central to our purpose
in this Parliament and to our values. We have no interest in doing harm
to public services. Our partnership is founded on strengthening and expanding
vital services that impact on the lives of ordinary Scots every day: new
hospital developments; new and refurbished schools; standards in education;
integrated public transport; and the construction of new and renovation
of existing houses. Those are all public services that have been improved
by this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is not about privatisation. We are
creating and supporting partnerships between the public and private sectors
to achieve high-quality investment in public services. We are committed
to delivering, and are delivering, new skills for Scottish children and
hospitals for those who need medical care. We say, openly and clearly,
that where services will be better, where costs will be low, and where
staff will be protected, we will create public-private partnerships.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>If Brian Adam will
bear with me, he will hear something about flexibility. In every case,
we decide the length and nature of contracts, so we decide the degree of
flexibility. We do so for the public good in every case, and are proud
of that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nicola has demonstrated today why the nationalists
lost the election. This debate will demonstrate either that they do not
understand public finances or that they are using vital public services
as a political football. Their plans for a public service trust would not
work. Not only would they prevent any new hospitals or schools being built
under the PFI, but they would threaten those projects that we have already
launched and throw the PFI programme into chaos and confusion. Work on
the eight new hospitals that are being built-the largest hospital building
programme that Scotland has ever seen-would grind to a halt. The PFI project
to build new schools and modernise older ones would stop as well.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SNP claims that it could borrow at
very competitive rates that are significantly below those that are available
for PFI schemes. However, the only way to reduce the rates is by the Government
guaranteeing the loans and, if that happened, the sum would be counted
as public sector debt and the programme would be cut.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>I suggest to Mr McConnell that he read "Pathfinders to the Parliament",
the Government's consultation document that sets out a business agenda
for the Parliament and has a foreword by Lord MacDonald of Tradeston. The
document endorses the idea of a public service trust in the form of a transport
bond. It says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We believe this innovative financial arrangement
should not count as part of PSBR."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

supplies the answer to my question, but what I said is the reality of the
situation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

my civil service brief; I can answer with an example from my constituency.

hospital rather than the new Law hospital-will be funded by bonds. Bonds
are in use in several of our public-private partnerships.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

be worth in excess of &pound;500 million. That is in addition to the substantial
capital investment from public funds that we plan. All those new public
health service initiatives are threatened by the SNP's proposals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Mr Crawford and the Perth and Kinross Council, of which he was a member,
for the council's use of public-private partnerships in delivering new
council offices. I am sure that the nationalist administration adopted
a value for money approach when it chose to use PFI.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we have spent too
long debating the need for infrastructure; it is time to deliver. A total
of &pound;500 million is being procured for sewerage schemes and progress
is well under way. However, the process of cleaning up our beaches and
our sewerge systems is threatened by the proposals of the SNP. Far from
supporting public services, the SNP is playing fast and loose with Scottish
services.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive will support only public-private
partnerships that improve public services and represent not the lowest
value, but best value. We are committed to ensuring democratic control
over those projects and services. I urge nationalist MSPs to drop the rhetoric
of the election campaign and join in the effort to modernise Scotland.
If they choose not to, they will have to answer for their actions in Edinburgh,
East Kilbride, Falkirk, Glasgow, Aberdeen-and in Wishaw, too.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have said that we will review and improve
PFI and today I will set out new policies in the areas of staff, surplus
land, information and the ownership of assets. Those are areas in which
we can make public-private partnerships work better to achieve our objective
of best value.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue of surplus land often arises
in these projects, as in other capital investments, because old facilities
are being replaced. The disposal of surplus land can raise valuable receipts
to help offset the cost of new buildings but care needs to be taken to
protect the public interest. In response to public concerns that we make
clear our approval, I will ensure that, in future Government public-private
partnerships, the assumption will be that surplus land will not be included
in the contracts unless it can be determined that it represents best value
to do so. That has always been the Government's assumption and I will expect
the rest of the public sector in Scotland to follow that approach.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive is committed to fairness
and equality of treatment for workers. It is important that staff get fair
treatment in public-private partnership projects. I commend the Scottish
Trades Union Congress and Unison for their efforts to ensure that that
happens in negotiations with us and with private companies. As the Minister
for Finance, I intend to keep under review the opportunities to improve
security and conditions for staff who deliver our vital public services.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I can outline a step which will benefit
some public sector staff. The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
Regulations-the so-called TUPE regulations-protect many public sector conditions
that employees have when they transfer to the private sector. However,
the regulations do not extend to pensions. The public sector negotiates
with the private sector to ensure that staff have broadly comparable pension
arrangements. Last week, we announced a further step to extend that protection
to transfers made under subsequent contracting rounds and, in cases of
subcontracting, where that is an integral part of the primary contract.
That change will apply to Government departments and their agencies where
the Government is the employer and to contracting agencies. I expect it
to be followed by the rest of the public sector in Scotland, including
local authorities, and I will write this week to all those responsible
to advise them of the change.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Has he renegotiated the contract with Haden Young, or will the Health Service
Executive pick up the bill for that group of workers who will lose their
pension rights?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_17"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell:
</strong>As Ms MacDonald will be aware, we are negotiating on the matter. We
have reached a good agreement at the Hairmyres hospital and I believe that
we have almost reached an agreement at the new Law or Wishaw general hospital.
It would be wrong of me to comment on who might pick up the bill following
those negotiations as we hope to secure the best possible deal for the
public sector.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The partnership agreement made clear that,
where appropriate, we would review the operation of public-private partnerships
to ensure that assets would revert to public ownership. I am pleased to
announce a new approach for buildings for which there is no practical alternative
use at the end of contract period, including most schools and hospitals.
There will be an option in contracts for those assets to revert to public
sector ownership at no cost to the public sector. Other options will remain,
and that situation represents maximum flexibility for the public sector
and ensures important safeguards. The policy will be implemented immediately
in Government public-private partnerships and I expect it to be followed
by the rest of the public sector as soon as possible.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>As Mr Wilson should
know because of his expertise in the area, the whole basis of the public-private
partnerships and PFI is the transfer of risk. In some cases, the transfer
of risk takes place where assets have conditions tied to them about their
reverting to public sector ownership. In all the different cases across
Scotland, in every contract, we have chosen the best possible option in
the public interest, which, in the future, will mean that, in some cases,
the risk will transfer at nil cost. At the moment, the risk is transferred
at different values, or there is an option for that to happen. That option
is important because, in some cases, public buildings will not be wanted
at the end of the contract and it would be preferable to leave the risk
and liability with the private sector.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am sorry that I have taken so long, Sir
David, but I wanted to take interventions. I am determined that as much
information as possible is made available, provided that is not commercially
confidential. Last year, the Treasury task force produced a policy statement
on the involvement of staff and the trade unions in public-private partnerships.
Both the Trades Union Council and the Confederation of British Industry
welcomed the approach, which we will continue to take in Scotland. However,
I will take the policy of openness further and, in future, will make available
the annual expenditure commitments associated with public-private partnership
projects, sector by sector. In the health sector, full business cases are
already published. My colleague Mr Galbraith initiated that during his

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will get down to the nitty-gritty. We
oppose the SNP motion and commend the Scottish Executive for broadly continuing
the initiative that was launched by the Conservative party in 1992. The
private finance initiative allows not only more taxpayers' money to be
spent on delivering services, such as teaching and health care, but the
use of private sources to fund the buildings in which those services are
delivered. As has been said, it is somewhat ironic that the SNP opposes
the initiative yet took full advantage of it to deliver projects in Perth
and Angus.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">These days, there are very few businesses
or organisations that own and operate the buildings in which they work.
It is a matter of good, prudent financial management to lease buildings
and to leave the burden of maintenance and management to a specialist landlord.
In most of those arrangements, the buildings remain in the ownership of
the landlord at the end of the lease.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is much better for the Government to
focus on what it does best and on what it was elected to do-promoting good
health, treating illness and teaching our children-rather than on investing
a huge amount of scarce capital resources in buildings.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I suggest that the mover of the motion-regrettably,
she is not here-asks her constituents whether they want new hospitals now,
in five or 10 years' time or perhaps never. I know what the answer to that
will be. At the moment, only PFI can deliver and satisfy the people's aspirations.
It extends the amount of expenditure, because the underlying principle
of public-private partnerships is to provide additional public expenditure
rather than to replace existing public expenditure.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Today is memorable for me for three reasons.
First, I have agreed with Jack McConnell for the first time in my life.
Secondly, I have got my maiden speech out of the way-an absolute delight.
Thirdly, my daughter is in labour-do not get excited, Jack, she is still

the whole scandal of the privatisation of our hospitals and schools; this
was the document in which Michael Forsyth introduced the private finance
initiative to Scotland. In one telling line, Forsyth says it all: he says
that the private sector will have the "scope for higher profits". Talk
about being the master of understatement. At one stroke, Michael Forsyth
sacrificed public need on the altar of private greed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That was at the fag-end of the Tory Government.
The SNP was not alone in opposing the theft of public assets-only the Tories

cost that is of most concern is in the division between clinical and non-clinical

ludicrous position that Mr Salmond and Mr Swinney got themselves into over
their notion of a public services trust. Have I got the term right? It
kept being changed during the election campaign as the SNP changed tack.
Mr Swinney heralded the notion as</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"a mechanism that would be able to provide
finances at very competitive rates, significantly below those at present
available for PFI schemes."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unfortunately for Mr Swinney, the Bank

the sub-committee established by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to consider
PFI-the so-called Bates committee-is likely to come out in favour of something
akin to the SNP's proposals?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>It would be interesting
to find out what the SNP is proposing, as it seems to be reluctant, in
various ways and in various forums, to indicate clearly what its proposal
is. For years, the SNP has adopted a process of thinking of a slogan and
then trying to construct a policy behind it, and that is what it has done
in this instance. The press in Scotland has given the SNP great leeway
over the years by refusing to take it seriously as a political party and
to subject its proposals to proper scrutiny. In the process, the press
has done the SNP and us a disservice. Now that we are all here in this

in such a process of scrutiny.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am delighted that, over the past two
years, Treasury ministers have refined and developed rules so that many
schemes now use the European Investment Bank as part of the investment
package, which significantly increases the financial attractiveness of
the process. I am also delighted that the Labour Government's good economic
management has led to the lowest interest rates in more than 20 years,
which also makes those schemes more attractive than they would have been
three or four years ago.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Will Mr McNulty give
way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>If Andrew will let
me make one more point, I will let him come in. I am very grateful to Jack
McConnell, because his announcements-about surplus land, about the protection
of employees, particularly on pensions, about the reversion of assets to
public sector use and about the openness that will assist the scrutiny
to which I have referred-represent major steps forward. There have been
legitimate criticisms of these schemes in the past, but those criticisms
have now been addressed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>Does
Mr McNulty agree that the reviews announced today on issues such as surplus
land have been introduced only because of the SNP's sustained pressure
on and criticism of Labour's PFI policy? The scandal of Edinburgh's land
rip-off is a prime example of that policy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>I said at the start
of my speech that the SNP has to engage in grown-up, serious politics.
I do not feel that the party has done so up to now. It has not engaged
in the debate about real options and alternatives. When the SNP wants to
talk seriously about what can and what needs to be done, it will be taken
seriously.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms MacDonald: </strong>I just want Mr McNulty
to take me seriously. He will forgive me for using high-falutin' rhetoric
when I say that the Government could afford the schemes if it were willing
to scrap nuclear weapons. However, that is by the bye. Let us return to
the issue of the Edinburgh royal infirmary. Can Mr McNulty explain what
plans are in hand for the so-called surplus land at Lauriston,&nbsp;</font></td>

million has been cut from capital expenditure in local authorities since
the Labour Government took office in 1997?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to nail the lie about why SNP councils
have been forced down the PFI route. In 1995-96, Government support for
local government in Scotland was &pound;734 million at constant 1997-98
prices. That support has fallen in the current financial year to &pound;328
million, which represents a cumulative cut of &pound;1,470 million in Government
capital support for Scottish local government in just four years. That
is why Perth and Kinross Council, Angus Council and Moray Council went
down the PFI road: they had absolutely no other option.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the option to purchase does not exist at the end of the contract? There
are some projects like that and I know which they are, but can he name
any?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Gibson: </strong>The Skye toll bridge.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the option to buy. Mr McConnell talks about the option of being able to
buy, but he is asking the public sector to buy at the very end of the contract
after it has paid through the nose throughout the contract period.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The truth is that, to guarantee lower taxes
today, PFI means higher taxes tomorrow-when the bill that Peter Williams
talked about finally presents itself. PFI is more about bolstering new
Labour's political virility with its key financial backers in the City
than about sound economic management. The truth is that the only people
who will win from PFI are the financial consultants, contract lawyers and
merchant bankers who have their snouts in the fiscal trough.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Speaking to the companies that bid for
PFI projects and build the infrastructure, I found, most surprisingly,
that they, like local government, are involved in such projects solely
because PFI is the only game in town. One senior engineer with a well-known
plc recently told me that he regarded PFI as a banker's scam and that his
company was more interested in building hospitals than in running them.

bank for an annual fee. The Tory Government and Labour front bench condemned
the scheme as loony left, but it seems to me that, far from being loonies,

an ever-increasing tax burden for the next generation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Someone somewhere in the Labour party has
to say that there must be a better way than PFI or public-private partnerships-I
hope that a member in this chamber will be the first. Many Labour MSPs
in this chamber have stood against PFI in the past. MSPs from trade union
and public sector backgrounds have stood up against schemes that have threatened
the wages and conditions of their colleagues and members; I know that those
MSPs will take this opportunity to break free of the control-freak tendency
in their party and stand up for what they believe in. This is an issue
in which belief matters and dividing lines can and should be drawn.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In <i>The Observer</i> in April, Bob Thompson,
the treasurer of the Labour party in Scotland, said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

serfs. So much for partnership and team working".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In <i>The Scotsman</i> in June, Alex Rowley-remember

is more at stake than financial procedures. What is at stake is not only
the ethos that runs through the entire public sector, but the morale, pay
and conditions of thousands of public sector workers across Scotland. What
is at stake is the very essence of why the majority of members in this
Parliament resisted wave after wave of Tory privatisation plans. It would
be one of the cruellest ironies if one of the first acts of the new Parliament

High School in my regional constituency of Mid Scotland and Fife. He said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"If we were to wait for the local authority
to replace our overcrowded, worn-out school from its own financial resources,
we could still be waiting in 2020. If we want our kids educated in the
kind of modern, enriched teaching environment that implicitly tells them
day-in, day-out: first and foremost this country values education, education,

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>I will in a second, because
Mr Gibson gave way to me. However, I will make this point first. The SNP
must learn that the duty of the Opposition is not just to oppose, but to
propose. Today, SNP members have not gone into detail about their Scottish
public service trusts in any of their speeches, least of all in Ms Sturgeon's
deplorable effort when opening the debate. She barely gave that proposal
a sentence at the end of her speech. We all know why, because the policy
is so deeply flawed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Gibson: </strong>Does not Mr Raffan accept
that this is a structured debate, in which the SNP will put forward its
alternative proposals? Does he not accept that the reason why local authorities
are being forced down this road is that they have lost &pound;1,470 million
of capital investment from central Government during the past four years?

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I accept that not all PFI projects produce
good value. The Skye bridge is the most notorious example. However, the
good thing about this Parliament and the committee system that we have
set up is that the Finance Committee, of which I am a member, can examine
PFI policy and the Audit Committee can examine particular projects. I support
the motion in the name of my colleague John Farquhar Munro, the member
for Ross, Skye and Inverness West, which calls for an investigation into
the Skye bridge contract and the toll order. The more the Audit Committee
examines particular projects and the more the Finance Committee examines

if Mr Galbraith stopped sniping from the sidelines.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Can Mr Raffan pick up on the point in our
motion that seeks to improve existing PFI projects by opening them up and
making them more transparent, allowing the Finance Committee to examine
them? Does he agree with me and with Geoffrey Robinson that there should
be absolute transparency in all projects, not only in the sectors mentioned
by Mr McConnell?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>I am all for transparency
and I am all for openness. From what I have heard-and I listened closely
to the minister-he supports that as well. Transparency I want; it is the
SNP's diatribe and rhetoric that I am not having anything to do with. This
is a complex and important issue, and the SNP has yet to explain its policy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The crucial point is that partnerships
between the private and public sectors produce capital projects earlier
and more efficiently than otherwise would be the case. That is why I mentioned
the case of Balfron High School. Either the SNP has to explain and develop
its policy convincingly so that its inherent flaws are removed, or it has
to accept the alternative to borrowing, which is tax. We know that the
SNP is the tax party-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>Will Mr Raffan give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan:</strong> No, I am not going to
give way any more because I am near the end. I have given way a lot-well,
all right, I did not realise that it was the fundamentalist; I will give
way to the fundamentalist. He is the SNP's internal opposition.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>Much appreciated.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Raffan quoted Alf Young saying that
a school required PFI. Is it not the case that if we had adopted Liberal
Democrat policy, putting 1p on income tax and earmarking it for education,
PFI in education might not have been necessary at all?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>Mr Neil would make that
point, wouldn't he? Kay Ullrich is sitting next to him; she has quoted
Mandy Rice-Davies once already-who am I to quote her a second time? But
he would say that, wouldn't he?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We made it quite clear that, having looked
at the books, we would raise taxes if we thought it necessary. That is
the whole point. Our policy position on tax was quite distinct from the
SNP's, and our position was clear over a long period, not announced overnight
like the SNP's. Last week, we saw the fundamental contradictions at the
base of SNP economic policy-a contradiction on interest rates that SNP
members have yet to explain, a contradiction on spending, a&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">SNP members cannot get away with it. I
ask them, in the name of the new politics, to work with the other three
parties in the chamber. At the moment, there is a grand coalition against
them on this issue. That is why I am surprised that they launched this
debate. Their own policy is deeply flawed, and now they are breaking the
unholy alliance that was developing with the Tories. We thought that the
new love affair would develop into something more permanent, but SNP members
have split it asunder by taking the stance that they have on PFI, giving
the Tories no alternative but to sue for divorce. There is a vast majority
in the chamber in favour of developing PPP and PFI. The SNP should work
with us to develop these policies. It is time for it to stop being a destructive
Opposition and become a constructive one.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The important principle is being lost in
this debate. That principle is the delivery and provision of public health
and other services to the people of Scotland. When, many years ago in the
House of Commons, the Conservative party argued that tenants should be
given the right to buy their council houses, the consumption of the good
was the most important thing, rather than who owned it. Rather than saying
"public good, private bad", we should try to focus the debate on the delivery
of the services.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am going to shock the chamber, because
the party that introduced the first privatisation of the health service
in the United Kingdom was the Labour party. The health services in general
practice are owned privately by banks, by building societies, by doctors-they
are not owned by the national health service. In 1966, the Labour health
minister Robinson introduced that; the Conservatives cannot claim to have
done so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that Mary Scanlon will agree that
there has never been a complaint about that aspect of privatisation of
the health service, because it is pragmatic and it has worked for the people.
That is what PFI and PPP are about, as Mr Raffan has said.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>I do not think that
any of us has a monopoly on good ideas, and I am delighted to hear that
we took the idea from the Labour party and that the Labour party has now
re-endorsed it. I welcome the minister's re-examination of the guidelines
and proposals. As mature politicians, it is our responsibility to examine
those proposals and to move forward with the commitment to PFI.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Des McNulty was still harking back to the
Tory years. I believe that if we are to get a serious grip on Scotland's
public finances, many Labour-controlled councils should endorse PFI and
public-private partnerships for reasons of service quality and value for
money. The debate should focus on providing services. I do not believe
that any patient turns up at a hospital and asks who owns it. Patients
are more concerned about standards of treatment and waiting times. I have
never heard a parent say that they were concerned about who owned a school.
Parents, children and we as politicians should be concerned about the standards
and the provision of education, rather than about who owns and maintains
the building.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Looking across the chamber, I seem to remember
that, during our debate on Holyrood, the point was clearly made that the
business of this Parliament could be conducted equally well whether we
were tenants in this chamber or owners in the other chamber. It is the
business and the decision-making that matter.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am pleased to endorse the excellent idea
of PFI and am delighted that Labour members have come on board and done
so, too. According to the information centre, PFI projects in Scotland
that have been completed or are in the pipeline have a value of more than
&pound;2 billion. That is serious money; I would like to hear those who
are opposed to PFI make a realistic and honourable suggestion of an alternative
means by which we&nbsp;</font></td>

Parliament, but I hope that it can also-perhaps somewhat improbably-be
a defining issue of the new politics and one where we make the quantum
leap of realising that both sides of the case have some merit.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is concern about PFI. Tommy Sheridan
did not reveal a state secret when he said that the Scottish Trades Union
Congress was officially opposed to it. I know that many of my constituents
are as well. The SNP, however-and Mr Gibson in particular, when he suggested
that the Labour party was doing this for some ideological reason-overstated
the case when it criticised the Labour party. The reality is that the Labour
party is doing this for the practical reason of speeding up investment
in public services. I know that the SNP has put forward an alternative,
but that would fall foul of the public borrowing rules. That is a dilemma
which the Labour party has had to address.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think-and again some members may find
this improbable-that there are grounds for consensus around the Labour
amendment because of its use of the words "best value". This Parliament
provides an excellent opportunity to scrutinise every proposed PFI or PPP
deal.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is massive controversy about whether
those deals are better value than traditional funding in the long term.
In each case the Government says that it has let a deal go ahead because
it offers better value, but many economists and experts say that there
is doubt about the public sector comparator. The existence of this Parliament
makes scrutiny in great detail of those deals possible for the first time.
On that basis, I am prepared to accept the Labour amendment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Bruce Crawford: </strong>Scrutiny is very
important in regard to PFI. Has Mr Chisholm been told by ministers in his
own Government about level playing field support? That is the process whereby
local authorities were encouraged to become involved in private finance
initiatives. Has he been told by the Labour front bench how much level
playing field support exists for local authorities for future private finance
initiatives? Further, has he been told that it may well be exhausted?</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:
</strong>There is clearly an issue about how affordable PFI is. Although it
brings forward investment, there is a limit to the number of projects that
can be undertaken because of the commitment to pay for them over 30 years.
We cannot get into that area today, but many of the committees of this
Parliament should examine it in great detail over the next few months.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Labour has always said that best value
is about not only cost, but quality. Apart from the issue of whether PFI
is cheaper in the long run-which I have doubts about-there is the issue
of staffing. Concern has been expressed about the effect of PFI on unified
staff, particularly in the health service.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome Jack McConnell's announcement
today on the conditions of NHS staff and, I presume, education staff in
PPP projects. However, there is still concern about the loss of a unified
NHS staff. The Select Committee on Health at Westminster examined the issue
of NHS staffing and-while not opposing PFI in the health service in England-called
for a moratorium on new NHS private finance initiatives until the effect
on staff had been monitored. That had the support of the Labour majority
on the committee. There is widespread concern about the work force issues
and we must monitor them closely to assess the effect on staff morale and
the details of staff conditions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am pleased that the pension arrangements
have been modified at the new Royal Infirmary. That has been of great concern
to many of my constituents who work in the health service. We must keep
a close eye all along on the effect of PPP deals on the work force and
conditions of service.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the end of the day, along with staffing,
the key issue is best value. How does paying over 30 years using this method
compare with the traditional method of funding? This Parliament should
address that key issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

in the Labour party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last year we celebrated 50 years of the
national health service-probably the single most important peacetime achievement
of any Government this century. It was the greatest leap forward for social
inclusion that this country has ever seen. Everyone in our society was
given entitlement to quality medical provision free and at the point of
need regardless of his or her means. It was Aneurin Bevan, the great socialist
architect of the NHS, who proclaimed the dawn of a new age in this country-an
age in which no one would be denied the support that was necessary to climb
out of the miseries induced by illness, ignorance, poverty and unemployment.
That support would be there from cradle to grave. At last that supreme
article of socialist faith-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"From each according to his abilities,
to each according to his needs"-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">was given hugely practical and popular
expression. For the past 50 years, public investment and reinvestment has
been efficiently financed by low-interest, long-term loans from the Public
Works Loans Board. That has allowed succeeding generations to fulfil and
to sustain Bevan's vision. That vision is now being systematically undermined.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The ticking time bomb that is the private
finance initiative is set to blow away the legacy of the past 50 years.
In the motion we are asking Parliament to stop that bomb going off. The
rush to PFI means an ever-increasing takeover of public assets such as
schools and hospitals by private consortia that are driven by the profit
motive rather than by public interest.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the debate, my colleagues have described
and will describe how public needs are being overridden; I would like to
concentrate on why that is happening. PFI was essentially a Tory creation
that was born out of Thatcherite ideology.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>No, it was not.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Ingram: </strong>Yes, it was. It was a
creation that was determined to push back the boundaries of the state,
and the welfare state in particular. The official justification, however,
was the need to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement and to meet
the Maastricht criterion that any deficit in public finances should be
less than 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Gordon Brown and the new
Labour leadership have not only inherited that line from the Tories, but
have-if anything-outdone their predecessors in their zeal to control and
cut back Government expenditure on vital public services.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of GDP? Are we struggling to meet the Maastricht limit? The answer is an
