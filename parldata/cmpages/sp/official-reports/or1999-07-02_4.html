<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):
</strong>The next item of business is a ministerial statement on the McIntosh
commission report.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>On a point of order, Mr Presiding Officer. As this is the first
day that the Parliament is invested with its powers, I was interested to
hear the Minister for Communities talk about a spirit of consultation.
Will you rule on the fact that the statement that we are about to hear
was given, substantially, to the nation at quarter to 8 this morning on
Radio Scotland? That was an hour before the statement was made available
to the Opposition who have to comment on it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I will not
answer the point of order just now, but I have been reflecting on precisely
the same point. If I may, I will deal with it privately afterwards.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I call on Wendy Alexander to make the statement.
There will be questions at the end of the statement before we move on to
the debate, so there should be no interventions during the statement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">10:16</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Communities (Ms Wendy
Alexander): </strong>Yesterday marked a renewal of Scottish democracy. It is
fitting that our first task with our full powers is to continue that process
of renewal by considering our relationship with the other democratically
elected tier of government in Scotland-local government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Local government is of crucial importance
to every person in Scotland. It provides democratic leadership for cities,
towns and communities. I applaud the work undertaken by committed councillors
from all parties and recognise the hours that are given up, the service
that is offered, the good work that is done and the achievements in building
stronger communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Through the dark times in the 1980s it
fell to local government to uphold the values of fairness, justice and
opportunity. Those values are close to the heart of many members in this
Parliament and we are now charged with upholding them. As we forge a new
democracy, we know that our ability to deliver better services to the people
of Scotland depends on the dedication of those who provide local services.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is time for a new partnership, not of
words, but of actions. Today I want to describe how the Executive will
build upon the McIntosh proposals, and indeed go beyond them, to ensure
that local government takes its rightful place at the heart of the new
Scotland.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want today to
pay tribute to the work of Neil McIntosh and his team. The principle underlying
their report is parity of esteem: a meeting of equals, with mutual trust
and respect on both sides.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will shortly publish a consultation
document setting out how the Executive plans to develop the McIntosh recommendations.
In the partnership document we promised an immediate programme of change
in response to the McIntosh report; we will honour that commitment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I now want to make a number of announcements
that will build on the McIntosh recommendations, none of which featured
on the radio this morning. McIntosh asked us to consider his recommendations
as a package and we have done that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will start with a matter that the McIntosh
report does not deal with directly but which is of much wider importance.
The Executive and this Parliament expect the highest standards throughout
the public service. We therefore intend to change the previously announced
local government ethics bill to a local government and public bodies ethics
bill. We will hold further discussions with interested parties over the
next few weeks, including discussions on the scope for a statutory code
of conduct, and proposals that the new standards commission for Scotland
should have powers to investigate issues of probity concerning members
of public bodies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Good local government demands good leadership,
and as part of our agenda for change I have asked the Deputy Minister for
Local Government, Frank McAveety, to establish a new leadership forum,
bringing together ministers and all 32 council leaders. The first leadership
forum will convene in September, and at that time we will unveil a package
of support for member and officer development.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In line with our commitment to community
planning, I want to consult carefully on the case for a power of general
competence. We will consult further on that important issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The heart of McIntosh is a process of self-renewal
for councils, rather than prescribing changes in law. I am happy to endorse
that process of self-renewal. We need structures that support change, rather
than obstruct it. The current committee system was designed for the 19<sup>th</sup>
century, not the 21<sup>st</sup>. The public sees delays, bureaucracy and
confusion. We welcome McIntosh's recommendation for councils to move towards
executive systems that formalise the existing political leaderships. Some
councils have already begun to reform in that way. I want all councils
to think about following suit. We recognise that no one structure will
fit all but, in&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">future, the Scottish
public want to know when decisions are taken, how they are taken and who
can be called to account for them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, once again, we want to go further.
We want to raise aspirations, set ambitions high and enthuse members and
officers, so before setting up the McIntosh panel of advisers on new structures
we want to encourage some fresh perspectives from individuals who have
led effective reorganisations and cultural change in their own organisations.
I am delighted to confirm that the first two champions for change will
be Brian Souter and Doug Riley. Other champions of change from the public
and voluntary sectors will follow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Modernising structures should be a priority
for every council. McIntosh offers a time scale for action, and we accept
it. We expect all councils to embrace reform by the end of 2000, and we
will take steps to monitor progress and secure results.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are several areas in which I would
like the Local Government Committee to inform the process and lead the
public debate. I have in mind issues such as the operation of the covenant
and the joint conference, the arrangements for local elections and the
political restrictions on council officers. The arguments concerning council
employees standing for election are complex. No decision has been taken
on that matter, but there is evidence that the current arrangements on
political restriction are not working: of the 184 appeals since it was
introduced, 161 have been upheld. Clearly, there is a case for reform.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">McIntosh has made significant recommendations
in relation to community councils. Again, I accept them all, but I want
to go further. As Minister for Communities, I am acutely aware of the need
to involve people in decision making. No one has a monopoly on wisdom,
so we will cast the net wide. We will include the full range of community
organisations, such as tenants groups and housing associations, and make
use of new mechanisms, such as citizens' juries.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">McIntosh also suggested that councils should
be elected for a four-year term. I am sympathetic to that case, but the
discussion must also address whether those elections should be held midway
through the parliamentary session, as McIntosh suggests, or coincide with
the Scottish Parliament elections, to reduce voter fatigue and increase
turnout.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The challenge underlying all of McIntosh's
recommendations is how we renew local democracy in Scotland. That can only
happen if we make public service more attractive to those who might be
attracted to serve in it. That should be the backdrop to the question of
electoral reform&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and the recommendations
on proportional representation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The partnership document committed us to
progress on electoral reform. McIntosh has argued the case for it. His
report asks us to look at the most appropriate voting system for Scottish
local government. That we shall do. Today, I am announcing the formation
of the working party that McIntosh recommends. It will be cross party,
and the chair will be Richard Kerley.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The working party will have three crucial
tasks. First, it will consider ways in which standing as a councillor can
be made more attractive to more people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, it will advise on the appropriate
number of members for each council, taking account of the different characteristics
of cities and rural authorities. On electoral reform, it will take into
account the criteria that were suggested by McIntosh: proportionality;
the councillor-ward link; fair provision for independents; allowance for
geographical diversity; and a close fit between council wards and natural
communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thirdly, the working party will advise
on an appropriate system of remuneration for councillors. Because we want
to see real leadership properly rewarded, there will be an independent
element in the setting of allowances that takes account of the available
resources.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will ensure that the working party has
access to the widest possible range of expert advice and analysis, and
we look forward to receiving its report.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finance was not included in McIntosh's
remit, but we take seriously his view that financial matters are a vital
part of the agenda for change. Today I simply want to lay out the Executive's
general approach; my colleague Jack McConnell will want to consult further
over the summer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The central financial challenge for local
government is the same as that which faces this Parliament: how do we achieve
better government, rather than bigger government? I want to congratulate
local government on its recent achievements. Since 1997, average council
tax increases have been halved and halved again, to a figure this year
of only 2.6 per cent. Best value is now delivering real improvements in
services.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We recognise that many aspects of the present
financial arrangements need to be addressed, and that we can work closely
and constructively with local government on that. We intend to respond
to McIntosh's call for a review by pressing ahead vigorously with action
on a number of fronts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First, the reviews of distribution arrangements
that were begun after reorganisation in 1996 are&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">under way in conjunction
with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, and should be completed
as soon as is practicable. We are also undertaking a review of the capital
finance system, which will continue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, we are about to embark on a revaluation
of business rates. Differences between the commercial property markets
of Scotland and England are likely to lead to different rate poundages
in the future as at present, even when the intention is to raise identical
sums. That being the case, the Executive believes that it would be wrong
to create any further turbulence for business by altering the national
regime for non-domestic rates at this time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thirdly, there is a modernising agenda
for local government finance. We in Government have ideas, councils have
ideas and third parties have ideas. We must examine how local government
can benefit from the long-term stability that we have brought to national
financing. We must also investigate how we can pool funding streams between
central Government, local government and other public agencies, to deliver
savings and joined-up government, and look at new ways of drawing in private
sector resources. Finally, we must examine whether business improvement
districts could promote closer working between councils and the businesses
in their area.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All that adds up to a serious and heavy
agenda for local government finance. We will pursue it vigorously and keep
the area under review. In partnership with COSLA, we will progress the
priorities that I have outlined.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In conclusion, the McIntosh report contains
many recommendations. Among them are many things for which local government
has lobbied over many years. I have not been able to mention every one
of the recommendations, but I can confirm today that the Scottish Executive
proposes to accept the overwhelming majority of them. Today is a good day
for local government in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I started by talking about the need for
partnership. The partnership will come alive not simply by providing modern
services, but when all Scotland's politicians live up to the challenge
of co-operating to tackle the root causes of the poverty and social division
that scar Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our challenge as politicians, whether local
or national, is to deal with those old problems in new ways. We will look
for trust instead of distrust, for mutual respect instead of mutual suspicion,
and for partnership instead of conflict. Individuals will not always agree,
but will strive in partnership for common goals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

fundamental change to local government across Scotland. I hope that the

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;<strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Ms
Patricia Ferguson): </strong>A number of members have indicated that they wish
to participate in the debate. The minister will now take questions on her
statement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP): </strong>First,
does the minister agree that council tax is one of the most regressive
forms of taxation and that a fairer, local government income tax is required
to redistribute some of the massive wealth that exists in our country?
Secondly, will she explain why, among all the recommendations in the McIntosh
report, the recommendation for an immediate independent inquiry into local
government finance has been completely and utterly fudged?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>I disagree wholeheartedly
with Tommy Sheridan's assessment of the council tax. I am astonished that
someone who purports to be a socialist should stand up and recommend that
Scotland is left without any form of personal property taxation. On his
second question, it is for this Parliament, this Executive, our Local Government
Committee and COSLA to make the decisions about financing local government.
We see no need to outsource that process to any independent body. Contrary
to what Tommy Sheridan suggests, we are suggesting immediate progress on
a number of fronts rather than a review, which would be likely to take
two years if its time scale were comparable to that involved with the McIntosh
commission.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>In her opening remarks, the minister stated that local government
should take its rightful place in the new Scotland. Will she respond to
my suggestion that that includes bringing Scotland's water authorities
back under local government control? I draw the minister's attention to
the advertisement in today's recruitment pages, through which the Executive
wishes to employ directly a water industry commissioner-on a handsome wage
of &pound;65,000 a year-to give</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"the Scottish Executive independent advice".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I suggest to the minister that this commissioner,
if employed directly by the Scottish Ministers, will be likely to let them
hear what they want to hear, as they will be the paymasters. Does the minister
agree that the Parliament should be responsible for employing the water
industry commissioner?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>My recollection is
that, as a result of the reorganisation enforced on local government, we
have ended up with 32 local authorities. We have no desire to have 32 water
bodies. We have three, and we have taken steps to put many more councillors
on those bodies. I remind Richard Lochhead that, unlike in England, water

there is an interesting issue at root: how to encourage more people to
stand for public office, and the sort of scrutiny that exists of the individuals
who stand and who are appointed. In my speech, I said that we expect public
bodies to continue to play a major role, but we are anxious that the people
who take up appointments to them are subject to the same form of scrutiny
as people who stand for directly elected office.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I
note that the process of re-writing history continues apace in the Administration.
When the minister referred to the dark times in the 1980s, she was obviously
referring to the dark times when businesses large and small were being
ripped off by Labour-controlled councils-a process that was remedied only
by the introduction of the uniform business rate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Will the minister clarify some of her remarks
about business rates? She talked about there being no need for further
turbulence. Can she categorically advise us whether the Executive will,
during this parliamentary session, rule out any abolition of the uniform
business rate or any return to local councils of the power to levy a supplementary
charge on top of the uniform business rate? The minister will know that
that is a matter of great concern to Scotland's business community, and
to organisations large and small.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I thank the minister for the positive nature of much of her speech. SNP
members will agree with a lot of what she said, but I have a number of
questions for her and I hope that members will bear with me.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First, I am concerned about the minister's
apparent refusal to sanction an independent inquiry into local government
finances, which the McIntosh commission strongly recommended. Only three
days ago, COSLA reiterated a view that was expressed in its manifesto,
"A Local Government Contract for Scotland". That document said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Too much financial dependency on central
government confuses accountability and contains too many central controls
both over funding and spending".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Will the minister explain her rationale
in ignoring the overwhelming view of all those who represent local government
at the coal face, including the four political parties that are represented
on COSLA, the independent group of councillors and the Society of Local
Authority Chief Executives?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, given that the minister has signalled
the Executive's intention to proceed with the McIntosh commission's recommendation
on PR-we welcome the establishment of the task force-will she give an assurance
that the working party will report in time to fulfil the McIntosh commission's
recommendation, on page 25 of its report, that PR should</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"take effect in time to govern the next
council elections in 2002"?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thirdly, does the minister agree that the
logical position of cabinet or accountable executive local government is
that that structure should be extended to cover the work of COSLA? Does
she agree that COSLA should review its own structures in the light of the
McIntosh report's recommendations specifically in relation to the operation
of party groups and whips within COSLA's decision-making structure?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, we welcome the minister's commitment
that the Executive will accept the overwhelming majority of the recommendations.
Will she clarify whether it is the Executive's intention to implement the
recommendations that it accepts prior to the next local government elections?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>I appreciate Kenny's
welcome of the statement that we have issued. We very much hope that the
spirit in which we have approached the McIntosh commission's report is
an example of the new politics in Scotland. I think that there can be some
measure of cross-party agreement on a&nbsp;</font></td>

More important, there can be agreement with our colleagues in local government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue of refusing to sanction an independent
review arose in response to Mr Sheridan's question. We believe that it
is for this Parliament to act on issues of finance, and we have laid out
a wide-ranging programme to examine the distribution committee capital,
the revaluation and a whole set of modernising reforms in finance. I have
made it clear that we will involve many independent experts, but we feel
very strongly that it is wholly inappropriate simply to out-source the
financial relationship between this Parliament and local government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Gibson asked for an assurance that we
would implement, by 2002, the recommendations of the working party on proportional
representation. I cannot give him that assurance, partly because, as I
said in my statement, we are particularly attracted by the idea of moving
to a four-year term. As he will know, that is something for which COSLA
has long argued.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thirdly, on the point about the internal
relationships in COSLA and the issue of political whipping, it seems to
me that, in keeping with the spirit of self-renewal that we are encouraging,
although the Executive would be supportive of COSLA's organisation of its
internal affairs, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the matter
at this stage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am sorry; what was Mr Gibson's final
point?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Gibson: </strong>Do not worry; I do not
think that anyone could have memorised it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We welcome the minister's commitment that
the Executive will accept the overwhelming majority of the recommendations.
Will she clarify whether the Executive intends to implement those recommendations
prior to the next local government elections?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>It
is with enormous personal pride, satisfaction and pleasure that I reply
to the minister's statement on the report of the McIntosh commission-enormous
pride because this is the first debate of our new Parliament under its
full powers and the first debate after the magnificent splendour of yesterday's
ceremony and the huge positive wave that we felt from the Scottish people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It gives me satisfaction because the first
debate is on local government. I trust that signifies local government
is now being welcomed in from the political cold to become a full partner
in the good governance of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It gives me pleasure because I believe
in the spirit of our vesting day. Local government is an area in which
we can genuinely make a difference through genuine consensus. That is not
to say that there is no argument in this chamber about what the minister
has announced. Those who heard my questions will have no doubt about where
some of the disagreements lie. Where there is agreement, however, it is
genuine and heartfelt, and where we can go forward together, we will.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I assure the Deputy Minister for Local
Government that, although he and I may have spent the past two years lobbing
verbal hand grenades at each other across the floor of Glasgow City Chambers,
those days are now behind us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>Not yet. Wait. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Gibson: </strong>There is genuine consensus
in Scottish local government, in Scottish politics and in Scottish civic
society about the desperate need for modernisation and reform. Local government
is tired of being a whipping boy and seeks positive renewal for itself.
The Scottish Parliament, conscious of becoming the new media scapegoat,
must make local government a full and equal partner in the new Scotland,
and I am pleased that the Executive agrees with that aim.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The partnership that McIntosh recommends
is a new covenant, as the report calls it. I am, understandably, nervous
of using the term covenanters, knowing the history of this chamber. Perhaps,
through McIntosh, we will all become the new covenanters for the next millennium.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Members of the SNP thank Neil McIntosh

praise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Members on this side of the chamber are
prepared to accept the McIntosh recommendations as a whole. We believed
on first reading, and still believe after further analysis, that the proposals
represent a balanced outlook, and we have accepted the commission's plea
that the proposals should be taken as a package. It is disappointing that,
contrary to previous statements in the press, the minister and the Executive
have decided on an element of cherry picking.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The lack of an independent financial review
of local government is a matter of real concern; the lack of a clear timetable
for implementing proportional representation is a matter of some frustration;
the fudge on general competence is a real disappointment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, the SNP is prepared to work with
the Executive to get the best possible deal from this situation, but we
issue one word of caution to the Executive-it should not be swayed in its
convictions by matters of internal party dispute. The McIntosh commission
captured a consensus that carries across the parties in this chamber. When
vested interest and narrow gain are taken out of the equation, that consensus
spreads across Scotland's town, city and county buildings.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On a minor, discordant note, having looked
at some of the local authority submissions to the commission, I find it
difficult to take seriously some the critical comments that some members
have made. One example comes from my old friend and colleague, Councillor
Charlie Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council and self-proclaimed hammer
of proportional representation. He described the debate around PR as "a
dangerous distraction". That is different from what Glasgow City Council's
submission said about PR. The city council's submission was made while
it was under the leadership of the Deputy Minister for Local Government.
It read:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Glasgow City Council is of the view that
a comprehensive review should be set up which looks into all electoral
systems. This review should have as its express purpose the task of determining
the most accountable system for local government in the 21<sup>st</sup>
century."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I could quote other, similar, statements,
but I will not, partly because I fear that you, Madam Deputy Presiding
Officer, will not give me the time, and partly because I fear that the
new-found consensus with which I so boldly began might break down.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not seek to labour the point on PR.
I simply want to state that what local authorities, voluntary organisations,
trade unions and many individuals submitted to McIntosh represents the
broad current of opinion. However tempted ministers are to listen to the
voice of vested interest, I trust that&nbsp;</font></td>

I look forward to the future of local government with optimism and I have

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Keith Harding (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(Con): </strong>I am delighted that we have this opportunity to debate the McIntosh
commission report before the summer recess. It has been long awaited and
I, too, would like to pay tribute to Neil McIntosh and the other members
of the commission who have put so much time and effort into producing the
final document.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is no doubt that a review of the
relationship between local government and the Scottish Parliament was necessary
and that reform of the way our local authorities are run was essential.
Too many councils in Scotland have failed their communities. The priority
for the Scottish Conservatives is to restore public confidence in our councils
by ensuring that they are accountable to their local communities and that
they deliver good local services that give value for money.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The new Scottish Parliament will clearly
change the way in which Scotland is governed. Everyone involved in Scottish
politics will have to adapt to that change and local government cannot
be exempted from that process. It is important that there is a constructive
relationship between the Scottish Parliament and local authorities, but
issues such as who controls which functions should not be set in tablets
of stone. What matters to the people of Scotland is the quality of the
service provided, not who provides it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The emphasis in any reform of local government
must be on improving the quality of service to local communities. The proposals
to improve the conduct of council business are welcome as a way of speeding
up decision making and increasing accountability. The Conservatives believe
that cabinet systems could remove the need for the numerous committees
that have become a feature of local government. That in turn could well
lead to more efficient local government. Directly elected provosts could
also increase local accountability and we would encourage that system where
there was a local desire for that type of government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Both of those moves would mean that there
would be a need for a small number of full-time councillors. The Conservatives
see no problem with that as long as it is self-financing and&nbsp;</font></td>

a reduction in the total number of councillors. That would mean redefining
the role of the other councillors who would act as advocates for their
wards and scrutinise the activity of the cabinet through a committee system.
That would be an important and challenging role, but a reduction in the
number of committees would reduce the time commitment. The advantage of
that would be that people from a wider variety of backgrounds would be
able to become involved in local government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are somewhat concerned about any relaxation
in the rules governing council employees standing for election. There is
a clear conflict of interest in council employees being councillors in
the authority where they work. As far as we are concerned, the case for
a relaxation of those rules has not been made.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is no doubt of the need to encourage
greater interest in local authorities and a higher turnout at local elections.
The McIntosh commission has proposed some good ideas to simplify procedures
and increase participation in local elections. We also go along with the
idea of a four-year term in local government, but elections must be staggered
so that they do not coincide with Scottish parliamentary elections.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, we believe that it is vital that
the link between a councillor and his or her ward is maintained. We would
oppose any reform of the electoral system that breaks that vital link.
In the absence of an alternative system that maintains that link, we favour
the existing method of voting.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On finance, the small proportion of revenue
that is raised locally by councils needs to be addressed in any review
of local government finance. As we stated in our manifesto, we believe
that a parliamentary committee should consider that. However, we do not
believe that giving local authorities the power to set business rates is
the answer to the problem.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The uniform business rate has been of immense
benefit to businesses in Scotland and it has created a level playing field
in the United Kingdom. Scottish businesses remember only too well the penal
rates that they had to pay when local authorities in Scotland controlled
the setting of business rates. It put Scotland's businesses at a serious
competitive disadvantage compared with their counterparts south of the
border.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Local authorities in Scotland have a lot
of work to do before they are trusted by the business community. All the
major business organisations are adamantly opposed to going back to the
old system of allowing councils to levy a supplementary rate on top of
the UBR.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

opportunity to do so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scottish Conservatives believe that
we need to examine ways of increasing the independence of local authorities,
which means looking at the functions of our councils. We believe that education
should be removed from local authority control and that funding should
flow directly to local communities and groups of schools in local authority
areas. Schools would then belong to their own communities and reflect the
needs and aspirations of those communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The proportion of revenue raised locally
would be increased, thereby increasing accountability to the local electorate.
The reassessment of local government's responsibilities should go hand
in hand with freeing local authorities from the obligations imposed by
central government. We will advocate that approach in the Local Government
Committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We do not believe that decentralisation
of power stops at local councils. We want to see real power being devolved
to individuals, families and local communities and we welcome the McIntosh
commission's proposals for strengthening community councils. Decision making
must be devolved to the lowest possible level as a way of strengthening
civic society and revitalising communities. We will support any proposals
that help to achieve that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the head, and we strongly support it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We also support the general thrust of the
minister's statement in support of local government and welcome many of

work. It shows that even rebels can sook when required.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

It has come in for a lot of criticism.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a problem in that, for understandable
human reasons, civil servants who advise ministers think that they are
competent whereas local government is not. I am sure that many civil servants
are extremely competent, but when we examine the record, local government
has no disasters that are in the same league as the poll tax, the child
support agency, the benefit system or the inability to issue passports.
There might be disasters or incompetencies on particular issues and, as
in any human organisation, some people are not up to scratch, but the competence
of a huge amount of local government is very high.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We welcome the ideas of self-review, finding
local solutions to local problems and finding more decentralisation within
councils. We support the idea of publicising and learning from good practice
in local government. There is too much reinventing the wheel; a lot of
good work goes on and people could learn from each other.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We also make a clear statement that this
Parliament and, I hope, this Executive, has no intention of stealing powers
from local government. Local government has a genuine fear about that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Like some members who have already spoken,
I was disappointed in the iffiness of the minister's remarks about general
competence and the ability of some employees to stand as councillors. The
issue of general competence is recognised across Europe; there is such
a power in many countries and it is sensible that local government be enabled
to do anything for the benefit of the local community that is not illegal
or not already done statutorily by some other body.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As regards employees standing as councillors,
the idea that a schoolteacher, or middle-ranking official of some sort,
will somehow pervert the whole system to promote his or her career is a
load of rubbish. In many large rural areas, such people represent a reservoir
of potential talent that we are not allowed to use. Our party is very keen
on the issues of general competence and, with appropriate safeguards, allowing
employees to stand as councillors.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The two pillars on which local government
should rest are democracy and accountability. Democracy involves making
it easier to vote and having a fairer voting system. We will be very happy
to take part in debates and education on proportional representation, which
is not as complicated as people like to make out. However, I served under
a previous party leader who did not understand the voting system at all;
ignorance is not confined to other parties.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

is easily the best system, because it gives the power to the voters and
not to the organisations-which is why organisations are against it. The
list systems are awful; the recent European election was awful and, although
I got in to this place on a list, I would far prefer to get in by STV.

or is done through the Local Government Committee, using independent advisers.
The minister was misleading in one respect when she set out the aspects
of local government finance that she thinks, sensibily, need to be looked
at in the short term and said that she thought it was an either/or choice
between doing that and having an overall review. I do not think that that

view on PR, if one looks closely at her statement, it does not say whether
she is sympathetic. Although the statement refers to the formation of the
working party that McIntosh recommends, it does not suggest that its remit
or direction will arrive at PR.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome unreservedly the McIntosh report
in its entirety. It reflects not only the majority view in Scottish local

agreement, so that implementation takes place as soon as possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am a little concerned by some of the
comments made on PR since the McIntosh report was released. Some councillors
seem to resent intervention from an outside body. It is almost as if some
of our council barons have adapted the idea of the divine right of kings
to the modern age. They seem to believe that no one knows better than they
do how to run local government and that they have a divine right to do
it, and they will brook no interference in their traditional role, which
is to tell us what to do and what kind of services we will get. Like the
great political dinosaurs of the past, they refuse to accept that times
have moved on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should be in no doubt that the political
mood in Scotland has changed and for the better. We have moved on from
choosing between Tweedledum and Tweedledee, when the first-past-the-post
system was acceptable. These days, Tweedledum does not seem to attract
much support from Scottish voters. Members who have studied the results
of the past four elections will have no doubt that we are now firmly in
the realm of four-party politics-indeed, after the most recent election,
we are moving on to five or six parties. I welcome that, because it reflects
the political diversity in our society. Political pluralism is healthy
for democracy. The age-old adage that power corrupts and absolute power
corrupts absolutely is borne out whenever political parties gain huge majorities
on the back of minority support. There can be no doubt that one of the
reasons why McIntosh put PR at the top of the political agenda is the abuse
of power and the appearance of political corruption that flows from that
abuse in certain great former Labour fiefdoms in west central Scotland,
which does no credit to politics.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

was a day to reflect on Scotland and our sense of who we are, from the
fine speech made by Donald Dewar to Sheena Wellington's excellent rendition
of "A Man's a Man For a' That" and Amy Linekar's witty poem. Even last

members of the commission that they created the consensus that has emerged

a full review. Donald Gorrie is right: issues relating to the initiatives
are not mutually exclusive of an independent review.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are in an extremely serious situation.
Scottish local government has taken a battering in the past decade, from
local government reorganisation to huge expenditure cuts. Scotland's local
authorities are &pound;968 million worse off after the first three years
of the Labour Government than they were under the Tories.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need to consider other reforms in that
financial context. Local government has an uncertain financial future.
We know that the projections for 2001-02 highlight a potential real-terms
shortfall of &pound;170 million in the amount that local government will
need to sustain services that it is required to provide.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive might be able to address
some of those problems in the budget bill-when it arrives-but we still
need to highlight them in today's debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George
Reid):</strong> Please wind up now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>We heard about a review
of capital finance; will the minister consider the clawback rules on housing
and the general services capital programme? Will the capital finance review
include a review of those matters?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Des McNulty (Clydebank and Milngavie)
(Lab): </strong>I welcome the McIntosh report and the minister's initial response.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have three main points. First, the financial
settlement that was imposed on local government following its reorganisation
was manifestly unfair to local authorities with high concentrations of
multiple deprivation. That reorganisation-partisan in nature-resulted in
disruption and major reductions in services in many parts of Scotland;
it affected the operation of voluntary organisations and community services,
as well as that of local councils. I was working with Neil McIntosh at
the time of reorganisation and I know the efforts that he and his colleagues
in local government were obliged to make to combat the uncertainty generated
by an illogical and ill thought through reorganisation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The most lasting damage was done in terms
of finance. The current system for allocation of local government finance
takes little account of need: cash is distributed on a population basis,
almost irrespective of the social and economic circumstances of the different
localities in Scotland. We need to address that unfairness as a matter
of urgency. We cannot allow two or three years more of misery in places
such as West&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>However, debate on
local government finance has been stymied because, until now, Government
has not led the way. It is difficult for individual authorities to agree
to pass resources elsewhere. The current system cannot continue if we want
to tackle social exclusion as well as ensure the continued delivery of
quality local services for everyone in Scotland. Changing the distribution
system would be the biggest contribution that the minister could make to
addressing the problems of social exclusion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Gibson: </strong>Will Mr McNulty give
way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>Secondly, I want to
highlight a weakness in the McIntosh report, in paragraphs 60 to 62, which
deal with local government and the wider public sector. We should work
from the presumption that local government, properly accountable to local
people, should meet local needs. If it is in the public interest that an
appointed body should deliver a function rather than local government,
the justification for that choice should be made against well-understood
criteria.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the fact that there will be a
periodic review. However, we should start from the principle that local
democracy is crucial to the management of public services. As someone who
has served on a health board as well as in local government, I am certain
that the management of health service provision should be done by the health
service rather than by local government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, there must be a much closer relationship
between health services and local government services. For years, previous
Governments denied any links between health and poverty. In doing so, they
inhibited effective action on health by councils, the services of which
could make a huge contribution to the improvement of health standards.
Representation is not enough: we need joint working, more imaginative ways
of working and recognition of the leading role of local government in co-ordinating
the planning of services across the locality. Partnership arrangements
have done much to achieve that, but we need to move further.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Please
be brief.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Des McNulty:</strong> I detect no upsurge
or pressure for the creation of list councillors in Scotland; nobody wants
that or sees it as part of the panacea. I think that Donald Gorrie put
an argument against proportional representation of which we must take proper
account.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The implementation of proportional representation
runs the risk of handing power from the electors to the party managers.
Remember Portillo-the people of Enfield threw him out. Some systems of
proportional representation will not allow the voters that same opportunity.
If we are to have proper, accountable local government, it is vital that
the voters can get rid of people who are not doing the business, and that
is the central aspect of democratic accountability-and one which we should
sustain.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire

not go over many of the issues that have already been discussed, particularly
those raised by my colleague Donald Gorrie, who represented the Liberal
Democrat interest.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will focus on just two of the recommendations.
The first one that I wish to examine, following on from Des McNulty's speech,
is that:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"proportional representation be introduced
for local government elections . . .</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the subject be given immediate and urgent

the next council elections in 2002".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second recommendation that I will examine
is:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"an independent inquiry into local government
finance should be instituted immediately."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am becoming a little wary of some of
the comments that have been made today about proportional representation.
I will also quote from the partnership agreement of 13 May, so that we
are absolutely clear what we are talking about:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We will ensure that the publication of
the final McIntosh recommendations is followed by an immediate programme
of change including progress on electoral reform . . .</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Executive seems to take a view of reform except when it comes to monetary
issues, and I want to flag that up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must have an immediate commitment to
electoral reform and a long-term review of government finance. Audrey Findlay,
the leader of the Liberal Democrat-led Aberdeenshire Council, to whom I
have spoken, is firmly of that view. As Brian Adam said, almost all views
from local government and COSLA are the same-they want a review, and it

</strong>I pay tribute to the minister and congratulate her on her statement.
It was a wide-ranging statement, and very welcome.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Cabinet-style local government-or, to be
more accurate, the role of an accountable executive in local government-has
been one of the main debates, both pre and post-McIntosh. The functions
of these new-style executives and their interrelationship with an elected
provost-or mayor, as some Labour members choose to call them-have generated
many column inches of copy in our national press. That is one of the issues
that interest the public most.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course, some of the people who are particularly
interested are those who have been badly affected by the present system
and who may have lobbied a committee or even a full council to find that
the decision has already been made. What they see is merely a rubber-stamp
exercise. In many ways, local government is very unaccountable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course, at election time, we are all
accountable, and councillors and councils are accountable. Councillors
are, indeed, accountable at surgeries. However, we can all think of examples-and
I am sure that most of us have been involved in such situations-of when
perhaps a parent comes along who believes that a bad or wrong decision
has been made about, say, a local school closure. They go to an education
committee where they see no real debate and where a decision is ratified-which
was, in fact, taken previously, behind closed doors. After that, what can
they do? They can go to the surgery and complain to their councillor. They
might be reassured or placated, but they will probably be ignored. I doubt
whether they would vote for that councillor again. That would be detrimental
to local government, because one such incident might&nbsp;</font></td>

very good councillor out of the water. In those situations, it is the community

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The difficulty is that councillors have
been whipped into line; it is not necessarily the councillor who is wrong,
but the system. Is the real reason for voter apathy that the public can
no longer influence decisions when the elections are over and so feel powerless?
The McIntosh report attempts to address that very problem. Under the McIntosh
recommendations, decisions will be open and transparent and people will
understand why they have been made. Paragraph 103 on page 28 of the report
says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>"</strong>Our recommendation to councils
is that they should review their own procedures with the principal objective
of ensuring that policy proposals and matters for decision by the councils
are subject to open debate; and that the council may effectively scrutinise
the actions of the leadership and hold it to account for its performance:
that is to say that these matters should be debated in public and there
should be opportunity for them to be examined and questioned, without unnecessary
constraint imposed by a party whip."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The McIntosh report has kicked the policy
of elected provosts into touch. We welcome that very much and I hope that
the minister takes it into account. Such a policy goes against the grain
of the McIntosh report-God help us if we have a reincarnated Pat Lally
in Glasgow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We support the findings of the McIntosh
commission and believe that the recommendations will form the basis of
the rebirth of local government. However, as other members have said, we
must refrain from cherry picking. Kenny Gibson made that important point
well. As the McIntosh report comes as a package, let us take it in that
way and start building a new local government for Scotland in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

subsidiarity as the fundamental principle, that does not mean that we should
not give strategic direction to local government. More controversially,
I believe that money should be ring-fenced for vital projects such as the
carers strategy and the strategy against violence against women.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I feel some disappointment with the second
part of the commission's remit about responding to people. I welcome the
report's recommendations on community councils, as there are many excellent
ones in my constituency. I also welcome the minister's statement that we
need to go much further in involving local communities in local decisions.
We have to start with the fundamental principle of a more responsive local
government with a strengthened role for local councillors as representatives
and champions of local people. All local groups-such as tenants groups,
community groups and community councils-must be involved in that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is in the light of that fundamental
principle that I hope that the debate about executives and PR systems will
take place, because some of those systems make for less responsive local
government. I hope that we will have a full and frank debate about that.
If we are going to have an executive system there has to be, as the commission
admits, a different kind of whipping system so that back-bench councillors
can put forward the views of their communities. I am glad that the commission
has recommended that and hope that the Executive will take it on board.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With more proportional systems we must
preserve the link between a councillor and an area; a closed list PR system,
for example, would result in far more power going to parties, with councillors
becoming far less responsive to local communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</strong>Given that the McIntosh commission was so expertly chosen and had such

that local government elections should be held between national elections
rather than on the same day as them?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that that is one of the commission's fundamental recommendations. However,

with citizens advice bureaux. An awful lot of the time of the management

complicated negotiations with local government and central Government to
secure core funding. An example of that-it has been in the press during
the past few days-is the Bath Street CAB, which faces a major financial
crisis. It is important that we protect the financial structures and organisational
independence of the voluntary sector. If the sector has an agenda that
does not quite fit the objectives of central and local government, it is
important that we recognise that that agenda is equally valid; it should
not affect its financial support.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue of long-term financial support

years of the withdrawal of funding, of the undermining of local democracy
and of the undermining of authorities' ability to serve their citizens.
I remind the minister that-especially in the past three years-my city of

city in Scotland, has suffered budget cuts of &pound;200 million and the
loss of 4,000 jobs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

hope that Tommy Sheridan will forgive me if, like the minister, I do not

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome this opportunity to discuss the
McIntosh report. I imagine that chapter 4, which contains recommendations
about the electoral system, will be the most hotly debated part of the
report in this chamber, in council chambers and in the media. Unfortunately,
that will probably deflect from some of the other issues that the commission
discussed. I say unfortunately, because although PR will exercise the minds
of politicians and journalists, I suspect that it is the issue of least
interest to the general public. As long as the link is maintained between
councillors and the community, people are more concerned about what local
government does than about how it is elected.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I agree with everything that Des McNulty
said about local government finance. After local government reorganisation,
Dundee was left in a similar position to that of Glasgow-in terms of poverty
indicators and league tables, the two cities vie for first place.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is why I welcome the fact that, although
finance was not included in the remit of the McIntosh commission, the commission
recognised the importance of the way in which local government was financed
and recommended a review, particularly of the distribution formula, which
would be welcomed in my area-Dundee City Council has campaigned on that
issue for a long time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although the McIntosh report covers many
important issues, the key section is chapter 6-"The Voice of the People".
I welcome the recommendations as far as they go but, like Wendy Alexander,
I do not think that they go far enough. When community councils operate
well-as they do in some parts of Dundee West-they ably articulate the views
and concerns of local people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Community councils are not, however, the
only representative bodies in communities. In some areas they do not exist
or are less relevant than tenants organisations or other local groups.
That is particularly so in areas where groups have been brought together
to combat poverty and deprivation and to improve and regenerate communities.
I hope that ways can be found in which to give representative groups equal
status in the democratic process. That is only briefly mentioned-in paragraph
164 in chapter six-and I think that the proposal should be strengthened.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, I hope that local government will
not be used as a political football in this chamber as it has been in other
forums in the past. I was a bit disappointed by Brian Adam's contribution
in that respect. People come into contact with local government 24 hours
a day from cradle to grave, and the majority of that contact is positive
and beneficial. Councils of every political persuasion or none provide
excellent services to the people that they represent.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that the McIntosh report can be
seen as the first step towards strengthening the role of local government
and that this Parliament and local government can work in partnership to
achieve that aim. There will be no partnership if local government is a
subordinate partner, as was seen to be the case in the past. The partnership
must be equal and must be built on trust, understanding and common goals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

and the fact that local authorities are multipurpose and provide a uniquely
wide range of services to the community.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Local authorities perceive significant,
imminent change as a threat. They see the Parliament as an institution
that will further erode their autonomy. Proportional representation must
acknowledge the different views across Scotland. I share Des McNulty's
concern. However, I believe that if there is an open, honest and transparent
debate, council members will accept the wisdom of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is one key omission from the McIntosh
report. We have made the connections between the Scottish Parliament and
local government, but we have failed to set up connections with the Westminster
Parliament and the European Parliament. There has been major apathy towards
Europe across Scotland. Europe controls and influences our lives a great

authorities, together with the occasional person who ran their own business.
I am not saying for one moment that there is anything wrong with those
sections of the community, but they are hardly representative. We must
make every effort to make local government more inclusive and to encourage
more people to stand.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How do we do that? We must examine the
way that councils are run. Few can doubt that the present cumbrous and
laborious structure of many local authorities is a disincentive for people
to enter local government. It is pleasing that the McIntosh commission
suggested that the cabinet system might be considered. The report also
suggests that the time of the full-time councillor has perhaps come and
that the councillor should be remunerated accordingly. Conservative members
would argue that that must be self-financing and that it must be achieved
by a reduction in the number of councillors.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">McIntosh identifies the real problem of
local government as voter apathy. Why are people not interested in councils?
Mike Rumbles put his finger on it when he pointed out-I do not know which
local authority he had in mind-that 20 per cent of local government finance
is financed by the local authority and the electors in that area. In my
experience the proportion is usually much smaller; for example, Glasgow
is somewhere in the region of 14 per cent. When there is no pecuniary interest,
people are reluctant to involve themselves in the affairs of local authorities,
which is bad. Local authorities should be subject to scrutiny and electoral
questioning to a much greater extent than they have been up to now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think Disraeli said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The ability to tax and please is a gift
not given to man."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Various experiments have been carried out
about how local government finance should be reorganised. None of the experiments
have been successful. That brings me to the conclusion that the only solution
to that difficulty is to recognise that some of the powers of local government-I
know that there will be resistance to this-should be taken from them. Education,
which is one of the big spenders, should, possibly, be administered by
this Parliament. That would enable local government to look more closely
at the powers with which it has been left.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</strong>I do not recall David Mundell contributing to this debate. The point

McIntosh commission has been an exemplar in terms of active listening and
deserved outcome. It would be too much to expect everyone to be fully satisfied
with the outcome of the commission's work. The least that we can expect
is for all, especially the Government, to give its findings full, detailed
and proper consideration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From the minister's statement, I am glad
to see that the Executive has, for the most part, embraced the spirit of
the commission's findings. Having said that, I am concerned, like others,
about the departure from the report of an independent inquiry into local
government finance. I am disappointed that the Executive has not considered
building on the commission's report by taking the imaginative step of announcing
how it may deal with community planning powers for local government. The
minister will be aware that for the past year, five local authorities-I
will not name them because of time restrictions-have been battling the
authorities in that area. I hope that the deputy minister will deal with
that in his summing up and tell us when we can expect that area to be considered.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will comment quickly on the prospect
of proportional representation, local government, pay and conditions for
councillors and the potential for executives. The Executive is be applauded

all the good intentions could be in danger of being undermined if we do
not have an independent review.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need an independent review with a brief
to establish a needs-based methodology that assesses the demographic and

population and geographical location. The issue is not just about how the
cake is distributed: it is also about the size of the cake-the amount of
money that is available to local authorities. That needs to be taken on
board.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">McIntosh raised that issue in his report
because of the din that was made by local authorities across Scotland.
Indeed, that din was converted into fine words by COSLA in its document
about local government in Scotland, which was endorsed earlier this year
by all of Scotland's former council leaders, including Frank McAveety,
who is now Deputy Minister for Local Government, Kate Maclean, Tom McCabe,
Ian Welsh, Peter Peacock, and, I have no doubt, many other councillors
here. I hope that they will continue to lobby in the same way that they
did when they signed up to that contract.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This has been an interesting and lively
debate. I will make one final point, because I can see the Deputy Presiding
Officer looking at me. It is crucial that we agree to four-year terms for
councillors, but it is also crucial that we resist robustly the idea of
having council elections on the same day as the parliamentary elections.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am delighted to have served in local
government in the largest authority in Scotland. I depend on local government
to deliver good-quality services for people like myself and my family,
as, I am sure, do many people present today. My experience was in the quiet,
non-eventful and placid political culture of Glasgow City Council. I am
delighted to hear the consensual comments made by many of my former colleagues
but, not surprisingly, Mr Sheridan decided to change-again-and continued
with the single transferable speech that he has made on every occasion
during his seven years in the city chambers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">McIntosh stated that local government serves
the people and represents the community. Everyone present welcomes those
features of local government. In the ministerial statement we made it clear
that we want local government to serve the people and to represent their
communities. I hope that local government is up to the challenge and rises
to it, and ensures that we work in partnership to make a difference for
all Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue is not necessarily about delivering
services, no matter how important that is at a local level. The issues
concern a vision of what local government can achieve-as we have heard
today-when it thinks more strategically and in the long term about the
needs of its communities, of how it serves the people and how it represents
them. For example, it means not just thinking about the housing of the
present, but the making of sustainable neighbourhoods for the future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The issue is not about the service that
existed previously. As Norman Murray said this week about the concerns
of the past 20 years, local government is almost like the drunken relative
at the party. However, it will no longer be the drunken relative at the
party. We will drink with local government to make a difference for the
future. I say that strictly as a teetotaller, Mr Deputy Presiding Officer.
I admit that certain other members enjoy themselves much more fully, although
they cannot match the enjoyment and excitement of Alex Salmond's household

for enjoyment the next time that I am up for a wee bit of fun.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>Mr Sheridan takes a

go back beyond 1997. Families have experienced mass unemployment and a
lack of employment opportunity; communities have been scarred. It takes
longer than two years to retrieve that situation. It is okay for members
of the SNP to support Mr Sheridan in this debate-as they have often done

[M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>: "Give way."] I will give way to Mr Salmond.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>Can I drag the deputy
minister back to the subject that he is trying to get away from? [<i>Applause.</i>]
Poverty has deep, underlying causes. Every member in this chamber will
agree with that, but the question that he was asked was why it has been
increasing over the last two years, according to the measurement which
Mr Sheridan gave. It is a legitimate question, whether asked by a member
of the Scottish Socialist party, by the Scottish National party or by any
member of this chamber. I suggest that the minister stops dodging it and
starts answering it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>I hope that I am allowed
the time to reiterate what I said earlier, which Mr Salmond seems to have
ignored. [M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>: "Answer the question."] I am trying
to answer the question, if members would allow me to do so. The deep, underlying
causes of poverty go back long before 1997, which Mr Salmond accepted.
The Labour Government has engaged in a series of measures-and will continue
to do so-to tackle the underlying causes of poverty. I have already mentioned
the series of policy developments that we have made. I do not wish to repeat
them, and if members do not like them, tough-they are actually happening.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I recognise that a consensus is developing
on the principles underlying our response to the McIntosh report. This
chamber wholeheartedly supports the idea of making a commitment to ensure
ethical standards in public office. We are committed to identifying ways
in which leadership can make a difference at a local level, irrespective
of party or individual. Each and every one of us has a responsibility on
that. We want a full and honest debate on democratic renewal, electoral
systems and how to support local government in its job. It is important
for us to engage in that process. COSLA has asked for nothing less.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Keith Raffan (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(LD): </strong>Will Mr McAveety give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>The
minister is winding up.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McAveety: </strong>On partnership, there
is a shared agenda for trying to ensure excellence and achievement. It
is about recognising that we can move together, not about centralising
powers, a proposal which some Tory members have put forward as a principle
for education. It is about recognising the impact that reorganisation has
had on all authorities in Scotland: it was a botched and non-consultative
reorganisation. In this chamber,&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we have a vision
of a good council flourishing and a weaker council being supported and

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My opinion is that an agenda for excellence
is a noble challenge. I think that, together, we can make the difference.
I welcome the contributions from across the chamber today-no matter how
heated some of the exchanges were-which were made to ensure that we in
the Scottish Parliament use our role to support and develop local government,
and that local government recognises our role in setting broad parameters
for governance in Scotland. I hope that we can build the family of Government
together, and that we can make a difference for the future.</font></td>
