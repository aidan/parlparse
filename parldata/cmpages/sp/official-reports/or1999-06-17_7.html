<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):
</strong>The next item of business is the motion on tuition fees in the name
of Jim Wallace. I have selected amendment S1M-2.4 in the name of John Swinney.
Mr Wallace will open the debate, and then the amendment will be moved.
The debate will end shortly before 5 o'clock to allow time for the bureau
motion on the setting up of committees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the moment, I do not propose to put
any time limit on speeches. I will wait to see how many members want to
speak.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy First Minister and Minister
for Justice (Mr Jim Wallace): </strong>I welcome the fact that it has been possible
to debate tuition fees and student finance so soon in the lifetime of this
Parliament, given the importance that was attached to those issues in the
election campaign.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My party and the Executive place lifelong
learning and the development of high quality further and higher education
at centre stage and regard them as key factors in securing Scotland's future
economic prosperity. Investment in higher and further education is also
a necessity if we are to ensure that, as a nation, we provide each individual
with the opportunity to develop his or her talents to the full.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scotland is rightly renowned for its university
tradition. Many of our higher education establishments are acknowledged
to be world class. We can boast the highest level of participation in the
UK; almost 50 per cent of young Scots are in higher education, compared
with 33 per cent of young people elsewhere in the UK.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The transformation of the number of people
gaining access to further and higher education, which has happened under
Labour and Conservative Governments, has been a remarkable achievement.
It has also thrown up deep concerns about the adequacy of funding for our
universities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Across the UK, the record of the Tory party
in power was a 40 per cent reduction in spending per student in higher
education. Against that background, there was agreement among the parties
that the crisis in higher education funding had to be addressed. However,
it was clear that the parties approached the issue in different ways.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Conservatives were
arguing for the introduction of &pound;1,000 tuition fees that would be
payable by every student, regardless of income. To be fair-I always like
to be fair-the Conservatives failed to support the second reading of the
bill because of the Government's failure to provide for</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"an independent review body to advise on
any future changes in tuition fees."-[<i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i>
16 March 1998; Vol 308, c 970.]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Labour Government at Westminster opted
for means-tested student loans and means-tested tuition fees. My party
accepted that maintenance grants should be turned into loans, but the Liberal
Democrats opposed the introduction of tuition fees-means tested or flat
rate. That remains our position.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We believe that the tradition of full-time
higher education students paying no fees is important. We remain concerned
that the imposition of tuition fees might be a barrier to increasing access.
We have expressed concern about the 6 per cent reduction in applications
to Scottish universities and the significantly higher fall in the number
of mature students applying for a university place. We have expressed fears
that, after the introduction of tuition fees, the amount payable by students
will increase, or different fees will be introduced for different courses.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is clear that we disagree with the Labour
party on those issues. That disagreement was apparent throughout the parliamentary
debates on the establishment of tuition fees and throughout the election
campaign for the Scottish Parliament. Those different points of view are
acknowledged in the partnership agreement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):
</strong>It is true that those concerns were apparent in the election campaign.
Jim and I took part in many debates and, in each one, he said that if the
Labour party did not have a majority in the chamber, tuition fees would
be abolished. Does he not think it was wrong to say that during the campaign
if he did not intend to carry it through?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I believe that what
we are proposing today is the most effective and immediate way of carrying
forward the issue of tuition fees-and that of student poverty, which we
also debated during the campaign.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Let me make it clear: we remain committed
to the abolition of tuition fees for all Scottish students at UK universities.
That is what our manifesto said. We will have confidence in putting that
case to the committee of inquiry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>The
Conservative party made its case to the biggest committee of inquiry that
was possible: the electorate, who made their decision when casting their
votes for us.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Having made such
great play of the &pound;80 million for education that was extracted in
the coalition negotiations, will the minister tell us why half of that
sum was not deployed to fulfil his promise to abolish tuition fees, but
was instead spent on areas that he did not describe as non-negotiable?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>Anyone who heard what
we said in the campaign knew that investment in education was our most
important priority. I am proud that we have managed to secure &pound;80
million of extra investment in education that will help to tackle student
poverty in a number of ways: the &pound;9 million three-year pilot scheme
to encourage students from low-income families to stay on at school with
a view to going on to higher education; the loan funding for mature part-time
students who are on low incomes; and the increase in access funds to &pound;14
million a year, which will relieve the hardships that are suffered by the
most disadvantaged students.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We said that education was our main priority
and we have helped to deliver more resources to education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the amendment's supporters' recent
conversion to the proposal of a committee of inquiry into student funding
and student hardship. No doubt the representations that they have received
from people who are genuinely concerned about the financial position of
students have had an effect on them, albeit belatedly. They may be willing
to recognise that the commitment to a committee of inquiry, which was expressed
in the partnership agreement document, was a significant step forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The committee of inquiry that will examine
the issues of tuition fees and student hardship will be very different
from its Westminster counterparts. If this motion is carried, the committee
will proceed with the approval and authority of this Parliament and it
will report to this Parliament. The role and importance of the Parliament
in progressing this issue is vital. It is also important when we look at
the terms of the opposition amendment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must remember that this is not a debating
society; it is a Parliament. Therefore, when the amendment in the name
of Mr Swinney says that we must</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"bring forward to the Parliament proposals
for the abolition of tuition fees",</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we are entitled to note that motions and
amendments must be clear and unambiguous.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our position, as I have stated, is that
we want all Scottish students to have their fees paid by the Government,
without interfering with the funding of the universities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

in which students were funded by the state. It would remove tens of millions
of pounds from Scottish higher education at a stroke. Where would that
leave efforts to improve quality and extend access?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The amendment would also mean that this
Parliament should abolish tuition fees for all students who study in Scotland,
including those from England and Wales. Scottish students studying in other
parts of the United Kingdom would still have to pay tuition fees. That,
expressly, was not part of the Liberal Democrat manifesto.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Opposition amendment is deeply flawed.
It bears the hallmark of a political tactic, rather than a substantial
parliamentary motion addressing an important issue that we must get right.
If I may use the language of Mr McLetchie, which so embellished our election
campaign, it smacks more of Mr McLetchie snuggling up to Salmond on a sofa
than to the serious politics that the issue requires.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In contrast, we have indicated that we
want to work with the organisations that care most about higher and further
education in Scotland on the issue of tuition fees and student support.
We want to work with organisations such as the Committee of Scottish Higher
Education Principals, the Association of Scottish Colleges, the Association
of University Teachers and the National Union of Students in Scotland,
all of which support the setting up of the independent inquiry. Indeed,
the National Union of Students in Scotland also supports the abolition
of tuition fees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unlike the Dearing inquiry, which focused
on the purpose, shape and funding of higher education, the focus of this
inquiry is the position of part-time and full-time students in both higher
and further education. Many people in our universities and further education
colleges believe that the Dearing and Garrick reports neglected that area.
The entire system, including the payment of tuition fees, requires an overhaul.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Much of the system goes back to the 1960s,
when social conditions and the number of people who went into universities
were quite different from what they are today. We need to take account
of the fact that patterns of study have changed since many of us were students.
Today, about half of the people entering further and higher education are
mature students, a fact that-with respect-the saltire awards proposed by
the Conservative party do not reflect.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mature students have different needs from
school leavers. Many people choose to combine work with study. The support
mechanism-in terms of help with fees, books and exam charges-has never

students. That is why I commend the committee of inquiry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the motion is passed, the Executive
is anxious to consult the other parties fully, and as a matter of urgency,
on the details of the committee. My view is that the committee should be
asked to work intensively and to report by the end of the year. Clearly,
we will need to find a suitably independent chair, without any party allegiance.
We are keen that the membership of the committee should be wide enough
to bring a wide range of experience to bear.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Parties will be asked for their views and
suggestions and I hope that we will all agree that people should be chosen
to serve on the committee on account of their expertise, rather than on
account of partisan loyalty. The committee's terms of reference will also
be a matter for discussion although, as the motion makes clear, it should
encompass tuition fees and all student finance, for part-time and full-time
students, in both further and higher education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also hope that we can reach agreement
that the committee should take account of the fact that we need to maintain
both quality and standards in our higher and further education institutions.
We also need to recognise the fact that many students in Scotland, particularly
in our universities, come from outside Scotland. Finally, we do not propose
to constrain the committee, but the Parliament would expect to be made
aware of the costs of the options and recommendations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No person or party is being asked to make
any concession on their position regarding tuition fees in agreeing to
establish the committee. This proposal represents the most effective and
immediate way of taking forward these crucial issues. Moreover, by consulting
and by involving people with an interest, people with a knowledge, people
with a commitment to students and people with a commitment to further and
higher education, we will give real substance to what all the parties have
proclaimed. The Parliament must consult and listen. As the former president
of the AUT, Mr David Jago, said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Seeking a quick fix on this issue would
be a betrayal of Scotland's aspirations for a new politics, in which everyone
can have a say."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that all parties will support the
establishment of the committee of inquiry and state their case to it. That
is what the Liberal Democrats will do. Although we intend the process to
provide a sound basis for an agreed way forward, the partnership agreement
expressly acknowledges that we are not bound in advance and, as Liberal
Democrats, we are free to come to our own view on the committee's conclusions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Mr Gallie.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have already referred to our manifesto
position on tuition fees. It is worth reminding the Parliament that our
manifesto also emphasised the importance of widening access to further

I have referred to in this speech show that we have made a start. The committee

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I move,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That the Parliament recognises the widespread
opposition to tuition fees, the growing importance of lifelong learning
to Scotland's society and economy and the wide range of circumstances of
those engaged in lifelong learning; and calls upon the Scottish Executive
once established to appoint urgently a committee of inquiry on the issue
of tuition fees and financial support for those participating, part-time
or full-time, in further and higher education; the terms of reference,
time scale and membership of that committee to be approved by and its report
laid before the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr John Swinney (North Tayside) (SNP):
</strong>I have listened carefully to Mr Wallace on many occasions. I have heard

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the measures outlined in Mr Wallace's
speech are the best way to address the crisis on tuition fees, I am left
to ask myself why he did not fight the election on them. He fought the
election, as my party did, on a commitment to abolish tuition fees. In
the 14 minutes of his speech, history was rewritten by his articulation
of what his party now represents.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to vote for the abolition of tuition fees. It is also an opportunity to
start to solve the problem of student hardship. We all know what our duty
is-73 members in this chamber were elected on a ticket of abolishing tuition
fees. That commitment was centre stage in the election-it was not hidden

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Parliament and,
critically, of whether the will of the people of Scotland can prevail.
We are debating a matter of principle that affects real people outside
this chamber and is close to the heart of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In moving this amendment, I want to concentrate
on two points. First, I want to make the case for this Parliament instructing
the Executive to abolish tuition fees. Secondly, I want to challenge the
notion, advanced by Mr Wallace and by his colleagues-in endless interviews
that Mr Lyon gave this morning-that the quickest way to abolish tuition
fees is to have the inquiry that is proposed in Mr Wallace's motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The case for abolishing tuition fees was
well rehearsed during the election campaign. It comes before us as a simple
question of principle: it is a question of free education, not fee education.
It is a very Scottish principle. More young Scots go into higher education
per head of the population than do young people in any other part of the
UK-and that pays off. Scotland is the third most prolific country in the
world for research published per head of the population.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, there are worrying signs of a
decline in applications to higher education and in applications to Scottish
higher education institutions. There are worrying signs about applications
from mature students and there is unease about our ability to encourage
postgraduate study on top of heavy undergraduate debt. Our country has
a strong commitment to education and we must not undermine it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To move away from a discussion on principle
with which it will be uncomfortable, the Executive will try to distract
us by claiming that the abolition of tuition fees will benefit only the
well-off. The SNP has always advanced the case for abolishing tuition fees
and tackling the issue of student hardship, and our amendment reflects
that position. There is abundant evidence that proves that the ending of
the grant and the increase in the loan and debt culture for students is
a real deterrent to people from low and middle-income households. During
the past few weeks, many students have represented to me a growing perception
that higher education costs a great deal of money, and tuition fees are
the clearest illustration of that perception.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Not only the children of managing directors
and Cabinet ministers are being charged tuition fees. The child of a postman
and a midwife pays the full whack and the child of a phone salesperson
and a bricklayer pays half of the fee. Abolition of tuition fees is hardly
a perk for the rich and famous. Even for people who pay no fees at all,
there is no guarantee that fees will not creep down towards them in the
future. The inflation index used to update the liability threshold will
mean that more and more people will be liable to pay fees.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When the case for
abolition was made during the election, the electorate spoke. The decision
to abolish tuition fees in principle should be taken today and we should
agree steps now to tackle student hardship.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SNP is the first to recognise that
its proposals have to be paid for. Before the election, I outlined a proposal-called,
interestingly, the Holyrood project-that was designed to free new resources
in the Scottish block to afford this Parliament's priorities. It was based
on the concept of extending value in the public finances and of seeking
the best practice within the Government community to obtain the best value
for public resources.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We estimated that more than &pound;120
million could be freed up for the abolition of tuition fees and the Parliament's
other priorities but, during the election campaign, our targets were described
as "modest". Fundamental to our case was the opportunity to direct resources
to meet the genuine funding requirements of the higher education sector,
which we would not detract from and which we recognised required to be
supported fully by the state.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The central issue is whether a committee
of inquiry is the quickest route to abolishing fees. At 12.54 this afternoon,
I was listening to Mr McLeish's impassioned speech during the earlier debate.
He came out with a ringing request that there should not be another committee
of inquiry. I could not agree more. I think he is absolutely right. He
was talking about a different subject, but he made the point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

it clear in the press that the committee proposed by the Executive will
have a wide remit, and that was confirmed by Mr Wallace in his presentation

where the money is coming from; and it will be chaired by an independent

It should be made clear that the committee that we want to establish-I

a committee of inquiry on the issue of student hardship. I am the first
to recognise that although the majority of members were elected to this
Parliament to abolish tuition fees, that majority does not have a solution
to the problem of student hardship. That has to be addressed along with
the serious points made by the student organisations. Today, I want this
Parliament to enforce the mandate that it was given.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the committee of inquiry goes ahead
and we do not take a decision in principle on tuition fees today, the assumption
must be that there is a substantial job to be done in relation to the debate
on tuition fees. The committee must therefore take evidence. The minimum
information that it will need for comparative purposes is admission figures
in October and application figures in December of this year, so it cannot
report until next year at the earliest. By the time its recommendations
are examined, debated and voted on-free vote or not-any abolition will
be too late for next year's students.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No member of this Parliament has ever obtained
an assurance from Mr McLeish and his colleagues in the Labour part of the
Executive that they will be bound by the terms of that inquiry when it
comes to the Parliament. We have no guarantee that that inquiry will recommend
the abolition of tuition fees.&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is no reason why any member elected
on a commitment to abolish tuition fees should find the wording of this
amendment impossible to support. It calls for the abolition of tuition
fees that the electorate demanded. It calls for a stable solution to student
hardship. The vote is about the principle of free education and access
to education. Mr McLeish admitted at the weekend that if this amendment
were passed, tuition fees would have to be abolished. Mr McLeish has also
stated that the Government's response to the committee of inquiry will
be driven through the Parliament by the party whips for Labour and the
Liberal Democrats.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is an opportunity today to abolish
tuition fees. If Liberal Democrat members pass up this opportunity, they
will do so with no guarantee that abolition will be delivered at the end
of the inquiry. Mr Wallace said during the election campaign that tuition
fees would be dead by Friday. We all thought that he was talking about
Friday 7 May, but the timetable has slipped. Mr McLeish conceded at the
weekend that tuition fees could be dead by this Friday, if this amendment
is passed. Tuition fees could be dead by tomorrow-Friday 18 June-so we
must vote for abolition today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

not the hardship that tuition fees might cause. If there is an inquiry
into student financial hardship, no doubt tuition fees can be part of that
equation, but today we are talking about the principle that higher education

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During the election campaign, the Scottish
Liberal Democrats, the Scottish nationalist party-[M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font><strong>:</strong>
"The Scottish National party."]-the Scottish National party, the Scottish
Conservative party, the Greens, the Scottish Socialist party and Dennis
Canavan all campaigned against tuition fees. We went round the houses,
round the campuses-some of us even wore the tee-shirt-to campaign for the
abolition of tuition fees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unfortunately, after the electorate spoke
and voted a majority of members for the abolition of tuition fees, the
Liberal Democrats agreed to an inquiry in their willingness to cook up
a deal. It can certainly be argued that an inquiry into student hardship
is necessary, but the Liberal Democrats created a fudge by bringing tuition
fees into the remit of that inquiry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Student hardship is undoubtedly a problem,
and it will undoubtedly get worse.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD):
</strong>Mr Monteith talks about the creation of student hardship and the principle
of free higher education. Has he conveniently forgotten that it was a Tory
Government that introduced 13 different measures to abolish free higher
education, and that it was a Tory Government that created student hardship
by abandoning the principle of free higher education during the 18 years
the Tories were in power?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>Can Mr Lyon give one
of those 13 examples?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

then come up with proposals as to how that could best be done-there will
undoubtedly be different views on that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Conservative party has already published
a bill in the House of Lords and we have lodged motions on how tuition
fees can be abolished. There is no doubt that there are ways of abolishing
tuition fees to people's satisfaction. This amendment makes it clear that
student hardship requires an inquiry, but that free higher education is
a principle that this party-and many other parties here-should not give
up on. We can end tuition fees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Minister for Parliament (Iain
Smith): </strong>Mr Monteith keeps referring to his party's commitment to the
principle of free higher education. I wonder whether he recognises this
quotation of a certain Mr Stephen Dorrell:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The student goes through higher education
and receives enhanced earning potential as a result and so should be expected
to contribute towards the cost of that education"-[<i>Official Report,
House of Commons, 16 March 1998; </i>Vol 308, c 976<i>.</i>]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Does that sound like the principle of free
higher education?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>No, it sounds like
Stephen Dorrell. Our party has embraced devolution and is quite at home
with the concept of creating policy for our party and our electorate in
Scotland. We are free to make our own decisions. I hope that members of
Mr Smith's party will be free to make their own decisions and to vote for
the abolition of tuition fees. It is worth reminding the Liberal Democrats
that in the past month their share of the vote has fallen from 13 to 9
per cent.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The abolition of tuition fees is non-negotiable.
We should not be discussing whether tuition fees should be abolished in
the future, once they have been shown to cause hardship. We should be discussing
abolishing tuition fees today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Where do all these fees stop? Will fees
be introduced for hospital care-possibly means-tested to make the Government

study in higher education want us to take the latter road.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is clear from the briefings of the
Association of University Teachers and the Committee of Scottish Higher
Education Principals. I quote from the AUT briefing:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It will be all too easy to get it wrong-to
rush into a quick fix that creates new anomalies or leaves a massive hole
in the Parliament's budget. Getting it wrong will discredit the Parliament
and disrupt higher education. Getting it right will take a bit longer but
in the process we can prove that the new Parliament offers a new, more
robust approach to resolving difficult issues and building a real consensus."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The AUT, COSHEP and-as we have mentioned-the
National Union of Students in Scotland all recognise the complexities of
the issues. They have argued consistently for an informed debate that takes
into account all the available evidence and recognises that what seems
like a simple and straightforward solution is rarely that. If this Parliament
genuinely believes in the new politics, it must put aside short-term party
political expediency and support the establishment of a committee of inquiry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In setting up a committee of inquiry, we
must be clear about the objectives that we want it to address. Let me suggest
two objectives that I believe should be paramount. First, nothing must
be done that threatens the world-class reputation of Scottish higher education.
That reputation has already been mentioned by Mr Wallace and is well deserved.
Scotland's academics rank third in the world for the number of research
publications per head of the population. Scottish universities attract
students from more than 100 countries. That means that if the committee
of inquiry recommends additional financial support, it must do so as part
of a package of additional resources for higher education. To do otherwise
would be a disaster.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

The AUT reports that there is a 36 per cent slippage in pay. Next week
the Bett commission on pay in higher education will report. It is already
clear that it will recommend significant increases, but universities and
colleges will not be able to meet those recommendations without increased
financial support.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is critical is that greater financial
support for students cannot be bought by reducing support for institutions.
In helping students to pay the bill, we must not reduce the value of what
they buy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

you do so quickly, please?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Jackson: </strong>The second objective
is to broaden participation. It cannot be acceptable that 80 per cent of
children from social class 1 go to university, but only 14 per cent of
social class 5 do. It is not a new problem. It is as old as higher education.
One of the great disappointments of the expansion of higher education in
the 1990s is that the proportion of students from the lower socio-economic
classes has changed little.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a rapidly changing information age,
Scotland needs to maximise the intellectual skills and potential of all
its people if it is to survive and prosper in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
Scotland's education system has fundamental strengths that are well suited
to such a rapidly changing future if-and only if-we build on them and provide
an education service not only for Scotland, but for the world.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The greater the financial or other barriers
placed before our people, the greater our failure as legislators will be.
It is to the shame of the Westminster Government that it has imposed tuition
fees on the Scottish higher education system at a time when other countries,
such as Ireland, have abolished tuition fees to encourage expansion of
and access to education for their citizens. It is all the more ironic,
as the Westminster Cabinet ministers who abolished student grants and imposed
tuition fees and student loans were the people who benefited from the grants
system. I am thoroughly ashamed that we have now imposed on a generation
debt burdens and barriers that were not in place when many of us went to
university.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Today's decision on tuition fees has important
consequences for the Scottish economy. The McNicoll report published by
the Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals two years ago identified
that students from the rest of the United Kingdom contribute more than
&pound;110 million annually to our higher education system. In addition,
each year they contribute more than &pound;100 million in off-campus expenditure
on Scottish goods and services. Therefore, any fall in applications to
Scottish higher education establishments from students from other parts
of the United Kingdom will have a considerable impact on the wider Scottish
economy, as well as striking at the heart of our traditional system of
four-year honours degrees and endangering the breadth of courses on offer
to Scottish students at our universities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is patently unfair that English, Welsh
and Northern Irish applicants to Scottish universities are expected to
pay up to &pound;1,000 more than Scottish or European Union students from
the same background for exactly the same course. That means that a student
at a Scottish university, from St Ives or St Albans, will have to pay &pound;1,000
more than a student from St Etienne or St Andrews. Such discrimination
against English, Welsh and Northern Irish students has to go-and now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

paid an average of only 23 per cent of the total fee. That figure has now
risen to 45 per cent. Top-up fees were also ruled out, but will now be

all that is possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

it today, that the committee of inquiry will report to this Parliament
by the end of this year-that is practical politics. We will have an opportunity
to vote on the issue in the new year, and we will abolish fees for the
next academic year at the first practical opportunity.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>When
the issue of tuition fees was debated in the House of Commons, I voted
against them; I voted in favour of the restoration of student grants, especially
for students from low-income families. Perhaps that is part of the reason
why I am sitting in this part of the chamber rather than with Labour members.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During the recent election campaign, I
gave commitments on how I would vote on tuition fees and I also expressed
the hope that this Parliament would take a far more enlightened view than
did the House of Commons. However, that remains to be seen. In recent years,
the House of Commons has, in many respects, been trying to turn the clock
back with regard to opportunities in higher education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">People who try to defend tuition fees tell
us that about half the students in Scotland are exempt from paying them.
I am not sure about that. I am told that the Scottish Office expects that
figure to drop, so that in all probability in the next academic session
the majority of students will face tuition fees. The current threshold
shows that parents with a residual income of approximately &pound;17,000
must pay fees for their sons or daughters at college or university. Parents
with a residual income of &pound;17,000 are not rich in this day and age.
Nevertheless, we must admit that if we were to abolish tuition fees full
stop, the main beneficiaries would be parents with high incomes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is why we cannot examine tuition fees
in isolation. The abolition of tuition fees must be accompanied by the
restoration of grants-for students from low-income families in particular.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive's response is to set up some
kind of inquiry into tuition fees. I admit that there might be a case for
an inquiry into the level of maintenance grants, relative to income, but
we must bear it in mind that the majority of members of this Parliament
were elected on clear-cut commitments to abolish tuition fees-no ifs or
buts or maybes; we were elected to this place to abolish tuition fees,
and people outside want us, as members of this Parliament, to do that at
the earliest opportunity.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sadly, the only party that did not have
a commitment in its manifesto to abolish tuition fees was the Labour party.
That is rather ironic, because the Labour party used to be the party of
free education. However, new Labour has become&nbsp;</font></td>

I, perhaps along with many other people, suspect that when the partnership
agreement was being negotiated, people down in London were attempting to
pull the strings. I am not opposed in principle to coalition, and I accept
that the Liberal Democrats could not seriously expect every aspect of their
manifesto to be included in the partnership agreement. However, I think
that they sold themselves short-and sold the people of Scotland short-by
not sticking to their principles, given that in the recent election those
principles were supported by the majority of the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I see the demand for an inquiry as a fudge.
We have had inquiries-we have had Dearing, we have had Garrick-and we can
see the results. The latest figures show that applications are down by
8.4 per cent at Stirling, 7.4 per cent at St Andrews, 8.4 per cent at Napier,
6.5 per cent at Glasgow, 5 per cent at Edinburgh and 5.9 per cent at Dundee.
The students are voting with their feet. Unless we change the policy, that
trend will continue, meaning that fewer of our people, particularly our
young people, will have the opportunity to benefit from higher education,
as many-probably most-members of this Parliament have.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

for the mounting debt that they created by successive measures to reduce
the levels of grant: abolishing the special grant for art students, abolishing
the repeat-year grant, and freezing student grants for two years running.
It is dishonest of them not to take responsibility for the debt that students
now face.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>As a former art student
who applied for the art grant, I can testify that the art grant was used
for materials, not living expenses. Its abolition is not, therefore, a
contributory factor in student hardship.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Pauline McNeill: </strong>I have to correct
Mr Monteith on that. He is correct in saying that the special grant was
for materials, but I made representations to Mr John MacKay, the Scottish
Office minister responsible at the time. I pleaded with him not to abolish
the grant because it was such a minute amount of public expenditure. Mr
Monteith's Government still said no.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This September, the student maintenance
level for those living away from home is &pound;3,635 a year, a weekly
expenditure of &pound;69.90. Given that the average student rent in Scotland
is &pound;45 a week, that leaves &pound;24.90 for living costs or &pound;3.56
a day. That is more or less what most of us spend on a cup of coffee and
a newspaper at the Scottish Parliament. That is the average amount that
students are left with to buy books, clothes and stationery. It is no wonder
that the drop-out rate is quite high.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Pauline McNeill: </strong>In just a minute.
It is important to note that there has not been a review of the level of
student maintenance in modern times. No body or Government department has
considered what students need to survive on. Whether we support a grant
or a loan system, we cannot continue to pluck figures from the air. For
students to survive, the figures must be based on real costs. Mr Wallace
mentioned particular concern over mature students.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

be examining hardship, which the amendment would allow us to do? Does she
agree that the fees element adds very much to hardship and contributes
to the figures that she has mentioned in her speech?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Pauline McNeill: </strong>It seems I will
not get to talk about it. The reason why I think student tuition fees should
be included in our review is that we have all failed to address the issue
of access to those from working-class families. We cannot put our hands
on our hearts and say that this country has found the fundamental reasons
why we do not have higher participation rates. I support the motion and,
within that, I support the inclusion of tuition fees. I do not think that
we can afford to exclude &pound;40 million of public expenditure before
we even begin to address the question of access. That is why the second
review, as contained in the motion, is the most important.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>The issue concerns the principle of free education. Today, we
are seeking to make a start on re-establishing free education, first, by
abolishing tuition fees. Every member-Mike Rumbles-has the opportunity
to do that today. We all know that tuition fees are a deeply unpopular
measure introduced by the Labour Government. It was Pauline's Government
that abolished the remnants of the maintenance grant, in case she has forgotten.
Tuition fees are unpopular not just with those who have to pay them, but
with 65 per cent of people who have expressed, in recent polls, their opposition
to them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Support for their abolition has come from
various quarters. Only this morning, we received a deputation from Dundee
City Council, which, last Monday, passed a motion in support of the widespread
campaign of opposition to tuition fees. It is clearly the will of the people
to abolish tuition fees. They elected 73 of us to do just that. We are
supposed to be here to represent their wishes: we can do that today by
supporting the amendment. Many members benefited from free education. Perhaps
they would not be here today if they had not done so, yet they wish to
deny that opportunity to others.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The impact of the attacks on free education
can already be seen with the 6 per cent drop in university applications.
To argue, as Labour members often do, that abolition of tuition fees benefits
the well-off is utter nonsense. Over the past few weeks we have heard a

intend to make one myself, but I was the first person in my family to have

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It sounds crass to talk about abolishing
tuition fees as benefiting the better-off when we are earning a minimum
of &pound;40,000 a year and many ministers are earning &pound;70,000 to
&pound;80,000. Jack McConnell's household income is probably more than
all of ours collectively. We talk nevertheless about better-off people.
Are they the clerical worker and the joiner with a joint income of &pound;17,000,
who have to pay tuition fees? Is it the spouse who earns &pound;14,000
and who has to contribute to their partner's tuition fees? Or is it the
postman and the nurse, who pay full tuition fees? Are these the better-off
people that we are talking about? I do not think so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The amendment allows us to go further than
abolishing tuition fees because it gives us the opportunity to re-establish
a free education system-and we have to look at student maintenance to do
that. The First Minister talked yesterday of the need to achieve a Scottish
education system of excellent quality. The state of an education system
says a lot about a society. I would have thought that the message that
we want to send out is that Scotland has an education system that is free
at the point of delivery, not one based on ability to pay. The quickest
way to abolish tuition fees is not to have an inquiry but to vote for the
amendment today, which I urge members to do so that we can begin to return
Scotland to a system of free education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

provides 1,400 of those places.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As members will know, further education
colleges are an important gateway to second-chance and lifelong learning.
As someone who benefited from that second chance, I can testify that it
was never given free. People who went to night school paid to go there
to get themselves out of the shipyards. People who went on plumbing, welding,
car maintenance and other courses paid or got their employers to pay. Principles

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">just what that
principle means for the people of Scotland, not least for those in our
own ranks who have benefited from a free education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In this country, we have a great tradition
of learning. We send more young people into higher education than any other
part of the UK. We believe that access to education should be based on
the ability to learn and not on the ability to pay.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tuition fees and the abolition of the student
maintenance grant-twin issues that are of equal importance-have ripped
the heart out of that principle. The effects are already there for all
to see. Applications are down by nearly 6 per cent since last year. I have
heard it said that, because the biggest drop is among low-income students
who are exempt from tuition fees, that makes it all right. It does not
make it all right. It strengthens the argument for a review of student
funding and financial support, but it is not an argument for tuition fees.
In any event, the figures show an above-average drop among those at the
lower end of the scale, the people who have to pay a proportion of the
tuition fees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In short, Mr Presiding Officer, but in
truth, we are pricing our students out of education. The Government's manifesto
commitment to create extra places in higher education should be considered
in the light of that fact. Based on present evidence, all that the Government
will be doing is creating a lot of empty seats in lecture theatres across
Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second principle that is at stake in
this debate is the principle of democratic accountability. In the long
years and varied arguments that have preceded the establishment of this
Parliament, the one theme that kept emerging again and again was accountability.
This Parliament was to be about bringing politics closer to the people
and making politicians more accountable for their actions and decisions,
forcing them to keep their promises. That theme emerged earlier this week,
albeit in a different context, when Charles Kennedy entered the Liberal
Democrat leadership race. He said that politicians must reconnect with
the people. He was absolutely right and, in this Parliament, we in Scotland
have the opportunity to do just that. However, if Liberal Democrat members-and
I make no apology for singling them out-do not vote for John Swinney's
amendment this afternoon, they will blow that opportunity.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

in this chamber today if Liberal members do not vote for John Swinney's
amendment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It has been said, before and during this
debate, that the establishment of a committee is the quickest way to secure
abolition. As Mr Swinney has already pointed out, that begs the question
why that was not the manifesto commitment; it is utter nonsense. Putting
aside the fact that this morning Mr McLeish would not commit the Executive
to carrying out the committee's recommendations, if we had a committee
and it decided to abolish fees, that would bring us back to the point we
are at today: that is, the point of calling on the Executive to bring forward
proposals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This afternoon, we have a choice. We can
honour the 6 May verdict of the Scottish people, or we can choose to ignore
it. I put it to the Liberal Democrat members of this Parliament that they
will ignore the wishes of the Scottish people at their peril. I support
the amendment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning (Henry McLeish): </strong>I would like to build some harmony and unity
out of what seems to have been a fairly disparate debate. We have election
campaigns and politics is about seeing through commitments. It is also
about looking at issues in their wider context.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The remarkable thing about Jim Wallace's
motion is that it does not ask any party to concede its position. The Liberal
Democrats forcibly pointed out that they are sticking with the issue-they
want abolition. A very important point of practical politics was also raised
by a Liberal member-there must&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>Mr McLeish has set out

the abolition of tuition fees, will he guarantee that the Labour party

[M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>: "Oh."] The SNP simply does not like being
challenged on the wisdom of its position. It may want to get hooked on
that hypothetical question, but let us go further to explore what Scotland
wants. The SNP talks much about being in the vanguard of the people, but
the National Union of Students, which is committed to the abolition of
tuition fees, says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"NUS Scotland has supported the establishment

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Seeking a quick fix on this issue would
be a betrayal of Scotland's aspirations for a new politics in which everyone
can have a say, not just party leaders meeting behind closed doors."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The emphasis is that it would be arrogant
for us simply to say, without looking at the consequences of the action,
"Let us take an issue. Let us spend &pound;40 million to &pound;60 million
of taxpayers' money." Today, I am saying, "Do not concede your position."
Let us agree on that. Let us listen to the rest of Scotland, which wants
to be involved in the debate. Are the SNP and the Tories going to say,
"No, we do not want to listen to COSHEP, the NUS or anyone else. We want
to go our way without due consideration"?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>In the spirit of

to meet the AUT, which has grave concerns about higher education. I am
willing to consider Mr Sheridan's invitation, diaries permitting.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What an amazing degree of consensus there
is in the chamber this afternoon. I have heard people talk about widening
access and about student hardship and maintenance grants. We have also
heard about part-time students, mature students, colleges, bursaries, fees
and fee waivers. As we are involved in the totality of funding, is it not
prudent-without conceding our positions-for us not only to look at the
matter in the context of student funding, but to ask, as the AUT does,
"What about the teaching infrastructure? What about the quality of higher
and further education? What about the fact that &pound;493 million is being
injected into Scotland's higher and further education over the next three
years?" I tell my colleagues in this chamber that this issue is too serious
for us to allow ourselves to get bogged down; we should not ignore the
education community and the wishes of many members and just state that
we will go forward with our plans.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish:
</strong>No, I want to press on. Pauline McNeill made a point in which, historically,
Scotland has had a big interest. Remember the Robbins committee of the
1960s? We wanted access to be widened and we have made tremendous progress.
Pauline McNeill's point concerned skilled manual workers, partly skilled
workers and unskilled workers-socio-economic groups 3, 4 and 5.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Socio-economic group 3-manual workers-represents
21 per cent of the population but only 17 per cent of people in higher
and further education. Those figures are not too bad, but the partly skilled
group represents 16 per cent of the population but only 9 per cent of people
in higher and further education. The unskilled group represents 6 per cent
of the population but only 2 per cent of those in higher and further education.
If we want to use the cloak of poverty and social injustice, let us remember
those figures.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The mythical days of free higher education
probably never existed in post-war Britain. They certainly did not exist
in pre-war Britain. I would rather take a principled position on the review
committee and say that Scotland believes in social justice and in widening
access-Scotland wants to examine how the abolition of tuition fees would
impact on the objectives that we all share. It is a great aspiration to
be able to say that not only can we stick to our position on tuition fees,
but-for the better interest of higher and further education-we can look
at the big picture, which I have tried, briefly, to pinpoint.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing
in the chamber about betrayals and principles. I like to think that we
all have principles. Are there any charlatans here who do not believe in
what they are doing? I do not think so. We must try to keep a moderate
tone.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we are clear, if we feel principled
and we have knowledge of a particular matter, we should put that matter
to an expert group to examine. I emphasise a point that Jim Wallace made:
this is not a fix and there are no constraints on the committee. I agree
with Dennis Canavan: if the committee wants to consider maintenance grants,
we should let it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The chamber has serious difficulties and
differences on a point of principle. That is fine, but we should not disguise
the fact that, if we have a review committee, we can explore every avenue.
The time for decision making will be when the report is presented to the
chamber and to the Executive. If we agree to the motion, I will speak to
all the Opposition parties over the next two or three days. We must have
an inquiry that we can be proud of and that the chamber can support. We
must ensure that widening access is the kernel of our approach to higher
and further education in&nbsp;</font></td>
