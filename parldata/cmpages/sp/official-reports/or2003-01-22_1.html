<P ALIGN="CENTER">[THE PRESIDING OFFICER<em> opened the meeting at 14:30</em>]</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Time 
for Reflection</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel): 
</STRONG>To lead our time for reflection this afternoon, we welcome Mrs Dianna 
Wolfson, who was formerly head teacher at the Jewish primary school in Glasgow.</P><P><strong>Dianna 
Wolfson (Former head teacher, the Jewish primary school, Glasgow): </strong>About 
a year ago, I translated some articles from French to English. I was fascinated 
by the subject matter: the first musician in history, Jubal, to whom reference 
is made in Genesis 4:21. He is credited with inventing the harp and the flute. 
As a shepherd, he used the instruments as tools of his trade, either soothing 
the cattle to help them graze quietly or stimulating them to move on. He was in 
complete harmony with nature.</P><P>For some reason, that made me think how I 
react to music. When I am abroad, the sound of Scottish music evokes nostalgia 
for home. Music can speak to the heart. As a second-generation Scot on my father's 
side, I am amazed at how easy it is to feel part of the culture and tradition 
of this country. If I hear a Scottish accent when I am waiting at a foreign airport, 
I need to speak to that person. Who are you? Where are you from? As if someone 
from Inverness is going to know me!</P><P>As national Holocaust memorial day is 
almost upon us and the national event will be here in our own capital, I reflect 
on the history of anti-Semitism that stretches back to the Bible. Set in the 4<SUP>th</SUP> 
century before the common era, the book of Esther, which Jews read on the festival 
of Purim, records that Haman, who would have been the equivalent of the First 
Minister of his day, said to King Ahasuerus of Persia:</P><P>&quot;There is a 
certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces 
of your realm. Their laws are different from every other people's. They do not 
observe the King's laws; therefore it is not fitting for the King to tolerate 
them. If it pleases the King let it be recorded that they be destroyed.&quot;</P><P>Echoes 
of the Wannsee conference.</P><P>The Jews of Germany played their part in all 
aspects of civil life. They loved German music, poetry and art. Yet we know what 
was to be their tragic fate. The media of the day ensured that they </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17176">17176</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>were vilified, that the loyal, law-abiding citizens were seen as pariahs&#151;Untermenschen, 
lowlier even than animals. It would all have turned out so differently had placards 
proclaimed: &quot;One Germany, many cultures&quot;. We are fortunate that we live 
in a society that values the worth of every individual.</P><P>I pray that we can 
all live together in harmony in the Scotland that is dear to people of many faiths 
and cultures, all of us proud of being Scots and at the same time proud of our 
own traditions and heritage. I pray that your deliberations will continue to help 
realise this goal. Sir David, I thank you for the privilege of addressing the 
Parliament today. [<em>Applause.</em>]</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17177">17177</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

one day. For today, members should have with them copies of the Land Reform (Scotland)

that have been selected for today's debate, and the groupings of amendments.</P><P>A 
new marshalled list and groupings will be published for tomorrow. They will include 
three additional amendments that were lodged on Monday, which I have selected 
for tomorrow's debate but which do not appear in the list that members have before 
them. As usual, I will allow extended voting periods of two minutes for the first

Mr Canavan to return to his point of order.</P><P><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>I 
note that my amendment 212 does not appear on the list of amendments that you 
selected. The amendment was lodged on Friday of last week, before the deadline, 
but did not appear in Monday's business bulletin among the list of amendments 
published therein. My office was informed that that was due to a mistake by the 
clerk, and that the amendment was submitted in time. Has the non-selection of 
my amendment got anything to do with the alleged lateness, which was certainly 
not through any fault of mine or of my staff?</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: 
</strong>I entirely accept that last point, Mr Canavan&#151;it was not your fault. 
Your amendment was published in yesterday's business bulletin. It had been omitted 
in error on Monday, but I can assure you that it was among the amendments that 
my two colleagues and I considered very carefully on Monday afternoon and evening. 
I am sorry that it has not been selected but, as you know, I do not give reasons 
for the selection of amendments. I can assure you that the fact that your amendment 
was not selected had nothing to do with the fact that there was a misprint.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17179">17179</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Section 1&#151;Access rights</STRONG></P><P> <strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_6"></A>The 
Presiding Officer: </STRONG>Let us proceed with the first group. Amendment 166, 
in the name of Ross Finnie, is grouped with amendments 176 and 211.</P><P><strong>The 
Minister for Environment and Rural Development (Ross Finnie): </strong>For information&#151;I

promise not to take seven and a half hours to deal with any individual&#151;[<em>Interruption.</em>]</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>Order. I am sorry to stop you right away, minister. 
This is a complex procedure, which is not helped if there are conversations going 
on around the chamber. We really have to concentrate on this.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_13"></A>Allan 
Wilson: </strong>There was a considerable amount of debate at both stage 1 and 
stage 2 about the purpose of part 1 of the bill. There are those who argue that 
there is an existing common law right of access to land, and that the purpose 
of the bill is to enshrine that right in statute. On the other hand, there are 
those who argue there is no such common law right of access; that trespass is 
part of the law of Scotland; and that access to land is currently granted only 
with the explicit or implied consent of the owner. At least some members of the 
Justice 2 Committee share the former view. As we have explained at stage 1 and 
stage 2, the Executive is satisfied that trespass is part of the law of Scotland.</P><P>It 
was to get away from that confusion that we decided to legislate. This is the 
purpose of the bill: to establish clear and unambiguous rights of responsible 
access to land. As members will recall, the decision to legislate followed advice 
from Scottish Natural Heritage, which was based on the views of the access forum. 
Let me quote from SNH's advice:</P><P>&quot;the existing law may be understood 
by lawyers but it is not clear to members of the public, who are deterred from 
exercising reasonable access by uncertainty about their rights and by the fear 
of, or previous experience of, confrontation with owners and land managers who 
in their turn have difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of irresponsible 
or provocative behaviour by the public&quot;.</P><P>In other words, no one is 
quite sure where they </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17180">17180</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>stand.</P><P>The recommendation of SNH and the access forum was to cut across 
the confusion about the current law and to establish new rights of access to land 
and water for informal recreation and passage. The recommendation was not in favour 
of legislation to clarify the existing law. The access forum specifically rejected 
that approach. It stated:</P><P>&quot;Above all, the Forum believes that clarifying 
the law in this way would not address the fundamental weaknesses of the law that 
have been identified and would not help the Government to meet its commitment 
to give people greater opportunity to enjoy the countryside. The Forum agreed, 
therefore, to drop this option.&quot;</P><P>I agree entirely with that conclusion. 
The purpose of the bill is to establish new rights of responsible access. For 
that reason, the bill as introduced opened with the clear statement:</P><P>&quot;Everyone 
has the rights created by this Part of this Act.&quot;</P><P>As I said at stage 
2, I believe that that statement accurately encompassed the purpose of the bill. 
However, the Justice 2 Committee took the view that the word &quot;created&quot; 
should be replaced by &quot;secured&quot;. As I understand it, at least part of 
the thinking behind the amendment was that the bill should be about securing existing 
rights of access, whatever those might be.</P><P>As I have explained, I do not 
consider that to be the proper purpose of the bill. First, such an approach would 
run counter to the advice that was given by SNH and the access forum. Secondly, 
instead of cutting across the current confusion and uncertainty, it would simply 
perpetuate that unsatisfactory state of affairs. Thirdly&#151;and perhaps most 
important&#151;there is a risk that a court could determine that the bill does 
no more than attempt to regulate rights that do not exist. There is a real danger 
that the bill would achieve nothing. I cannot believe that anyone in the chamber 
wishes that.</P><P>For those reasons, I have lodged amendments to the first line 
of the bill. It is important that the bill is clearly seen to establish new statutory 
rights of responsible access. As the bill states, those new rights do not diminish 
or replace existing rights of access. Rightly, in my view, the bill says nothing 
about the current legal position in respect of access. What it does is establish 
clear and unambiguous rights of access that will provide the public with the confidence 
to go out and enjoy the countryside with a firm understanding of where they can 
and cannot go. That clarity will also benefit landowners, who will know exactly 
what the public can and cannot do on the land.</P><P>This bill is the opportunity 
to create in Scotland a modern approach to access that meets in a balanced way 
the needs both of the public and of owners and managers of land. It is important 
that </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17181">17181</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>we get that right. For that reason, I commend amendment 166 to the chamber.</P><P>Amendment 
211, in the name of Stewart Stevenson, would have the effect of inserting the 
word &quot;statutory&quot; after &quot;establish&quot; in the long title and mirrors 
the amendment that we propose to the first line of the bill. Although all rights 
that an act establishes are necessarily statutory rights, I am prepared to accept 
amendment 211 in the interests of consistency. I intend to not move amendment 
176 and to support amendment 211.</P><P>I move amendment 166.</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>We are starting on a note of harmony.</P><P><strong>Stewart 
Stevenson (Banff and Buchan) (SNP): </strong>I thank the minister for his gracious 
acceptance of my amendment 211. Our shared objective is to open up the countryside 
to responsible access. At a later stage, the Scottish National Party will criticise 
certain elements of the bill for their lack of ambition, but in respect of access 
the bill comes close to striking a reasonable balance.</P><P>It is true that in 
its deliberations after taking evidence the Justice 2 Committee came to the conclusion 
that although there is a law of trespass&#151;an act dealing with the matter was 
passed in the 1880s&#151;there is no criminal offence associated with access. 
The common man and woman of Scotland assert the right to roam and to take access 
to land, and have done so for many years.</P><P>The bill and amendment 166 simply 
say either that we are creating new rights in statute or that we are securing 
the ones that we have. In the light of the minister's gracious acceptance of amendment 
211 and of the fact that we will have many other interesting things to debate 
in other groupings, I will leave it at that and thank the minister.</P><P>14:45</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>Thank you. You will in fact be moving amendment 211 
right at the tail end of tomorrow.</P><P><strong>Pauline McNeill (Glasgow Kelvin) 
(Lab): </strong>I support amendment 211 in the name of Stewart Stevenson, having 
lodged a similar amendment. I am pleased that the minister has accepted amendment 
211, because I think that it is consistent with amendment 166.</P><P>The Justice 
2 Committee rejected the word &quot;create&quot; and favoured the word &quot;secure&quot;, 
as we thought that it was consistent with the position that we took in our stage 
1 report, which is that there is no common law of trespass. We have a </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17182">17182</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>longstanding disagreement with the Executive, the Law Society of Scotland and 
others on that matter. However, amendment 166 is a good suggestion and it provides 
a good position for the Executive to take, because the word &quot;statutory&quot; 
simply reflects the legal position that we have just now. The amendment does not 
prevent those members who support the Justice 2 Committee's position from continuing 
to hold that view and it does not prevent those who support the Executive's interpretation 
of the law of trespass from holding that view.</P><P>I still support the Tom Johnson 
position of 1942, which is that there is no law of trespass. There is a presumption 
of the right to roam in Scotland, but I support amendments 166 and 211. I commend 
the Executive for its sensible approach.</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: 
</strong>Before I call the next speaker I appeal again for conversations in the 
chamber to be limited to the bill. Any other conversations can take place in the 
coffee lounge, because there will be a two-minute break for divisions. Please 
let us have as much quiet as possible.</P><P><strong>Bill Aitken (Glasgow) (Con): 
</strong>I regret to perhaps introduce a note of controversy into the proceedings, 
but amendment 166 encapsulates the difference between the Conservative party's 
viewpoint and the viewpoints held by other parties in the Parliament.</P><P>In 
the Conservative view, part 1 of the bill is largely unnecessary. Those who wish 
to access the countryside responsibly have been able to do so for years, almost 
invariably without let or hindrance. Although there might have been the odd local 
difficulty from time to time, when witnesses to the Justice 2 Committee were urged 
to be specific, as opposed to relating the apocryphal, there was little to suggest 
that land managers sought to frustrate those who wish to walk through Scotland's 
countryside and hills.</P><P>Some of the attitudes that exist beggar belief. To 
listen to some members of the Parliament speaking on this matter when it was previously 
debated, one would have thought that land managers had been producing mantraps 
to prevent people accessing the land.</P><P>The plain fact is that common sense 
has prevailed for many years with regard to access to the countryside. Just as 
there is very little evidence to suggest that ramblers or others have at any time 
behaved irresponsibly, there is a similar dearth of evidence to suggest that land 
managers have attempted to deny them access.</P><P>The problem is that by seeking 
to legislate, problems can be created where none previously existed. In Yorkshire 
parlance, &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot; The entire part 1 of the 
bill is living </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17183">17183</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>testimony to the Executive's obsession with legislating on and interfering 
in every aspect of Scottish life.</P><P>Despite having taken evidence from a number 
of erudite sources, the question of the law of access and trespass remains undoubtedly 
vague. Pauline McNeill, the deputy minister and Stewart Stevenson were right to 
correct that problem. The most recent case law is 100 years old and relates to 
a hackney carriage entering land owned by some long-defunct railway company. The 
obvious and logical conclusion that one must draw is that if there had been problems, 
there would have been litigation. The fact that there has been no litigation is 
evidence that there is no need to establish statutory rights. The legal concept 
of the reasonable man should have prevailed. Unfortunately, the Executive is less 
than reasonable.</P><P>It is inevitable that the introduction of such legislation 
will create problems. This part of the bill will simply make lawyers rich and 
judges famous and it will bring ridicule on the law of Scotland. The Executive 
must consider the matter seriously and must leave the people of Scotland to behave 
as adults, as they have behaved for many years. There have been no significant 
problems. Why interfere with something that works?</P><P><strong>Fergus Ewing 
(Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP): </strong>I hope that it is not out 
of order to begin by saying that, following my father's recent death, my family 
and I much appreciate the support that we have had from all members of all parties.</P><P>It 
gives me great pleasure to support the principle of a statutory right of access. 
The current law is undoubtedly as clear as mud. Therefore, for the Scottish Parliament 
to bring clarity where previously there was only confusion is an excellent act.</P><P>It 
is interesting that although the first Conservative speaker said that the existing 
law is vague, he also said that there was no need to end that vagueness. I suspect 
that we will hear many more such contradictions. Bill Aitken argued that there 
was no need to create a statutory right of access because no one had gone to court.</P><P><strong>Phil 
Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>On a point of order, Presiding Officer. 
I make my point of order in a reasonable fashion. It was an omission for Fergus 
Ewing not to have declared an interest. As a lawyer, he will obviously be affected 
by the bill, given what Bill Aitken said.</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: 
</strong>It is not necessary for Fergus Ewing to declare an interest.</P><P><strong>Fergus 
Ewing: </strong>I had no intention of failing to declare an interest. Contrary 
to what Bill Aitken </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17184">17184</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>said, although I am a lawyer, I assure members that I have no expectation of 
becoming rich as a result of the bill.</P><P>I should perhaps also declare that, 
for about 15 years, I was a member of a mountain rescue team. I know that, in 
contrast to the Conservative party, that team will be delighted by the establishment 
of a statutory right of access.</P><P>If Bill Aitken's argument is that there 
have been no bad landowners over the years and that no one has tried to stop folk 
having access to our hills, all I can say is that he must have been in Glasgow 
city chambers for far too long. The reason for the lack of litigation might be 
that people who have been prevented from getting access to our hills and mountains 
might have taken the not unreasonable position of not wanting to make lawyers 
rich by litigating on the issue.</P><P>I understand that Ross Finnie's amendment 
176 is not being moved, but I am delighted to support his amendment 166 and Stewart 
Stevenson's amendment 211, which bring clarity where there has been utter confusion.</P><P><strong>George 
Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD): </strong>I would like to add the Liberal Democrats' 
support for amendments 166 and 211. Bill Aitken said that the law was not broken, 
so there was no need to fix it. I disagree with that point of view. For many years, 
there has been a dispute about whether there is a law of trespass in Scotland 
or whether there is a right to roam. The fact that the bill will create a statutory 
right of access once and for all should be welcomed by all sides in the debate.</P><P>During 
the Justice 2 Committee's deliberations, it became clear that there were arguments 
on both sides about whether there was a law of trespass in Scotland. The Law Society 
of Scotland made it clear that there is a law of trespass in Scotland, which is 
extremely difficult for landowners to enforce. If landowners wish to stop individuals 
from roaming over their land, they need to seek an interdict to do so.</P><P>I 
support the Law Society's view and I welcome the bill's creation of a statutory 
right of access for everyone in Scotland who wishes to roam over Scotland's land. 
I support the Executive's amendment 166 and Stewart Stevenson's amendment 211.</P><P><strong>Scott 
Barrie (Dunfermline West) (Lab): </strong>The comments of preceding speakers have 
already illustrated the lines of the different parties. I, too, speak in favour 
of amendments 166 and 211. I was the member who lodged amendment 19 at stage 2, 
which was successful in replacing the word &quot;created&quot; with the word &quot;secured&quot;. 
The Executive is to be congratulated on lodging amendment 166, which will provide 
a better wording than that which the Justice 2 Committee </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17185">17185</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>established at stage 2.</P><P>The bill will provide a statutory right of access 
but, as Pauline McNeill accurately explained, that will in no way eliminate or 
diminish existing common law rights of access. That is an important point. By 
agreeing to amendment 166, I hope that we can get away from the confusion that 
has existed for so long about whether Scotland has a law of trespass. The Executive 
has done well in the wording that it has proposed.</P><P>It is equally important 
that we support Stewart Stevenson's amendment 211, which will ensure that the 
long title accurately reflects what is in the bill. I am glad to see that the 
Executive will support that amendment.</P><P><strong>Mr John Home Robertson (East 
Lothian) (Lab): </strong>There is, of course, a trespass act from the 19<SUP>th</SUP> 
century&#151;the Trespass (Scotland) Act 1865&#151;but it is very restricted, 
as it refers only to camping and the lighting of fires within a certain distance 
of public roads. It has always been commonly understood that pedestrians have 
a right of responsible access to the open countryside of Scotland.</P><P>Contrary 
to what Bill Aitken said, a problem has arisen because, in many parts of Scotland, 
what I describe as new-age landowners have come into rural areas and have sought 
to obstruct that commonly understood public access to the open countryside. Over 
the years, I have had to deal with some quite nasty cases of confrontation, which 
responsible walkers have experienced in the Lammermuir hills on the edge of my 
constituency. I remember raising the issue at Westminster. It would have taken 
years to find a legislative opportunity to get the necessary legislation through 
Parliament down at Westminster.</P><P>It is very good news that this new Scottish 
Parliament is addressing this fundamental issue. Frankly, I do not know or care 
whether we are creating or restoring that right. The important thing is that we 
are establishing what most people believe to be the proper and reasonable position 
of responsible pedestrian access to Scotland's open countryside. That access needs 
to be properly regulated, and it will be regulated by the access code. I am delighted 
that we are taking this step. I strongly support the bill and I support Ross Finnie's 
amendment 166.</P><P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Lab):

<P>&quot;Everyone has the rights secured by this Part of this Act.&quot;</P><P>The 
Scottish Labour party was founded on a demand for law reform: for a local Parliament 
in Scotland with a Scottish Executive; for the minimum wage; and, indeed, for 
prohibition. We may have moved on from prohibition, but the assertions and claims 
that were made when the Scottish Labour party was founded are being realised today.</P><P>I 
also commend the important establishment of the security of rights. Unlike Bill 
Aitken&#151;I am delighted to see that the dividing lines in Scottish politics 
remain&#151;I do not accept the notion that the bill creates uncertainty or that 
it creates work for lawyers. The bill crystallises and improves on existing rights. 
If nothing else, the bill assists in dispensing with the confusion.</P><P>There 
has, of course, been an almost theological divide in Scotland as to whether Scotland 
has a law of trespass, but that should not be the fault line that runs through 
this debate. We see where that fault line lies. It lies with those who are now 
bidding to be the landowners' party, or Laidlaw's party, or whatever they wish 
to call themselves.</P><P>Mr Aitken asked for evidence of instances where people 
have been put off land. Anecdotal evidence is always bad, but I was part of a 
group of parents and children who were turned back from an estate on new year's 
day. It transpired that the people who turned us back were not even the landowners, 
but were simply renting a lodge from the landowner. They thought that that gave 
them the entitlement to turn back people who were exercising a right to roam.</P><P>At 
that stage, the question was whether one should proceed to try and summon the 
police from God knows where. Should one try and proceed to serve an interdict 
while out walking with one's children? Should one bother to take up that time? 
The answer was no. In part&#151;aside from the cost and delay&#151;that explains 
the absence of litigation. People do not like being disrupted, inconvenienced 
or put off when they are only seeking to exercise their responsible right to roam.</P><P>15:00</P><P><strong>Bill 
Aitken: </strong>As Mr Fitzpatrick is a member of the Faculty of Advocates, would 
he suggest that courts should accept the sort of anecdotal evidence that he appears 
to be happy to accept? Is that not indicative of a degree of prejudice on his 
part?</P><P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: </strong>I am always delighted to take 
interventions from Mr Aitken because he always makes the argument for me. It was

<P>evidence he did not like it because it did not fit with his ideological position. 
He therefore finds himself making inane interventions in a serious debate.</P><P>The 
Tories will sit where they sit. The Tories will adopt the stance that they adopt. 
However, the majority of members will welcome the chance to put beyond peradventure 
rights that some thought that they held, and to improve rights for many of Scotland's 
people. We should welcome the fact that everyone's access rights will be secured

166 agreed to.</em></P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>We come to amendment 
61, which Mr Finnie will deal with. To save time, I will not read out all the 
amendments in the group; they are on the marshalled list.</P><P><strong>Ross Finnie: 
</strong>Amendment 62 addresses concerns raised by educational groups that the 
bill as drafted could result in confusion about which group activities fall within 
access rights. For example, a school hillwalking group or a geological society 
outing would clearly be recreational and fall within access rights. However, a 
school geography or biology field trip or a university geology field trip might 
be considered more educational than recreational, and might be deemed to fall 
outwith access rights.</P><P>I accept that the distinction should be clarified 
because it is potentially confusing. Amendment 62 would bring within access rights 
being on or crossing land for the purposes of carrying out a relevant educational 
activity. Amendment 66 would provide a definition of &quot;relevant educational 
activity&quot; as furthering the understanding of natural or cultural heritage. 
Amendments 61, 64, 65 and 86 are consequential on amendment 62.</P><P>Amendments 
66A, 66B and 66C seek to modify the definition of &quot;relevant educational activity&quot;. 
Amendments 66A and 66C would widen the definition to refer to furthering not only 
the understanding of natural or cultural heritage, but the exercise of any activity 
within access rights. I assume that the intention is to ensure that outdoor educational 
courses are included within access rights. However, I am satisfied that the bill 
already provides for such courses. The right to be on land for recreational purposes 
must include being on land when being instructed in such activities as hillcraft 
and map reading. Similarly, a scout leader or other voluntary group leader who 
provides such instruction would come within access rights. If the instructor was 
paid for his or her services, he or she would be within access rights by virtue 
of section 1(2A), which was inserted at stage 2. Accordingly, amendments 66A and 
66C are unnecessary and I hope that they will not be moved.</P><P>Amendment 66B 
appears to intend to bring within access rights people who carry out activities 
to enable or assist other people who are not with </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17190">17190</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>them to further their understanding of natural or cultural heritage. I am not 
clear that the proposed alternative wording would make any real difference to 
the scope of the provisions, but nevertheless I am content to accept amendment 
66B.</P><P>Amendment 66D would remove paragraph (b) of the definition in amendment 
66, which would require that relevant educational activities are</P><P>&quot;not 
carried on for the purposes of deriving a profit directly attributable to the 
carrying on of the activity.&quot;</P><P>I am satisfied that activities carried 
on for profit will be covered by section 1(2A), but I am happy to accept amendment 
66D if it clarifies the situation.</P><P>Amendments 177 and 178, in the name of 
Roseanna Cunningham, seek to extend access rights to artistic and scientific activities 
that are not intended to yield a profit. I am not clear which such artistic activities 
would not be considered to be recreational and therefore already included within 
access rights. Similarly, amateur naturalists, ornithologists and the like would 
already fall within the access rights in the bill as it stands. I assume that 
the intention may be to provide that staff of conservation organisations or other 
bodies, such as Scottish Natural Heritage, should have a right to access land 
for the purposes of, say, survey work. In my view, that would not be appropriate. 
SNH's powers of entry to land are set down in statute. We are satisfied that those 
powers provide SNH with the means of carrying out its duties and that a general 
right of access for such a body to enter any land at any time would not be appropriate 
and I can see no reason why other organisations should have greater access to 
someone's land than official bodies such as SNH. I hope that amendments 177 and 
178 will not be moved.</P><P>Amendment 63 addresses concerns that were raised 
at stage 2, when we lodged amendments to bring within access rights such people 
as mountain guides. The principal amendment was the insertion of section 1(2A). 
However, concerns remained that commercial activities such as professional photography 
would continue to be excluded from access rights and we agreed to look at that 
issue again at stage 3. We have decided against a specific provision to include 
professional photographers and artists within access rights. Instead, amendment 
63 adopts the same approach as an amendment that was lodged by Rhona Brankin at 
stage 2. Amendment 63 would bring within access rights all those commercial activities 
that could also be carried on non-commercially. I accept that that is a fairly 
wide provision, but I hope that such activities will be subject to the general 
requirement that they are conducted responsibly and in line with guidance provided 
in the access code. Amendment 167 is </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17191">17191</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>consequential on Executive amendment 63.</P><P>I move amendment 61.</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>If amendment 167 is agreed to, amendment 178 will 
be pre-empted.</P><P><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP): </strong>The SNP 
intends to vote for the Executive amendments in the group, but we think that some 
aspects need to be clarified. Amendment 177 was lodged because, if amendments 
61 and 62 are agreed to, the public will have a right of access to private land 
for recreational, educational and some commercial purposes, but&#151;arguably&#151;not 
for scientific or artistic purposes.</P><P>The minister asked for examples of 
what we were talking about. Under the scientific heading might fall scientific 
work that is undertaken by several non-governmental organisations and which cannot 
be regarded as educational, recreational or commercial. For example, such work 
could include an NGO monitoring animal migration or the occurrence of pollutants 
in a river or soil.</P><P>As for artistic purposes, the question is arguable, 
but would all artistic work fall within the three categories of educational, recreational 
or commercial activity? I know that that debate cannot really be held in the context 
of land reform, but I assume that we all accept that an argument exists over art 
for art's sake, not primarily for any other purpose. If George Wylie were to decide 
to float another paper boat down the Clyde, would that be a recreational, commercial 
or educational activity? I am not sure. That is what we are considering and I 
am interested in the minister's response.</P><P>I intend to support Dennis Canavan's 
amendment 66A, which is part of the argument about extending clarification, particularly 
on educational visits. Amendment 66A would rectify weaknesses in the Executive's 
amendment 66, which deals with educational visits. Many such visits are not solely 
for the purpose of understanding natural or cultural heritage. They may be aimed 
at educating the public in the practice of skills that are required for various 
activities that have been mentioned, such as hillwalking and horse-riding, or 
in how to exercise access rights responsibly and safely. I assume that we all 
hope that such courses can take place.</P><P>A school might organise a Duke of 
Edinburgh's award trip to the outdoors to practise navigation. Such activities 
must remain within access rights; otherwise, landowners might try to restrict 
them or to argue that they do not fall within the categories in the bill. Failure 
to expand access rights in such a way might make it difficult to educate the public 
about responsible or safe exercise of access rights.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17192">17192</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The comments that I made about amendment 66A also apply to Dennis Canavan's 
amendment 66C. My amendment 178 is consequential on amendment 177.</P><P>I have 
asked the minister for further clarification. We are trying to make it clear in 
the bill which activities are excluded and which are not.</P><P><strong>Dennis 
Canavan: </strong>I support Executive amendment 62, which would include educational 
activities in the activities for which access rights may be exercised. Executive 
amendment 66 attempts to define educational activity, but it is too restrictive, 
as it confines a &quot;relevant educational activity&quot; to one that has the 
aim of furthering someone's</P><P>&quot;understanding of natural or cultural heritage&quot;.</P><P>I 
lodged amendments 66A and 66C because of that restrictive definition.</P><P>We 
can all think of examples of educational visits and excursions that would not 
be made solely for the purposes of understanding natural or cultural heritage 
but that are nevertheless educational visits or excursions. They may be aimed 
at educating the public about the practice of skills that are required for activities 
such as hillwalking, cycling, canoeing or horse-riding that are within access 
rights, or about the responsible and safe exercising of those access rights. They 
should all be included in the bill, as they are all legitimate educational activities.</P><P>15:15</P><P>A 
school might organise an excursion to practise navigation, for example. Surely 
such excursions must remain within access rights; if not, landowners might try 
to restrict them. Further, failure to expand access rights in such a way might 
make it very difficult to educate the public about how to exercise them responsibly. 
Education on safe and responsible access has always been one of the central planks 
of the discussions that have taken place on access. In particular, education on 
how to exercise access rights responsibly should help to allay the concerns of 
landowners.</P><P>I listened carefully to what the minister said and I do not 
agree with his statement that my amendments 66A and 66C are unnecessary. If the 
Executive deems it necessary to spell out a specific reference to an understanding 
of natural or cultural heritage, surely the bill should also include an explicit 
reference to educating people on&#151;or helping to promote an understanding of&#151;the 
exercise of any activity that is within the access rights that are provided for. 
My fear is that, without such a specific reference, some landowners might seek 
to bring legal challenges </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17193">17193</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>against certain educational excursions. The specific references that are included 
in my amendments 66A and 66C are not only desirable but necessary.</P><P><strong>Murdo 
Fraser (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>The issue of commercial access 
is the one on which there is the prospect of controversy. I think that the principle 
that people should be allowed to come on to the land and exercise access is accepted 
by all sides of the debate&#151;by landowners and farmers as well as by those 
taking up access rights. The principle is reasonable in the case of mountain guides, 
for example. However, we should not have situations in which people access land 
to derive profit from it by, for example, holding events or setting up stalls.</P><P>In 
general, the Conservatives welcome the amendments in the grouping because we think 
that they make sense. I have concerns about one of them, however, which I put 
to the minister for his response. I am concerned about amendment 63 and in particular 
how it would work in practice.</P><P>Amendment 63 seeks to include the words:</P><P>&quot;which 
the person exercising the right could carry on otherwise than commercially or 
for profit&quot;.</P><P>I will give two examples that illustrate my concerns.</P><P>The 
first example is of someone who comes on to land and starts to peddle hamburgers. 
If they said that they were giving away the hamburgers, not selling them for profit, 
would that activity be excluded from access rights?</P><P>Secondly, it would be 
possible to hold a rave on someone's land and not charge people admission and 
yet the people organising the rave could be doing so for profit. Would amendment 
63 allow raves to be held without the landowner's permission if people were to 
derive their profit other than by charging admission? Those points require clarification 
and I would welcome any comments that the minister may make on amendment 63.</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>Four other members have asked to speak. I warn the 
chamber that we are running a wee bit tight for time. We have another group of 
amendments to deal with before the guillotine comes down at 10 minutes to 4. I 
ask members who are to speak to show brevity, please.</P><P><strong>Pauline McNeill: 
</strong>This group of amendments is important, not least because of the number 
of representations that many back benchers across the parties have made on this 
aspect of the bill.</P><P>Members should note that there will be an access code 
that will ensure that guidance is given on the meaning of the provisions. Distinguishing 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17194">17194</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>those activities that would benefit from statutory access rights, which will 
be exercised individually or collectively, was the subject of a lot of discussion 
between the Justice 2 Committee and the Executive. Many other back benchers were 
also interested in the debate.</P><P>In our attempt to formulate our view on that 
distinction, the committee often referred to it as the &quot;T in the Park distinction&quot;. 
We meant that activities should be allowed to proceed as they do at present: ordinary 
activities, such as school trips, would be unaffected but landowners would make 
the normal arrangements for big events, including pop concerts such as T in the 
Park.</P><P>We have done well to achieve all that we have achieved to date. The 
Executive has also done well&#151;I know that amendment 66 was drafted and redrafted. 
We are trying to achieve something that is no more or less than what existed previously, 
and we want to preserve the status quo, as we understand it, so that landowners 
are able to take advantage of the arrangements that I outlined. On Dennis Canavan's 
points, the bill, if passed, would make no difference to schools and whether they 
will be able to take advantage of trips to the countryside.</P><P>Amendment 86 
is a minor amendment that relates to golf courses. During our consideration of 
the bill, there was much discussion of golf courses, and I think that we have 
reached a sensible position on the issue. There is no general right of access 
to golf courses, except to cross over them. However, some MSPs have received representations 
from people who have made use of golf courses during the sledging season. Notwithstanding 
the fact that Allan Wilson is the minister with responsibility for global warming 
and that people may not be able to enjoy sledging for much longer, I ask him to 
confirm that, where local agreements exist for people to take part in that activity, 
it will be unaffected, although such arrangements are not prescribed in the bill.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP): </strong>I shall be brief. I ask 
the minister to answer two specific questions in his summing up.</P><P>I support 
the Executive's amendments and I particularly welcome the minister's support for 
amendment 66B. However, will he reflect on some of the examples that have been 
given in the debate, such as scientific activities, activities under the Duke 
of Edinburgh's award, or activities by NGOs that seek access to land for pollution 
control? In order to allow members to make an informed decision about his interpretation 
of the bill, I ask him to outline for the Parliament which of the examples that 
have been mentioned would not be included or whether they would all be included.</P><P>Further, 
will the minister clarify his interpretation </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17195">17195</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>of amendment 66? I do not seek to tell him his job; however, he might argue 
that where the bill defines a &quot;relevant educational activity&quot; as that</P><P>&quot;which 
is carried on by a person for the purposes of&quot;</P><P>a certain activity, 
that activity must be the sole or main purpose of access. On the other hand, perhaps 
he means that such an activity might be a by-product of access and one of several 
reasons for, or an intended or unintended result of, that access. If he intends 
that wider definition, the minister might have a case. However, if the activity 
must be the sole or main purpose of access, his definition might be more restrictive, 
which would probably mean that we would have to support the amendments to amendment 
66.</P><P><strong>George Lyon: </strong>Members received the maximum correspondence 
from constituents who were concerned about the impact of commercial access. We 
need to find the right balance between the genuine needs of mountain guides or 
the staff of outdoor centres who accrue some commercial benefit from escorting 
clients on hillwalking expeditions to the countryside, and the interests of landowners, 
who do not want themselves or their land to be financially exploited by the setting 
up of raves and so on without accruing any financial benefit themselves. Indeed, 
it is absolutely essential that we find that balance. I am interested to hear 
the minister's response to the examples that Murdo Fraser and other members raised 
and I hope that he can reassure us that the correct balance has been achieved 
in amendment 63 and the amendments that were agreed to at stage 2.</P><P><strong>Fergus 
Ewing: </strong>Last year, during the foot-and-mouth crisis, the sole group of 
people in Scotland who received no compensation but lost almost all of their income 
for weeks if not months included mountain guides, climbing instructors, canoe 
instructors and a variety of other people, most of whom work for themselves and 
have a modest income. Although those people lost their entire livelihood for a 
long period, they behaved to a person&#151;as far as I know&#151;with total responsibility. 
I am delighted that the Executive is now persuaded that those people should not 
be punished for their good behaviour. I welcome the minister's aim that such people 
can continue to play the essential role that Duncan Hamilton, George Lyon and 
others have described. The question is whether, technically, the minister's aim 
is being achieved.</P><P>If mountain guides, climbing instructors, canoe instructors, 
dry-stane dyke instructors and others&#151;all of whom must have access to the 
outdoors to earn their modest livelihoods&#151;are to be protected by the amendments, 
that is fine. However, I understood that the minister's argument was, &quot;Well, 
if the amendments that we are talking about today&quot;&#151;which we agree with&#151;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17196">17196</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>&quot;do not cover those people, they are covered by the fact that access can 
be exercised for recreational purposes.&quot; If a mountain guide takes a class 
to Ben Nevis, the class is there for recreational purposes, but the mountain guide 
is not. He or she is not there to make a lot of money, but because he or she needs 
to get money to survive and to continue doing what he or she wants to do. That 
is a possible loophole. I hope that I am wrong and that the minister will address 
my point in his closing remarks.</P><P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I will be 
as quick as I can.</P><P>I will deal first with Fergus Ewing's last point. We 
are absolutely clear about the general right of access. It was the clear wish 
of the committee that guides of any shape, size or description be covered by the 
bill. Amendment 66 tries to extend the definition to deal with concerns about 
educational interests.</P><P>Duncan Hamilton is right. In response to his point, 
I can tell him that I am clear that we are seeking to achieve a wider definition. 
The difficulty is that, when one starts to draft such an amendment and to clarify 
the provision, one runs the risk of narrowing the definition. I accept the point, 
but I invite Mr Hamilton to read the section as a whole and as amended. If he 
did so, he would see that it covers both Fergus Ewing's point about general intent 
and the question of extending that definition, and that it deals with those two 
points. With that, I hope that I have addressed other concerns.</P><P>I will deal 
with Murdo Fraser's point before I respond to George Lyon, but first I will respond 
to Pauline McNeill, who is a well-known sledger. I say to her that agreements 
that are already in existence or that might be agreed with an individual can continue. 
The bill makes no provision to override such local agreements.</P><P>I turn to 
the substantive points on Roseanna Cunningham's amendments 177 and 178 and Dennis 
Canavan's amendment 66C. Members raised other concerns with me, but if those activities&#151;particularly 
the example given by Roseanna Cunningham&#151;are not being carried out for the 
purpose of making a profit, they fall into another category, which is a different 
issue. That is why I draw the distinction between a general right of access and 
allowing those who are not pursuing activities for profit to continue to have 
the extended access rights described in section 1.</P><P>I had a little difficulty 
with Murdo Fraser's new concept of a commercial activity that involves giving 
away hamburgers. I have not quite got my mind round that concept.</P><P><strong>Bill

<P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>No, under no circumstances will I take an intervention. 
Bill Aitken might want to reflect on what Murdo Fraser said&#151;perhaps we will 
get free hamburgers when we leave the chamber.</P><P>I ask Murdo Fraser to look 
at the much broader definition of profit that the bill provides. There will always 
be clever people who think up clever ways&#151;they tend to be lawyers, I am bound 
to say&#151;to obviate a provision in any piece of legislation. Let me be serious. 
The existing provisions make it clear that people who have absolute rights, whose 
activities do not exploit the land and who are not seeking to make a profit will 
have their rights extended by amendment 66 and further extended by the other amendments 
that we have lodged. That seems the correct approach, whereas people who are engaged 
in specific commercial activity should seek access rights in the normal way.</P><P><em>Amendment

<P>73, 80, 80A, 80B, 186, 93, 187, 94 and 162. The guillotine will fall at 15:52 
for this group of amendments, so members have until then to debate them.</P><P><strong>Allan 
Wilson: </strong>I will press my request-to-speak button.</P><P><strong>The Presiding 
Officer: </strong>It is nice to know who you are.</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: 
</strong>I know who I am.</P><P>Amendments 67 and 80 seek to reintroduce the order-making 
powers that were lost at stage 2. They will provide powers for ministers by order 
to modify any of the provisions of sections 2 and 3, and for the purposes of those 
sections, sections 9, 14 and 22; and the provisions of sections 6 and 7. Such 
orders could apply generally or be restricted to certain areas, locations or classes 
of land, or could apply to particular ways of exercising access rights or particular 
types of land management activity.</P><P>I remind the Parliament of what we said 
at stage 2 in relation to the importance of those order-making powers.</P><P>I 
would like to think that the new access arrangements that are heralded by the 
bill will work in the way that we intend and I believe that the balanced approach 
that we have adopted is correct. However, it was apparent at stage 2 that there 
are very different views as to how the bill will work out in practice. I suspect 
that it will be some time before we can assess how effectively the bill is delivering 
our objective of improved access and whether any of the concerns that have been 
expressed have any foundation.</P><P>Realistically, I suspect that some difficulties 
may arise; I do not know exactly where or we would take action now. Some of those 
difficulties may require us to revisit the legislation. In those circumstances, 
I want ministers to be able to respond quickly and efficiently to modify details 
of the bill in the light of experience. Primary legislation would not be appropriate, 
as we do not want to have to wait for an appropriate bill in which to include 
amendments&#151;that could take years.</P><P>On the other hand, I recognise that 
any modification of the legislation must be subject to the approval of Parliament. 
This is why section 95 requires that any order to be made under section 8 will 
require the express approval of Parliament. I do not think that everyone recognised 
at stage 2 that constraint on the use of the powers. There is no suggestion that 
the bill might be amended without the approval of Parliament.</P><P>In addition, 
it is important that no order would be made without full consultation. It is normal 
Executive practice to consult widely on all proposed secondary legislation, but 
we have </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17207">17207</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>written that requirement into amendments 67 and 80. Where an order proposes 
an amendment of general application, the consultation will involve the main national 
organisations, in addition to individuals. Where an order is of local applicability, 
the consultation will also focus on local interests, including the local access 
forum.</P><P>Amendments 73, 93, 94 and 162 are consequential to amendments 67 
and 80.</P><P>I will now consider amendments 67A, 67B, 67C, 80A and 80B. Amendment 
67A seeks to limit the proposed power. It would limit the scope of any order to 
amendments to sections 9, 14 and 22. I have looked again at the matter and I accept 
that it is unlikely that any practical difficulties that arise from implementation 
of the new arrangements will require amendment of either section 2 or 3 as now 
drafted. I am therefore content to accept amendment 67A. [<em>Interruption.</em>] 
Roseanna Cunningham sounds surprised.</P><P>Amendments 67B and 80A would require 
that any order must not materially reduce the extent of access rights or increase 
landowners' obligations. Sections 6 and 7 set out in detail the land over which 
access rights are not exercisable. It is difficult to envisage any amendment of 
the provisions in those sections that would not materially affect the extent of 
access rights or landowners' obligations. The amendments would effectively rule 
out any potential order amending those sections. I consider the order-making powers 
essential to ensuring that the new arrangements work in practice. They should 
not by constrained in the way that is proposed.</P><P>Amendments 67C and 80B would 
require ministers to issue a public notice of any proposed order, provide reasons 
for making changes and invite views on the matter. I have explained that the proposed 
new section includes a requirement on ministers that was not in the bill at stage 
2 to consult on any order. Providing the reasons for the order and inviting views 
are mandatory parts of any consultation and there is therefore no need to set 
that out in the bill in the way that the amendments suggest.</P><P>Amendments 
181, 186 and 187 are relevant only if amendments 67 and 80 are not agreed. I hope 
that Parliament will agree that the powers to amend certain provisions in the 
bill by way of an order approved by Parliament will provide a useful means of 
responding quickly to any difficulties that arise on implementation of the new 
arrangements. If amendments 67 and 80 are agreed, amendments 181, 186 and 187 
should be resisted. Therefore, I ask Stewart Stevenson and Roseanna Cunningham 
not to move the amendments in their names, with the obvious exception of amendment 
67A, which I am happy to accept.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17208">17208</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

add to the clarity, I point out that, because of pre-emption, if amendment 181 
is agreed to, I cannot call amendment 73; if amendment 186 is agreed to, I cannot 
call amendment 93; and if amendment 187 is agreed to I cannot call amendment 94.</P><P>I 
ask Stewart Stevenson to move amendment 67A to bring it into play, and I will 
then call the convener of the Subordinate Legislation Committee.</P><P><em>Amendment 
67A moved&#151;[Stewart Stevenson].</em></P><P><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald (Lothians) 
(SNP): </strong>I speak as the convener of the Subordinate Legislation Committee, 
so my remarks do not apply to the policy implications of the Executive or Opposition 
amendments in the group.</P><P>I inform Parliament that amendments 67 and 80 would 
put back into the bill two broad powers that troubled the Subordinate Legislation 
Committee at stage 1. I heard what the minister said about consultation, but nit-pickers 
&quot;r&quot; us. We had the powers removed at stage 2 and we are concerned that 
they are to be replaced.</P><P>Amendment 67 will give ministers wide scope to 
modify access rights under section 2 and to modify landowners' obligations under 
section 3. Amendment 80 also relates to the bill's fundamental purposes. In effect, 
it will allow ministers to decide how much or how little land will be subject 
to access rights. The powers go to the heart of the bill. In fact, the Subordinate 
Legislation Committee's stage 1 report questioned whether such core provisions 
should be open to alteration by ministers, even by affirmative instrument.</P><P>The 
Subordinate Legislation Committee has had an understanding with the Executive 
that it will be told in advance about any substantial changes to subordinate legislation 
provisions at stage 3 of a bill. Indeed, a letter from the Executive in December 
told the committee that no new subordinate legislation powers were envisaged for 
the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill at stage 3. It is unfortunate that, in the past 
couple of days, we have found out that the substantial provisions that were removed 
are to be reinstated. I hope that the minister is as concerned and disappointed 
about that as the committee members are.</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>I 
thank the minister for accepting amendment 67A, although my colleagues are becoming 
deeply suspicious about the matter. We do not now feel the need to move amendments 
67B or 67C, but we will press amendment 80A. Sections 6 and 7 define land that

<P>is excluded from access and we believe that the minister should not have the 
power to reduce materially the extent of access secured. We will not move amendment 
80B.</P><P>Amendments 181, 186 and 187 are essentially technical and relate to 
the reintroduction of the original section 11 before section 12, which we will 
discuss tomorrow in group 12. The reason why we deleted section 11 at stage 2 
was largely because of the objections of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. 
I admit that it came as a slight surprise to receive support for the deletion 
of section 11, which is why consequential amendments were not dealt with at the 
time. I am minded not to move amendments 181, 186 and 187 because they are tidying-up 
amendments that assume that section 11 will remain deleted. I now assume that 
that section will return, although we will debate that in due course.</P><P><strong>Donald 
Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>Given Margo MacDonald's line of reasoning, 
will the minister assure us that, if some less resolute and talented ministers 
are in charge of proceedings in the future, they will not be able to subvert a 
great deal of the bill through procedural methods, rather than through a new bill? 
What comfort can the minister give us that his good intentions will not be destroyed 
in the future?</P><P><strong>Bill Aitken: </strong>Although I am happy to accept 
the minister's personal assurances, I have the same misgivings as Donald Gorrie 
has with regard to the future. It appears that the minister seeks a blank cheque 
from the Parliament. If there are to be substantive changes to legislation, the 
matter should come back before the Parliament. It is significant that the minister 
conceded that there might be a need to revisit part of the bill. That in itself 
is concerning. We are concerned with a profound democratic principle. We cannot 
go along with giving the minister&#151;or any other minister, for that matter&#151;the 
power to change legislation on a whim without the Parliament getting a full opportunity 
to examine it.</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I reassure members that the 
reintroduction of the powers was intimated to the Rural Development Committee 
at stage 2. If there was any breach of protocol with the Subordinate Legislation 
Committee in the interim, I apologise on the Executive's behalf, as that was certainly 
not our intention.</P><P>We considered the matter carefully following stage 2. 
It was anticipated that it might take some time to assess how effectively the 
bill delivers the objective of improved access. The powers are therefore considered 
necessary as a last resort to enable ministers to respond swiftly and efficiently 
to modify sections 6 and 7&#151;I accept Stewart Stevenson's intention not to 
move the relevant amendments.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17210">17210</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Although the bill has been consulted on widely and a reasonable consensus exists 
on the principle of general access&#151;perhaps with the exception of Conservative 
members&#151;it is evident that some concerns remain about the bill. We envisage 
that, if in future some minister less amenable than I were to stand in my place, 
primary legislation would be needed to repeal the bill's principles. I assure

</STRONG>Amendment 68 is grouped with amendments 180, 179, 182 and 183.</P><P><strong>Ross 
Finnie: </strong>The bill as introduced excluded from access rights land on which 
there is a structure. We argued at stage 2 that that was both reasonable and necessary. 
I do not believe that access rights should extend to such things as telecommunications 
masts, mobile phone masts, canal locks and the like. Nevertheless, that provision 
was removed from the bill at stage 2. At that time, we indicated that we would 
have to return to the issue at stage 3.</P><P>We have given careful consideration 
as to whether it would be realistic to attempt to list in the bill all the types 
of structure to be excluded from access rights. Our conclusion is that that would 
not be a sensible approach. The list would be long, and it is unlikely that we 
would catch everything that should be caught, not only now but in future.</P><P>I 
reconsidered the arguments for removing from the bill the exclusion of land on 
which there is a structure, and I am not persuaded. The bill already provides 
that access is not excluded to bridges, tunnels, causeways, fences or walls. I 
consider that to be the correct approach. To tackle the issue the other way round 
and include under access rights all structures other than those specified is the 
wrong approach. It is for that reason that I lodged amendment 68.</P><P>Amendment 
180 would bring under access rights compounds or other enclosures around a structure. 
It is important that where, for example, a fence is erected round a telecommunications 
mast, for reasons of security, the land within that fence is excluded from access 
rights. Otherwise, the fence would serve no useful purpose. That would be a nonsense, 
and I hope that Stewart Stevenson will withdraw that amendment.</P><P>Amendment 
179 would remove from the bill the provision that clarifies that bridges, tunnels

<P>on are not to be regarded as structures, and that access rights can therefore 
be exercised over them. It is clearly important that access rights can be exercised 
over bridges, through tunnels and so on. However, I accept that there could be 
a case for extending that list. Amendments 182 and 183 seek to do that by providing 
that access rights can be exercised on launching sites, groynes, weirs, boulder 
weirs, embankments of canalised waterways and on anything that is designed to 
facilitate passage. In other words, amendments 182 and 183 will expand the section 
that amendment 180 seeks to delete. Amendments 182 and 183 are consistent with 
the approach that I have outlined. I accept that the structures listed in them 
could be included under access rights. I am therefore content to accept Roseanna 
Cunningham's amendments 182 and 183.</P><P>I move amendment 68.</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>I point out that, if amendment 179 is agreed to, I 
will not be able to call amendments 182 or 183.</P><P><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: 
</strong>It is always charming when a minister accepts one's amendments&#151;but 
it always throws one right out with regard to what one was about to say. Nevertheless, 
I am happy&#151;</P><P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Roseanna Cunningham should 
turn her fire on Stewart Stevenson.</P><P><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>In 
fairness to my colleague, he was the one who lodged an amendment to remove the 
word &quot;structure&quot; at stage 2. He has sought at this stage to remove other 
redundant instances of that word, in keeping with his stage 2 amendment&#151;although 
the purpose was slightly different then.</P><P>As amendments 182 and 183 have 
been accepted by the minister, I think that I can save the chamber's time by coming 
to a close after that brief explanation of the situation in which Stewart Stevenson 
found himself.</P><P><strong>Bill Aitken: </strong>Having heard that explanation, 
I am prepared to go along with it. I was looking forward, however, to an explanation 
from Ms Cunningham as to the definition of &quot;groyne&quot;, which I understand 
in fact relates to a device or structure to prevent soil erosion. I do not think 
that many people knew that.</P><P><em>Amendment 68 agreed to.</EM></P><em> <P>Amendment

<P>provision into the act that will be in the public interest and will improve 
protection of children.</P><P>Unfortunately, facilities such as playgrounds that 
are provided for children occasionally attract people with a more sinister purpose. 
Amendment 40 seeks to protect children by denying the public access to an area 
that is being used predominantly by children for recreational pursuits. That protection 
is not available elsewhere in the bill. The amendment is practical, notwithstanding 
the explanation that the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development 
gave in committee at stage 2. I look forward with interest to hearing the minister's 
views.</P><P>I move amendment 40.</P><P><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>Amendment 
184 is a probing amendment. We are seeking to establish the Executive's true position 
in respect of tracks that run through farmyards. Many tracks&#151;especially tracks 
up hills&#151;start in farmyards. Under the bill as it stands, those tracks would 
be excluded from the right of access.</P><P>In response to an amendment in the 
name of Scott Barrie that sought to deal with this issue at stage 2, Allan Wilson 
stated that he wanted to nail down access to tracks that run through farmyards 
and that he was willing to discuss the matter further. However, the Executive 
has not lodged an amendment to deal with the problem.</P><P>Amendment 184 seeks 
to protect the existing right of access under common law, which we discussed separately, 
from change as a result of the establishment of statutory rights of access.</P><P>Farmyards 
provide very good routes&#151;often the only route&#151;into the countryside behind 
the curtilage. Members who are walkers know that to be the case. There is concern 
that continued access along such routes will be restricted in future if access 
rights do not apply to them. In its report, the Justice 2 Committee noted:</P><P>&quot;there 
are many places where access to open land can only be gained through farmyards. 
This is particularly so in relation to access on horseback of bicycle. However, 
farmyards will fall within the definition of curtilage in section 6 and so not 
be included within access rights.&quot;</P><P>The committee indicated that the 
issue needed to be addressed.</P><P>Amendment 184 is a probing amendment. We are 
seeking assurances from the minister that the public should expect to be able 
to continue to take access through farmyards, as they do at present, rather than 
just on rights of way. Limiting access to rights of way would restrict hugely 
the access that is currently available in Scotland.</P><P><strong>Scott Barrie: 
</strong>Amendment 40 must be opposed. It has been drawn so widely that any open 
space could be construed to fall within its scope. If the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17215">17215</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>amendment is agreed to, the public will not be able to access such spaces.</P><P>Roseanna 
Cunningham has already alluded to the fact that at stage 2 I tried to explore 
the issue to which amendment 184 relates. We have found it incredibly difficult 
to reach a resolution of that issue. I am sure that in summing up the minister 
will agree with me.</P><P>Roseanna Cunningham highlighted the key points in this 
area. She was right to say that many routes for accessing hills start in farmyards. 
We must be assured that such access will not be restricted. The bill has always 
been about ensuring that the people of Scotland have nothing less in future than 
they have at the moment.</P><P>Roseanna Cunningham's points were well made in 
relation to the Justice 2 Committee's position in its stage 1 report and through 
its stage 2 consideration, during which amendments on the matter were contended 
and sometimes agreed to. I hope that the minister will be able to reiterate that 
after the passage of the bill, the people of Scotland will end up with nothing 
less than they have at the moment.</P><P><strong>George Lyon: </strong>I thank 
Roseanna Cunningham for raising the question of access through farmyards, because 
I believe that it is crucial and that it raises two important issues. One of those 
is health and safety, because a farmyard is an area in which machinery is operating 
and where there might be slurry pits or slatted passages. I do not think that 
it is appropriate that access rights should apply to farmyards. We also have to 
consider the privacy of the farmer and his family.</P><P><strong>Pauline McNeill: 
</strong>The Justice 2 Committee's position is not that there should be a general 
right of access through farmyards because, as George Lyon says correctly, there 
is a health and safety issue. Where there is no alternative route, we wanted the 
Executive to legislate to ensure that a route is provided; we did not want to 
create access to farmyards. That is the point that Roseanna Cunningham raised 
and I ask that it be addressed.</P><P><strong>George Lyon: </strong>I was going 
to come on to that.</P><P>The issue is how access is gained through a farmyard. 
Access rights would allow people to walk round the farmyard to take access through 
the fields on either side. It would give people absolute access to any other way 
of getting round the farmyard. I do not think that it is necessary for access 
rights to apply to farmyards.</P><P>I would like the minister to comment on the 
Executive definition of curtilage, which I asked him about at question time last 
week. There has been much discussion of that in the press and a number of concerned 
people have asked me about the definition, how it applies to hotels and whether 
it </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17216">17216</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>applies to the ground surrounding hotels. I would like to hear from the minister 
what the Executive's position is and what the definition of curtilage is.</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>I think that a later amendment deals with that, if 
I remember rightly. Does Lord James Douglas-Hamilton wish to speak?</P><P><strong>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>No, certainly not.</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>Your name appeared on my screen.</P><P>Does John Home 
Robertson wish to speak?</P><P><strong>Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab): 
</strong>No.</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>Wonderful. I call Allan 
Wilson to reply.</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The bill provides for rights 
of responsible access to land for recreational purposes. I say to Bill Aitken 
that far from being helpful, amendment 40 would exclude all land used primarily 
by children for recreational purposes. The exclusion of the public from exercising 
access rights on land that adjoins a school and is used by the school, which the 
bill already provides for, is sufficient for the purposes that he outlines. We 
do not see the need to exclude all land used by children for recreational purposes. 
That could have the effect of excluding the public from exercising access rights 
from local parks, for example. I am sure that Bill Aitken would agree that far 
from being helpful, the proposition would be ludicrous. I therefore ask Bill Aitken 
to withdraw amendment 40.</P><P>Roseanna Cunningham and colleagues looked for 
assurances and she said helpfully that amendment 184 was a probing amendment. 
The amendment would provide that any existing right of access through farmyards 
is not deemed to relate to excluded land. I give the assurance that section 5(3) 
of the bill already provides that</P><P>&quot;the existence or exercise of access 
rights does not diminish or displace any other rights ... of entry, way, passage 
or access.&quot;</P><P>I recognise, however, that there are concerns about access 
through farmyards, which George Lyon, among others, expressed. As Scott Barrie 
said, we have given this careful thought but, as I said at stage 2, farmers should 
obviously enjoy rights to privacy.</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Is 
the minister confirming that access through farmyards is available currently?</P><P><strong>Allan 
Wilson: </strong>Where access through farmyards already exists, nothing in the 
bill will diminish or extinguish such a right of access. I have quoted </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17217">17217</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>section 5(3), the terms of which are self-explanatory.</P><P>However, I should 
add that the appropriate approach to ensuring that farmers have rights to privacy 
and that those who wish to take appropriate access have the right to do so is 
to provide guidance in the code. I accept that, in circumstances in which a farmer 
is unwilling to allow access through a steading on the grounds of privacy or health 
and safety, there should be a requirement to identify and mark an alternative 
route. That is a matter for the code. Amendment 90, which seeks to amend section 
10, will widen the scope of the code to allow for that.</P><P>I have indicated 
that section 5(3) already provides that the</P><P>&quot;existence or exercise 
of access rights does not diminish or displace any other rights&quot;</P><P>and 
that amendment 90 will make specific provision for widening the scope of the code 
to cover alternative routing round the steading. I hope that those two assurances 
will mean that Roseanna Cunningham will not move amendment 184, as it will not 
be necessary.</P><P><em>Amendment 40, by agreement, withdrawn.</em></P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>Amendment 69 is grouped with amendments 70, 72, 75 
and 76.</P><P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Section 6(1)(f) will exclude from 
access rights sports pitches and other land that has been developed or set out 
for recreational purposes, when such land is being used for those purposes. Amendments 
69, 72 and 75 seek to restructure and expand that provision.</P><P>Amendment 75 
sets down the main provisions. Its effect will be to exclude from access rights 
sports pitches and other areas that have been developed or set out for a particular 
recreational use, when they are in use. In such circumstances, the exercise of 
access rights would interfere with their use. Paragraph (b) of the subsection 
that amendment 75 would insert seeks to exclude golf greens, bowling greens and 
so on. It simply picks up the provisions that are set out in section 6(1)(fa). 
It would also exclude at all times the synthetic sports surfaces that are set 
out in paragraph (c) that would be inserted by amendment 75. That is necessary 
because sportscotland has advised us that such surfaces might be damaged by people 
wearing inappropriate footwear. Amendments 69, 72 and 76 are consequential on 
amendment 75. The proposed provisions are sensible and I hope that members will 
agree to the amendments.</P><P>Amendment 70 would extend the provision to exclude 
not only land that had been developed or set out for a particular recreational 
purpose while it was in use for that purpose, but land that had </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17218">17218</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>been developed or set out for a particular commercial purpose while it was 
in use for that purpose. That exclusion is potentially very wide and I see no 
need for it. The responsible exercise of access rights would not interfere with 
the sort of commercial activities that are envisaged by amendment 70. The matter 
could be better addressed through the code rather than in the bill. Therefore, 
I invite Bill Aitken not to move amendment 70.</P><P>I move amendment 69.</P><P><strong>Bill 
Aitken: </strong>The Executive amendments in the group are acceptable. The idea 
behind amendment 70 is to apply the restrictions to access where the recreational 
facility concerned is also a commercial facility.</P><P>It seems that the wording 
of section 6 could allow access through a professional football ground or a rugby 
stadium, for example. If the minister can demonstrate satisfactorily where else 
in the bill that issue is dealt with, I will listen carefully. If he cannot do 
so, I will have to press amendment 70.</P><P>As I have said, it is clear that 
the vast majority of people behave responsibly and take access in an eminently 
sensible manner. However, there are always those for whom we must legislate. Against 
that background, I shall wait and see what the minister has to say before I decide 
what action I will take.</P><P>16:15</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>Three 
members want to speak to the amendments in the group. We are running a little 
tight for time.</P><P><strong>Maureen Macmillan (Highlands and Islands) (Lab): 
</strong>I seek clarification from the minister on paragraph (a) that would be 
inserted by amendment 75, and which would prevent access rights if</P><P>&quot;the 
exercise of those rights would interfere with the recreational use to which the 
land is being put&quot;.</P><P>The Highland Council is concerned that amendment 
75 might create a loophole that would allow a grouse-moor owner, or possibly a 
deer-forest owner, to argue that the use of the land also includes management 
operations such as heather burning. Such owners could claim that the exercise 
of access rights at such times would interfere with the recreational use of the 
land. That would mean that landowners could exclude walkers for long periods.</P><P>Will 
the minister assure me that amendment 75 will in no way enable sporting estates 
to extend the legitimate exclusion that is enforced when shooting is taking place? 
Will he assure me that the amendment will not allow such estates to </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17219">17219</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>prevent access by walkers at other times of the year?</P><P><strong>Alasdair 
Morgan (Galloway and Upper Nithsdale) (SNP): </strong>I seek the same kind of 
clarification that Maureen Macmillan asked for. Amendment 75 is reasonable and 
would improve the bill's drafting considerably, but I ask for an assurance that, 
in relation to land such as golf fairways and grouse moors, a commonsense meaning 
will be applied to the word &quot;interfere&quot;.</P><P>Amendment 70, which I 
think is identical to an amendment that Murdo Fraser lodged at stage 2, is just 
the usual nonsense from the Conservative party. As the minister has said, the 
right of access to land is a right of responsible access. The bill does not provide 
a right to interfere with commercial activity. Were amendment 70 agreed to, it 
would open up the possibility that many people would unreasonably restrict access 
to land by claiming that the land was used for some commercial activity.</P><P><strong>Dr 
Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab): </strong>Having been approached by constituents 
of mine from Balquhidder, I ask for clarification of the interpretation of &quot;recreational 
purpose&quot; in section 6(1)(f)(ii), which would be amended by amendment 72. 
My constituents have purchased cottages, which they have advertised for rent as 
being quiet and secluded. Would those cottages be afforded suitable privacy, given 
that they have been advertised as being private? What would be the effect of the 
amendments in that case?</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I call 
on the minister to wind up.</P><P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>In response to 
Bill Aitken's first point, section 6(1)(f) excludes sports grounds. No matter 
how one defines that, those are already included in the bill as being excluded 
from the general right of access.</P><P>On the question of grouse moors, I assure 
members that amendment 75 clarifies that section 6(1)(f) talks about access rights 
not being exercisable over land that has been &quot;developed or set out&quot; 
for recreational purposes. We are quite satisfied that grouse moors do not fall 
within the category of being &quot;developed or set out&quot; for recreational 
purposes. A grouse moor is, as Alasdair Morgan said, a grouse moor, so it would 
not be excluded from access rights by the provisions of amendment 75.</P><P><strong>Mr 
John Swinney (North Tayside) (SNP): </strong>&quot;A grouse moor is a grouse moor.&quot; 
That is helpful.</P><P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I am glad to have Mr Swinney's 
support on that. I think that that deals with the points that were made by Maureen 
Macmillan and Bill Aitken. [<em>Interruption.</em>]</P><P>I apologise for almost 
forgetting Sylvia Jackson's </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17220">17220</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>point. The right to privacy has been addressed and the cottages that she mentioned 
would therefore fall within the provisions that give guidance on that right. I 
cannot give guarantees about what is advertised at any time, but there still exists

<P>Amendment 72 moved&#151;[Ross Finnie]&#151;and agreed to.</P></em> <P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>Amendment 168, in the name of Rhona Brankin, is grouped 
with amendments 169 and 77.</P><P><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab): </strong>I 
will speak to amendments 168 and 169. The amendments are designed to ensure that 
no one&#151;walker, cyclist or horse rider&#151;is charged for access.</P><P>I 
understand that section 6(1)(g)(i) and 6(1)(g)(ii) were inserted in the bill to 
allow businesses such as safari parks to continue to charge for access but, unfortunately, 
those sections will allow certain landowners to charge horse riders for access, 
although they will not be able to charge cyclists or walkers. I believe very strongly 
that those provisions will effectively exclude a significant number of horse riders 
from the right of access.</P><P>I have two examples. The Duke of Buccleuch's Dalkeith 
country park in my constituency of Midlothian currently charges for access, as 
does Eglinton country park. I firmly believe that it is discriminatory to charge 
horse riders for access when walkers and cyclists are not charged. To do so will 
also displace horse riders onto the roads, with the risks that that involves.</P><P>Will 
the minister confirm whether the Forestry Commission is ceasing to charge horse 
riders for access? Will he say whether he believes that charging horse riders 
for access is within the spirit of the bill? I believe that it is not.</P><P>I 
move amendment 168.</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Section 6(1)(g) excludes 
from access rights any land to which a member of the public has been &quot;admitted 
only on payment&quot; for the periods specified. Having reconsidered the provision 
after stage 2 we decided that, as drafted, the effect would be to exclude land 
even where only one class of user&#151;for example horse riders&#151;has been 
charged for entry. That is not our intention. Amendment 77 therefore seeks to 
amend the provision in such a way that a charge for entry on one class of user 
will not cause that land to be excluded from the exercise of access rights by 
other classes of user.</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>Order. There 
is again a wee bit too much noise in the chamber. It is quite </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17223">17223</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>difficult to concentrate.</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Amendments 168 
and 169 would have the opposite effect to amendment 77. Their intention is to 
ensure that where only one class of user has been charged for entry in the past, 
the land should in future be open to the exercise of access rights by any class 
of users. That would run contrary to the principle and purpose of section 6(1)(g), 
which is that where income has been derived in the past from charging for entry, 
that should continue. It would be wrong to take away from an owner such a source 
of income, and could result in claims for compensation.</P><P>The same argument 
applies where the charge has been levied on only one class of user. I have sympathy 
with Rhona Brankin's point, but in the few cases in which the provision will apply, 
although it would be wrong to deprive an owner of a historical source of income, 
it would be within the spirit of the bill for owners to consider seriously their 
charging practises and policies. Forest Enterprise and the Forestry Commission 
have withdrawn charges for horse users who exercise on their property. I urge 
that course of action on others.</P><P>I ask Rhona Brankin to withdraw amendment 
168 and to not move amendment 169 in favour of Executive amendment 77.</P><P><strong>Rhona 
Brankin: </strong>In view of what the minister said, and given the fact that I 
hope that we will continue to monitor the matter closely, I am prepared to withdraw 
amendment 168.</P><P><em>Amendment 168, by agreement, withdrawn.</EM></P><em> 
<P>Amendment 169 not moved.</P></em> <P><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> 
Amendment 41 is grouped with amendments 185, 78 and 79. The debate on the group 
has to end at 16:37. We have about 10 minutes.</P><P><strong>Bill Aitken: </strong>We 
are seeking to apply appropriate restrictions that will prevent those who seek 
access to land from interfering with the operation of a commercial farm. The wording 
that we have used is &quot;enclosed farmland&quot;. By definition, that would 
not include fields, paths and places to which people would normally expect to 
have reasonable access. Enclosure of such land would have a dual purpose: it would 
protect the business of the individual farmer, and it would protect the health 
and safety of those seeking access. The countryside can be a lovely place but, 
equally, it can be a dangerous place. Sometimes it is ill advised, to say the 
least, to go onto enclosed farmland on which there are farm animals. Unfortunately, 
there have been many instances in which serious injury and death have resulted 
from members of the public mixing with farm animals. We seek to prevent that.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17224">17224</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>There is nothing in amendment 41 that would impinge on the rights of those 
who seek sensible access to farmland. The word that has to be stressed is &quot;enclosed&quot;, 
which refers to places where there are fences of a type that is used to restrict 
animals from straying. Those animals would be potentially dangerous to people 
who walk nearby.</P><P>I move amendment 41.</P><P><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Amendment 
185 seeks to remove plantations of young trees from the list of growing crops 
over which access rights are not exercisable. I am pressing amendment 185 in response 
to the concerns of community forestry groups that plant and manage forests in 
different parts of Scotland and which, far from wanting to keep people away from 
young trees, want to encourage people in the community, especially children, to 
be involved in the management and development of community forests.</P><P><strong>Ross 
Finnie: </strong>It should be clear that the bill provides for responsible access 
to all land. That reflects Scottish Natural Heritage's advice in 1998 to the then 
Scottish Office that a statutory right of access to all land&#151;open and enclosed&#151;should 
be established. Amendment 41 would restrict access to large areas of the countryside 
in Scotland, which is not the intention of the bill. We wish to encourage more 
people to enjoy the countryside; the bill will, I hope, give them the confidence 
to do that. There is no reason why responsible access to agricultural land should 
create problems. Not everyone wants to bag Munros or Corbetts; many people want 
simply to enjoy the countryside around where they live. The bill will give them 
confidence that they can do so without fear of challenge.</P><P>Let me also say 
that I see the bill as an opportunity for farmers. We hear a great deal about 
the lack of public sympathy for farmers, but children and others want to know 
more about agriculture and agricultural habits and the way to teach them about 
it is to help the public into that field. I therefore urge Bill Aitken to seek 
to withdraw amendment 41.</P><P>16:30</P><P>We are happy to accept Rhona Brankin's 
amendment 185, which would delete section 7(7)(a) from the bill, which would mean 
that the bill would treat young saplings as a crop.</P><P>During stage 2, I listened 
to the arguments about the exercise of access rights over grass that was being 
grown for hay or silage. We accepted that there was not a problem with access 
during initial growth and that the crucial time was shortly before grass is cut. 
Amendment 78 deals with that issue and will provide that access rights can be 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17225">17225</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>exercised over grass that is grown for hay or silage, except when the grass</P><P>&quot;is 
at such a late stage of growth that it is likely to be damaged&quot;.</P><P>Guidance 
on that will be included in the Scottish outdoor access code.</P><P>Amendment 
79 also follows from stage 2 discussion and makes it clear that access rights 
can be exercised on all field margins, whether or not they are sown with crops, 
subject to the exercise of that right being responsible.</P><P><strong>Alasdair 
Morgan: </strong>Amendment 41 refers to &quot;enclosed farmland&quot; and is similar 
to an amendment that was defeated at stage 2. It would exclude from the bill large 
areas of Scotland&#151;certainly, of Dumfries and Galloway. In effect, it would 
drive a coach and horses through the bill. I hear my friend Stewart Stevenson 
saying that it would stop a coach. Amendment 41 would prevent many members of 
the public from walking anywhere near their houses, so we should reject it.</P><P>Amendment 
185 is a good example of people getting together and agreeing on restrictions 
that can be removed from the bill, so we welcome it.</P><P>Amendment 78 deals 
with silage. It is unfortunate that such an amendment is needed because the bill 
is too detailed and does not leave enough for the access code. However, given 
the condition of the bill, we will support the amendment.</P><P>Amendment 79 deals 
with access to margins such as headrigs and endrigs. Current farming practice 
is to plant fields up to their edges, which means that the only way in which to 
obtain legitimate access under the bill would be to walk on crops that are growing 
in the margins. At stage 2, ministers assured members that people would continue 
to have the right to access margins. We welcome that and hope that it will encourage 
farmers to leave margins round crops. Apart from their being usable for access, 
such margins would be useful for environmental purposes.</P><P><strong>Pauline 
McNeill: </strong>I strongly support what Ross Finnie has said so far. The Executive 
has moved considerably in response to members' concerns about the provisions in 
the bill.</P><P>I am strongly against Bill Aitken's amendment 41. At stage 2, 
I attempted to remove section 6(1)(j), for the reasons that Alasdair Morgan outlined. 
The inclusion of crops that</P><P>&quot;have been sown or are growing&quot;</P><P>might 
mean that people could not walk on the margins of a field. That has now been clarified 
and the Justice 2 Committee decided, on balance, to keep that provision. If Bill 
Aitken's amendment 41 </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17226">17226</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>were agreed to, the bill would refer to &quot;enclosed farmland&quot;, which 
would mean that huge areas of Scotland were not open to access under the bill.</P><P>A 
crucial debate was held with ministers about responsible access to fields in which 
crops are growing. I emphasise the word &quot;responsible&quot;, because responsibility 
is the crux of the matter. There is no reason why someone who takes access cannot 
walk through crops in a field, provided that they do so responsibly and do not 
damage those crops. Several concessions were made in that stage 2 debate on matters 
such as tramlines and field margins. Ministers even accepted that, provided that 
it was done responsibly, access could be taken between some crops, when it was 
clear that they would not be damaged.</P><P>I am pleased that the Executive accepts 
Rhona Brankin's amendment 185. The same debate took place at stage 2. On balance, 
the committee felt that the provision to which amendment 185 relates should remain 
in the bill, but there is no reason why responsible access cannot be taken in 
areas where young trees are growing. The amendment is a positive step in the right 
direction.</P><P>It is important to ascertain what is in ministers' minds. The 
Justice 2 Committee did that and put that on the record at stage 2. If they take 
that into consideration, no good landowner, land manager or farmer should fear 
the bill.</P><P>The right to roam the countryside responsibly has to be a wide 
right or there is no point in having it. If we are going to restrict access to 
the extent that Bill Aitken proposes, we might as well rely on the confusion that 
exists on the issue. This aspect of the bill is important and I welcome the action 
that the Executive has taken.</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I 
ask Bill Aitken whether he will press or withdraw amendment 41.</P><P><strong>Bill

<P>Amendment 74 makes it clear that access rights can be exercised on all core 
paths regardless of whether they cross excluded land. That is an important clarification. 
The amendment will ensure that, for example, cyclists and horse riders can use 
a pedestrian right of way over excluded land where that right of way is a core 
path. Amendment 105, which removes section 19, is consequential on amendment 74.</P><P>We 
have always made it clear that a system of core paths throughout Scotland is an 
essential element in the new arrangements for access introduced by the bill. Most 
people prefer to walk on paths and a well-marked system of routes will encourage 
more people into the countryside. Equally important is the fact that the provision 
of paths will assist in the management of access, particularly over agricultural 
land.</P><P>The challenge in drawing up the provisions relating to core paths 
has been to balance the public's rights of responsible access to all land with 
appropriate powers for local authorities in respect of creating identified routes 
over someone's land.</P><P>Many useful points were made at stage 2, when we undertook 
to reconsider various provisions in the bill. We have had discussions with COSLA, 
which provided useful input. The amendments that we have lodged will provide a 
means of readily establishing a system of core paths that both meets the aspirations 
of those exercising access rights and respects the rights of landowners.</P><P>One 
concern raised at stage 2 was that the current wording of section 17(2) implies 
that the system of core paths must include every path that falls under paragraphs 
(a) to (c), so that, for example, every right of way would become a core path 
irrespective of its current level of use. Amendment 99 seeks to address that concern 
by clarifying that the system of core paths that section 17 refers to &quot;may 
include&quot; any routes or paths set down in that section, but not necessarily 
all such paths.</P><P>COSLA has particular concerns that section 17(2) requires 
that all core paths that are not rights of way, as in paragraph (a), or paths 
created under statute, as in paragraph (b), must be delineated under section 20 
or section 21. COSLA has quite rightly argued that that is unnecessarily bureaucratic. 
For example, a local authority might decide that an existing farm track should 
be a core path. If so, the public will be able to exercise access rights along 
that track in so far as it does not cross excluded land. Given that, and given 
the consultation process that is required before adoption of a core paths plan, 
I am satisfied that further legal process such as that under sections 20 and 21 
is not required.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17232">17232</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Amendment 100 will introduce into section 17(2) a fourth class of core path, 
which can simply be any</P><P>&quot;routes, waterways or other means by which 
persons may cross land.&quot;</P><P>That is an important change. As a result, 
everything identified on a core paths plan would form part of the system of core 
paths immediately on the adoption of the plan by the local authority&#151;the 
farm track to which I referred would be a core path as soon as the core paths 
plan was adopted.</P><P>In addition, amendment 100 will make it clear that a core 
path might not be a physical path on the ground, but simply a route between two 
points. Those routes would be indicated on maps&#151;we have already discussed 
amendments that would allow local authorities to signpost and waymark such routes 
and erect gates or stiles to facilitate their use. Only where a local authority 
considered it necessary to construct a path or cycle track would it have to invoke 
the provisions in section 20 or section 21. Again in response to concerns raised 
at stage 2, amendment 100 would make it clear that the system of core paths may 
include waterways.</P><P>I am not clear that section 18(9) regarding</P><P>&quot;the 
extent of public rights in each of the core paths&quot;</P><P>is necessary. At 
stage 2, the Justice 2 Committee was concerned that the provision could restrict 
access rights. That would not be the case; the provision was intended only to 
provide information to the public. However, it is not essential and amendment 
102 seeks to remove it from the bill in accordance with the committee's concerns.</P><P>On 
amendment 106, section 20(3) currently provides that</P><P>&quot;A path agreement 
shall contain sufficient description of the land to which it relates to enable 
it to be recorded in the Register of Sasines or entered in the Land Register of 
Scotland as appropriate.&quot;</P><P>Section 20(4) provides that every path agreement 
that the local authority enters into must be recorded. On reflection, we do not 
consider that subsections (3) and (4) are necessary, given that the core paths 
plan and the list of core paths will be available to the public. As a result, 
there will be little doubt about the location of the paths. Any conveyancing solicitor 
would be expected to include the list of core paths in the routine searches.</P><P>Amendment 
128 defines the term &quot;core path&quot; used in part 1 of the bill and clarifies 
that it</P><P>&quot;means a path, waterway or any other means of crossing land 
such as is mentioned&quot;</P><P>in sections 17 and 18.</P><P>I move amendment 
74.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17233">17233</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>16:45</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>Three members want to speak. 
Again, we are very short of time.</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>I 
thank the minister for responding to many of the concerns that I expressed at 
stage 2. I particularly thank him for including water in the definition of core 
paths. As he and I discussed at stage 2, we might truly walk on water. We will 
support the amendments.</P><P><strong>Mr Home Robertson: </strong>I declare my 
interest as a partner in a family farming business.</P><P>The bill needs to recognise 
that access rights for pedestrians are not always compatible with equestrian use 
of footpaths. That depends on the soil type and drainage. The regular use by horses 
of footpaths on soft land can quickly make those paths impassable. That point 
must be addressed and I hope that the Executive will give priority to the rights 
of pedestrians.</P><P><strong>Bill Aitken: </strong>We have long thought that 
the way forward for responsible access is a good and well-maintained network of 
core paths. Such core paths should be placed through areas on a reasonable basis 
and they should be subject to maintenance, thus making them safe for members of 
the public to use. The advantage of a core path system is that it will inevitably 
lessen the possibility of conflict. Therefore, we are keen to encourage such a 
system.</P><P>We note that, in amendment 99, the Executive proposes to lessen 
the duties on local authorities to provide and maintain core paths. We would have 
difficulty in supporting that. The remaining amendments are reasonably sensible.</P><P><strong>Allan 
Wilson: </strong>Amendment 99 recognises that not every right of way need become 
a core path, especially where that right of way has fallen into disuse over many 
years. That is in line with the flexibility that we are prepared to give local 
authorities to designate routes in their core path networks. That flexibility 
also extends to the point raised by my colleague John Home Robertson about the 
appropriateness of the use of paths by access takers&#151;it is important to recognise 
that not every path is as appropriate for horses as it might be for cyclists or 
pedestrians.</P><P>The creation of the fourth class of designated route is important 
to ensure that adequate provision is made in the core path network for all access 
takers, including those who are disabled, to exercise their rights of responsible 
access.</P><P><em>Amendment 74 agreed to.</EM></P><em> <P>Amendment 184 moved&#151;[Roseanna

82, which is largely technical, will remove sections 9(b)(ii) and 9(c). That is 
because section 9(b)(ii) contains a reference to subsection (2), which was deleted 
at stage 2. In addition, as a consequence of amendment 81, there will no longer 
be a need for section 9(c).</P><P>Amendments 83 and 84 seek to reintroduce provisions 
that were lost from the bill by the removal of section 9(2) at stage 2. I would 
like to reiterate what was said at that stage. The policy intention has never 
been for access rights to extend to hunting, shooting or fishing. It is important 
that the bill makes it explicit that hunting, shooting and fishing are not included 
within access rights.</P><P>The access forum recognised that fishing requires 
management and can be of high commercial value to the land manager. Moreover, 
a considerable body of common and statute law that relates to fishing might be 
at odds with a general right of access. As we indicated at stage 2, we acknowledge 
that there is scope to improve access for fishing, but we simply do not believe 
that the bill is the appropriate vehicle for that. As we explained in the green 
paper &quot;Scotland's Freshwater Fish and Fisheries: Securing Scotland's Future&quot;, 
our proposal is to undertake a review with the aim of repealing the Freshwater 
and Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act 1976 and to replace protection orders with 
a new system. Work on that is planned to start shortly. Access for fishing raises 
particular issues, which we are addressing, but more work is required. I hope 
that Dennis Canavan will accept that and not move amendment 83B.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17245">17245</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>On amendment 84, I acknowledge that there is still deep concern about dogs 
and other animals that might not be under proper control. Therefore, I propose 
to bring back the exclusion from access rights of</P><P>&quot;being on or crossing 
land while responsible for a dog or other animal which is not under proper control&quot;,</P><P>which 
would be provided for by amendment 84.</P><P>Amendment 85 seeks to address concerns 
over a possible consequence of Executive amendment 63 to section 1. That amendment 
includes a provision that will bring within access rights a range of commercial 
activities. However, concerns have been raised about activities such as commercial 
mushroom picking and the collection of sphagnum moss. I do not believe that such 
activities should be included within access rights. Amendment 85 would exclude 
from access rights</P><P>&quot;being on or crossing land for the purpose of taking 
away, for commercial purposes or for profit, anything in or on the land&quot;.</P><P>Amendments 
83A and 85A seek to remove the phrase</P><P>&quot;being on or crossing land for 
the purpose of&quot;,</P><P>in relation to hunting, shooting or fishing, or taking 
away anything in or on the land for commercial purpose or for profit. I have carefully 
considered the matter and am willing to accept that hunting, shooting and fishing 
should be excluded from access rights. I am, therefore, content to accept amendment 
83A. However, I am not convinced by amendment 85A. It seems to me that the intent 
to take away mushrooms in order to sell them, as well as the actual taking, should 
quite properly be excluded from access rights. Therefore, I ask Roseanna Cunningham 
not to move amendment 85A.</P><P>Amendment 42 would exclude from access rights 
doing anything that would disturb animals or commercial activities on land. As 
I said at stage 2, section 2 of the bill provides that access rights must be exercised 
without undue interference with the rights of others. The access code will contain 
more detailed guidance on the responsible exercise of access rights and will cover 
situations where commercial activities are under way. I am satisfied that existing 
legislation provides for offences of intentional disturbance of wildlife. Moreover, 
we intend to address reckless disturbance in forthcoming legislation on wildlife 
crime. I am therefore not convinced of the need for a specific provision relating 
to disturbance of wildlife in the bill. That view is shared by Scottish Natural 
Heritage. I ask Bill Aitken not to move amendment 42.</P><P>I move amendment 81.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17246">17246</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Diesel Spills (Safety Campaign)</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </STRONG>The final item of business 
is a members' business debate on motion S1M-3430, in the name of Brian Adam, on 
a safety campaign on diesel spills. The debate will be concluded without any question 
being put.</P><P><em>Motion debated,</em></P><P>That the Parliament notes with 
regret the distressing number of motorcycle accidents and fatalities caused by 
diesel spills and believes that the Scottish Executive should run a road safety 
campaign to highlight the dangers of over-filling diesel tanks and introduce other 
measures to reduce diesel spills.</P><P>17:03</P><P><strong>Brian Adam (North-East 
Scotland) (SNP): </strong>The background to my request for the debate is that 
there are a significant number of accidents that involve motorcycles. Indeed, 
there are far too many, some of which, unfortunately, result in fatalities. Up 
to 10 per cent of those accidents are believed to have been caused as a direct 
result of diesel spills.</P><P>We can start to tackle the problem in a number 
of areas. Clearly, the matter is a safety issue, and some such matters are covered 
by other legislatures. In that respect, I accept that the role of the minister 
will be to encourage his colleagues elsewhere. I advise the chamber that a European 
directive governing the matter is on its way, and I encourage the minister to 
take an active interest in the development of that directive. The regulation of 
vehicles is a matter for Westminster, but the Executive has a role in general 
safety and environmental issues and it takes an active interest in many aspects 
of road safety. The aspect that we are discussing is a highly particular one, 
and I do not suggest for a minute that the bulk of accidents on the road are caused 
by diesel spill, but it is a cause of accidents that can be addressed. I believe 
that the Executive has the powers to do that and I will suggest one or two specific 
measures.</P><P>I want to highlight some of the reasons why I have raised the 
issue. Obviously, I have been lobbied. Various motorcycle interest groups, including 
the United Kingdom Motorcycle Action Group, have approached me, and I have been 
lobbied by the parents of a young man who, unfortunately, was killed as a consequence 
of slipping on a diesel spill while on his motorcycle. In the past year or so, 
a couple of incidents in the north-east of Scotland have been drawn to my </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17250">17250</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>attention. I received an e-mail from someone who is actively involved in the 
Motorcycle Action Group, which mentions that a relative of his was the driver 
in a recent incident on Speyside in which a motorcyclist was seriously hurt. There 
are obvious implications for the individuals who are hurt in such accidents, but 
there are also implications for people who are innocently involved by being the 
driver of a car.</P><P>Diesel spills do not affect only motorcyclists, although 
they are affected more than other road users. A fairly serious incident to the 
south of Aberdeen in which a couple of cars went off the road was a consequence 
of a major diesel spill. The minister is probably aware that legal action might 
be pending on that matter.</P><P>I believe that the Executive can take action 
through safety campaigns. The Executive rightly runs regular safety campaigns 
on issues such as drink driving, drug driving and speeding. I encourage the Executive 
to consider a public campaign on the dangers of diesel spill. The campaign should 
encourage motorcyclists to be aware of potential hazards and where they are likely 
to occur. The hazards are often at petrol or diesel station exits and at roundabouts. 
I am sure that members have regularly observed motorcyclists going almost right 
across roundabouts, closely hugging the centre. The reason is not just so that 
they can go, &quot;Vroom, vroom,&quot; and create a bit of speed; it is because 
diesel is spilled on the extreme outside of roundabouts. If caps on diesel tanks 
are poorly fitted, are not fitted at all or leak, driving round corners and, in 
particular, roundabouts leads to leakage from the tank, and diesel gathers on 
the edges of roundabouts. The minister can address that issue.</P><P>The minister 
could also attempt to enforce the current legislation under which it is an offence 
to spill fuel&#151;he could encourage the law to be used fully. In the light of 
his announcement today about the road haulage modernisation fund, which highlighted 
the grants that are available to hauliers to retrofit their lorries with new technology 
that reduces emissions and cuts pollution, I suggest that we also require a sensor 
to be fitted that can determine whether diesel caps are in place and whether they 
are effective. That would significantly reduce pollution, increase fuel efficiency 
and&#151;most important&#151;increase safety. I encourage the minister to draw 
on the fund, which has a parallel south of the border, for use elsewhere in the 
United Kingdom.</P><P>Lorries and buses, which are the primary offenders, do not 
originate only in Scotland. In fact, they can come from anywhere, and when we 
get legislation from Europe, there will be many foreign lorries on our roads.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17251">17251</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>We ought to target the safety campaign at the major fleet users of diesel. 
We should encourage them to live up to the International Organisation for Standardisation's 
standard 4001&#151;I think that that is the correct standard, but the appropriate 
people will, no doubt, correct me if I am wrong. A number of organisations are 
good at enforcing such legislation. I point the minister in the direction of Transco, 
for instance. We should try to make use of the best practice that exists.</P><P>I 
ask the minister to consider various aspects of the safety campaign. I also ask 
him to consider using the road haulage modernisation fund, which he announced 
today, to fund retrofitting of sensors to identify the presence or otherwise of 
fuel caps.</P><P>I commend the motion to the Parliament.</P><P>17:12</P><P><strong>David 
Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>I thank Brian Adam for bringing the 
issue before the Parliament. It is one of those that go unnoticed unless they 
are highlighted.</P><P>Motorcycle fatalities on our roads are increasing. We need 
to address that. I was most concerned to learn that, in 2000, 605 motorcyclists 
were killed on the roads and a further 6,769 were seriously injured.</P><P>We 
are all aware of a number of campaigns that have been run to increase motorcycle 
safety, particularly those run to increase car drivers' awareness that motorcyclists 
might be on the roads, but I do not recall diesel spillages being highlighted. 
However, when I did some investigation, it was clear that the issue is real for 
the motorcyclists to whom I spoke. Indeed, in various motorcycle groups and on 
websites, diesel spillages are highlighted as one of the key hazards that motorcyclists 
face, and various pieces of guidance are given.</P><P>To give guidance to motorcyclists 
on avoiding diesel on the roads is one thing, but the most appropriate way to 
tackle the issue is to try to ensure that the diesel is not on the road in the 
first place.</P><P>We are highlighting the dangers of diesel spillages to other 
road users, but such spillages also have a significant environmental impact. Indeed, 
in the region that I represent, there was, on 4 December last year, a major diesel 
spillage near the village of Newcastleton, which not only created a major road 
hazard, but leaked into water supplies that were used as a private source of drinking 
water. The presence of diesel on the roads can be not just a hazard; it can have 
an environmental effect, too.</P><P>I was interested to hear what Brian Adam said 
about roundabouts and junctions. Diesel out-spill </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17252">17252</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>from vehicles can also be a problem at corners. I understand that the Institute 
of Advanced Motorists launched a campaign targeted at British lorry drivers to 
tackle the problem, and that it issued thousands of stickers for trucks' fuel 
tanks. The campaign was supported by the Road Haulage Association. However, it 
is one thing sticking a sticker on a tank; it is more important that the tank 
has an effective seal so that the fuel does not spill out on to the road.</P><P>If 
tonight's debate can achieve anything, it will highlight the issue and put the 
focus on stopping spillages taking place in the first place instead of concentrating 
resources on the accidents suffered by motorcyclists. If we can avoid having diesel 
on our roads and forecourts, we will avoid many unnecessary accidents.</P><P>17:16</P><P><strong>Mr 
Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>I, too, congratulate my colleague Brian 
Adam on securing the debate, and I concur with the points that he made. Diesel 
spills are a matter of significant importance to a minority, but they impact upon 
the majority in a variety of ways.</P><P>If I may transgress slightly and deal 
with more general matters, I point out that, if it were not for the inception 
of this institution&#151;although it takes a great deal of criticism&#151;debates 
such as this would have been difficult to secure. The Scottish Parliament, for 
all the brickbats that are flung at it, at least presents an opportunity for such 
matters to be debated, for a response to be given by the Executive and for individuals 
to have their views aired.</P><P>As has been said, diesel spills concern not just 
motorcyclists; the problem affects drivers of other vehicles. Difficulties with 
black ice are, to an extent, similar to those that are experienced with diesel 
spills, but the effects of spills can be just as dangerous and, because they not 
caused by the vagaries of the weather, we can do something about them.</P><P>It 
is to the minister's credit that attempts have been made to enhance road safety. 
Indeed, such attempts were also made by his predecessor. Clearly, transport policy 
is not all about the construction of a road infrastructure, not does it all relate 
to massive capital investment in roads and rail. Action can be of relatively minor 
significance, but can have massive ramifications. That brings us back to a point 
to which my colleague Brian Adam alluded.</P><P>The issue that we are discussing 
this evening may affect only a few people in terms of the number of road deaths 
that it causes, but that is of little comfort to the bereaved whose loved ones 
have been killed in accidents. However, it is to be </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17253">17253</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>hoped that the problem can be addressed and that action will be taken as a 
result. We must tackle the problem. The numbers involved may be few, but for the 
individuals concerned, the effects are significant.</P><P>Tackling the problem 
would not require masses of legislation. That is the benefit of dealing with such 
matters by way of a members' business debate. Brian Adam referred to using the 
road haulage modernisation fund, and doing that would not require legislative 
change; much more carrot, rather than stick, would be required. We are trying 
not just to educate the motorcyclist with regard to the actions that they should 
take to avoid areas where spillages are most likely, but to target the drivers 
of the vehicles that cause the incidents in an attempt to ensure best practice.</P><P>I 
welcome the fact that the minister was promoting the road haulage modernisation 
fund earlier today. As Brian Adam said, the fund offers an opportunity to deal 
with the specific issue of diesel spills and the difficulties that they cause 
to motorists, but we must promote best practice across the board in response to 
the knock-on effects of spills in other respects.</P><P>We must pay tribute to 
Brian Adam for bringing this matter to the attention of the Parliament. I hope 
that the Executive will take it on board. We do not need to spend a great deal 
more money than is already being spent to provide training in a variety of areas. 
This is a matter of ensuring that those who are involved in the distribution of 
diesel, in particular, follow best practice. People who work in garages should 
take steps to ensure that spillages are dealt with. We should follow best practice 
when training those who use motorcycles&#151;an activity in which I do not claim 
to participate.</P><P>The debate offers the Parliament an opportunity, through 
the democratically elected Executive, to bring about significant change&#151;albeit 
for a minority&#151;that will have substantial benefits. That will ensure that 
the Parliament delivers what the people of Scotland voted for.</P><P>17:20</P><P><strong>Robin 
Harper (Lothians) (Green): </strong>I would like to highlight two issues. Two 
years ago, I received representations in respect of general concerns about sloppiness 
in the transfer of fuels. Those concerns related both to the loading and unloading 
of fuel tankers and to the amount of fuel that escapes through evaporation. In 
confined areas, evaporating fuel, which contains benzines and other aromatic carbons, 
can have damaging effects on health.</P><P>My second concern relates to the policing 
of the upkeep of lorries and buses. Do the police </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17254">17254</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>produce regular reports on instances that they have discovered of poor maintenance 
of lorries and on the issue that Brian Adam raised this evening&#151;that of ill-fitting 
caps on diesel tanks and diesel transport lorries? It strikes me that a simple 
design change could be made to the tanks of big lorries, whose fuel caps tend 
to be at the side, so that the tanks could be filled up easily. If a cap is poorly 
fitted, diesel can slop out through it when the lorry goes round a corner. If 
the cap were raised by a foot or 2ft, fuel would not be spilled when the lorry 
went round a corner&#151;it would go up and down the fuel pipe. The industry could 
consider providing a screw-on addition that could be fixed in place, or the change 
that I have suggested could be a design feature of future tanks, to reduce the 
possibility of spills occurring.</P><P>17:23</P><P><strong>The Deputy Minister 
for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning (Lewis Macdonald): </strong>I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to address this issue and I congratulate Brian 
Adam on securing the debate. I suspect that the speeches that have been made reflect 
a broad consensus that such issues ought to be addressed. Although primary responsibility 
for this matter lies elsewhere&#151;as Brian Adam said&#151;aspects of it are 
relevant to the Executive and, therefore, of interest to the Parliament.</P><P>I 
want to put my response in the context of our general road safety policy. Members 
will be aware that we have set a target for a 40 per cent reduction by the end 
of this decade in the number of people who are killed and seriously injured on 
our roads, compared with the average figure for the years 1994 to 1998. We have 
made significant progress towards achieving that target. By 2001, the number of 
people killed and seriously injured on our roads was 22 per cent below the baseline 
figure. We are moving in the right direction, but major issues remain to be addressed. 
One or two of those have been mentioned specifically in today's debate. Any road 
death is one too many.</P><P>Rightly, our approach to road safety strategy is 
based on partnership with our United Kingdom colleagues in the Department for 
Transport. We share responsibility for measures to address specific issues relating 
to motorcycle safety and, as has been said, for road safety education and publicity.</P><P>We 
recognise that, as Brian Adam said, oil or diesel on the road constitutes a danger 
to road users and that motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable in such circumstances. 
The figures that Brian Adam cited on the proportion of road accidents in which 
oil or diesel on the road was involved are different from those that I will cite 
later in my speech. Nonetheless, I recognise the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17255">17255</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>significance of any accident that is avoidable and of measures that can be 
taken to avoid such accidents.</P><P><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) 
(SNP): </strong>Clearly, Brian Adam has brought an important issue to the attention 
of the Parliament. Will the minister comment on the law with regard to diesel 
spillages? If such spillages are illegal, have there been any prosecutions in 
the past year or two?</P><P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>A number of pieces 
of legislation are in place, but Richard Lochhead's question highlights one of 
the difficulties in this area, which is securing enforcement. Brian Adam referred 
to a legal case that relates to a diesel spillage. To support the police in securing 
the enforcement of legislation, we require the co-operation of all road users. 
The witnessing of an offence by a police officer, or the reporting of an offence 
to a police officer, is the only way in which enforcement can be secured and we 
encourage all road users to take that seriously.</P><P>Primary responsibility 
for ensuring that road users are responsible lies with the Driving Standards Agency. 
Matters relating to spillages on the road are included in the syllabus for the 
theory test for road-vehicle drivers. The theory test for motorcyclists includes 
the dangers of oil and diesel on the road.</P><P>David Mundell mentioned the sticker 
campaign that the Institute of Advanced Motorists launched with the support of 
the Road Haulage Association. Such initiatives are welcome and can help us highlight 
those issues for road users.</P><P>This morning I announced that we will support, 
through the Scottish road haulage modernisation fund, a number of important schemes 
that we identified as priorities in partnership with the Freight Transport Association, 
the Road Haulage Association, the Transport and General Workers Union and the 
Road Haulage and Distribution Training Council.</P><P>Reference was made to technical 
aspects to do with evaporation and other emission issues, which Robin Harper raised, 
rather than to do with spillage, but I take the points that were made. This morning 
we announced a number of training schemes for road-vehicle drivers, which could 
be of benefit in that area.</P><P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>All that was available 
to me was the minister's press release. I made the technical point that, presumably, 
it would be feasible to have retrofit devices that would identify whether a cap 
was in place. Will the minister take up that point as part and parcel of the modernisation 
fund and will he discuss it with colleagues south of the border?</P><P><strong>Lewis 
Macdonald: </strong>I am happy to discuss those </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17256">17256</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>technical matters with those in the UK Government who have responsibility for 
the technical standards that are applied to freight vehicles. As I said a moment 
ago, the training provision in the fund, which we will fund to the tune of 5 
million over the next three years, will include measures to secure cost savings 
and greater efficiency in the use of fuel. Part of that will be to identify how 
fuel spillages can be avoided, which we welcome.</P><P>The industry has been invited 
to continue to talk to us about other ways in which road haulage modernisation 
can be progressed with public support and I am happy to discuss that. We regularly 
meet representatives of the motor cycling community in Scotland, including the 
Motorcycle Action Group, the Motor Cycle Industry Association and the British 
Motorcyclists Federation. They have not raised directly with us the issues that 
have been mentioned this evening, but they have raised them with the UK Department 
for Transport, which is considering closely the problems that are posed by diesel 
spillage. Among other things, the department is considering raising the profile 
of existing legislation in England and Scotland and it is considering enforcement.</P><P>I 
am happy to draw to the attention of my colleagues in the Department for Transport 
the issues that have been raised this evening and to have discussions with them, 
particularly where the issues relate to devolved matters. That relates to the 
role of the Scottish Road Safety Campaign, to which I will come.</P><P>I mentioned 
that the figures that we have do not indicate that a large proportion of serious 
and fatal motorcycle accidents are caused by diesel spills. In 2001, out of a 
total of nearly 15,000 accidents involving injury in Scotland, there were 33 accidents 
in which oil or diesel on the road was identified as a significant component. 
Nonetheless, we take on board the fact that such accidents occur.</P><P><strong>Brian 
Adam: </strong>One of the issues that the Motorcycle Action Group raised with 
me was the method of gathering statistics. I said that up to 10 per cent of all 
accidents involving motorcycles were due to diesel. That figure, which came from 
the Motorcycle Action Group, related to studies that have been done across Europe. 
I cannot imagine that the situation elsewhere is significantly worse than it is 
here. Specific measures should be developed to identify the role of diesel spills 
in accidents. That is a matter for the Government south of the border, rather 
than for the Executive.</P><P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Scottish Road 
Safety Campaign works with the Motorcycle Action Group in identifying issues of 
concern and in promoting the &quot;Bikesafe Scotland&quot; training initiative, 
in which the Scottish police forces co-operate.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col17257">17257</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The Scottish Road Safety Campaign has to found its decisions on major publicity 
campaigns on the available evidence. As has been mentioned, drink-driving, drug-driving, 
excessive use of speed and the inadequate use of safety belts are the key issues 
on which major publicity campaigns have been conducted.</P><P>The Department for 
Transport is considering enforcement and raising the profile of existing legislation, 
and we will pay close attention to its conclusions. Last year, the UK Government 
ran a publicity campaign on motorcycle safety in Scotland, as well as in the rest
