Officer&nbsp;<a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_2"></a>(Sir David Steel): </font></strong><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Before
we start on the business of the day, I have one announcement to make. I
want to correct the announcement of the vote on prayers that was made yesterday.
The figures were transposed, and should have been announced as follows:
For 69, Against 37, Abstentions 15. The motion was carried. The incorrect
announcement makes no difference to the vote, but I am sorry that it was
made.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are also having teething troubles with
the business bulletin, and I ask for your indulgence on that. It has now
been suggested and agreed in informal discussion with the Parliamentary
Bureau that we will not take the motion on the summer recess today because
it has not yet been agreed. Mr McCabe will withdraw the motion that is
on the business bulletin, and Mr Russell will withdraw his amendment. Instead,
there will be a short business motion dealing with the formal meetings
over the bank holiday. It will be lodged by Mr McCabe now and be taken
at the end of this afternoon's debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have been considering the fact that a
very large number of members want to speak in today's main debate. For
that reason, I am proposing that the debate should be extended until 12
pm, that we should then adjourn for lunch, and that we should debate the
appointment of junior ministers in the afternoon for an hour from 2.30
pm. That will enable more members to participate. Normally such motions
would be ordered in advance, but I hope that members will find this a more
convenient arrangement that will allow a more extended debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also propose that there be one debate,
with separate votes at the end on the amendments that I have selected.
At the start of the debate, after the First Minister has moved his motion,
I shall ask that the two amendments that I have selected be moved formally.
We will then have a general debate, taking the votes on the amendments
at the end. Instead of splitting up the proceedings into short debates
on each amendment, there will be one general debate. I hope that that,
too, will be to the convenience of Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Is it agreed? It is agreed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

It would be far more appropriate to take separate votes on the appointment
of those individuals, particularly in the case of amendment 5.1, as the
business bulletin shows that a number of motions were lodged relating to
Nicol Stephen, but only one relating to Iain Smith. Conflating them in
this way creates difficulties for members who wish to vote for one or other
candidate. I ask you to separate out those votes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> I took that
into account, but decided that there had to be a limit to the number of
amendments that I could accept if we were to have rational debate. I took
the amendments that were broader in scope; in other words, those that included
two names. You can, Mr Russell, distinguish in the debate between Nicol
Stephen and Iain Smith, but I am afraid that as far as the vote is concerned,
Mr Smith will have to suffer guilt by association.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><strong><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister&nbsp;<a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_4"></a>(Donald
Dewar): </font></strong><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that we do, in fact,
have rational debate this morning and on all occasions. This is a motion
of some interest. It is a motion to approve or give support to a ministerial
list which, if that support is forthcoming, will be submitted to Her Majesty
the Queen. That is a significant innovation to our constitutional practice
and I welcome it. It is an opportunity to commend a team that will work
hard for Scotland and deliver what Scots want.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the whole-I am perhaps trying my luck
in saying this-the ministerial list has been reasonably well received,
although there has been the odd mixed notice. That is inevitable, and I
would describe it as Opposition parties on automatic pilot, or, old habits
die hard.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mike Russell was quoted as describing me
and my colleagues as "party hacks and apparatchiks". That is certainly
a subject in which he is expert. He has practised the art with great distinction
for a number of years, but I suggest to him that he is wrong on this occasion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The ministerial list has also been condemned
as a central belt clique, I think by David McLetchie or by some of his
apparatchiks and party hacks. I suggest that if that is his best argument,
he is getting very short of ammunition very early in the campaign. He may
be interested that there is an east-west balance-which I believe is good-in
the Administration as a whole. He will note that around 25 per cent of
the ministerial team are women, and that a third of the team come from
outwith the central belt. I am glad about the fact that there is a minister
from every one of the eight list regions on which the electoral system
was based. There is a genuine spread.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>Is it not the case that the First Minister could hardly miss with respect
to selecting members from every region, given that one in six MSPs will
become a Government minister?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister:</strong> Phil Gallie
is a great expert in missing. His point gives me a terrible and horrible
feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu-I suppose that I will overcome that in
time. As far as I am concerned, the figures speak for themselves. It is
a fair and good spread. The people in my team were picked on merit-I ought
to make that very clear. It is not a pedantic matter of geographical balance,
but the outcome is a happy one.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of extravagance and of the&nbsp;</font></td>

equivalent of loose living. It is the first time in a long time that I
have been accused of loose living and I am quite flattered. I have to disown
the compliment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also like the fact that <i>The Scotsman</i>
yesterday accused us of having put in place a series of faction captains.
I do not know who I would put in that category. Rather quaintly, it went
on to say that too much attention had been paid to the</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"dishonourable tradition of rewarding loyalty".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is an interesting insight into how
the editor of <i>The Scotsman</i> picks his team. I can think of a few
people in that team whose presence is explained by that, but I should not
pursue that line too far, or I will make enemies where, of course, I have
friends.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The outstanding feature of the Administration
is that it is a partnership Administration and a coalition Administration.
That fact has produced heavy attacks from some predictable quarters. The
huddle of amendments that we are discussing today is the end product of
those attacks.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There has been an attack on the basis of
the coalition and on the circumstances of the case, but-perhaps more surprisingly
and more fundamentally-there has been root-and-branch opposition to the
principle of coalition.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Inevitably, I have to take the arguments
in a short space of time. I will deal with the basis of the coalition and
with the circumstances of the case. A great deal of the fire has been directed
at the question of tuition fees. The issue is surrounded by controversy,
and I concede that there is considerable opposition to the current policy.
My colleagues in the Liberal Democrat party have made it very clear that
they stand where they did, but we have all agreed that there ought to be
a proper inquiry before there is action, and that there ought to be a proper
investigation of all aspects of higher and further education funding in
Scotland. That seems to be a matter almost of common sense. It is known
by the Parliament that we have had a massive range of representations from
higher education, saying that we should not snatch at the matter and that
we should not just rush to abolish tuition fees, but that we should try
to get right something that is a very complicated issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That view has been put to us by the Association
of University Teachers (Scotland), by the Committee of Scottish Higher
Education Principals and by the National Union of Students. I ought to
say that the NUS has made it clear that it wants the abolition of tuition
fees, but it still argues that there should be a full inquiry first so
that we get it right.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister:
</strong>I will finish this passage before I give way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All those organisations argue that case
because they fear that if we snatch at the decision, if we rush to judgment,
we may attack the wrong target and end up with the wrong result. We must
define our objectives. John Swinney-to whom I will give way in a minute-will
surely agree that we must consider access, the number of places and the
most effective way of broadening the student base of higher education and
that we must deal with the future financial consequences of any changes
that we introduce. Given that, it is perfectly honourable, good practice
and good sense for the Parliament to say that we will consider these things
properly and that we will get impartial advice before we take that decision.
I will be interested to hear the attack that I presume is about to come
because I would have thought that a cautious man such as Mr Swinney would
take the view that that was proper preparation for decision making.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>It has certainly taken
a long time to get to the end of that passage-it seemed to be the longest
on earth. I accept the points the First Minister is making in relation
to the commentary by the AUT and the Committee of Scottish Higher Education
Principals and other organisations, but there was one important group of
people that he missed out of his explanation of the body of opinion, and
that is the electorate. By voting for the Conservative party, the Scottish
National party, the Liberal Democrats and the three independent members,
the electorate said quite clearly that it did not want tuition fees. Where
is the electorate in this cosy coalition between the Labour party and the
Liberal Democrats?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I think that
the electorate takes the view that good decision making should be the mark
of a mature Parliament. I am interested to hear that it was a single-issue
election. Most of the nationalists I talked to made claims about certain
other issues being the determining factor, and said that those issues were
what took people into the SNP and that lobby, if I can put it that way,
and made them put crosses against SNP candidates.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Information is constantly shifting on tuition
fees. I had some figures just the other day that may be of interest-I use
them only as a symbol of the need for full information. The assessments
by the Students Awards Agency for Scotland this year show that 54 per cent
of students will pay no tuition fees, 23 per cent will be on the taper
and 23 per cent will pay full fees. That is a very significant shift on
the figures that I was using only a few months ago. I very, very clearly
take the position that we want to get this right. This Parliament is supposed
to be about talking-certainly-but also about listening and about learning.

</strong>Does the First Minister acknowledge that the majority of the Scottish
electorate voted against tuition fees? Do Liberal members of the Parliament,
as far as he is aware, have a free vote after the commission of inquiry
has reported?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I recognise
that a majority of votes were cast for parties that had that as one issue
in their manifesto. That is very different from saying that it was a one-issue
election or that such a simple connection can be made. I know that Mr Salmond
is good at making oversimple connections, but I think that that is a dangerous
one for him to make. What we must do is see the outcome of the inquiry,
assuming the Parliament agrees to set it up, and make proper judgments
on that basis.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second point I want to address about
the coalition is whether coalition is in itself in some way inherently

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">coalitions, as
every member will know. One such coalition existed between 1994 and 1996
in an important unit of government, the Grampian Region. The SNP was in
coalition-I almost hesitate to mention-with the Liberal Democrats, heaven
forfend. I presume that that coalition was established because the SNP
wanted an administration that could deliver a policy that would give a
sense of direction and which would work in a constructive and proper way.
At the time, those were very good reasons for entering into that coalition,
and those same arguments apply now. I hope that people will accept and
understand that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am always surprised by the attitudes
of the SNP. Sometimes I am astonished by them, Sir David, but let us leave
that for another occasion. I remind SNP members that they have advocated
proportional representation for as many years as I can remember, yet they
are totally unwilling to live with the consequences of the policy that
they advocated. That was pointed out to them, repeatedly and tirelessly,
by the press and others during the election campaign. It is absolutely

that it is right for the country and not simply for sectional interests.
I agree that those who are not in the coalition may be disappointed by
the fact that they are not included. [<i>Laughter.</i>] The derisive laugher

to think that if one puts a policy before the electorate in one's party
manifesto, and claims on national television two days before voting that
it is non-negotiable, one should not ditch that policy after the election
for the sake of a vestige of power. Those back benchers are right. They
are the honourable members in the Liberal Democrat party. It is a pity
that they belong to a dishonourable party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Liberal Democrats have been exposed
for what they are: totally unprincipled and happy to whelp as Labour's
lapdogs. Jim Wallace may have claimed during the election campaign that
he would not trade principles for a ministerial Mondeo, but an Omega and
a deputy's badge have obviously done the trick.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Liberal Democrats seem to think that
they will get a free vote on tuition fees after the independent commission
has reported. The fact of the matter is, as we all know, that they will
be bound and whipped by the final decision of the Cabinet, which has a
majority of Labour members who are wholly opposed to abolition.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Liberal Democrats have been taken for
a ride by Labour. Either one accepts the principle of free higher education
for students and young people or one does not. There is no need for an
independent commission to adjudicate on that, so it is a pointless exercise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

McLetchie's argument, the implication of which seems to be that he is in
favour of free higher education. Why then did the Conservatives introduce
loans, and why does he not advocate their abolition?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>There is a distinction
between tuition fees and maintenance for students while they are studying.
There is free school education-nursery, primary and secondary-but nobody
is suggesting that the Government should pay maintenance awards to parents
for looking after their children.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is not as though this Government could
not afford to lose a couple of ministers. Losing Jim Wallace and Ross Finnie
would help to shrink a top-heavy Administration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Let us consider the numbers. There is the
new Secretary of State for Scotland-and it would be churlish not to congratulate
Dr Reid on his appointment to that distinguished office-and his two junior
ministers. There is the new post of Advocate General, and we congratulate
Lynda Clark on her appointment to that post. Then there is the First Minister
and his team. Altogether, some 24 ministers are carrying out the work that,
before the general election, was done by just five ministers. There are
now nearly five times as many ministers as there were.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Frankly, that is an outrage. It is an explosion
of bureaucracy and red tape, all of which must be paid for by the taxpayer.
Does anybody seriously think that the money to pay for all those ministers
and their entourage of special advisers, spin doctors, secretaries, chauffeurs
and so on, could not have been better spent on the education of our young
people? Some of that money could have been put towards funding the abolition
of tuition fees for higher education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I propose that we strike a blow for smaller,
smarter government in Scotland by putting this bloated Administration on
a diet. That means cutting out Jim Wallace and Ross Finnie. They are too
rich, indigestible and unpalatable. They deserve no less, for they are
guilty of perpetrating a massive fraud on the people of Scotland at the
election. Their masters will no doubt save them today, but the people will

with the dignified elections of the Presiding Officer and the First Minister,
and the meetings were convened in a dignified way. However, I do not think
that the Executive can be said to have got off to a particularly good start.
It is important to remember the contents of "Partnership for Scotland:
An Agreement for the First Scottish Parliament", which state what this
Administration will put to the Parliament. The document covers a number
of areas where the hopes that we had for this Parliament to be the start
of a new politics in Scotland have been thwarted by the actions of the
coalition Administration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr McLeish is a key minister in that Administration
and is responsible for one of the most sensitive policy areas. His foreword
to the consultative steering group report on the Scottish Parliament raised
a great deal of hope in Scotland. He wrote:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"In all our deliberations we have been
struck by the degree of consensus that exists. In particular, that the
establishment of the Scottish Parliament offers the opportunity to put
in place a new sort of democracy in Scotland, closer to the Scottish people
and more in tune with Scottish needs. People in Scotland have high hopes
for their Parliament, and in developing our proposals we have been keen
to ensure that these hopes will be met. In particular, our recommendations
envisage an open, accessible Parliament; a Parliament where power is shared
with the people".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Where, in this "Partnership for Scotland"
agreement, are the people who voted decisively for the abolition of tuition
fees in the election on 6 May? They have been forgotten in the negotiations
for the coalition Administration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have before us a proposal on tuition
fees that nobody had heard about and that nobody was offered on 6 May.
It has been cobbled together so that this Administration could be formed
and it excludes the clear and express opinion of people in Scotland that
tuition fees should be abolished. The overwhelming majority of the members
of this Parliament were elected to deliver on that opinion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Hugh Henry (Paisley South) (Lab): </strong>Mr
Swinney says that the people of Scotland voted overwhelmingly for the abolition
of tuition fees and that that was what they were voting for when they voted
for the SNP. Will he now accept that, in voting for the SNP, people were
voting only for the abolition of tuition fees and not for independence?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>I think that the SNP's
performance and achievement is clear from the outcome of the election.
This Parliament, which remains within the United Kingdom constitution,

of tuition fees, but the actions of some members since 6 May have not contributed

policy commitment. That is the key point that emerges from this debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr McLeish is to be supported in his work
by Nicol Stephen, who is the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning. Over the past 24 hours, a number of remarks have been made that
show the difficulties that this coalition Administration will have to overcome
if they are to deliver on the partnership document, irrespective of whether
that document reflects any of the aspirations of the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The coalition agreement has failed to recognise
what the Liberal Democrat manifesto said about beef on the bone. It has
failed to deliver any real change to the privatisation of public services
and it has failed to abolish tolls on the Skye bridge. The coalition Administration
has cast aside all those things.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must focus the debate on tuition fees-that
is the fundamental point about the way in which this coalition has been
constructed. On Sunday, Mr Ross Finnie said that we would be able to vote
freely according to our views on the report. The next day, it was reported
that Mr McLeish had said that, from the point at which the report was presented,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"collective cabinet responsibility holds
and we would anticipate that both parliamentary groups would support the
set of recommendations that we would put to the parliament."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unless I am mistaken, there is a contradiction
between those two arguments. My colleague Mr Salmond asked the First Minister
whether there would be a free vote when the report was produced. I do not
want to be uncharitable to the First Minister-I am never uncharitable to
him-but it was quite clear from his answer that he had dodged Mr Salmond's
question. There is no free vote. Mr McLeish makes the position absolutely
clear: when the independent commission reports on tuition fees, the Executive
will come to a conclusion about that report and the two coalition partners
will adhere to that conclusion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Somewhere along the line there is a fundamental
division of opinion at the heart of the coalition agreement. Will Liberal
Democrat members be able to apply independent discretion when the report
is produced? It sounds as though they will not.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Radio Scotland this morning, we heard
that, in the foreword to the partnership document, the First Minister and
Mr Wallace had talked about the ability to deliver stable government. At
the heart of this coalition agreement is an issue on which the Scottish
election turned and a fundamental disagreement about the rights of the
coalition partners in the Administration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD):
</strong>During the election campaign, we heard much about the new style of
politics that would pervade our new Parliament. We heard mention of greater
consensus or even compromise-that dirty word of politics. We heard that
there would be more consultation with the people before decisions were
taken. Above all, the pledge that was given to the people of Scotland was
that this Parliament would be different from Westminster.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The perception so far may be that this
Parliament is no different from Westminster, but the reality is that it
is quite different. We have proportional representation, which delivered
129 of us into this chamber. PR has made a difference. It has meant that,
instead of another humiliating defeat for our friends in Mr McLetchie's
party, that party has 18 MSPs. The reality of PR means that, instead of
seven first-past-the-post members for Mr Salmond's party, the SNP has the
moderate success of some 35 members.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The biggest difference has been that PR
has meant that, unlike Westminster, there is no winner takes all-no party
was given a mandate to deliver the whole of its manifesto. That means that
every party in this chamber is a minority. To deliver stable government
for Scotland, compromises had to be made between two parties. I am not
ashamed of the word compromise; it means that two parties have come together
to deliver the partnership document for the Scottish people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have heard much about the important
issue of tuition fees. Liberal Democrats believe that the right way in
which to proceed is for us to go out to consultation and for the committee

in Argyll and Bute, which he and I shared so comfortably-to the abolition
of tuition fees? That commitment now seems to be on the back burner, with
the result that we must wait and see what happens. If he gave such a commitment,
would not his election to that constituency be a mandate to stay true to
his principles rather than to sell out in this way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>George Lyon: </strong>There is no sell-out.
During the campaign, I stated that we were opposed to tuition fees; we
will testify to the inquiry on that basis. I take it that the SNP and the
Tory party will do the same. We hope that the inquiry will return a verdict
that will support our position. I will listen to that verdict before we
vote on the subject. That is what is stated in the partnership document
and we agree with it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>Once he has done all
that, and once he has considered the matter, will he have a free vote on

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>George Lyon: </strong>As I stated clearly,
I will make up my mind and take into consideration what is said in the

still opposed to tuition fees and we will be able to make up our own minds
when the day comes. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> Order. Mr
Lyon, as you are near the end of your four minutes, please come to a conclusion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>George Lyon: </strong>To sum up, the "Partnership
for Scotland" document delivers. It delivers &pound;51 million extra on
education and &pound;29 million extra to help the poorest students. It
delivers by creating a new Minister for Rural Affairs, who will deliver
for rural Scotland. It delivers for much of the agricultural community
by setting up an independent arbitration system to ensure that farmers
are treated fairly in EU decisions. It delivers by setting up a new body
to promote Scottish food; we supported that very clearly. It delivers on
beef on the bone-[<i>Laughter.</i>] The commitment is in black and white;
what Government would override scientific advice? Science has to be taken
into account; if science says no, we have to wait, but the commitment on
beef on the bone exists.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I support the partnership document. I believe
that it will give Scotland a stable Government and that the situation with
tuition fees will be resolved through the committee of inquiry. It is only

object specifically to the inclusion of Jim Wallace's name in the list
of ministers as Minister for Justice, but I cannot help but comment on
the farrago of nonsense that we have just heard from one of the Liberal
Democrat members. Mr Lyon showed in his speech that the Liberal Democrat
manifesto contained virtually nothing that we can take as a promise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Being the first Minister for Justice in
our nation is a hugely responsible task. I must ask whether Jim Wallace
has shown any real responsibility in recent weeks. I, too, have read the
consultative steering group report; it makes somewhat nostalgic reading
already. Jim Wallace was an assiduous member of that group. Its report
talked in terms of open, accessible and participative government, yet he
has connived at creating a situation where this debate is the only forum
in which we can raise issues about the so-called partnership agreement
between the Liberal Democrats and new Labour-so much for the new politics.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Members have, in effect, been presented
with a fait accompli. On a number of matters-tuition fees is perhaps the
most contentious, but it is not the only one, as we have heard-the majority
in Parliament will be overridden or side-stepped. That is not democracy
and it is not what the people expected. It is neither open nor just. We
are in danger of engendering disappointment and alienation among voters.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are being asked to approve someone who
claimed that a key manifesto promise was nothing more than election rhetoric.
I wonder just what the word promise means in these circumstances. Perhaps
Jim Wallace will take the opportunity later today to outline how much of
the Liberal Democrat manifesto was nothing more than election rhetoric.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many Liberal Democrat members-including
some who are in the chamber today-and a vast number of their voters must
be considering the nature of trust. Liberal Democrats made promises that
were not going to be kept. Mr Wallace has shown that he and his party are
not to be trusted. Either he conducted the campaign in bad faith or he
is now open to the accusation that he is a naive dupe. Either way, it does
not look good on his CV.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

relating to the coalition.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr McLetchie objected to the number of
ministers. He would admit that the way in which for 100 years the Scottish
Office has been run by five ministers has hardly been a model of good government.
I have a limited personal experience of that; I assure members that covering
the number of portfolios that Scottish Office ministers used to cover in
the bad old days is not a recipe for good government. I commend the First
Minister for addressing that problem and ensuring that government in Scotland
can be conducted much more efficiently than it has been in the past.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The problem of quality on the Government
benches has been the embarrassment of riches among the new members. I have
found this Parliament a more competitive environment than Westminster when
it comes to appointments, but that is a good sign. It indicates the very
high quality of Labour members, who are the only ones for whom I will speak.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another noted achievement, which should
be celebrated today and on many other days, is that 50 per cent of our
members are women. As far as I know, we are the only substantial group
in any parliament in the world of which that is so. We should continually
receive praise from the people of Scotland for that achievement, which
I hope all the other parties will emulate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That achievement has resulted in the appointment
to the Cabinet of three remarkable women. As two of them are my neighbouring
MSPs, members will forgive me for mentioning them. Sarah Boyack was born
to be Minister for Transport and the Environment. Combining those two portfolios
for the first time represents an imaginative realignment in the Scottish
Office.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Susan Deacon has a key appointment as Minister
for Health and Community Care. Since the Government was elected in 1997,
it has taken a broad view of health policy, which will lead to an attack
on health inequality in particular. Susan is clearly the ideal person to
drive health policy forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Lest I forget, the third woman is Wendy
Alexander, who worked with me on the matters that she covers in the Scottish
Office. I can vouch for her great expertise in those areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

kiss of death when I said in the <i>Edinburgh Evening News</i> that one
of them would be the next First Minister, but no doubt we will see in time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The fact that parties will have different
relationships to one another is a key plank of the new politics. Given
that we had a voting system that was unlikely to deliver an overall majority,
I fail to see how anyone can complain about the fact that two parties are

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That does not mean that the Labour party
will not work differently with other parties as well. I hope that Labour
will have a new working relationship with the Tories and with the SNP,
although, because of past enmities, that will be difficult to achieve.
There will always be a fundamental divide between Labour and the SNP on
the constitutional question, but I hope that, in substantive policy areas
such as health and housing, we can work in a way that is unlike the Westminster
style.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

as will be the involvement of the wider public. Not having time to go into
those points in more detail, I will just say that the way in which we are
approaching tuition fees seems to be a good example of the new politics
working. We will involve people from outside and we will have a comprehensive
debate in the chamber. That is a more sophisticated view of politics than
the simplistic approach of individual party manifestos.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

policies. The nationalists and the Liberal Democrats launched their policies;
it was clear to those who now sit here and the electorate that those parties
were committed to the effective abolition of tuition fees. That was until
Mr Wallace's wobbly weekend, when, during an interview, the fact that negotiations
on tuition fees might be a part of coalition discussions became a possibility.
It was then incumbent on those taking part in the campaign to pin Mr Wallace
down. There followed a week of campaigning in which parties sought to ascertain
what he meant. I attended a number of meetings and participated in programmes,
and I well remember the Liberal Democrat spokesman intervening while Nicola
Sturgeon was speaking, to assure us that there was no way that tuition
fees would be negotiated on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It could not be clearer than that. He also

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Tuition fees are dead as of next Friday.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He was talking about the Friday after the

just in case there was a scintilla of doubt about what he had said in that

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"If Scotland gets the opportunity to blaze
a trail for the rest of the UK by abolishing tuition fees, we should grab
it."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We waited in expectation, knowing that
on that Friday tuition fees would go if the Liberal Democrats joined the
nationalists and the Tories, but the Liberal Democrats decided that they
could have an inquiry, buy time and possibly ensure that they could take
part in a coalition deal, even though in previous election material they
said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We now have clear and indisputable evidence
of the damage that Labour's tuition fees have done to Scottish education
. . . Abolishing tuition fees would instantly transform the situation."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They had no doubts; they had already made
up their mind. Nevertheless, when it came to the aftermath of the election
it was time to negotiate, to put tuition fees on the table and to talk
about having a committee of inquiry that could give them the opportunity
to ditch their promises later.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

me how he will vote when the inquiry is published and it recommends that
tuition fees should stay in place? Can the gentleman tell me how all the
other members of the Liberal Democrat party will vote? No? There we are.
The point that is clear is that the Liberal Democrats went into the election
with a clear commitment. They have brought shame not just to themselves,
but to the whole idea of what the Parliament could do. The people who will
be most hurt by that are those who voted for the Liberal Democrats, many
of whom left the Labour party in order to do so. Those people put their
trust in the Liberal Democrats and they will feel let down.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some people may think that we need to abolish
tuition fees and that I should be happy to see the Liberal Democrat party
in difficulty over the issue. That is not the point. It is clear to me
that the Liberal Democrat party has brought a greater cynicism towards
all politicians, not just to itself. It has brought shame to all members
of the Parliament and that is why it is important that we vote for the
removal of James Wallace and Ross Finnie from the list of ministers. They
do not stand for the things that they said that they would stand for, but
are working against them. The Scottish people need to see that the Scottish
Parliament takes notice of that and will remove them from the list of ministers.

to recognise the new political climate in Scotland. However, if it were

</strong>In light of the new coalition arrangement, will Mr Watson tell us precisely

party given up?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mike Watson: </strong>It is not the purpose
of the debate that I should answer such questions. The purpose of the debate
is to put forward and ratify the Cabinet that has emerged from the discussions.
As far as I am concerned, both political parties are satisfied with the
outcome, and that is what this form of Parliament was always going to be
about. It was absolutely predictable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the basic mistakes made by those
who fail to grasp the new political situation is that they suggest that
the Labour party should have gone into government on its own, and should
have walked that perpetual tightrope on every political issue. I suppose
that we should be flattered by that. However, such a Government would always
have been in danger of being knocked off at any point, perhaps without
notice, and I do not think that that is what the people of Scotland voted
for on 6 May. They voted for a system which meant that, if a party did
not get an overall majority, it had to enter into some form of agreement.
Nor do I think that the manifesto commitments of all the parties were held
to be indivisible, as there is no way that political parties, having stood
against one another during an election, could enter into any form of coalition
without each side giving something away in negotiations, and that is clearly
the case for this coalition.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Mr Watson talks about
the new political climate. I put it to him that perhaps the electorate
of Scotland made their judgment on the basis that there would be no overall
majority party, and that the Parliament would take each issue on its merits.
That is what the people of Scotland wanted and, by entering into a shady
deal, the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats have cheated the people

personally that it will, but it might not. The issue of tuition fees has
been raised to a ridiculous level of importance and, although I accept
that it is an important issue, it is not the most important issue to Scotland
as a whole. Tuition fees do not mean much to young, unemployed people,
or to a single parent living in a damp house. If agreement is reached today

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After 18 long years of Tory sell-outs in
Westminster, Scotland's fishing industry has been keenly looking forward
to the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, so that it has a forum
where its voice is heard, and where the industry is not used merely as
a bargaining chip. However, I fear that the appointment of Ross Finnie
will do little to improve the fortunes of the fishing industry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The industry continues to suffer from backroom
deals, whether those deals are made 500 miles away in London or around
the corner from this chamber. New Labour has picked up where the Tories
left off. A few days ago, it was revealed that Westminster had moved the
English boundary 60 miles into Scottish waters, and, by the passing of
an order in London, 6,000 square miles of Scottish waters had been stolen.
The fishing industry now faces the prospect of the English-Scottish boundary
being just east of Carnoustie. Even Ross Finnie, with his skills in accountancy,
will be unable to make sense of that ridiculous situation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

not consulted in any way, shape or form. Indeed, delegations are coming

was some deal cooked up in the partnership programme for government. To

will find out exactly why the fishing industry is concerned about the agreement
between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party. That industry is up
in arms. It was not consulted by any of the authorities. The Parliament
in Scotland was not consulted. Indeed, no courtesy was shown to the industry-it
found out about this theft only from someone who was at an oil industry
liaison meeting, when it crept up in conversation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another backroom deal was struck around
the corner, and we find yet again that the fishing industry is the victim
of a backroom deal. Thanks to this coalition, the importance of the fishing
industry has been reduced to 16 words out of a 24-page manifesto. That
is why the fishing industry is concerned about the coalition deal and why
it wants more attention to be shown.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

effect on the transportation of goods, which affects businesses, tourists

at.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister started this debate
by talking about how the Scottish National party was against the whole
concept and principle of coalition government. Nothing could be further
from the truth. What we are against is the misuse of coalition by the Labour
party, which simply assumes that its manifesto can be imposed on the Parliament,
on the country, and certainly on the minority party in the arrangement.
Let us separate the principle of coalition government from the rather tawdry

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I cannot be the only member who spent the
election campaign listening to a Liberal Democrat opponent-in my case the
aptly named Mr Lyon-who told everyone about his party's immutable and unalterable
commitment to the principle of free education. That principle was important
for people in rural areas, where we had to give people access to education
to give them a chance to improve their lives. It was a principle that would
garner support across the Parliament. Then, all of a sudden, the principle
changed. It did not change for any rational reason, and it did not change
after an inquiry; it changed purely because a few members of the Liberal
party fancied getting themselves into the Cabinet. George now says that,
after an inquiry, he will give us an answer as to whether he will have
a free vote or opinion. George did not need an inquiry before 6 May. I
am not sure what has changed. Perhaps he can tell me.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is not just about policy; it is also
about integrity. Many of the points that have been raised with me in reaction
to the coalition are about the death of a Liberal party in Scotland. No
one can deny that there is a long and proud tradition of liberal democracy
in Scotland, but we are seeing a massive sell-out. We are seeing the death
of a distinct political party, and its amalgamation into a larger Labour
party. That is a very bad thing for Scottish democracy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The point of proportional representation
is to encourage minority parties and the fractionising of the political
process to ensure that there is wider, more mature and more adult debate.
Rather than more parties and more opinions, what seems to be coming through
in the guise of coalition government is fewer parties and one opinion.
I suggest that that is a regressive step. As the leader in the negotiations,
Mr Wallace should take the responsibility for that. In opposing his appointment,
we must ask ourselves how a man who clearly cannot command the support

people can trust always to have their priorities at heart must be central
to that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I, for one, recognise the talent and determination
that Jack McConnell would bring to the post. He would think of nothing

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>I will not give
way yet. My remarks are in many respects directed towards Mr McLetchie's
amendment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In many ways, Labour has what it wanted-it
has subsumed the Liberals in this pact. I do not often refer to editorials
in the <i>Sunday Mail</i>, but I think that that paper got it just about
right last Sunday: "Liberal Democrats RIP." They have let down their electorate
and the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many members, including Mr Dewar, said
that this was not a one-issue election. There were, however, some issues
that dominated the campaign, one of which was student funding and, in particular,
tuition fees. During the hustings, I took part in many a debate with new
Labour members-I will not embarrass any of them by referring to them by
name-and I found it very difficult to get them to defend tuition fees.
Many of them said that the situation would have to be reviewed after the
election, which I think managed to hold off some of the revolt among the
students at the debates.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The difficulty is that more than 60 per
cent of the people of Scotland voted for political parties that said quite
clearly that they wanted tuition fees to be abolished. I agree with Mr
Watson's point that tuition fees should not become a b&ecirc;te noire.
Frankly, for the lone parents and unemployed people he mentioned, tuition
fees are not the main issue; the main issue is student maintenance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The other problem for new Labour is that
it has gone even further than the Tories. It is rather sad that we can
listen to representatives of the Tory party talking today about student
maintenance and support when that party's record of underfunding of education
and, in particular, attacks on students is nothing short of a disgrace.
The difficulty is that new Labour's performance is allowing the Tories
to behave like the students' friends, because new Labour has gone further
than the Tory party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many new Labour members, many of whom I
recognise in the chamber-I see Mr McConnell here, although I would not
want to embarrass anyone-benefited from the same educational opportunity
as I did. In 1981, under a Tory Government, I was able to attend Stirling
university, to receive a full maintenance grant and to claim housing benefit
between terms, free of the idea of tuition fees-although my parents' income
at the time would have meant that fees would not have been a factor. New
Labour has removed access to education for working-class children from
the housing schemes of Scotland because it has removed access to student
maintenance. That is why the deal that has been entered into with the&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>I may give way later.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

That is why I am not letting him in.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the Liberals had stuck to their guns
on the tuition fee argument, the issue of student funding would have been
raised very early on in the session. That is what we wanted, what the National
Union of Students wanted and, frankly, in the opinion of my party, what
the electorate of Scotland wanted. It is from that point of view that I
support Mr McLetchie's amendment. If people want new politics, there it
is; on this occasion the Scottish Socialist party is willing to support
his amendment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know that many members of new Labour
are sitting uncomfortably on the idea that new Labour is a party that has
gone further than the Tories in underfunding student support. Perhaps Mr
Dewar, if he were here, would confess that his concern about having a free
vote after an inquiry is not about the Liberals, but about members of his
party voting against fees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Des McNulty (Clydebank and Milngavie)
(Lab): </strong>During the past two weeks, I have been struck, as I am sure
have many other members, by the extent to which people of all shades of
political opinion in Scotland are enthused about the prospect of the new
Parliament and the opportunities it creates for better government of Scotland.
Almost everybody to whom one speaks wants this Parliament to succeed. It
is for that reason most of all, that I support the partnership agreement-it
provides a framework for meeting the aspirations of the Scottish people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Whichever aspect of policy people are concerned
with, the agreement delivers a secure and stable Government. I believe
that the Government will operate in a new, different and more integrated
way. It will seek solutions through extensive consultation and discussion-processes
we are all committed to-that will transcend departmental and organisational
boundaries. It will deliver, I hope, better co-ordinated and more effective
action. Goodness knows, people have elected a Parliament for a purpose,
not because it is a beautiful idea in principle. They want to change things
and see effective action taken. That is what we are here for. This is about
delivering for people.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Effective action
is vital across a range of policies, but I want to address the issue of
public health and social work. The health inequalities in Scotland are
an affront to our society and we must do something about them. I believe
that all parties in the Parliament have an obligation to deal with the
severe health inequalities that currently exist.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On a number of occasions, as Minister for
Health and the Arts, Sam Galbraith has highlighted the gulf in health between
different parts of Scotland. The example commonly used is that of Bearsden
and, just over the constituency boundary, Drumchapel. My constituency is
a microcosm of the health inequalities in Scotland: in Clydebank there
is poor health equivalent to that found in many parts of north and east
Glasgow; at the other end of my constituency there are leafy suburbs, including
not just Milngavie but a substantial part of Bearsden, where the health
status of the population is much better. We have to deal with those health
inequalities, which are to be found in areas that are so close to each
other, in an integrated way. Under this Government, I am confident that
one of the key priorities will be a general improvement in health and the
tackling of health inequalities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A great deal has been done since 1997.
I do not want to embarrass Sam Galbraith. He has ended the flawed internal
market, poured substantial resources into front-line services in health
and effectively promulgated the ethos of putting patients first. His biggest
achievement was to reject decisively the blame culture established under
the Conservative Government which, in effect, held poor people responsible
for having worse health because of their poverty. That was unacceptable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have to address the fact that poverty
induces ill health. Social disadvantage, whether it is caused by poverty
or by personal circumstances-which may affect individuals in any part of
society-generates ill health. Ill health reduces people's opportunities
and disfigures their lives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> I am sorry
to interrupt, but time is running out.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>I will just wind up.
This affliction needs to be tackled in three ways: first, by taking specific
measures-and I am confident that the new team will pursue such measures;
secondly, by establishing clear targets that show how we are going to change
things and allow people to measure our achievements; thirdly, by having
a health impact assessment of all our policies so that they are properly
integrated. If we can take that step and deliver measurable achievements
in health, it will be a sign of what can be achieved through the Government's
partnership agreement.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>The people of Scotland elected the Scottish Parliament to reflect
their needs and aspirations. As the elected members of this Parliament,
we have the responsibility of ensuring that we have a Parliament that is
open, accountable and, above all, democratic in its decision making.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During the early days of this Parliament,
and from the publication of the partnership document by Labour and the
Liberal Democrats, it was clear that a sell-out was taking place for the
sake of ministerial office rather than of reflecting the needs of the people
of Scotland. A majority of members were elected on the basis of manifestos
that committed them to abolishing student tuition fees and lifting the
beef-on-the-bone ban.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In February 1998, Charles Kennedy-that
well-known Liberal Democrat face and the man who is now one of the front
runners for the leadership of that party-led the Opposition debate in the
House of Commons. He led the debate against the Government and its ban
on beef on the bone. Now what do we see? We see Mr Finnie and his leadership
colleagues doing a U-turn on the issue. They now tell us that they will
wait until they receive the right medical evidence before making such a
decision. Why did they not take the same medical evidence before they made
it their party's policy to lift the ban? The words "envelope" and "the
back of it" with regard to policy making come to mind. The Liberal Democrats
have clearly failed to think through this process and have concerned themselves
more with ministerial office.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is all very well for people such as
Mr Finnie to sell out on their party policy, but selling out on the farmers
who voted for the Liberal Democrats and on the people who live in rural
communities that depend on farming is not just selling out on their party
policy, it is a betrayal of the supporters who elected them to this chamber.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Simpson:</strong> What astonishes me about
the points being made by Michael Matheson and the parties who wish to lift
the beef-on-the-bone ban is that they are determined to go against the
medical advice that is being offered. Does he think that any member does
not want the ban on beef on the bone lifted as quickly as possible? The
ban cannot be lifted until the appropriate medical advice has been received.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Matheson: </strong>I must point out
to Dr Simpson that the majority of members were elected on a commitment
to get the ban lifted. Mr Lyon-who has disappeared and has not remained
for the debate-was one of the leading members of the National Farmers Union
who campaigned against the Government's imposition of the ban.</font></td>
