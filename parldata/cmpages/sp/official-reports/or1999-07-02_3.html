<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>1. Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan)
(SNP): </strong>To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it intends to take
to ensure that the Parliament meets the expectations of the people of Scotland.
(S1O-154)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):</strong>
Briefly please, First Minister. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister (Donald Dewar): </strong>Sir
David, I always enjoy answering a precise question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have already announced an extensive
legislative programme, which in range and scope could not have been matched
under the previous dispensation from Westminster. We are concentrating
on issues such as education, health, jobs and social inclusion-issues that
I believe reflect the priorities of the people of Scotland and command
their broad support. As we tackle those issues, I look forward optimistically,
but not with complete confidence, to the support of the nationalists.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>Is the First Minister
aware that the main headline on Ceefax at 1 o'clock this morning said that
MSPs were happy and emotional at events? I was tempted to ask which MSPs
and which events; but I think the headline summed up a highly successful
day. That success was acknowledged generally, and not just by members of
the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As was referred to in speeches yesterday,
one of the expectations that people have of this Parliament is that there
should be vigorous debate. Does the First Minister agree that that vigorous
debate should, in this new democracy, extend not just to people in this
chamber, but through all Scottish society?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>That is a proposition
that I might even assent to. However, I am not sure that I was emotional
or tired last night, but I certainly was not sitting at 1 am looking at
Ceefax. [<i>Laughter</i>.] That, Sir David, was a distinctly alarming piece
of information from the leader of the nationalists.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I accept that there will be vigorous debate
in this chamber. We all want that debate to be extended, when appropriate,
into civic society and across the communities of Scotland. We will try
to give impetus to that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

happy celebrations: people in Scotland value co-operation among politicians;

on which there ought to be agreement, they look forward to the musketry
in the party trenches being dumped. I commend that to him.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>I fully accept that
some people returned home slightly earlier than others.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To ask a precise question: if vigorous
debate is to go through Scottish society, will the First Minister join
me, Unison, and the Transport and General Workers Union in condemning the
action that is being taken by Edinburgh City Council against Mr Dorman
and Mr Corsie, whose offence appears to be that, during an election visit
by Mr David Blunkett, they voiced their concerns to the press over the
private finance initiative?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I have a prejudice
against condemning situations of which I have no direct experience. That
is perhaps the rather cautious approach of a lawyer; but one has to know
the circumstances in their entirety before starting to condemn. Although
I realise that there are always attractions in making public denunciations
and gestures, before doing so it is important that one equips oneself with
real knowledge.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>The matter has been
well reported in the press, as I am sure that the First Minister is aware.
Mr Dorman and Mr Corsie are school janitors. When Mr David Blunkett attended
their school during the election campaign, they expressed their concerns
over the PFI in terms of jobs. One of the gentlemen is a Labour supporter,
one is a Scottish National party supporter; both were concerned about their
jobs. The disciplinary charge that they face is that they interfered with
a Government minister's visit. Does the First Minister agree that the vigorous
new democracy and debate should extend not just to members of the Parliament,
not just to leaders of civic society in Scotland, but to every citizen
of this country?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>We are all in
favour of justice and equity as general propositions. All my knowledge
of the affair of the two janitors comes from reading published articles.
The case is at present subject to an appeal and, in any decent judicial
system, politicians do not go around making denunciatory statements in
the middle of process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

plans to treat cross-departmentally to fulfil its commitment to integrated
government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Mr Macdonald. Your name had come up on my computer screen to ask a question

Fife) (Con): </strong>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans
to set and monitor targets to reduce the numbers of homeless people. (S1O-159)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Communities (Ms Wendy
Alexander): </strong>On 17 June I announced that the Deputy Minister for Communities
is to lead a major new task force to take an in-depth look at the causes
of homelessness in Scotland, with the aim of developing a long-term strategy.
The Government is already committed to ensuring that by the end of this
session of Parliament no one will have to sleep rough.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Harding: </strong>I thank the minister
for that reply and I am glad that the Government is beginning to address
that situation. Labour has been in power for two years and homelessness
has increased by 14 per cent. What immediate initiatives does the minister
intend to implement to reduce the level of homelessness?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>There is consensus
that one of the reasons for the rise in homelessness is the increase in
applications from homeless people through the new code of better reporting
that we have introduced. All housing organisations acknowledge that our
legislation is 21 years out of date. It does not tell us what we need to
know. We have an opportunity to legislate and we will do that based on
recommendations as to how homelessness can be prevented, and how we can
assist those who are homeless.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Harding: </strong>I thank the minister
for that comprehensive answer, but why is that not in the legislative programme
for the coming year?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>We have already discussed
this and, in keeping with the spirit of consultation in this Parliament,
the consultation period for the green paper on housing closed just a few
days ago. We have said that we will consult on those proposals and we look
forward to introducing legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We picked the area of homelessness because
there was unanimity to move forward and to set up a review straight away.
Jackie Baillie is now leading that review.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

area, or does it consider that contractual rights are adequate?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>That is an area that

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thank you, Mr Presiding Officer, for giving
me the opportunity to be the first member to ask the same question twice
at the same meeting.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_12"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First
Minister (Donald Dewar): </strong>The Administration regards this as an issue
of considerable importance. New ministerial committees on rural development,
drugs, social inclusion and the creation of digital Scotland will soon
be in operation. One of the failures of the past has been that we have
talked a great deal about cross-cutting but we have not made it as effective
as we would have liked. I have been in office and must take some of the
blame for this. The new Parliament and the new Administration have an opportunity
to pick areas of the kind that I mentioned-areas that genuinely straddle
the portfolios of a number of ministers-and to set up machinery that is
structured and that has the strength to ensure that there is genuine co-operation
and co-ordination of attack and progress. These are sensitive, key areas
of policy and I look forward to seeing that working and to making progress.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_14"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Lewis
Macdonald: </strong>I welcome the First Minister's commitment to those matters
and to making the policies work in practice. I commend to him the work
that is being done at a local level by the great northern partnership in
deprived areas of Aberdeen Central and Aberdeen North. That partnership
is developing a cross-cutting approach at local level. Does he agree that
tackling urban disadvantage and promoting a policy of social inclusion
and regeneration in areas such as Woodside and Tillydrone in Aberdeen not
only requires that housing is regenerated, but that GPs are encouraged
to move their surgeries into communities? Does he further agree that we
should develop a child care strategy that will allow young mothers to work
and that we should provide work and training opportunities for young people?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Macdonald on that
omnibus supplementary question, which covered a remarkable range of issues.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was talking specifically about the machinery
of central Government, but I accept that it is important that such models
are also considered locally and that we try to build the same level of
co-operation and integration in our attack on urban and rural regeneration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I fear that all of us think about our own
patch when such matters are raised. In the city of Glasgow, Glasgow Alliance
has an effective focus. It is trying to ensure that the &pound;1.5 billion
of public funds that goes into agencies in Glasgow every year has the maximum
impact by developing a genuinely co-ordinated approach and by ensuring
that when relevant organisations take decisions on their areas of responsibility,
they bear in mind what other agencies are doing. Each should buttress the
others' efforts, which is the right approach.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The attack on deprivation and poverty and
the fight to unlock opportunity for the disadvantaged is an enormously
important priority not only for this Administration, but, I hope, for the
entire Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Keith Raffan (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(LD): </strong>Does the First Minister agree that, while the Executive wants
to improve cross-cutting, the onus is also on the parliamentary committees
to develop sub-committees and working groups, particularly on the issue
of drug misuse? Bearing it in mind that some committees, such as the Social
Inclusion, Housing and Voluntary Sector Committee, have a very broad remit,
members of such a working group could be drawn from the Health and Community
Care Committee, the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, the Justice
and Home Affairs Committee and the Social Inclusion, Housing and Voluntary
Sector Committee. Sub-committees and working groups need to be set up as
soon as possible to address issues such as drug misuse effectively.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I do not dissent;
indeed, I positively agree with Keith Raffan's remarks. There are opportunities.
However, in the early days we must watch that we do not become over-complex
and end up with a multiplicity of committees, each trying to take in someone
else's washing. The point of cross-cutting is to simplify and focus on
particular issues. That must be the result of any move towards the phenomenon
to which he refers. However, if he means that there should be flexibility,
I agree entirely.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

which school cleaning, catering and clerical staff have found themselves?
Staff have suddenly been denied benefit for the summer holiday period because
there is a date in their contracts-12 August-for starting back at school.
Surely, these people are either entitled to benefit, as has always been
the case during the summer, or they are entitled to holiday pay from the
devolved Administration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>Social security
is not a direct responsibility of this chamber. Although I recognise that
Mr Neil has been elected only recently, I am astonished to hear him say
that this is a sudden and unexpected problem. I have been aware of it for
a considerable period of time. The rules are complex. As Mr Neil no doubt
knows, a lot has been going on behind the scenes in the social security
world and some settlements have been reached. However, I agree that there
are important issues to do with definition. Members of Parliament at Westminster,
who have the particular constituency responsibility, will no doubt be corresponding
about and examining this issue for a considerable time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>Has the First Minister given much thought to implementation costs?
To improve services we must ensure that we achieve best value for the money
available. The massive increase in the number of ministerial positions
and the escalating costs for the new Parliament building will put an added
drain on the funds available. Will he comment?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>My first comment
is to congratulate Phil Gallie on the consistency of his approach. When
he gets something in his mind, he certainly does not forget it in a hurry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is enormously important to get value
for money. That is a recurrent theme of this Administration and will be
of all Administrations. However, if Phil Gallie is inviting me to endorse
the principle that proper democratic scrutiny should be taken on the cheap,
and that we should not get some of the advantages of the constitutional
reform that we represent, I disagree with him deeply.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course there will not be profligacy
and it is important, whether it be in local government or central Government,
that we get value for money. If we fall down on that, we are clearly open
to considerable criticism and our ability to argue the case in other areas
is greatly undermined.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
