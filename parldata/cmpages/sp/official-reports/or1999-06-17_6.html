ways in which we can put the patient at the heart of the NHS. Some of them
are highlighted in the partnership agreement, and they demonstrate how
we can give patients the treatment that they need, when they need it and
where they want it. They include our commitment to develop the number of
one-stop clinics, the 24-hour telephone helpline, NHS Direct, and walk-in
walk-out treatment centres. In addition to those services and facilities,
we are committed to improving the information that patients get at all
stages of their care, and the communication between the patient and the
NHS. I am already in discussion with people in the service on how to take
forward that agenda, and I will continue that over the next few months.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

housing, jobs and the environment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>Can the First Minister
tell us what the environmental reasons are for imposing a toll tax on the
M8?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I would not
describe it as a toll tax. It is very important that we try to reduce the
gridlock and congestion on motorways and in urban centres. In debate earlier
today, there were some impassioned speeches from Alex Salmond's benches
on the need to do something about urban congestion. Although people make
those statements, when imaginative and difficult ideas are brought forward-difficult
because we know that they will be controversial but believe that they must
be examined-there is a barrage of criticism and complaint. There is a good
deal of courage in the legislative programme that we announced, and the
measures are an example of that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>There has been a barrage
of criticism and complaint from Graeme Maurice, the Labour leader of West
Lothian Council. Does he not have a point when he argues that a toll tax
on the M8 will divert traffic to less suitable roads, making things worse
for the environment and raising safety concerns?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>It is perfectly
legitimate for the Scottish National party-or any outside party-to draw
attention to diversion. It is one of the factors that must be examined
carefully. There are other possibilities for congestion charging which
may have a part to play. It is important that, if there is to be a move
in the direction of charging, it must be clear that any money raised will
be used to improve transport services and infrastructure. When people sit
down and think about that, it might be more popular than Mr Salmond would
like.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond: </strong>The First Minister says,
"if" there is a move in that direction-does that indicate some doubt? Let
me try a simple question. When the ministerial car takes the First Minister
back to Glasgow, who will pay the toll tax? Will he pay, or will the taxpayer,
and how much will it be?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I imagine-and
I suppose that this is a dolefully inadequate answer to that penetrating
general matter of principle-that the Scottish Office will probably follow
exactly the same procedure that it follows when we cross the Forth road
bridge.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I know that
Donald Gorrie takes a great interest in those things, and I suspect that
he rather fancies himself as a representative of youth. It shows a confidence
in that matter that I find implausible. I have never taken the view that
young people had totally different interests from those of the rest of
the population. Young people are interested in educational opportunity
and-essentially-in job opportunity. Mr Gorrie might want to consider the
impressive statistic that, since the Government came to power at Westminster,
the new deal has halved the number of 18 to 24-year-olds claiming unemployment
benefit.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is the same with housing, the health
service and a range of social services. If we get those matters right,
and bring about the kind of improvements that we want, we will appeal to
people of 18 as much as we will appeal to people of Mr Gorrie's age.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP): </strong>In
relation to the question about toll tax, will the First Minister introduce
immediate legislation to bring us into line with England and Wales, and
announce an amnesty for poll tax non-payers, in order to alleviate poverty
in Scotland?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>Mr Sheridan
is indulging in wishful thinking, because there is no such amnesty in England
and Wales. I take the view that when people owe money, and when money is
due, that debt should be met. I have no intention of introducing an amnesty.
There are difficulties about collecting, and other principles of law apply,
but local government is right to recover due debt. If it does not do so,
there will be an additional burden on others in society-I do not include
Mr Sheridan-who have been meeting their dues.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

we will all have to bear as a result of the legislative programme announced
yesterday?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I know that
Mr McLetchie finds the concept difficult to grasp, but the Parliament has
no powers to raise charges or taxes that were not previously available
to the Scottish Office. Apart from the 1p variation in income tax, there
is nothing in the Scotland Act 1998 to give the Parliament powers that
were not already available.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we do go down that road, it will be
for a direct return, both in terms of the better management of our road
system and our cities, and through the use of any funds that are raised
in that way to address concerns about gridlock, greenhouse emissions and
motorway queuing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am not interested in raising taxation
for the sake of it, but I am interested in seeing tax reform-such as that
which is being implemented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer-in order
to address opportunity in society. The new 10p band, the working families
tax credit, the important and generous tax credits for nursery and pre-school
care-which will come into effect later this year-are examples of how, without
victimising people who earn more, we can use the tax system to unlock opportunity
for those who have been denied it in the past.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>The First Minister
seems to be following the lead given by the Prime Minister, by-contrary
to election pledges-increasing the tax burden on people resident in Scotland,
and the United Kingdom as a whole. He seems to be confirming that the legislation
is designed to ensure that local authorities in Scotland are turned into
the Parliament's tax gatherers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the subject of local authorities, given
the First Minister's desire to be a friend to the business community, will
he categorically rule out that during the lifetime of the Parliament, local
authorities will be given sole or partial discretion to set business rates-a
measure to which the Scottish business community is wholly and rightly
opposed?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I trust that
I will not try Mr McLetchie's patience if I repeat what I have often said:
the McIntosh commission report is due soon and a whole series of important
consultations that we promised on the issue will also take place soon.
I have made it clear repeatedly on behalf of my party, and I believe that
it will be the view of the Administration, that we would not want in any
way to put Scotland's commerce, industry and business at a competitive
disadvantage against other parts of the United Kingdom. On that at least
we can make common ground.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that the unemployment claimant count fell again this week and, at 5.5 per
cent, is still the lowest that it has been since 1977. The International
Labour Organisation unemployment figure fell by 11,000 and the numbers
in employment went up by 7,000 in the quarter to the end of April. As a
result of the management of the economy over the past two years, Scotland
has a good, strong economic position, which, I assure Mr McLetchie, the
Administration has no intention whatever of putting at risk.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alasdair Morgan (Galloway and Upper
Nithsdale) (SNP): </strong>Given his desire to keep taxes down, what representations
has the First Minister made, or will he make, to his friend the Chancellor
of the Exchequer about the successive increases in road fuel tax? Those
increases have had a dire effect on Scotland, particularly in the rural
areas that I represent, where people on very low incomes often have no
alternative but to own a car and pay the high taxes imposed by the Government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The First Minister: </strong>That is why
we are spending more-&pound;13.5 million over three years-on urban transport.
It is why we are helping some-not a lot, but some-rural petrol stations.
And it is why we have asked the Office of Fair Trading to consider again
the alleged profiteering among the petrol companies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the difficulties is that only about
0.25 per cent of petrol sales in this country are made in the Highlands
and Islands, which unfortunately has a large land mass. Therefore, there
are problems with petrol stations, which have a small throughput and have
to push up margins in order to survive. That is the sort of issue that
we will look at.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are introducing a whole range of initiatives,
such as the substantial increase on remission of vehicle excise duties
for lorries that have cleaner engines and the &pound;55 annual reduction
in vehicle excise duty for cars under 1,100 cc.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I am sure Alasdair Morgan accepts, we
have a duty under the Kyoto accord to meet the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
targets, which represent a substantial reduction of 12.5 per cent on the
1990 totals, by the period 2008 to 2010. People will recognise that that
might mean some quite uncomfortable and difficult decisions, but we have
to get the balance right. We cannot simply ignore the threat of greenhouse
gases and global warming.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

for Children and Education (Mr Sam Galbraith): </strong>The new legislative
process will reflect the arrangements that were proposed in the consultative

groups have an opportunity to comment on the issues that affect them. I
will announce shortly how we intend to consult on the education bill and
how young people can be involved in that process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Thank you for that
helpful answer. Is the minister aware of the recent case in south Ayrshire,
in which a sheriff felt that the provisions of the Children (Scotland)
Act 1995 did not give him powers to stop a convicted sex offender, on his
release from prison, returning to live in close proximity to his young
victim? If he is aware of that case, will he comment on how legislation
could be improved to ensure that children in such cases are afforded the
protection that they need, to allow them to live safely and without fear
in their homes and communities?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>First, I want to recognise
the work that Cathy has done with young people and children. She worked
for a number of years with Who Cares? Scotland, an organisation that looks
after a particularly vulnerable group. Her work has been a credit to her
and an example to us all. The fact that she did that work for less than
she is earning here is also to her credit and should not be sneered at
by other individuals in newspaper articles. People who do real jobs with
real people in the real world do not need lessons from people who do not
possess such qualities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Looking after vulnerable kids is important,
as are their views. A number of legislative measures have been taken recently
and guidelines have been produced-dealing with the social justice system,
the criminal justice system, local authorities and the social work services-on
how their views can be taken into account. There are still some problems.
If Cathy Jamieson wishes, we can discuss the matter to see how we can take
it forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>When young children's
issues are addressed, it is important to ensure that views are taken on

us has complete knowledge of those issues; few of us are in our youth,
although we may think that we are.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
