within it, but within it by a factor of no less than 10. The current deficit
as a percentage of GDP is a mere 0.3 per cent. In other words, the new
Labour Government has the room to increase public borrowing and spending
by a massive &pound;22 billion this year, and by as much if not more in
each of the next four years. It will still be able to meet the Maastricht
criteria for economic and monetary union.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is scope for a massive increase in
capital expenditure. Scotland's share would be around &pound;2.5 billion
this year and every year up to and including 2003-04. To put that sum into
perspective, last year, Government spending on capital projects in Scotland
was only &pound;1.7 billion. The value of all the PFI projects in Scotland-those
that have been signed up for and which are in the pipeline-is only &pound;2.8
billion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

ask you wind up now please, Mr Ingram.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Ingram: </strong>The reality is that this
new Labour Government has the wherewithal to launch a massive public works
programme without recourse to public-private partnerships, but it clearly
lacks the political will to do so. It would appear that Gordon Brown will
use the billions in his rapidly accumulating war chest to buy the votes
of middle England with more cuts in personal income tax. Without doubt,
it is a case of retaining power for its own sake, rather than exercising
power meaningfully for the common weal.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP): </strong>The
speech that we have just heard is the kind of speech that would have been
made by a Labour member five or 10 years ago. It was full of socialist
content. Some of the members on the Labour benches used to be socialists.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The problem with today's debate is the
stench of hypocrisy and arrogance. The British Medical Association is one
of the most respected bodies in the national health service; Unison is
the largest trade union in Scotland; and the Scottish Trades Union Congress
represents some 900,000 organised trade unionists in Scotland, yet all
those bodies are completely and emphatically opposed to the private finance
initiative. That is why this debate is arrogant. Are the BMA, Unison and
the STUC wrong and Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Tories right?
Do the parties have the monopoly on wisdom?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

PFI is popular and that we will lose support if we do not get in line,
he is on a hiding to nothing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Politics is about priorities. Mr Ingram
gave us an illustration of how this Government's policies are all wrong.
Three years ago, under the Tory Government, a campaign was started in Glasgow,
which was taken up by the Glasgow <i>Evening Times, </i>to raise &pound;1.5
million for an MRI scanner for the children's hospital at Yorkhill. Three
years later, the money has been raised through public donations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the same week as that campaign was launched,
the Tory Government announced that it would support the British contribution
to the Eurofighter project at a cost of &pound;15 billion. That is the
politics of priority-Governments that can afford &pound;15,000 million
for weapons of destruction, but cannot afford &pound;1.5 million for an
MRI scanner for a children's hospital.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The problem that faces Labour members is
that the Scottish electorate cherish our public services and the fact that
they are delivered on the basis of need, not to satisfy the bank balance
of shareholders. That is why we talk about best value when we talk about
health, our schools and our houses. The director of the City of Glasgow
Council's housing department had to admit that the best way to achieve
best value in delivering a complete renovation of Glasgow's housing stock
was through conventional public investment. The problem is that, because
of the archaic public sector borrowing requirement rules that we use in
Britain-the only country in Europe to use them-that method of financing
has been forgotten.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Tosh: </strong>Does Mr Sheridan accept
that, to an extent, conventional methods of public investment have been
the problem? All the houses developed in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were
funded in that manner. The councils did not build any life-cycle costings
into the plans and no money was set aside for renewal and refurbishment,
so that in Glasgow around 77,000 houses are now of almost no value because
so much work is necessary to bring them up to standard. That is the result
of the conventional approach to funding and it is the legacy of not looking
at efficient property management for decades.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>I completely deny
that that is the reason why we are left with those problems. They are due
to a lack of planning. There was a willingness to construct thousands of
homes to deal with massive overcrowding in areas such as Govan and the
Gorbals in Glasgow, which resulted in the building of flat-roofed tenements.
That would have been nice and they would have lasted for ever in places
such as Greece, which has a nice climate, but not in places such as&nbsp;</font></td>

housing department was forced to admit that such homes could be delivered
more quickly through public investment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Scanlon, as she makes her comments honestly-some members of other parties
do not make theirs as honestly-but she is a Tory. She says that the priority
is who owns things. I will bear that in mind when the party that I represent

her in destructive mode.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">blatant attempt
to embarrass Labour. In other words, this motion is not a serious attempt
to debate PFI or an opportunity for this Parliament to address the issue
properly; it is, as usual, the old politics of Westminster-party politicking
to get at other political parties.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Gibson gave it away when he reminded
everyone here that how we vote today will be used at every hustings that
members attend between now and the next election. I, for one, am certainly
not going to be fooled into supporting an SNP motion that is aimed directly
at helping the nationalists and damaging my party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Let us look at the SNP motion. First, it
condemns the privatisation of public services. There is nothing wrong with
that-I do it myself. The clear implication behind that condemnation is
that public services should always be publicly provided-again something
that I would not fall out about. Why, then, has the SNP-controlled council
in Angus, which has been under SNP control for 16 years, never delivered
its housing maintenance and repair service through a direct labour organisation?
It has never had a direct labour organisation and it has always delivered
that public service through the private sector. Of course, it gets an advantage
from doing that because the wages in the private sector are lower, the
conditions are not so good and there are no apprenticeship schemes. The
SNP gets the benefit of boasting about low rents and council taxes in Angus,
but it does that by delivering public services through private means. I
will give way to the provost who was responsible for many of those policies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP): </strong>Mr
McAllion is entirely wrong. He should do his homework before making such
accusations against the SNP. The administration that I led employed direct
labour; we encouraged local business and we used direct labour where appropriate.
If Dundee City Council came anywhere near the record of Angus-the best-run
council in Scotland-the citizens of Dundee would be much happier.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McAllion: </strong>I have done the homework.
Mr Welsh ceased to lead the administration in Angus in 1987. At the moment,
there is no DLO in Angus providing the housing and maintenance repair service,
but there is one in Dundee. That is the difference. Our council is Labour
controlled, whereas Angus Council is SNP controlled. As Mr Raffan said-I
do not always agree with him-members cannot say one thing here and do something
entirely different on the ground. No one is twisting the SNP's arm up its
back in Angus. Labour-controlled Dundee has been able to deliver a DLO
and so could have Angus if it had chosen to do so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Baldovie in my constituency, where we are replacing the old incinerator

that is another example of Labour going down the privatisation road." Why,

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Public-private partnerships and PFI came
about because there were problems with public funding. We all know that.
Limits were set on the amount that government could spend and borrow. As
a result, many public projects were left lying on the shelf gathering dust.
PPP and PFI are meant to break that log-jam and allow public projects to

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McAllion: </strong>I have serious reservations
about PFI. The idea of a privately owned and privately run hospital in
the NHS is anathema to me as is the idea of forcing public sector workers
out of the public sector against their will. That is not why I came into
politics, but those of us who are opposed to it have to find a practical
alternative. That is what this Parliament is about.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I am ashamed that it has gone on for so long and I think that that shame
transverses this chamber. The Liberals have made a big noise about it.
The solution that they have reached in the partnership agreement is to
stagnate the charges-bully for them. I suggest that Liberal members do
not give up their day job if that is the best deal they can do. I would
not like to see them do a bad deal. For me, their suggestion is like a

Mr Raffan and others have spoken about the roles of the Finance Committee,
the Audit Committee and the subject committees. It is for all of us to
examine this issue. What Mr McConnell has told us today, and what is in
the partnership agreement, moves the PFI-PPP debate forward. It does not
take the debate to its conclusion, but it is better than where we were.
One of the roles of the committees is to move the debate forward again.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will not attack the SNP for using PPP
and PFI projects locally. I will give four reasons why I will not: Craigmount
High School, The Royal High School, Muirhouse Primary School and Silverknowes
Primary School-four different school projects in my area. I have concerns
about PPP and PFI, but I am more concerned to ensure that the children
I represent get the best education possible from Edinburgh City Council

under the Tories. It was maintained under a Labour Administration, and
it is now accelerating under this Lib-Lab partnership. Under Thatcher,
public utilities were privatised. That was robbery of, and private gain
from, a public asset at public expense. Privatisation went to such an extent
that Harold Macmillan said it was selling off the family silver. Labour
jumped up and down in raptures in support of that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

answer, but my colleague Alex Neil has kindly told me that he was. Macmillan
was referring to the privatisation of public utilities. PFI is privatisation.
Labour is not selling off the family silver; it is selling off the family
furniture, because we are dealing with health, education and housing-the
fundamental issues for individuals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I wish to comment on alternative funding
and Mr McConnell's amendment. I will also touch on the points made by Mrs
Smith. Mr McConnell talked about the choices. I do not want to go into
great detail about Scottish public sector trusts-my colleague Andrew Wilson
will do that-but Mr McConnell raised an issue that I was going to comment
on: the Scottish transport bond. I note that Mr McConnell talked about
the civil service brief "Pathfinders to the Parliament". I do not speak

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>Mr MacAskill referred

We are quite happy to look at alternatives if Mr McConnell is not prepared
to accept the Scottish public sector trust, but we must move away from
PFI, PPP or privatisation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That brings me to the issue of schools,
as raised by Mrs Smith. As far as I can see, PPP means privatisation for
parents and public. Mr McConnell talked about ownership. I have the document
"Private Partnerships: Investing in Education" from the education department
of Edinburgh City Council. Mr McConnell said that ownership remains with
the public sector-or he alluded to it. Lo and behold, under the heading
"Why PPP?", at the end of paragraph three, the document says:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"In practice, this means that the Council
will lease rather than own the proposed new or refurbished PPP buildings
and receive funding from the Scottish Office to meet rental costs."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is what the City of Edinburgh Labour
group said.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McConnell: </strong>The point I was making-if
Mr MacAskill listened to that part of my speech-is that the option for
public ownership remains when the contracts expire and when the public
interest asks that it should remain. In almost all of the PFI contracts
currently in existence in Scotland, that option appears in the contract-although
none of our colleagues have so far been able to name any, despite their
grandiose claims-and in most cases for a nominal value.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In future, where there is no practical
alternative use for the project at the end of the contract period, during
which cost-lease arrangements apply, there will be the option of transferring
at no cost. I would be grateful if Mr MacAskill would welcome that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of PPP in Edinburgh and deal with this amendment. Mr McConnell thinks that
his is a favourable proposal. I notice that Mrs Curran, who has previously
commented on international affairs, is sitting at the back of the chamber.
I want to know why, if this is such a good option for the Scottish Parliament,
we are restricting it to this chamber and this nation. Why, when throughout
the world, particularly in the third world, there are requirements for
homes, schools and hospitals, are we not giving others the benefit of the

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):
</strong>The debate on PPPs must rank alongside that on student finance as one
of the most contentious that faces this Parliament. In practice, both debates
have been oversimplified and have failed to capture the complexities of
the issues involved, as many members have pointed out. In the case of PPPs,
one mistake has been the failure to recognise that what have been called
PFIs and PPPs are not all the same. There is variation and they are evolving.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From some of the speeches that SNP members
have made, there would seem to be no middle ground. We have polarised the
arguments, so that people are either for PPPs or against them. I suggest
that we need to consider the middle ground.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My approach to this matter starts from
basic principles. For most of the past 20 years, the public sector has
been starved of resources; most of us agree on that. There is a real danger
that, as J K Galbraith, one of the century's most distinguished economists,
said, we will have</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"private opulence but public squalor".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If that is to be avoided, we must act,
and act quickly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My approach to this matter recognises that
many of the PFIs that have been introduced to date have been unsatisfactory.
The balance between public and private gain has been wrong, and much of
the private gain has been made at the expense of public sector workers.
The balance may have been wrong because too many of the public sector bodies
that have negotiated with the private sector have lacked the expertise
that is necessary for them to do so effectively.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I criticise much that has happened in the
past. The Tories' policy-that the private sector is always best-flies in
the face of all experience. There are too many examples, whether from privatisations
or PFIs, of the private sector making excessive profits at the expense
of the public purse; we have alluded to those already. However, that does
not mean that there are no circumstances in which I could support the use
of private sector finance for public sector development. Rather, it means
that I want there to be much more scepticism about private sector involvement.
It means that I want far more controls&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Members will have seen the briefing that
has been provided by the Scottish Parliament information centre and noticed
the frequent references to an article by Professor David Bell. Professor
Bell is a constituent of mine who works at the University of Stirling.
He argues for a mix of public and private funding to develop public assets,
so that risk can be shared. However, an important element of what he proposes
has received insufficient attention. He argues that the public sector must
learn from its mistakes and not bargain with the private sector from a
position of weakness. At the moment, too many negotiations with the private
sector are carried out by bodies that have little experience in such matters.
That must change, so that there is a clear focus for negotiations with
the private sector. Malcolm Chisholm has made some good points about how
we can make progress on scrutiny and monitoring of that process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Amendment S1M-67.1 seeks to capture many

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a second PFI at the Edinburgh
royal infirmary-for equipment. Before the election, I was concerned because
every piece of advice that I had received-from the British Medical Association,
from the people who work in the area that will be covered by the second
PFI and, of course, from Unison-suggested that it would, almost certainly,
lead to a lowering of the standard of clinical care. The equipment PFI
covers equipment that is patient-critical. The equipment is operated by
a health team that is made up of the same people who purchase, install
and maintain it, and who train the staff in how to use it. They are an
integrated part of the medical care. Under the equipment PFI, they would
be split off from the rest of the clinicians and nursing staff.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was also very concerned about the total
absence of British health care companies from the companies that tendered
for this PFI, because I do not want the bedside bookkeeping of the American
health care companies in Edinburgh's new royal infirmary. I am sure that
Mr McConnell does not want that either.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have a compelling third reason for revisiting
the PFI. When the minister sums up, I want him to give us an assurance
that the Executive will re-examine the books for the Edinburgh PFI. I have
here a letter dated 31 May. It is addressed to the executive directors
of the Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust, and is from the heads of
service and business managers at the royal infirmary. It says that</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"effective planning of and communication
about the entire project has ground to a halt"</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

spoke the words that he was given at the press conference, that there had
to be a reason for the showpiece PFI being unable to attract and keep a

pension rights, a matter which he mentioned today. Donald Dewar said that
the contract could not be reopened. I take it, then, that Sam won that
argument. I am therefore asking that we re-examine the contract, and that
we certainly stop the second PFI contract until we are convinced that there

in its history is under way. Some of that has been funded through the traditional
channels and some under public-private partnerships. I find it strange
that he spoke about the needs of the people, when in East Kilbride, where
I was born and brought up, the new &pound;67.5 million Hairmyres hospital
is literally growing out of the ground. A partnership agreement has been
signed by the management and staff, who are represented by Unison. That
is a benchmark for participation and for trade union and employee involvement
in such schemes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the hospitals which I knew, people had
to get an ambulance to get to the X-ray department from another part of

such issues are considered. That is the strength of the schemes of which

to fund capital investment. It is no surprise-Mr Ingram referred to this-that
the framework for public sector borrowing and investment in our economy
is essentially dictated by sound principles of macroeconomic management,
which were most recently embodied in the Maastricht treaty and in the European
Reconstruction and Stability Pact.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Ingram made the point that, in the context
of the 60 per cent and 3 per cent rules, there was scope to expand conventional
public sector borrowing. There may very well be scope in the current climate,
when we are very nearly at the peak of the economic cycle-but an economic
cycle goes up and down. We were not in a position to meet the Maastricht
treaty's requirements when it was signed; virtually no European economy
was at that stage. It is a matter of good economic management.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan </strong><i>rose</i>-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Tosh: </strong>I would say to Mr McNulty,
who made the point about under-investment in the public sector over 20
years, that public sector borrowing restraints were introduced to our economy
in 1976 and since then we have had to live within sensible economic management
rules, as every major industrial economy does. There is a limit to the
amount of borrowing that is reasonable. I will allow Mr Sheridan to come
in at a later point as there is something I have to say to him.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This Government, like the previous Government,
faces the difficulty of the massive backlog in necessary investment in
the public sector. We have heard a lot this morning about "public sector
good, private sector bad." I find that very curious-it is the mirror image
of the caricature that is thrown at Conservatives all the time, which is
not our position. "Public sector good, private sector bad" seems to be
the position of the SNP,&nbsp;</font></td>

sector has a far better track record than the public sector in building
and maintaining properties.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What Tommy Sheridan said about some of
the reasons for the poor qu ality of council housing in Scotland is true,
but the essential problem is that councils have never indulged in life-cycle
costings. They do not build up reserves to tackle necessary repair work
at the end of the lifetime of a building. Housing associations build up
reserves and their tenants know that, at the end of the lifetime of their
buildings, they will be able to get the repair work that is needed. They
are technically private sector, so the SNP does not like them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>I have two questions
for Mr Tosh. He mentioned housing again. Does his party support the cancellation
of the capital housing debt in cities like Glasgow, given that it cancelled
the debts of Scottish Homes, British Steel, British Rail, Scottish Gas
and others? Secondly, does his party support the retention of the public
sector borrowing requirement, or would it support the introduction of the
European-wide new system of general government financial deficits?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Tosh: </strong>That is the nearest we
have come all day to a constructive suggestion. I would welcome a debate
on central government general deficits, or whatever the jargon is-I can
never remember quite how to style it. I would even welcome a debate on
the idea of public sector trusts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Tosh: </strong>The Government has allowed
local authorities in Scotland the latitude to indulge in consultancies
and to investigate a variety of proposals to increase investment in housing
through a variety of delivery mechanisms. The SNP has not suggested a public
sector trust in the context of housing. It has said no-absolutely no, ideologically
no, totally no-to any variation from the existing pattern of local authority
tenure. They say that in the full knowledge that it means no extra resources,
no ability to fund the massive housing programme that is required by that
position, and they take the same position on the entire gamut of public

</strong>I thank Mr Tosh for a vigorous contribution to the debate. As we stand
here in the General Assembly building of the Church of Scotland the ghost
of Mrs Thatcher's sermon on the Mound seems to live on. The difference
is that, if she were here today, she would receive not the condemnation
that she had at the time, but support from the Liberal Democrat, Labour
and Conservative benches. Mrs Thatcher's approach to funding public services
has been embraced by the people's party, by the still-alive-but-not-quite
Conservative party and by the ever-spinning and without-principle Liberal
Democrats.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The reality is that Labour's bluster and
bluff-and Mr Galbraith's plain rudeness-failed to disguise the facts of
the matter. Labour has changed the position that it held in opposition,
when it utterly opposed the PFI scheme. Harriet Harman and Alistair Darling
are on the record as having said as much. The Liberal Democrats have made
a volte-face, but that is no surprise from a party that has lost the respect

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"the party that introduced the first privatisation
of the health service in the United Kingdom was the Labour party."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I agree with Andy Kerr that this is about
service quality and delivery. The Government makes a distinction between
short-term gain and the long-term sustainability of the public sector.
Prudence and sustainability must go hand in hand with delivering public
services. Short-termism is the problem with PFI. PFI means signing up to
a much more expensive lease deal for the delivery of public services.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is all very well to say that we will
deliver hospitals and schools today-of course everyone wants that-but we
must be prudent and honest about where the money is coming from. The Edinburgh
royal infirmary, as Margo MacDonald said so well, will be seven times more
expensive than if it was funded through borrowing under conventional mechanisms-it
will cost the public purse seven times the actual cost of the project.
Will Mr Galbraith answer that point in his summing up, rather than just
shouting about it during the debate?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Government can issue a Treasury gilt
bond at 4.5 per cent. The average return on PFI is 10 per cent. With a
cost-of-capital difference of 5.5 per cent, how can the circle be squared?
Will it be by hitting pay and conditions for workers?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ms Scanlon, Mr McNulty and Mr Chisholm
seemed to suggest that there was no alternative to private finance. Adam
Ingram-if folk were listening-made the most significant contribution to
the debate today and to the PFI debate beyond this chamber. Mr Tosh mentioned
Maastricht, but within the Maastricht guidelines, which everyone accepts
as prudent, there is &pound;22 billion to spare for public projects in

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a 16-page document that has been the
most substantial contribution to the privatisation debate so far-Mr Tosh
should have taken the time to read it-we outlined our idea for public service
trusts. That idea is a significant and positive suggestion about what can
be done within the confines of devolution. We will criticise the limits
of this devolved Parliament and come up with positive suggestions on how
we can make public services work; I hope that we can move on and make the
case.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also welcome Mr Chisholm's backing for
our case for openness and accountability in public service contracts. It
is critical that we know exactly what is being done in the public's name.
Alistair Darling supported that position before the election. On 11 January
1997, he said in the <i>Financial Times</i>:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Legitimate use of commercial confidentiality
is one thing, but using it to hide the truth about the extent of the taxpayer's
commitment from the public is inexcusable."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a very welcome announcement today, Mr
McConnell said that announcements will be made by project area rather than
by specific projects. Sectoral spending on specific PFI deals is a step
forward. However, that is only because the scale of PFI funding is so great
just now that commercial confidentiality can be hidden within those bounds.
If we are to have openness and accountability, it must be on a project-by-project
basis.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I refer members to what Geoffrey Robinson,
the former Paymaster General, said on "Channel 4 News" on Monday night.
Of his time at the Treasury, he said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I wanted the idea of transparency translated
into reality, if there was a question about what was commercially sensitive
or not, those that were involved should respond to the spirit of what was

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Through the Finance Committee, we want
to be provided with the detail of the deals involving every public-private
partnership project. There should be no hiding behind commercial confidentiality.
No one other than the Government knows, for instance, to whom the &pound;20
million funding for the Holyrood project is going. Let us open up the matter
and put it before the Finance Committee. I hope that Mr Galbraith will
agree to that when he sums up-all members would welcome it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the campaign that was launched over the weekend. On Sunday, Mr Galbraith
issued what was-with the greatest respect-a very embarrassing press release
condemning the campaign. Mr Galbraith did not know what he was talking
about. We know that the Treasury has examined the public service trust
model in detail and we know for a fact that our idea is gaining some currency.
Scottish Homes is considering a similar model, as did "Pathfinders to the
Parliament". We can cite a whole range of examples throughout Europe of
the public service trust model in action.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Is not "Pathfinders
to the Parliament" more honest in admitting that what is being proposed
would count as public expenditure? The document talks about borrowing that
is supported by an income stream, as is the case for the transport charges
that are mentioned, which is quite unlike what happens for either the health
or education services.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Mr Chisholm's first
point is wrong, but his second is correct. We believe that this innovative
financial arrangement should not count as part of the public sector borrowing
requirement. That is reasonably straightforward. Mr Chisholm is right,
however, to say that the document talks about borrowing that is secured
against an income stream-as Fiona Hyslop's idea for a communities and homes
trust is secured against a rental income stream-or against a guaranteed
income stream from the public sector. Either way, the model works and is
bang on. That is something that Malcolm Chisholm should support, given
the point that he has just made.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we were to stand before the Parliament
and propose healthy eating and regular exercise, Labour members would be
on their feet condemning it as a left-wing plot and entirely unworkable.
No matter what good ideas come before the Labour party, if it has not thought
of them, it will condemn them-unless the Tories thought of them. The SNP
cannot suggest anything that Labour will endorse, because Labour's is the
politics not of ideas but of cynical and nasty electioneering. The way
in which Labour members conducted their entire election campaign was appalling,
because they offered nothing. Their only idea was to tell the electorate
to vote for them because they were not the SNP. Let us hear some positive
ideas that have not come from the SNP-then we might support the Labour
party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I said, the model is perfectly workable
and the only criticism of substance that has been made against it was from
the private sector, which did not like the idea of securing the jobs and
conditions of public sector workers. Why does Labour, the people's party,
disagree with our idea? We are not going to give ground; we are not going&nbsp;</font></td>

workers at the expense of their working conditions, because we have too

her mind, other than a seat at the cabinet table? She and people like her

up every principle that they once held to pursue PFI.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that members will forgive me for
that dig at Susan Deacon. I could not resist it, but I want now to deal
with some more positive contributions. Mr McConnell's point must be welcomed,
but let us go further. It makes some sense to include land in any deals.
Mr Macavity-or McAveety-probably opposed that when he served on Glasgow
City Council and considered the housing deal. I know that he was very precious
about some of the council's land assets. Maybe the proposal will send a
shock wave across there. If it makes things work and keeps rents down,
it will be better than the status quo, and I would have to support it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Margo Macdonald pointed out, the reason
that this issue has been forced is the scandal of the transfer of land
during the Edinburgh royal infirmary deal. Mr Galbraith may shake his head,
but land that was transferred during that deal was subsequently sold off
for private housing development at six times the price that was paid for
it. Will Mr Galbraith bring the figures before the Parliament? He should
stand up and tell us what the reality of the situation is. That is the
information that I have in front of me, but which he hides behind an argument
of commercial confidentiality. The detail will be examined under the Transfer
of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, which is a
step forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In summation, I say that PFI is a profiteering
scam. It serves politicians well, because they are able to announce the
building of new hospitals and schools and can take the kudos. The long-term
pain is over a number of years and Labour members will not be here when
that pain is brought down on the public sector and the taxpayers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

accept that, if we waited for the SNP's proposals, a high-school student
who is leaving a Glasgow school at the moment could have a child who would
also be leaving school by the time the proposals had begun to be implemented,
with the school still not improved? We should address the fundamental issue

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Mr McAveety only

him about this: we need improved schools within three years, and there
are three ways of achieving that. The first is to operate within a PFI
deal that exacts the cost over 25 years and hits the taxpayer over the
longer term. The second is to be honest and to tell the electorate that
we will finance the work in a way that is prudent over the long term and
will not defer the costs to future generations. We would ask them to pay
for it through traditional and progressive taxation. We offered that solution,
and the Liberals suggested they might support it, but now they have performed
a volte-face. The third option is the public service trust, which sits
on the PFI model but does the job cheaper.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those are the options. The Parliament must

is the most significant PFI funder of schools in the UK. The Channel 4

schools in two or three years' time, to which Mr Moayedi said yes. When
the interviewer said that that would make Jarvis a very powerful player
in Britain's education system, Mr Moayedi replied, "We hope so." That is

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I must tell Margo MacDonald that the great
bomb that she dropped with the devastating revelations in her leaked letter
was really a bit of a damp squib. I am sure that she would agree that there
is not really much in it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms MacDonald: </strong>That is what I said.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>Yes, that is what
she said, but she was a bit selective in reading from it. She missed out
the passage that said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The NRIE is a challenging project which
will be a success".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She might have included that quotation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Bruce Crawford asked about level playing
fields. Level playing field support, as he knows, is top-sliced off aggregate
external finance. However, there is an agreement with the Convention of
Scottish Local Authorities whereby it will no longer be top-sliced, but
will be put into AEF; it will be up to local authorities to make their
own choices about pursuing such projects.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms MacDonald: </strong>Will Mr Galbraith
give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>But of course I will
give way. I would be delighted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms MacDonald: </strong>I think that we are
agreed on one point. This is too serious a matter to brandish about without
a route out of what is still a huge dilemma. Let us not bother about how
huge it is; it is a big dilemma. I did not go through the list of six points
in the letter because there was not enough time, but Mr Galbraith will
agree that the whole contract needs further examination.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During the election campaign, Mr Galbraith
was big enough to say that he would look again at the question of pensions,
and it looks as though he succeeded in that. Can we have some sort of retrospective
look at this contract, particularly at the land deals? We know that there
is another land deal coming up at Lauriston.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>Andrew Wilson also
mentioned land deals. He should read the letter to his leader and he should
look at the Westminster parliamentary answer to John Swinney's question.
Let us get things clear. There is no rip-off on the land; the return to
the developer was perhaps slightly less than can usually be expected at
about 4 to 5 per cent based on a total value-once all the houses were built-of
&pound;93 million. Taking off the cost of building all the houses and the
infrastructure, there is a return of 3 to 4 per cent. I understand that
Bruce Crawford is a world-leading economist, so he can work out what 3

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Bruce Crawford: </strong>I am grateful for
the information on level playing field support that was provided to members
today. Obviously, level playing field support was introduced as a mechanism
to equalise against the capital projects that were formerly being undertaken
by local authorities. Is the minister confirming that that level playing
field support, which was brought in for that purpose, no longer has any
headroom and that all the costs associated with future PFI projects undertaken
by local authorities will have to be borne by local taxpayers?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>As I explained, that
level playing field was top-sliced off AEF. It will no longer be top-sliced
and will go directly to the local authority, which can make its own choices.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I realise that I do not have too much time,
so I shall move on to say something about the history of public-private
partnerships. They were first mooted by Joel Barnett many years ago and
partly adopted by the Ryrie rules; the first person to introduce them was,
in fact, John Prescott. At that stage, the Tories opposed them because
they said that they were not privatisation. The reality is that public-private
partnerships are not about privatisation, but about using private sector
involvement to deliver services. They are not about taking over services,
but about how to get best value for money, and we must remember that all
these projects go ahead only if they are value for money.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have heard a lot of nonsense about how
much more such schemes cost in terms of public borrowing. Over the lifetime
of the contract, they are value for money. There is no great legacy left
at the end of them at all; they are actually cheaper in the long run.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SNP position is based in dogma. SNP
members say that they want to bare their breasts, pay more and waste more
of the taxpayer's money, just because of an ideological position. They
do not want to make savings; they want public services to waste money rather
than to deliver services. That position should not be acceptable. One of
the theories behind such thinking is, I suppose, that they want to own
those assets; that seems to be some kind of great totem for them. We can
own those assets. I heard Mrs Ullrich saying that there is no option to
own the royal infirmary. Has she read the business plan? It is written
into the full business case, for goodness sake.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are three options. We could walk
away from the scheme; that is sometimes a good option, as it gives us the
flexibility to move on. We could continue with another contract to maintain

people think that that option is the best one. Alternatively, we could
take over the facilities. That is written into the contract. If we are
going to have a debate on this, please let us base it on fact and not on
any more rubbish. Please let us read some of the documents.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>I am grateful to
Mr Galbraith for giving way. Will the buy-back arrangements always be in
the public domain for every PFI contract?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>Absolutely. I have
heard some rubbish about secrecy and transparency. One of the things that
the Labour party has done to alter PFI significantly since the Tories dealt
with it is to put every outline business case and full business case in
the public domain. Was Andrew Wilson aware of that? It seems odd that he
should complain about secrecy when one of the first things that we did
was to put those things in the public domain.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms MacDonald </strong><i>rose-</i></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>I will not give way
again. Much as I love Margo, she ought to sit down.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All those documents are in the public domain.
The only trouble is that nobody in the SNP has actually read them; it would
be a good idea if someone did.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">People have mentioned the terms and conditions
for staff. One of the other changes that we made was to put in a condition
whereby all public-private partnerships must in future involve the unions
in discussions about the contractors that will be involved and the terms
and conditions for staff in the event of a transfer of services. At Hairmyres,
we have set up a partnership agreement, with the unions, that guarantees
staff their pensions; the position is on-going at the royal infirmary.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is the way in which we have changed
things. PFI is about getting private sector money in so that we can deliver
public services. Either we can have our hospitals today, or we can almost
never have them at all.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I hope that it will. We will say, "Look at this hospital. The SNP did not

you would not have it." We are not apologising in any way for public-private
