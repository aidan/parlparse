industry is in a bad condition at the moment. We have heard proposals from
a number of parties, and they are contained within the partnership agreement,

concerning European support can be dealt with. Does the minister have any
plans to bring forward early proposals to deal with that matter?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Yes, because as part
of the expansion of funding in higher and further education we want to
widen access. In particular, we want to focus on those groups that need
special assistance. The disabled students allowance, for example, is paid
to eligible students in higher education who, as a result of their disability,
face extra costs in attending their course. We are also using access funds
to tackle particular problems that students face. The total provided for
access in 1998-99 was &pound;8.76 million. As part of the partnership agreement
between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, that will be increased to &pound;14
million in 2001-02. This is a priority area to which the Executive is giving

developing coaching expertise, important as that is, the task force will
consider proposals to develop indoor and other all-weather facilities for
our football academies, on the Scandinavian model? Such facilities would
provide year-round opportunities for Scottish kids to improve their skills
and end the game's expensive reliance on foreign players, many of them
of Scandinavian origin.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

in social work he will be well aware of the different attributes that different
providers can bring to nursery education. We are very clear about wanting
to have the voluntary and independent sectors actively involved, alongside

Care (Susan Deacon): </strong>The provision of drug treatment will be at the
heart of the Executive's strategy for dealing with drugs. Spending on drug
treatment will be boosted by &pound;6 million over the next three years,
bringing annual spending to &pound;11.3 million.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>Does the minister share
my serious concern-and that of members from all parties-about the shortage
of treatment programmes in Scotland, particularly in certain health board
areas such as Fife and Forth Valley, in my constituency of Mid Scotland
and Fife? Does she share my concern about the shortage of residential rehabilitation
beds? There are only 10 residential treatment centres in Scotland, with
120 beds. What will she do to increase the number of treatment programmes
and centres as well as to learn from the best drug treatment practice in
the United States?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Most members would
share Mr Raffan's concern about the need to tackle drugs effectively. We
are provided with a great opportunity to do that in this Parliament. There
is growing evidence that effective treatment and rehabilitation can have
a real impact. We are also committed to building on best practice where
it exists, and to dealing with drugs as part of a much wider strategy that
includes enforcement and, crucially, prevention: how to avoid people becoming
addicted in the first place. We will work together across different departments
of the Scottish Executive to ensure that we develop a comprehensive strategy
to tackle the issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Raffan: </strong>The minister's reply

in the total budget to tackle drug misuse.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

you must ask a supplementary.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

a real commitment by this Executive to treatment. I indicated that significant
additional resources are going towards that. It would, however, be wrong
to suggest that treatment should be at the expense of investment and action

we will be required to devote fewer resources to treatment and rehabilitation.

(Con): </strong>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to ensure
that the division of responsibilities between local authorities and the
national health service for the delivery of health-related social services
does not result in bed blocking in the future. (S1O-38)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Health and Community
Care (Susan Deacon): </strong>The Executive is committed to more efficient and
effective joint working, based on partnership between local authorities,
the national health service and the voluntary sector. The Executive will
now take forward the plans that are set out in "Modernising community care:
an action plan", which was published in October.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>I am pleased to hear
that there will be greater integration. It has been flagged up to me that
there is likely to be a serious crisis over the millennium, with an expected
increase in accident and emergency cases at a time when the number of NHS
admissions is higher. Compounded with bed blocking, those are serious concerns.
Will they be addressed by the end of the year?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Mrs Scanlon raises
a number of important issues, and I will try to address a few of them briefly.
Additional winter funding has already been channelled in to ensure that
winter crises do not arise. There is, however, no quick fix to the problem
of bed blocking. Some imaginative and effective work has recently been
done locally, which has started to resolve the problems, regarding both
the people who are concerned and the effective use of resources. I am keen
for us to use the opportunity that this Parliament has to build on those
examples and ensure that that success spreads throughout the country.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</strong>I note that the minister believes that the primary responsibility belongs
to the two local authorities. Will she confirm whether the Executive has
plans for extensive de-trunking of the network, whether any such plans
might have implications for the funding of the proposed route, and whether
the Executive has plans to help with the funding of that route?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>We have no plans for
the trunk road programme that would directly affect the western peripheral
route around Aberdeen. The transport bill will provide the opportunity

bring forward road-user charging schemes where appropriate and where they
would fit in with their local transport strategies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs the administration
of the trial of those accused in the Lockerbie air disaster. (S1O-63)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy First Minister and Minister

matter for the High Court of Justiciary. Security and facilities at the
site are being provided by the Scottish Court Service, the Scottish Prison
Service, and Dumfries and Galloway constabulary with the assistance of
other forces.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>The minister
will recall that, when the issue was raised in the other place, we were
frequently assured that the matter of a third-country trial was not just
a devolved issue but one that concerned the Foreign Office. Has he considered
approaching the Foreign Office for a contribution towards the enormous
cost of the trial-which I am sure he would not want to be funded entirely
from the public purse-if indeed the Foreign Office has responsibility in
the matter?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I am pleased to be able
to give Ms Cunningham an answer that I hope she will find satisfactory.
It has been agreed that the agreed capital costs will be met fully by the
reserve and not by the Scottish block. Eighty per cent of current costs
will be met by the reserve and 20 per cent by the Scottish block. That
reflects the fact that, had the trial been held in Scotland, its costs
would have been met by the Scottish block.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</strong>The green paper on housing, published earlier this year, proposed a
review of homelessness in Scotland. I am pleased to be able to announce
today that we will establish a review through a steering group led by Jackie
Baillie, the Deputy Minister for Social Inclusion, Equality and the Voluntary
Sector.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Although I welcome
the homelessness review, it is no excuse for the lack of a housing bill
in the legislative programme proposed by the Executive. Will the task force

Committee and be accountable to it?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>On the homelessness
review, I can certainly give an undertaking that there will be wide consultation
in Scotland. On Fiona Hyslop's wider point, I am happy to say that this
Administration is wholly committed to legislation on housing. As she knows,
the consultation period for the green paper closed only a matter of days
ago. When I met housing organisations in Scotland this morning, they were
delighted that there would be a period to consider the responses and then
the opportunity to use the innovative procedures that this Parliament has
introduced, to consider how to take forward legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tricia Marwick (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(SNP): </strong>On a point of order, Mr Presiding Officer. I asked the clerks
whether I could lodge a question in today's meeting about the housing green
paper. I was prevented from doing so, because that is still a matter for
the Scottish Office. Can you tell me why the minister is referring to a
housing green paper about which I was not allowed to ask a question?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

on the basis of a Home Office document, "Fire Service Pensions Review:
a Consultation Document", that the Government intends to make changes for
new members of the fire service.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Can Mr Mackay assure me that new members
of the fire service will not have reduced pension availability, unlike
their colleagues who are currently serving? More important, I draw the
minister's attention to the decision made at the Fire Brigades Union's
conference on 11 May 1999:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"That this conference rejects the national
employers' proposals as contained in their letters of 17 July 1998 and
22 March 1999 to alter the present conditions as contained within the national
scheme of conditions of service. Conference therefore agrees"-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>Order. You
must ask a question, Mr Quinan. You cannot read out a long quotation in
the middle of a question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Quinan: </strong>I simply want to know
whether the minister will apply what Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, intends
to apply: the withdrawal of the right to strike for members of the Fire
Brigades Union if it implements the decision made at its conference.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Angus Mackay: </strong>If I remember rightly
the first supplementary question that was asked, no, I cannot explain why
the Fire Brigades Union has issued the document to which Lloyd Quinan referred.
However, I know how the confusion has arisen. The initial question was
about the review of the structure of the fire service. The pension scheme
is a separate matter, which is currently the subject of a consultation
that is being carried out by UK ministers. It is an on-going consultation.
When the report is published, the Scottish Executive will take a view of
its own on fire pension schemes. If any changes were made to the fire pension
scheme, current members would retain their existing rights and the new
scheme would apply only to staff joining the fire service after the introduction
of any new scheme.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
