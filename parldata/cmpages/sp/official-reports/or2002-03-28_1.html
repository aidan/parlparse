              <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Transport</strong></P>
              <P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </strong>Good 
                morning. The first item of business is a debate on motion S1M-2945, 
                in the name of David Mundell, on transport, and two amendments 
                to that motion. Members who wish take part in the debate should 
                press their request-to-speak buttons now.</P>
              <P>09:30</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>I just 
                met the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning 
                in the foyer of the Parliament, wearing what looked like a jogging 
                suit. I know now what the reference to pedestrians in the Executive's 
                amendment is all about.</P>
              <P>It is another Thursday morning&#151;the 9.30 graveyard slot. 
                I hope that today we will have a meaningful transport debate. 
                Unlike last week's ministerial announcement of the so-called transport 
                delivery plan&#151;now called a report&#151;I hope that today's 
                debate will be of substance and will set out Scotland's transport 
                needs and identify how we will meet them, not just for the benefit 
                of the travelling public, but for the economy.</P>
              <P>There can be no doubt of the significance of transport infrastructure. 
                In that term, I include public transport. The infrastructure is 
                important to the development of Scotland's economy and to lifting 
                the growth rate above its continuing below-trend performance.</P>
              <P>There is no doubt that business in Scotland is crying out for 
                improvements. The Confederation of British Industry Scotland, 
                Business a.m. and numerous other organisations have produced their 
                own transports plans. The Scottish Executive described the CBI's 
                plan as a</P>
              <P>&quot;timely contribution to the debate ... in Scotland.&quot;</P>
              <P>No wonder there is universal disappointment among the business 
                community, road-user organisations and the travelling public following 
                the launch of the Executive's transport delivery report. As <I>Business 
                a.m. </I>said:</P>

              <P>&quot;Wendy Alexander's claim that her transport delivery report 
                sets out an 'impressive range and number of transport improvements' 
                across Scotland is either astonishingly naive or is designed for 
                Labour flag-waving. Of the 10 projects announced, some are old 
                news, others are dependent on studies before they can go ahead, 
                and none has committed funding.&quot;</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_4"></A>The Minister for Enterprise, 
                Transport and Lifelong Learning (Ms Wendy Alexander):</strong> 
                Which projects would the member like to remove, and does he accept 
                that the concessionary fares scheme, Traveline Scotland and others 
                are fully funded?</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>Pardon me for being sceptical, 
                but it is interesting that the much-vaunted travel scheme was 
                announced 19 months before it is to come into operation. It will 
                be fully operational only one month before the Scottish Parliament 
                elections.</P>
              <P>It is not as if the Scottish Executive did not have sufficient 
                time to prepare detailed proposals. The transport delivery plan 
                was due in September 2000, but has been constantly delayed. It 
                was originally intended to be the Scottish version of John Prescott's 
                10-year strategic plan for transport in England and Wales. However, 
                as <I>The Sunday Times</I> pointed out, since then there has been 
                significant divergence between England and Wales and Scotland 
                in the priority afforded to transport.</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_6"></A>Bristow Muldoon (Livingston) 
                (Lab): </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>I will not at the moment, but 
                I will come back to Mr Muldoon.</P>
              <P>Indeed, if <I>The Sunday Times's</I> story &quot;Scots transport 
                cash lags behind England&quot; is to be believed, the minister's 
                civil servants calculate the shortfall between what is being spent 
                south of the border and what is being spent north of the border 
                at £85 million over the next three years. That one-time favourite 
                transport guru of new Labour, David Begg, agrees. In a recent 
                paper, he accused the Executive of</P>
              <P>&quot;failing to deliver the levels of investment and improvement 
                that are being implemented south of the border&quot;,</P>
              <P>which will lead to a significant negative divergence of approach. 
                According to the article in <I>The Sunday Times</I>, Miss Alexander 
                rejected the idea of a strategic plan not, as I suggested last 
                week, because she prefers 15-second soundbites to 15-year plans, 
                but because she believes that planning is</P>
              <P>&quot;dangerous because it makes the unwarranted assumption that 
                money will be available ... to finance those promises.&quot;</P>
              <P>What a danger; that the electorate should believe that the Labour 
                party and its Liberal Democrat partners would back up promises 
                to improve Scotland's transport system with hard </P>

            <TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
              <P>cash. To avoid that clear danger, the minister took the decisive 
                step of ensuring that there are no concrete plans in the report 
                and that there is no money.</P>
              <P>There are more questions than answers from last week's report. 
                For example, it would be useful if the minister could give a copper-bottomed 
                guarantee that the Scottish Executive, in conjunction with the 
                Strategic Rail Authority, will complete the process of re-letting 
                the ScotRail franchise by April 2004, but there is no evidence 
                that it can.</P>
              <P>What is the Executive's commitment to Borders rail? Is it patronising 
                tokenism or will there be hard cash? Perhaps we will hear the 
                answer today.</P>
              <P>I am sure that the park-and-ride facility at Croy station is 
                a good idea. No doubt there will also be benefits from the works 
                at the Auchenkilns roundabout, although those benefits will be 
                no substitute for an extension to the M80.</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_8"></A>Cathie Craigie (Cumbernauld 
                and Kilsyth) (Lab): </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>I will come back to Cathie Craigie.</P>
              <P>Can it really be the case that when the minister announced her 
                major strategy for the future of transport in Scotland, all that 
                it contained were commitments to build a car park and a roundabout? 
                No wonder it was met with such derision. That is why we need to 
                begin the process again, but this time with funds and time scales 
                clearly identified.</P>
              <P><strong>Cathie Craigie: </strong>The member raised two points 
                about matters in my constituency&#151;the Auchenkilns roundabout 
                and the Croy park-and-ride scheme&#151;but it is obvious that 
                he and his party know nothing about issues in the area. Traffic 
                management at the Auchenkilns roundabout is exactly what the people 
                of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth are looking for. It is exactly what 
                will ease the congestion on that road. On Croy station&#151;</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_11"></A>The Deputy Presiding Officer: 
                </strong>We do not want a speech. You have made your point.</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>If Cathie Craigie had listened, 
                she would know that I said that I welcomed the Croy station improvements. 
                I have spent hours in queuing traffic at Auchenkilns roundabout, 
                so I know what the problems are there and the solution is completion 
                of the M80.</P>
              <P>I will refer back to the transport delivery plan. I do not accept 
                Miss Alexander's assertion in another Sunday newspaper that the 
                transport problems of rural Scotland have been sorted out. That 
                is an outrageous assertion that is based on the giving out of 
                a few minibuses instead of </P>

            <TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
              <P>acknowledging the deplorable state of most rural non-trunk roads, 
                which those minibuses must drive on. Nor has rural public transport 
                been improved.</P>
              <P>The need to improve the A75 and A77 in the Stranraer area is 
                as great as ever. Failure to do so will have a knock-on impact 
                on ferry investment and will create in Wigtownshire a rural economic 
                catastrophe of unparalleled severity. That is why the Conservative 
                party would carry out the necessary works out of public funds. 
                That does not apply just to the A75 and A77; we believe that Scotland's 
                motorway network must be completed. The time for studies is over. 
                Scotland's travelling taxpayers are entitled to see their hard-earned 
                tax pounds spent on completion of the M8, the M74 northern extension, 
                upgrading of the A80, the A8000 and the Aberdeen western relief 
                road. There are many other worthy projects in Scotland.</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_13"></A>Mr Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire 
                and Kincardine) (LD): </strong>Will the member take an intervention 
                on that point?</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>Not at the moment.</P>
              <P>That does not mean taking money from rail and public transport, 
                which have a vital role. That vital role is why we support the 
                development of rail links to Edinburgh and Glasgow airports. As 
                the <I>Evening Times</I> stated in relation to Glasgow airport:</P>
              <P>&quot;The lack of decent public transport links ... not only 
                helps to contribute to massive congestion on the M8 but is also 
                one of the main factors cited as stifling the growth of the west 
                of Scotland economy.&quot;</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_15"></A>Mr Rumbles: </strong>I 
                want to make sure that we get this on the record. Will the member 
                confirm that all that he suggests should be paid for by the Executive 
                out of public funds? Does the Conservative party support those 
                projects being paid for out of taxpayers' money?</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>Mr Rumbles will hear about that. 
                We have previously made it clear that we would commit to transport 
                £100 million per year from the budget of the rest of Miss Alexander's 
                department. I restate that. As the smoke and mirrors are stripped 
                away from the Executive's budget, significantly greater resources 
                might become available. What, for example, will happen post 2004 
                to the £100 million a year that the Executive currently has in 
                an estates budget that is being ploughed into the Holyrood project?</P>
              <P><strong>Alasdair Morgan (Galloway and Upper Nithsdale) (SNP): 
                </strong>Given that the Conservatives are never going to be in 
                power, or even in coalition, in this Parliament, can the member 
                tell me what is the point of all this?</P>

              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>I do not know how to take that, 
                Presiding Officer.</P>
              <P>We in Scotland cannot have a transport system that we can be 
                proud of if we do not rid the country of the scourge of Labour's 
                plague of potholes, which have become all too common on our country 
                roads and in our towns. The Executive must engage in a strategic 
                dialogue with local government on the steps that are needed to 
                return our non-trunk roads to a reasonable state of repair. Scottish 
                Conservatives are committed to setting up an inspectorate that 
                would carry out an independent audit of the state of non-trunk 
                roads that would provide a basis for dialogue. Road users want 
                to end buck passing between the Scottish Executive and councils. 
                It is time to deliver a mutually funded plan for action.</P>
              <P>The Scottish Executive has failed to deliver the transport infrastructure 
                that business needs and the travelling public deserve. It has 
                presided over transport chaos, the most lamentable recent example 
                being its sitting on the fence on the rail strikes. Only when 
                the public were at the end of their tether and business had lost 
                millions did the Executive even begin to give any sort of signal 
                to its friends in the rail unions that strikes were totally unacceptable 
                and that the travelling public should be put first. In so doing, 
                the Scottish Executive failed the Scottish people, just as Stephen 
                Byers has failed rail users throughout the UK.</P>
              <P>Mr Byers has one priority. That priority is not travellers, but 
                himself and saving his neck. The latest thing he has had to do 
                to achieve that is to pay £300 million to Railtrack's shareholders, 
                which he and many Labour MSPs vowed would never be done. It would 
                have been far better to have used that money to continue to support 
                Railtrack to invest in improving our railways, but just as in 
                Scotland&#151;as the Executive's amendment today proves&#151;Labour 
                has no interest in transport, only in spin. The Conservatives 
                do have an interest in transport. Our commitments to business 
                and to the travelling public are clear and unequivocal.</P>
              <P>I move,</P>
              <P>That the Parliament notes the importance of transport to the 
                economy in delivering growth and investment to Scotland; further 
                notes that the Scottish Executive's stewardship of transport issues 
                has been characterised by chaos and muddle, evidenced by strikes, 
                increased congestion, poor maintenance of local roads and unreliable 
                public transport; regrets that the long-awaited transport delivery 
                plan launched by the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong 
                Learning on 21 March 2002 contains no concrete plans for funding 
                and delivering desperately needed improvements to Scotland's transport

              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong 
                Learning (Lewis Macdonald): </strong>I am grateful to the Tory 
                party for raising such an important topic again, and for providing 
                us with another opportunity to highlight the Executive's priorities 
                in delivering a modern transport system for Scotland as a whole. 
                The reason why the debate has revolved, and will continue to revolve, 
                around the policies of the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition is 
                not simply that we are in power. It is because we have gone beyond 
                complaining about the problems and have brought forward solutions 
                while the Opposition has not. We have outlined priorities and 
                laid out what needs to be done to overcome the legacy of 18 years 
                of neglect and decline under Tory rule.</P>
              <P><strong>Alasdair Morgan: </strong>That was five years ago.</P>
              <P><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP): 
                </strong>Have the last five years vanished?</P>
              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Indeed it was five years ago, 
                but it has taken some time to get to where we are. In looking 
                forward, we will not do what the Tories have just promised to 
                do, and cut university funding by £100 million a year.</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>I do not think that we said that. 
                Ms Wendy Alexander's budget covers far more, as Lewis Macdonald 
                knows, than university funding. Does he think that the £3 million 
                that Scottish Enterprise spent on public relations activity was 
                money well spent, and that it would not be better spent on public 
                transport?</P>
              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>If I stand corrected by Mr 
                Mundell, I must acknowledge that rather than cutting £100 million 
                from university education, clearly his proposal is to cut £100 
                million from business support. That announcement will not be welcomed 
                by the business community, but perhaps it will be more welcome 
                to universities than was his first proposal.</P>
              <P>We will meet the challenges that face Scotland's economy and 
                transport system in the next 20 years by setting priorities and 
                moving forward to meet them. A generation ago, as Wendy Alexander 
                said in the Parliament last week, the great challenge was to provide 
                the strategic roads to link our major cities and to connect Scotland 
                with the south. Today, the greatest challenge&#151;and the one 
                thing in the Tory motion with which I agree&#151;is to tackle 
                congestion in and between our major metropolitan areas.</P>

              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We will not meet that challenge 
                simply by girning about the problems. We will meet it by recognising 
                that the price of urban congestion is too great for our economy 
                and our environment to pay, and by identifying the most effective 
                ways in which that economic and environmental burden can be removed. 
                We will seek to modernise and improve our public transport system, 
                not talk it down. We will seek to complete the missing links in 
                our strategic transport networks, not just say that every single 
                project is a priority and then avoid the tough choices that need 
                to be made.</P>
              <P>We want a bigger, better and safer railway network. That is probably 
                the common view in the chamber, but the Executive will focus its 
                efforts on what is achievable and what will deliver and make a 
                difference. We are working to deliver by April 2004 the directions 
                and guidance that are required for a 15-year franchise for ScotRail's 
                services. We have restructured the existing franchise so that 
                all existing services can be built into the baseline for its replacement, 
                whether they are part of the present agreement or not. That is 
                real progress. We want to see real competition for the next franchise, 
                so that Scottish travellers get the best possible deal out of 
                whoever delivers the services from April 2004.</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>On the 
                ScotRail franchise, the minister might like to advise the current 
                holders of the franchise that today is not a public holiday, and 
                that it is highly inappropriate for ScotRail to charge travellers 
                premium rates for travelling within Scotland, just because the 
                company happens to be owned south of the border.</P>
              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Members will find that the 
                process of issuing directions and guidance and letting the next 
                franchise will take into account the record of the present holder 
                of the franchise, as it will take into account the plans of the 
                present franchise holder and any other competitors that come forward.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>Will the

              <P>The Strategic Rail Authority's strategic rail plan, which was 
                issued recently, contains a set of priorities for upgrading Scotland's 
                railway infrastructure, which are also among the priorities for 
                Scotland that were announced by Wendy Alexander last week. Redeveloping 
                Waverley station is one of those. Provision of more platforms 
                for local and strategic services will increase the capacity of 
                the rail network on mainline routes to London, Glasgow and Aberdeen,

              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_17"></A>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) 
                (Con): </strong>Is it still the Government's intention to get 
                more and more freight on to the rails, given that that has massive 
                implications for signalling requirements? What steps is the minister 
                taking to ensure that signalling resources, expertise, manpower 
                and hardware will be made available?</P>
              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We have increased our target 
                for transferring freight from road to rail and water from 18 million 
                lorry miles a year, which we achieved this month, to 23 million 
                lorry miles a year, which is our target for a year hence. We are 
                in discussions with the SRA, Railtrack and others that are involved 
                in the industry on how to obtain those signalling resources.</P>
              <P>Delivering top-priority public transport projects is part of

                Macdonald: </strong>We also want a capital city with a public 
                transport system that is fit for purpose. Edinburgh trams will 
                symbolise that vision. Partnership is the key to fixing congestion 
                in Aberdeen, which is also a key national priority.</P>
              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>In the course of the past 12 
                months, we have extended our strategic road traffic model and 
                strategic rail planning to the north-east from the central belt.<A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_22"></A> 
                That means not more studies, but judging transport issues in Aberdeen 
                on the same basis as those in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and fully 
                acknowledging that Europe's energy capital is part of urban Scotland.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>What does the Executive expect the 
                end date to be with regard to plans for the transport system in 
                Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire? Is it a year in the future?</P>
              <P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_24"></A>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We 
                expect the strategic traffic modelling that I have described to 
                produce concrete results during the course of this year. We are 
                investing, as we did again last week, in the development of a 
                modern north-east transport system for the region, and in developing 
                a Borders rail link.</P>
              <P>We will follow up the short-term measures that we announced last 
                week to tackle the major issues on the corridors between Glasgow

                national travel timetable through Traveline and concessionary 
                fares for elderly and disabled people on local off-peak bus services.</P>

                have expressed in previous debates. He was right to say that the 
                transport delivery plan provides more questions than answers. 
                We must consider where we are at present and how we got here. 
                We have not simply arrived from cyberspace. We are here because 
                of a period of logical progression. As the minister said, during 
                that time we had 19 years of Tory rule. Because of those 19 hard 
                Tory years, the people of Scotland turfed the Tories out at the

              <P>The fact is that the Tories constructed the M74, for which we 
                give them credit. However, they cannot dine out on the construction 
                of one major bit of infrastructure in a generation. That is inadequate.</P>

              <P>Many of the points that have been made about potholes arose because 
                the Tories underfunded local authorities. The Tories started starving 
                local authorities of cash and I am sad that the Lib-Lab Executive 
                has continued to do that. When the Tories initiated that underfunding, 
                the cracks began to appear. They might resemble crevasses in many 
                areas now, and they began with the Tories.</P>
              <P><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Mr MacAskill asked how we got here. 
                I got here from Ayr by driving up the A77 dual carriageway, which 
                the Tories modified, up the M77, which the Tories provided, and 
                on to the ring road around Glasgow, which the Tories provided. 
                I got here on roads that the Tories provided.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>The member probably did that because 
                he did not wish to use the railway. A former Tory Prime Minister 
                used to say that she did not believe in railways, and she went 
                out of her way to humiliate them. Mr Gallie did not take the train 
                because to travel through Glasgow&#151;our major city&#151;he 
                would have had to change trains and stations. The Tories had power 
                for a generation, yet they could not connect Ayr to Edinburgh 
                with a direct train. The Tories failed to do that, so we need 
                no empty lectures from them.</P>
              <P>The motion refers to fault, error and malaise, but all that started 
                with the Tories. Did not the terms &quot;chaos&quot; and &quot;muddle&quot; 
                apply in the 1980s and 1990s? Did not we have strikes? Yes, we 
                did. I have some sympathy for ScotRail, because when the public 
                monopoly was handed over to a private monopoly, the difficulties 
                that the public monopoly had were simply transferred. The blame 
                for that cannot be laid solely at the Executive's door. I blame 
                the Executive for failing to take action and for washing its hands 
                of the matter, but the solutions that the likes of Mr Canavan 
                suggest would probably not be required if we still had British 
                Rail, because collective bargaining would take place nationally. 
                The Tories caused the problems by fragmenting and privatising 
                the rail network. As I said, the Tories started underfunding of 
                local road maintenance.</P>
              <P>It is gross hypocrisy for the Tories, who privatised the railways 
                and deregulated the buses, to say that public transport is unreliable. 
                Not only did the Tories deregulate the buses back in the 1980s, 
                but Mr McLetchie now wants to privatise Lothian Buses&#151;the 
                jewel in the crown of Edinburgh in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. 
                The Tories initiated the problem and want to worsen the situation. 
                The people of the Lothians will reject them again next year, because 
                their suggestion to privatise Lothian Buses is anathema.</P>
              <P>The Tories did not restrict themselves to privatising the railways 
                and deregulating the buses&#151;they even sold off the British

                because of its management's failure to deliver and make that airport

              <P>The Tories say that they want to resolve the situation by taking 
                money from Scottish Enterprise's budget. I sympathise with that 
                position. Scottish Enterprise has suggested that it would pay 
                for the M74 north extension if nobody else would, so it is clear

              <P><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>That is a matter for Scottish 
                Enterprise. The minister would have to speak to Robert Crawford 
                about that. Scottish Enterprise has said on record that if the 
                M74 extension could not be funded any other way, it would scrape 
                to the bottom of the barrel and use all its money at local enterprise 
                company and national level to build the extension, because it 
                considers the extension important. If Scottish Enterprise has 
                said that it can manage that, it is about time the Executive found 
                out where it can get that money.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>Will 
                the member give way?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>Not at the moment.</P>
              <P>In the Executive's amendment, Mr Macdonald talks about public 
                transport. The ScotRail franchise is to pay for everything that 
                has been pledged for rail, but the franchise does not exist in 
                isolation. We will eventually pay for it. We can approach SNCF, 
                Virgin Trains or National Express, but they will all want to know 
                how much they will be given before they will say what they can 
                do.</P>
              <P>We cannot say that we will construct the Borders rail link and 
                the airport links, improve the service and make the trains run 
                on time unless we say in time for the tendering process in 2004 
                what budget will be available. It is incumbent on the Executive 
                to say what funding will be available for the ScotRail franchise. 
                Until it does that, we will have only a wish list, because SNCF, 
                Virgin Trains and National Express will say only, &quot;We can 
                provide what you want, but that depends on how much you pay us.&quot;</P>

                no structure. We need immediate action to fix the potholes in 
                key congestion areas, allied with a long-term strategic plan for 
                building up our national infrastructure. So far, the problems

                regrets that the Scottish Executive's latest transport strategy 
                publication, Scotland's Transport: Delivering Improvements, provides 
                no programme, no costings and no timescale, and therefore offers

                have lodged a brave motion. It says that</P>
              <P>&quot;the Scottish Executive's stewardship of transport issues 
                has been characterised by chaos and muddle, evidenced by strikes, 
                increased congestion, poor maintenance of local roads and unreliable 
                public transport&quot;.</P>
              <P>When did all that start? To do all that in two short years is 
                very clever. [M<FONT SIZE="-1">EMBERS</FONT>: &quot;Five years.&quot;] 
                The motion refers to the Scottish Executive. Could the cause have 
                something to do with the brutal undermining of local authorities, 
                which created a backlog of road maintenance that stretched 40-year 
                road treatment programmes to 200 years, as an almost tearful local 
                government officer once informed me? Could it have something to 
                do with bus deregulation or the botched privatisation of the railways?</P>
              <P>The motion rather unfairly sneers at the transport delivery plan. 
                For a start, it is a transport delivery report, and it reports 
                many good things. Members should read it. It sets out projects 
                that are beginning to be tackled, including the redevelopment 
                of Waverley station, dealing with congestion in Aberdeen&#151;projects 
                that are dear to my own self-interest&#151;rail links to Edinburgh 
                and Glasgow airports, a light rail system in Edinburgh and the 
                Borders rail link. All those projects were Liberal Democrat manifesto 
                pledges. The report also lays out completion of the missing links 
                on the A8 and A80. Progress is beginning to be made on all of 
                those projects.</P>

              <P>Scotland presents an interesting selection of transport problems. 
                They range from our remote areas and islands that have population 
                levels that cannot sustain unsubsidised modern transport links, 
                to densely populated areas that have overloaded public transport 
                systems. We have highly productive food, forestry, paper, fish 
                and textile industries at one end of the country, but their main 
                markets are at the other end of the country, in Europe and beyond. 
                We have a rural population that is dependent on the car and an 
                urban population that is choking on its own exhaust fumes. Thirty 
                per cent of households have no access to a car.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>Does 
                the member accept that the last time her party was in power there 
                were very few cars and therefore no transport problems? Will she 
                tell me whether her party is following the same policies today 
                as they did at that time?</P>
              <P><strong>Nora Radcliffe: </strong>I remind the member that the 
                National Health Service was among our policies.</P>
              <P>Scotland has the advantage of being a small country in which 
                it is easier to take an holistic approach. Would not it be sensible 
                to rationalise how our airports do business so that they complement 
                each other and do not compete for the same type of business? Modern 
                mapping systems and computer capability enable us to look at the 
                goods and bodies on any particular route and to calculate the 
                reason why that route is used. Those systems and that capability 
                can calculate whether the route is used for a local or a through 
                journey, for business or leisure and by a native or a tourist. 
                Those systems and that capability make it possible to make intelligent 
                transport provision, using every appropriate mode of transport, 
                including pavements, cycleways, roads, rail, air, sea and even 
                canals.</P>
              <P>Shared transport is more efficient transport; that is the case 
                on environmental and financial grounds. The public will change 
                from using their cars and move on to buses and trains not only 
                if major investment in infrastructure and rolling stock is put 
                in place, but if more passenger-centred thinking is applied. Potential 
                passengers will not use a bus if they do not know its timetable 
                or route. They will not spend time and trouble seeking out that 
                vital information. We must put the information under their noses.</P>

              <P>The potential passenger's journey does not begin or end at the

                connecting services or information that the person will need. 
                Provision of such services need not be expensive, but it will 
                pay dividends.</P>
              <P>Although transport is about moving people and goods around, we 
                tend to forget the value of planning for removing the necessity 
                for transport. All new developments should be planned to put people's 
                homes near their jobs, to build in walk and cycleways through 
                residential and business areas and to ensure that pupils have 
                safe walking routes to schools.</P>
              <P>On Monday, I travelled to Oban for the Transport and the Environment 
                Committee's meeting. As I did so, the remains of an old railway 
                line&#151;two short viaducts and a retaining wall&#151;caught 
                my eye. The structure had survived from Victorian times because 
                it was beautifully engineered and built to last. If the Victorians 
                could build a rail network to last, surely to goodness we can 
                do at least as well. The Victorians believed that they could do 
                it, so they did it. We need some of that confidence and self-belief 
                today.</P>
              <P>We can and will create a safe and affordable transport network 
                throughout Scotland and with connections beyond. It should be 
                a network that is as fit for our time as the Victorian network 
                was for its time.</P>

              <P><strong>Bill Aitken (Glasgow) (Con): </strong>When the minister 
                announced the transport delivery plan&#151;with the customary 
                fanfare of trumpets&#151;it was significant that she decided to 
                do so in a statement rather than a parliamentary debate. The reason 
                for that was simple. When one examined the statement, one saw 
                that it did not say a lot. The report's 10 highlighted priorities 
                depend entirely on the completion of more studies, more consultations 
                and more plans. There is a total lack of action.</P>
              <P>Given the time that is available to me, I will deal not with 
                the transport problems that affect Scotland, but with those that 
                affect Glasgow. That is not because I am being parochial or territorial; 
                it is because the problems in Glasgow highlight the difficulties 
                that apply to Scotland.</P>
              <P>Glasgow is a city in which it is easy to get around. It does 
                not have too many problems in that respect. As a result of some 
                pretty enlightened thinking in the 1960s and 1970s, Glasgow, with 
                its expressway and its motorway network, is easy to get through.

              <P>there is highly problematical.</P>
              <P>A journey from Stirling to Glasgow is fine until one arrives 
                at the nightmare that is Auchenkilns. A journey from Edinburgh 
                is fine&#151;once one gets out of Edinburgh&#151;until one arrives 
                at Newhouse, where the situation is one of wall-to-wall metal 
                all the way into the city. We agree that missing transport links 
                have to be completed, but when will that be done and what action 
                will be taken in the meantime to improve a situation that is well 
                nigh intolerable?</P>
              <P>When will something be done about the rail link to Glasgow airport? 
                Even by the earliest estimation, it will take something like seven 
                years for the project planning and planning process to be undertaken. 
                Until that component is in place, the vital link between Glasgow 
                and its airport will not be achieved. Is it not ironic that it 
                is possible to take a train from Glasgow or Edinburgh to Manchester 
                airport but impossible to take a train from Glasgow city centre 
                to Glasgow airport? That highlights the difficulties that we face. 
                Not only would a rail link to Glasgow airport be invaluable to 
                commerce and the local economy in the city of Glasgow, but it 
                would achieve what the Executive seems anxious to achieve&#151;a 
                reduction in the congestion on the M8 around and about Paisley.</P>
              <P>The railway network is in a total and absolute shambles and is 
                likely to become worse as a result of Mr Byers's plans and his 
                ill-considered taking of Railtrack into administration. I have 
                referred before in the chamber to Michael Palin's programme &quot;Great 
                Railway Journeys of the World&quot;. However, in the minds of 
                many people, what should be a simple train journey from Glasgow 
                to Edinburgh is a nightmare. It need not be thus. With a bit of 
                thought and pre-planning, many of the difficulties that are experienced 
                could be avoided. Although, as a Glaswegian, I tend to regard 
                the view from the 5.30 pm train from Edinburgh to Glasgow as one 
                of the best that the city of Edinburgh has to offer, there has 
                to be better communication between the two cities. If there is 
                not, there could be a damaging effect on industry and commerce.</P>
              <P><strong>Alasdair Morgan: </strong>Does the member accept that 
                the current state of the railways has little to do with Mr Byers, 
                who has been in office only since last summer, and everything 
                to do with the Treasury under the Tories? At that time, the Treasury 
                turned down practically every investment scheme that was proposed 
                for the railways.</P>

                basic fact, which is that the Conservative Government has not 
                been in office for five years. Anything that was wrong should

              <P>We should examine the SNP's record on transport. It is interesting 
                to note that Mr MacAskill was highly critical of my colleague 
                Mr Gallie for highlighting the fact that he was able to drive 
                on Conservative-funded roads from Ayr to Edinburgh. If Mr MacAskill's 
                colleagues had had their way, Mr Gallie would not have been able 
                to do that&#151;the SNP vigorously opposed the M77 link. That 
                shows the negative aspect of the SNP's approach to transport.</P>
              <P>The debate is serious. It is a good thing that it has already 
                engendered some heat. Transport in Scotland is in a vulnerable 
                state and early action is necessary.</P>
              <P>10:09</P>
              <P><strong>Bristow Muldoon (Livingston) (Lab): </strong>Before touching 
                on the main subject of the debate, I want to respond to some of 
                the points that have been made. Mr McGrigor intervened to make 
                a point about the length of time since the last Liberal Government. 
                I look forward to that same length of time elapsing until the 
                next Conservative Government. Indeed, if the Tories continue as 
                they are, that will be easily achieved. I must also comment on 
                Mr Aitken's brave reference to missing links. The Conservatives 
                could give evolutionists a great deal of useful material on that 
                topic, but perhaps not in the way that he intends.</P>
              <P>The Tories' choice of subject is interesting. I wonder why they 
                choose to secure debates on subjects in which they have a record 
                of abject failure instead of debating topics in which they had 
                some success when in government. When I thought back over the 
                Tories' 18 years in power&#151;not 19 years, as Mr MacAskill claimed&#151;I 
                came up with some successes that perhaps they should be mentioning 
                instead. For example, making the wearing of seat-belts compulsory 
                and banning alcohol in Scottish football grounds were excellent 
                initiatives. However, it would get boring if we had to talk about 
                those issues every week.</P>
              <P>I am pleased that the Tories have decided to debate transport 
                today, because it is one of the areas in which they have the worst 
                record of failure. They are responsible for many of the problems 
                that they have highlighted. Bill Aitken described the railway 
                network as</P>
              <P>&quot;a total and absolute shambles&quot;.</P>
              <P>However, as Mr MacAskill correctly pointed out, the network is 
                in such a state because of the Tories' lack of investment in the 
                railways when they were publicly owned and because of the Tories' 
                botched programme of privatisation.</P>

                The Tories should listen to this point. That step will ensure 
                that taxpayers' money will be spent on improving the railway service 
                instead of being poured down the drain making shareholders rich 
                as the Tories would prefer.</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>What will the £300 million that 
                Mr Byers has set aside for Railtrack shareholders be spent on? 
                Why were Mr Byers and indeed Mr Muldoon's colleagues only a few 
                weeks ago saying that not a penny would ever be paid to shareholders?</P>
              <P><strong>Bristow Muldoon: </strong>Mr Mundell should tell us instead 
                how many more billions of pounds of taxpayers' money the Tories 
                would waste on an enterprise that failed in every respect. Railtrack 
                failed to invest, to manage safety and to operate as a financially 
                successful company.</P>
              <P>The Tories are absolutely obsessed with roads. However, they 
                have absolutely no concept of public transport, which is hardly 
                surprising, as they never use it. Mr Gallie demonstrated that 
                when he described his journey from Ayr.</P>

              <P>If the Tories had any experience of using public services, they 
                might believe in them.</P>
              <P>From the way in which the Tories describe the Executive's forward 
                transport programme, one would think that they did not want the 
                minister to plan for the future. Do they think that major investment 
                in infrastructure happens by accident and that we do not have 
                to plan it out years in advance? Perhaps that is why there was 
                so little planning when they were in power.</P>
              <P>The Tories also seem to suggest that, so far under the Executive, 
                nothing has happened in transport in Scotland. However, there 
                has already been major investment in a number of areas. For example, 
                £8 million has been invested in the Fife circle line and £13 million 
                has been made available for new trains for Strathclyde Passenger 
                Transport. Moreover, the Executive has committed an additional 
                £320 million to a number of motorway and trunk road projects. 
                In my area, £4 million has been invested in a brand-new express

                </strong>Before I ask the minister specific questions about the 
                railways, I must tell Bill Aitken that the Tories have a lot to 
                answer for. Rail projects are not delivered quickly; they have 
                a long gestation period, and we are still suffering from the lack 
                of investment throughout the Tory years.</P>

                the member give way?</P>
              <P><strong>Alasdair Morgan: </strong>Not at the moment.</P>
              <P>I know that the minister is not directly responsible for the 
                west coast main line, but is the Executive happy with the capacity 
                forecasts on the line, particularly in relation to freight? The 
                rail lobby is already complaining that there is not enough capacity 
                south of the border. When Richard Branson introduces his faster 
                tilting Pendolino trains, the situation will only get worse, because 
                there will be even less room for freight. The Post Office has 
                already indicated that it is taking off some of its trains because 
                the journey times are not decent enough. The matter is important 
                for the Scottish economy.</P>
              <P>I am glad about the remodelling of Waverley station, but one 
                of the main constraints is the line capacity out to Dalmeny and 
                Falkirk. Before ScotRail introduced its emergency timetable, one 
                delay in the morning would make every train late. As I have not 
                been able to find the part of the programme that addresses that 
                problem, I wonder whether the minister will explain where it is 
                hidden.</P>
              <P>All parties need to find some imaginative solutions to the fact 
                that many of our previous solutions have become problems. For 
                example, the Edinburgh city bypass was originally built to take 
                traffic around Edinburgh. However, instead of simply being a bypass, 
                the road has become a destination, because many offices, supermarkets 
                and cinemas have been built beside it. Clearly such development 
                cannot be undone; indeed, one could argue that it has brought 
                great economic benefit to the city. However, in future, when new 
                bypasses are built elsewhere, we must stipulate the planning constraints

              <P>I know that members would be disappointed if I did not have a 
                small rant about the A75 and the A77, so that is what I intend 
                to do so for the remaining minute and a half of my speech. This 
                is not just a local matter in Dumfries and Galloway; the roads 
                are strategically important to the whole of Scotland. If we compare 
                the northern corridor from Stranraer to Ireland with corridors 
                further south, we find that the northern corridor is far more 
                important for freight than, say, the central corridor from Holyhead. 
                The proportion of freight on the northern corridor&#151;and then 
                on the A75 and the A77&#151;has implications for the type of road 
                that is needed. Although the total number of vehicle movements 
                might not be as great as those on more southerly corridors, the 
                fact that most are lorry movements means that we need a better 
                solution to the problem.</P>
              <P>The A55 through north Wales to Holyhead has brought significant 
                economic benefits to that part of the world.</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Johnstone: </strong>That is a Tory road.</P>
              <P><strong>Alasdair Morgan: </strong>Well, it might be, but it is 
                a Tory road that was not built in Scotland. That is part of the 
                problem.</P>
              <P>A Cardiff Business School survey highlighted the huge economic 
                benefits that the A55 has brought to north Wales and that was 
                before the recent dualling of another 18 miles of road in the 
                island of Anglesey. One constituency alone has received 18 miles 
                of dual carriageway at the end of the route from London to Holyhead 
                and then on to Ireland, which is about 17 miles more than the 
                entire length of dual carriageway in the south-west of Scotland. 
                Although £730 million was spent on the A55 at 1996 prices, it 
                is planned that only £30 million will be spent on the A75 and 
                that is for the period up to 2008. If we do not have a more level 
                playing field between the A55 and the A75, there will be severe 
                consequences for the economy of the whole of the south-west of 
                Scotland and&#151;because the roads are of strategic importance&#151;for 
                the whole of Scotland.</P>

              <P>We accept the need to get more traffic off the roads and more 
                people on to the railway. However, there is a real problem with 
                the state of rail infrastructure and the lack of capacity on the 
                tracks. Despite all the spin that we hear from the Executive and 
                today's self-congratulatory amendment, in the real world commuters 
                face a dismal experience. They know what the situation is on the 
                ground. As on health service, all that we get from the Executive 
                is fine talk; the reality does not match the rhetoric. We need 
                proper management of the railways so that confidence can be restored 
                to the sector.</P>
              <P>The railways need the private sector to invest, but the private 
                sector will not do so with all the dithering that we have seen 
                from Stephen Byers and the Department of Transport, Local Government 
                and the Regions. Six months ago, Stephen Byers was saying that 
                not a penny of taxpayers' money would go to Railtrack's shareholders. 
                This week, in another dramatic U-turn by the Labour Government, 
                £300 million is to be spent on compensation. How can anybody have 
                any confidence in the Government's approach when Byers's priority 
                is saving his own neck rather than sorting out the problems on 
                the railways?</P>
              <P><strong>Bristow Muldoon: </strong>Murdo Fraser talks about capacity 
                problems that cause difficulties, especially in the east of Scotland. 
                Can he tell us when a Tory Government or the privatised Railtrack 
                was going to get around to investing in Edinburgh Waverley? Does 
                he not recognise that the Strategic Rail Authority&#151;which 
                was established by Labour&#151;put that on the political agenda?</P>
              <P><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>Plans to reassess the capacity 
                of Waverley have been in place for years. The fact is that the 
                private sector will not invest in Railtrack and the railways because 
                of what has happened with Byers. The Government has completely 
                lost the confidence of the private sector.</P>
              <P>I shall move on to talk about roads. Mr Muldoon talked the most 
                nonsense that I have heard in the chamber for a long time when 
                he talked about our record. Under the Conservative Government 
                in the years between 1992 and 1997, the average spend on trunk 
                roads and motorway construction in Scotland was £150 million a 
                year. In 2002-03, the spend on trunk roads and motorways will 
                be £43 million. The improvements that were delivered under the 
                Conservative Government can be seen: the dualling of the A90 from 
                Perth to Aberdeen; the dualling of the A9 from Stirling to Perth; 
                improvements on the A9 north of Perth; and the Dornoch and Kessock

                was short sighted of the Conservative Administration?</P>
              <P><strong>Murdo Fraser: </strong>As I understand it, a proper assessment 
                was undertaken at the time and incorporating rail on the Dornoch 
                bridge was deemed not to be a viable project.</P>
              <P>I welcome the fact that work will shortly start at the Inchture 
                junction on the A90. I also welcome the work that is being done 
                at the Forfar and Glamis junctions to deal with accident blackspots. 
                However, work also needs to be done on the A9. South of Perth, 
                a considerable number of junctions are in need of upgrading. The 
                problem is that there has been an exponential growth in traffic 
                on the A9 since it was dualled. Because of the growth in communities 
                such as Greenloaning, Blackford and Auchterarder, the junctions 
                that serve those communities have become substandard. I recently 
                spent a day in that area, meeting local councillors and community 
                councillors who all had the same message: the accident rate is 
                unacceptable. If there is to be further housing development in 
                the area, there must be improvements. In the long term, we must 
                also consider dualling the entire stretch of the A9 north of Perth 
                to Inverness. That would have to be done over several years. The 
                Conservative Government made good progress on that, but investment 
                has dried up under the Labour-Liberal coalition.</P>
              <P>Good roads are required not just to make the lives of locals 
                easier. Poor and congested roads inhibit economic growth, especially 
                tourism, which is the life-blood of local communities. If the 
                Executive is serious about promoting enterprise in Scotland, it 
                should listen to local people and business organisations and loosen 
                the purse strings so that we can build the roads that we need

                the brass neck of a party that dares to comment on rail problems 
                after selling off our national rail infrastructure for a bargain-basement 
                price to a company that demonstrated that it could not do the 
                job.</P>
              <P>I am beginning to have serious doubts about the health of Conservative 
                members. They seem to have a form of dementia that causes them 
                to forget the distant past and remember only recent events. In 
                debate after debate, the Tories seem to have completely forgotten 
                what happened under previous Tory Governments.</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>Ms Whitefield is well qualified 
                to lecture on amnesia, because that is what she is suffering from. 
                She seems to think that time stopped in May 1997, when Labour 
                took control of transport in Scotland. From that time, the Government 
                has delivered nothing. Labour has been in power for five years 
                and that is where the buck stops.</P>
              <P><strong>Karen Whitefield: </strong>Since we came to power, things 
                have started to move. We have started to invest in public transport 
                and we are not setting public transport against roads. The issue 
                is not just about investing in roads, which is something that 
                previous Tory Governments failed to understand.</P>
              <P>Let me provide the Conservatives with some therapeutic assistance 
                to help them to remember what happened. In a debate on rail privatisation 
                in 1996, John Watts, the then Minister for Railways and Roads, 
                said:</P>
              <P>&quot;Rail user groups are increasingly coming to recognise the 
                benefits that privatisation has brought. A shift in public attitudes 
                is under way. The future of the railway in the UK is secure. The 
                case for privatisation is so overwhelming that in 10 years the 
                radicalism of today's policies will look like nothing more than 
                common sense. By putting the railways into the private sector, 
                we are powering them into the 21st century.&quot;&#151;[<I>Official 
                Report, House of Commons</I>, 15 November 1996, Vol 285, c 607.]</P>
              <P>David Mundell said that Railtrack failed because of Labour's 
                interventions. However, less than a year after the Tory minister 
                made that statement&#151;in May 1997 when Labour came to power&#151;Railtrack 
                was already £700 million behind in its investment in rail and 
                its maintenance programme. We all know that the Tories' vision 
                of nirvana for the railways was oversold. The truth is that they 
                botched the privatisation and the Labour Government and the Labour-led 
                Executive have been left to pick up the pieces.</P>
              <P>The Executive is committed to tackling congestion in an integrated 
                way, by improving key sections of our trunk road network and investing 
                substantially in and improving our public transport system. Unlike

                alleviate congestion, such as the development of rail links to 
                our airports, action on the findings of the multimodal studies&#151;which 
                I believe will prove the need for an Airdrie-Bathgate railway

                that turning around 20 years of underinvestment in our transport 
                system will be easy, but the Scottish Executive is finally beginning 
                to make its mark. I am confident that, given time, even the scars

              <P><strong>Mrs Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West) (LD): </strong>David 
                Mundell is always good value in the chamber, but I think that 
                I must have slipped into a parallel universe when I hear senior 
                Tory spokespeople such as David Mundell quoting David Begg. David 
                Begg was wrong on several things that he said about transportation 
                in Edinburgh and some of my constituents would be interested to 
                hear that he has now been adopted as the Conservative party's 
                transport guru.</P>
              <P>I will be parochial this morning. Given that the majority of 
                people in Scotland live within 50 miles of Edinburgh, failing 
                to get the strategic view of the Edinburgh transport system right 
                will have a knock-on impact on the rest of Scotland's economy. 
                Over the years, the people of Edinburgh have been frustrated not 
                only by 18 years of Tory Government but by the grand schemes of 
                City of Edinburgh Council and previous councils. David Mundell 
                was dismissive about the Croy park and ride. All I can say is 
                that, after decades of grand schemes in this city, we still do 
                not have a park and ride. Sometimes, a successful transport policy 
                is not about dreaming up grand schemes but about delivering small, 
                medium and large schemes. That is what the Executive is trying 
                to do in developing the proposals that the minister outlined last 
                week. It aims to develop a mix of small, medium and large proposals, 
                in the short term, the medium term and the long term.</P>
              <P>That is the way forward. We must have a strategy for where we 
                are going. What people want from a transport system, in Edinburgh 
                and elsewhere, is capacity and choice. This city is absolutely 
                booming, but it is a victim of its own success in transport terms. 
                We have economic and population growth unlike any other part of 
                the country, but in the past we have not had </P>

              <P>investment. I welcome the fact that in recent months investment 
                has been announced and that the Executive has made a commitment 
                to improve transport in my constituency, with investment in the 
                west Edinburgh bus system, the north and central Edinburgh tramway 
                and now the west Edinburgh light rail tramway. The Executive's 
                priorities include airport links, the redevelopment and increased 
                capacity of Waverley station, which will have an impact for the 
                whole of central Scotland and beyond, and the Borders rail line.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>Does Margaret Smith believe that 
                the tramway outlined in the transport delivery plan is best paid 
                for by congestion charging? If we read between the lines, it is 
                quite clear from the answer that the minister gave after making 
                her statement that the tramway in Edinburgh would be paid for 
                by congestion charging. Does Margaret Smith support congestion 
                charging?</P>
              <P><strong>Mrs Smith: </strong>If Kenny MacAskill is prepared to 
                wait, he will hear me come on to that point.</P>
              <P>It is critical that, as well as meeting the capacity needs of 
                the city and Scotland's transport needs in general, we must give 
                the people of Edinburgh and Scotland choice. Obviously, some of 
                that choice can come only with investment. We have to consider 
                a whole range of ways in which we can invest in Scotland's transport 
                infrastructure to make that happen. I would rather that my constituents 
                were given the opportunity to make legitimate choices about what 
                public transport they use and other transport issues than allow 
                the current situation to continue, where they have no choice but 
                to sit in traffic jams. There are 15,000 people working at Edinburgh 
                Park. They cannot get in and out to their work in the morning 
                because of congestion.</P>
              <P>Unless people see investment on the ground, they will view congestion 
                charging as nothing other than a tax. It has to be seen as something 
                that will actually make a major difference to people's lives. 
                That will happen only if people feel that that money is being 
                properly invested on the ground, giving them opportunities for 
                choice before they are asked to pay congestion charges. That is 
                important in considering how to take forward the consultation 
                with people and what we intend to do with such schemes.</P>
              <P>We had 18 years of the Conservatives. Murdo Fraser talked about 
                their commitment to transport. We had no dualling of the A8000, 
                which is a missing link in Edinburgh's road system. We had no 
                airport link, no integrated public transport system for Edinburgh 
                and no Borders railway. None of those things was delivered in 
                18 years. What kind of commitment to Scottish transport is that?</P>

                needs. I support that, but it is essential to back it up with 
                proper investment to deliver the schemes on the ground to give 
                people the real choice to decide whether to use their cars on 
                roads that are safe or whether to use public transport. We must 
                give them the choice and that needs investment&#151;from the Executive, 
                from the private sector and from local authorities. I also urge 
                the minister to keep a serious watching brief on what is happening 
                with the A8000 and the new Forth bridge authority that is being 
                set up. We need that missing link. It is ridiculous that the Conservatives 
                took 18 years and still did not deliver that link. We must deliver

                transport, and I have read the document from the Executive, which 
                does not want to spend any public money whatever. That merely 
                confirms the view that we on the SNP benches have already formed

                when I use that phrase I mean the country beyond Aberdeen&#151;are 
                absolutely constrained by the congestion in Aberdeen. Businesses 
                in my constituency are actively considering relocation because 
                they cannot reliably go through Aberdeen.</P>

              <P>Businesses are paying huge sums of money because of congestion 
                and unreliability. It costs £50,000 a year for a small company

              <P>Let me say a word or two about flying and about Scotland's role. 
                There is a consultation document on European new skies. Well, 
                well! The list of consultees that the UK Government has chosen 
                for the exercise is very telling. Among the hundreds of bodies 
                that are being consulted, there is only one Scottish company&#151;Loganair. 
                Almost none of the air transport facilities that are provided 
                in Scotland is provided by Scottish air transport companies. That 
                perhaps indicates why I find it difficult to agree with the Scottish 
                Tourist Board, whose website says:</P>
              <P>&quot;Scotland is a small country and travelling around it is 
                quite easy, as is getting here.&quot;</P>
              <P>That experience is alien to the majority of people whom I meet.</P>
              <P>I turn to something that Alex Johnstone said. He referred to 
                18 glorious years of a Tory Government. Well, I have something 
                rather surprising to say to Alex. I met a Tory voter when I was 
                campaigning last year, and he had had some rather upsetting news. 
                He had been to his doctor and heard that he had only four months 
                to live. I said, &quot;Why are you voting Tory? They will not 
                help the health service.&quot; He said, &quot;No, I'm voting Tory 
                for the very first time, because four months under a Tory Government 
                is like 18 years under anybody else.&quot;</P>

              <P>The Tory motion attaches about as much importance to transport 
                and its effect on the economy as did the 18 years of Tory Government 
                about which we have heard so much this morning. It is unacceptable 
                that the Parliament and the Executive should be asked merely to 
                note that transport is an important issue. It is important that 
                the Executive and the Parliament establish a plan that will set 
                in place a framework that will deliver improvements in our transport 
                system&#151;our roads, our rail services and our bus services.</P>

              <P>The Tory record was to commission consultants' reports, hear 
                findings and then do nothing. Bill Aitken is not here to respond, 
                but he mentioned the debate on central Scotland's missing motorway 
                link. In the days of the Tories, that was how we referred to the 
                A80 corridor. In fact, from 1979 through the 1980s and the 1990s 
                until 1997, the Tories promised to make decisions&#151;they promised 
                a decision in the summer, in the autumn, in the spring and even 
                for Christmas&#151;but in all those years, they did nothing. In 
                the months before the general election, they made a number of 
                promises on roads. They promised to build new roads and to finish 
                off missing links. Those were empty promises with no substance 
                and there was no cash to deliver.</P>
              <P>The Tories also claimed to have a rail plan. In the 1990s, their 
                plan for Croy&#151;which has been mentioned&#151;was to close 
                the station. Thankfully, a public outcry stopped that, but services 
                were reduced and the station was hardly used.</P>

                to Edinburgh. I could take only one direct train in the morning 
                and one direct train back in the evening. That service should 
                be contrasted with the current service. Now there is a service 
                every half-hour from Croy station and the journey time is 35 minutes. 
                A number of lonely people used to stand on the platform; now, 
                people struggle to find car parking spaces at Croy station. That 
                shows that, if the Executive and the transport deliverers provide 
                services that people want to use and arrange them to meet the 
                needs of the travelling public, we will get people off our roads 
                and back to using our rail and bus services. I look forward to 
                working with ministers and local authorities to ensure that facilities 
                are there to meet the public's needs.</P>
              <P>Mr Mundell ridiculed the Auchenkilns roundabout proposals. The 
                proposals that the Executive announced last week are exactly what 
                the people of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth have been calling for for 
                many years. We do not want a three-lane motorway through Cumbernauld 
                and Kilsyth. In Cumbernauld, we realise that the section of the 
                A80 that runs through the town plays an important part in the 
                central Scotland transport network, but we do not want a three-lane 
                motorway splitting our town in half. We want proper traffic management 
                solutions to the problems at Auchenkilns and on the A73. The Executive 
                is delivering on that and I look forward to working with it to 
                ensure that we deliver what is best for the people of Cumbernauld 
                and Kilsyth and the rest of Scotland.</P>

              <P>we are extending the debate by about 10 minutes as more members 
                have asked to speak in this debate than in the debate on enterprise, 
                which will follow.</P>
              <P>10:44</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): 
                </strong>I welcome the £1.1 million that the Executive has announced 
                to tackle the problems of congestion in and around Aberdeen and 
                Aberdeenshire. Such money for pre-planning and feasibility studies 
                is welcome. However, the time is rapidly approaching when we will 
                need action to commit the Executive to funding publicly the integrated 
                transport system that we desperately need in the north-east. I 
                was pleased to hear Lewis Macdonald say that we can expect a concrete 
                announcement later this year. A concrete commitment to fund the 
                project is exactly what we need. When the Parliament journeys 
                to Aberdeen in May, I hope that there will be an opportunity for 
                Lewis Macdonald to make an announcement.</P>
              <P>As usual, David Mundell's contribution to the debate was amusing 
                and informative&#151;it was particularly so today. Usually, only 
                the SNP calls for a bottomless pit of public money to be spent, 
                but the Conservatives gave a whole list of transport projects 
                that they would fund. When I intervened and asked David Mundell 
                how those projects would be funded, he confirmed that the money 
                would come out of public funds and I thought that there had been 
                a major Tory policy change. The reply was, &quot;Oh, no.&quot; 
                The implication is that they would remove £100 million from business 
                support or the higher and further education budget. That is complete 
                nonsense.</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>Does Mr Rumbles agree that decisions 
                that relate to supporting the economy are about making hard choices? 
                It is clear that a transport infrastructure is the fundamental 
                requirement of Scotland's economy. Money would be better spent 
                on that than on nice-to-have business projects.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>That we can magic money out of a 
                hat to spend on something is a typical Conservative con. The Conservatives 
                do not want to tell the business community that we do not want 
                to support it.</P>
              <P>My colleague Nora Radcliffe made an important point when she 
                said that we can create a safe, efficient and affordable transport 
                network throughout Scotland. That will not happen overnight&#151;nobody 
                is claiming that it will&#151;but there is a lot to be accomplished.</P>
              <P>Bristow Muldoon successfully pointed out the failures of the 
                previous Tory initiatives, notably the disastrous lack of investment 
                in the railways and their privatisation. I was amused by Murdo

              <P>Fraser's contribution to the debate. He spent a great deal of 
                his speech listing what the Tories did for the roads when they 
                were in power. When he was challenged, he completely failed to

              <P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>The Liberal Democrats are keen on 
                an integrated public transport system for the north-east, including 
                electrification of the railways, and an integrated commuter system 
                from Inverurie in the north to Stonehaven in my constituency in 
                the south. We also want a western bypass around Aberdeen. I hope 
                that Executive ministers will announce a commitment to many of 
                those matters later this year.</P>

                in his final minute.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>The Conservatives should not even 
                have turned up for this debate, let alone lodged a motion. They 
                cannot lecture anybody on transport, given their appalling record 
                in office. They went on a mission to attack public transport throughout 
                Great Britain. The much-heralded revival of the railways has come 
                unstuck as the full folly of John Major's botched privatisation 
                plans has become apparent.</P>
              <P>The Tories claim that no concrete plans have been announced in 
                the transport delivery report. Do they think that rail links to 
                Edinburgh airport and Glasgow airport, a light rail system in 
                Edinburgh, the central Borders rail link&#151;which are all Liberal 
                Democrat manifesto pledges&#151;and road upgradings can be achieved 
                without any feasibility studies or pre-planning? Of course they 
                cannot.</P>
              <P>The SNP's transport policy is, if anything, a bit more laughable.

              <P><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>The 
                debate has been interesting and, at times, amusing. Accusations 
                have been made about the Liberal Democrats' horse and buggy approach, 
                and demented Tories have had accusations thrown at them by the 
                Labour party. We have had a lot of the usual special pleading 
                for parochial interests. Members have spoken about their own pet 
                projects, and rightly so. That is what happens: we represent people 
                where we live and we should do that.</P>
              <P>It is a matter of regret that members have talked about Edinburgh, 
                Glasgow, central Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway, the north-east 
                and Aberdeen, but no one&#151;in particular no one from the Executive 
                parties&#151;has talked about the Highlands. Despite what is stated 
                in the Executive amendment, no specific matters are being addressed 
                in the Highlands and Islands and no one would take an intervention 
                from my colleague, Fergus Ewing, so that that matter could be 
                addressed.</P>
              <P>The transport policy that was inherited from the Tories, quite 
                some time ago, is still in place.</P>
              <P><strong>Maureen Macmillan (Highlands and Islands) (Lab): </strong>Will 
                the member give way?</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>Wait until I have developed my point.</P>
              <P>What has been inherited from the Tories is not only privatisation 
                of the railways, which has led to such disaster, but privatisation 
                of airports and the ports. The purpose of privatisation of the 
                ports was to enable friends of the Tories to make lots of money 
                developing the land, rather than developing the ports. Bus deregulation 
                has also taken place. Predatory pricing policies have been used 
                in the past few months to try to drive out Lothian Buses, as a 
                direct consequence of Tory policies.</P>
              <P>A variety of mechanisms have been used to fund&#151;or, in the 
                long term, not to fund&#151;transport projects. Those mechanisms 
                include private finance initiative and public-private partnership 
                projects and proposals for congestion charging. I have a question 
                for those who favour such mechanisms, especially PFI/PPP. Although 
                that approach guarantees maintenance for the future, </P>

              <P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>If David Mundell wants to answer 
                that question, I will be delighted to hear from him.</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>We have heard little about the 
                SNP's policy and its ideas on funding. What has happened to the 
                SNP's Ikea tax? Some weeks ago, the SNP floated the proposal that 
                funding of new roads in Scotland should be paid for by taxing 
                people who park in out-of-town shopping centres.</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>I am delighted that Mr Mundell did 
                not bother to answer the question that I posed. The SNP has proposals 
                for funding mechanisms. Those are dependent on our public services 
                trust. We will use that mechanism to fund a variety of projects. 
                We are considering a variety of innovative ideas for funding. 
                There is nothing wrong with that.</P>
              <P>I pose a question to those in the chamber: how can we deliver 
                an integrated transport system when, as elected representatives 
                in this Parliament, we can have no influence over a significant 
                part of transport services?</P>

              <P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>I will be happy to hear from Bristow 
                Muldoon why we cannot deliver an integrated transport system when 
                we have no control over the railways.</P>
              <P><strong>Bristow Muldoon: </strong>I would like clarification. 
                Is the SNP's proposal to introduce a shopping tax in shopping 
                centres such as the Almondvale centre in Livingston? Is the SNP 
                aware that that is a town centre shopping centre and not an out-of-town 
                centre?</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>Having enjoyed a visit to Livingston 
                last weekend, I put it to Bristow Muldoon that the current problem 
                is that people who work in and visit hospitals have to pay to 
                park there. We are considering innovative approaches to the issue. 
                We have ruled out workplace parking charges. We are looking to 
                provide an appropriate level playing field for development for 
                all sorts of businesses, not to favour those who happen to be 
                on the periphery.</P>
              <P>We have a significant problem in delivering an integrated transport 
                system because the Strategic Rail Authority and the Labour Government's

              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Contrary to what has been said 
                by one or two Opposition members, a good deal of evidence of the 
                Executive's investment in transport is all around us. There are 
                new trains in Fife and Strathclyde and new park-and-ride sites 
                serve Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Bus quality corridors in 
                all our major towns and cities give preference to bus travel and 
                promote that mode of transport. New ferries for Caledonian MacBrayne 
                serve the Clyde and the Western Isles and a new level of service 
                will come in later this year for the northern isles. There are 
                new terminal buildings at the airports in Inverness, Kirkwall 
                and Stornoway. That emphasises our continuing commitment to Highland 
                as well as lowland Scotland. Improvements have been delivered 
                throughout rural Scotland through the rural transport fund. Considerable 
                investment has been made in cycling, walking and safer streets 
                projects, and in the progression of 94 schemes under the motorway 
                and trunk road programme, including a new bridge over the Forth 
                at Kincardine.</P>
              <P><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>Amidst the list of largesse, can 
                Lewis Macdonald say what investment has been made in any of the 
                arteries that serve the Highlands, in particular the A82, the 
                A9 and the A96? Is not it a fact that those are the roads that 
                new Labour has forgotten?</P>
              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Quite the contrary. If Mr Ewing 
                had read the transport delivery report, which was published last 
                week, he would have noted that the A96 improvements at Fochabers 
                are one of the priorities that we established at an early stage 
                and that we are taking forward under our motorway and trunk road 
                programme. As I said, substantial and record sums are being spent 
                on lifeline services in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.</P>
              <P>Action is being taken by the Executive to help local councils 
                to address the backlog of repairs that are within their budgetary 
                responsibility. Last year, we provided an additional £70 million 
                and only last month a further £20 million was announced to assist 
                councils in meeting those responsibilities.</P>

                vision of how to address the priority transport challenges of

              <P>recognises the central importance of tackling congestion in our 
                major metropolitan areas. Our research forecasts indicate that 
                over the next 20 years there will be an increase in road traffic 
                in Scotland of 27 per cent, the vast majority of which will be 
                concentrated in our major urban areas.</P>
              <P>Above all, we must address the issues that such an increase raises. 
                That is why so many of the priority projects that we have outlined 
                are aimed at tackling urban and interurban congestion by improving 
                and promoting public transport, providing alternatives to the 
                car and seeking&#151;as the transport delivery report makes clear&#151;to 
                stabilise road traffic usage at 2001 levels by 2021.</P>
              <P>Our vision contains substantial, strategic, large-scale projects. 
                However, as many members have indicated, it is not only the big 
                strategic projects that matter. We are investing in many other 
                ways to upgrade our transport infrastructure. We are undertaking 
                a series of improvements on the A77 and A75 and we are talking 
                to local partners about how to target that investment most effectively.</P>
              <P>Only last week, we released a further £2 million to progress 
                the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line, which will promote a public 
                transport alternative for commuters and, by diverting freight, 
                will free up capacity for passenger services on the Forth rail 
                bridge. Next week, the new Forth estuary transport authority will 
                be set up. It will have new powers to address transport issues 
                such as the A8000, which will help to tackle congestion in Edinburgh.</P>
              <P>We recognise the importance of the rail capacity issues that 
                have been raised. That is why the strategic rail study will address 
                those issues&#151;for example, at Falkirk&#151;and why we are 
                pleased to report recent progress in the discussions on the west 
                coast main line.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>The minister considers railways 
                a key priority. Like many other members, I have received a communication 
                from Network Rail regarding its make-up; it has no shareholders 
                and it is accountable to its members, who fall into three categories. 
                Those are the SRA, industry members, who will be represented&#151;</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr Murray Tosh): </strong>The 
                intervention is rather long.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>I have a question. The third component 
                will be public interest members, who will be chosen from a wide 
                range of stakeholder groups. Where is the Parliament's representation? 
                What power will the Executive and the Parliament have over Railtrack's 
                successor?</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I will compensate 
                Mr Macdonald for the time taken up by that intervention, although 
                he should not have taken an intervention in the final minute of 
                his speech.</P>

              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I take that as a plus and a 
                minus, Presiding Officer. Kenny MacAskill knows that we are working 
                in close partnership with the SRA on the infrastructure provider, 
                which is critical to the future of the railway system.</P>
              <P>I am pleased to note the progress that has been made in talks 
                between ScotRail's operators and the train drivers unions. I understand 
                that an announcement has been made and that the threat of strike 
                action in the coming two weeks has been lifted. That is good news.</P>
              <P>I will touch on one or two other matters that members have raised. 
                I confirm that this year, we hope to make progress on the assessment 
                of Aberdeen's traffic flow and to complete the modelling within 
                12 months. I will meet Cathie Craigie to discuss the issues she 
                raised about Croy and Auchenkilns. Her welcome for those projects 
                reminds us of the progress that is being made here and now. We 
                have developed projects and set out a larger vision, for which 
                we invite the support of all members. They should agree with us 
                on the priorities for Scotland's transport system and help us 
                to make progress in achieving them. We welcome such support.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>I 
                congratulate David Mundell on his excellent speech, which laid 
                out clearly our proposals&#151;something that we have been trying 
                to get out of the Government for the past two and a half years. 
                His speech caused obvious confusion among the SNP members, which 
                shows that we hit the button right on. I did not believe what 
                we heard from the SNP members. I timed their speeches&#151;Kenny 
                MacAskill had a seven-minute slot, but six minutes and one second 
                into it, he had made no comment on SNP policy. His rant was entertaining, 
                but it contained absolutely nothing about policy on what is supposed 
                to be one of the SNP's key issues.</P>
              <P>I turn to the speeches of members of the coalition parties. I 
                watched the expression on Wendy Alexander's face when Mike Rumbles, 
                on behalf of the coalition, committed what comes to at least £1 
                billion of spend, when all the parts are added up. To get the 
                euro into the debate, I say for Mr Rumbles's benefit that the 
                £600 million for the electrification of the east coast line would 
                be 1 billion.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>A little later. I must make progress.</P>

              <P>which has been turned into a report. They said nothing about 
                the past five years. Lewis Macdonald began by saying that the 
                Executive has a list of priorities and that it will meet the challenges. 
                We are still waiting to hear those priorities in rank order and 
                the costs that are involved. We are none the wiser on those issues.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Not at the moment.</P>
              <P>Ms Alexander said that the document is a route map. To where 
                is it a route map? It has no destination marked on it. If one 
                has a route map, one knows the destination, one has planned a 
                route and one knows the date, times and commitments that are involved. 
                We are going into initiative after initiative.</P>
              <P>Karen Whitefield attacked David Mundell viciously, which was 
                dreadful. He welcomed the park-and-ride facility at Croy and the 
                roundabout at Auchenkilns, but Karen spent a long time attacking 
                him. I did not understand that.</P>
              <P>To get down to the nitty-gritty, I will list examples of issues 
                on which the deputy minister might have been helpful. He had two 
                opportunities to be helpful, but he made no suggestion for dealing 
                with potholes in rural roads and gave no commitment or notion 
                of a policy on how he will get local authorities to deliver their 
                responsibilities.</P>

                (LD): </strong>On a point of order, Presiding Officer. Are you 
                aware that a member has been throwing things in the chamber?</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I do not know 
                that it is in order to sneak in school. I ask all members to behave 
                a little bit better.<br>
              </P>
              <P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>May I continue deputy headmaster?</P>
              <P>We have had no clarity. Last week, there was an Executive statement 
                on transport. We expect the Executive to lay out its plans in 
                such statements. This morning, there has been a series of rants 
                and raves about what the Conservatives did not do when they were 
                in power. Labour has been in Government for five years; before 
                that, it made a series of commitments about what it would do in 
                power. Those commitments are around eight or nine years old, but 
                there has been no delivery.</P>
              <P>There is no recognition that taxes on road users must go back 
                into the road network. That is vital for business and tourism. 
                Neither of the ministers recognises that the problem in many rural 
                areas is that there is no option other than to depend on the motor 
                car. Brian Adam, who is sadly missing from the chamber, was right

                made no comments about the problems there. One or two of my colleagues 
                listed local issues&#151;</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>Did those include the western bypass 
                for Aberdeen and the electrification of the east coast line?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>One day, Mr Rumbles will catch 
                up with the fact that the Conservative party has said for a long 
                time that there should be a bypass for Aberdeen to suit the needs 
                of Aberdeen and the need for links to Inverness and up the coast 
                to Banff and Buchan. The bypass is in our plans.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>How will you pay for it?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>I should not answer questions from 
                a sedentary position. The bypass was in the list that David Mundell 
                read out.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>No, thank you. The deputy minister 
                said nothing about congestion charges, which were mentioned during 
                last week's statement. We must know how the Executive will fund 
                its proposals and how it intends to implement the charges. New 
                powers have been given to local authorities; I assume that that 
                means that if authorities do not introduce congestion charges, 
                the money will be taken from their block grant.</P>
              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Transport (Scotland) Act 
                2001 clearly gives the power to raise congestion charges to local 
                authorities. We will not issue directions to councils on whether 
                they should use those powers.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>I am not sure why the minister 
                bothered to make that comment. Why did the Executive introduce 
                the power if it has no intention of using it?</P>
              <P>It is vital that members recognise the content of David Mundell's 
                speech as the way forward for the Conservative party's strategy. 
                Our proposals are affordable and our priorities are different 
                from those of the Executive. We know how to use a budget. That 
                does not mean simply adding more money, as the Liberal Democrats 
                would have it.</P>
              <P>It is interesting that the SNP made no proposals on policy or 
                funding. For the first time, the SNP did not mention oil and did 
                not seem to mention independence. The moving of the Conservative 
                motion raised the level of parliamentary debate on transport and 
                provided a good start to the day's business. We will do the same 
                job in the enterprise debate.</P>

                in Scotland. There are two amendments to the motion. I invite 
                those members who wish to speak in the debate to press their request-to-speak 
                buttons now. I call Miss Annabel Goldie to speak to and move the 
                motion. You have 10 minutes, Miss Goldie.</P>
              <P>11:10</P>
              <P><strong>Miss Annabel Goldie (West of Scotland) (Con): </strong>The 
                political process in Scotland has never been more visible, more 
                accessible or more expensive. Never have more consultations, strategies 
                and initiatives in glossy brochures been launched than have been 
                launched by the Scottish Executive in the first 1,000 days of 
                this Parliament. The people of Scotland should be dancing in the 
                streets because of pent-up excitement, but they are not. The business 
                community should be engaged in a corporate fandango of unfettered 
                jubilation, but it is not.</P>
              <P>The general sense of frustration and anger can be easily explained 
                by such public relations nightmares as the new Parliament building 
                and perverse priorities that place issues such as the banning 
                of fox hunting and the smacking by parents of children ahead of 
                creating a health service that treats ill people when they need 
                treatment. There was also the recent embarrassment of MSPs voting 
                on their salary increases. It is small wonder that the public 
                are scunnered.</P>
              <P>What about the business community? It can now engage in the political 
                process with unprecedented ease. There is a Scottish Executive 
                with 20 ministers and an Executive department that is devoted 
                to enterprise that has legions of civil servants. There are 129 
                MSPs. There is an Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee and 
                there is the enterprise network, which is joined at the hip with 
                the Executive. What is the measure of that wide spectrum of political 
                access and what has been happening to the business community since 
                1999?</P>
              <P>Business start-ups have, sadly, shown a decline. In 1999, there 
                were approximately 19,000 new businesses, but with a declining 
                graph. In 2000, there were approximately 17,000 new businesses.

              <P>The 2001 figure is likely to be around 17,000 again. That measurement 
                becomes starker when it is compared with 1977, when Scotland had 
                24,771 business start-ups. At best, we are declining; at worst, 
                in real terms, we are de-enterprising and going backwards.</P>
              <P>On Scottish economic growth, Scotland has had lower growth levels, 
                historically, than the rest of the United Kingdom. However, the 
                Scottish position has weakened even further in recent years. The 
                Fraser of Allander Institute for Research on the Scottish Economy, 
                in its quarterly economic commentary, projected a 7 per cent gross 
                domestic product growth in Scotland for 2001 and a 1.2 per cent 
                figure for 2002. A separate Government study suggested that Scotland 
                has been more dramatically affected than the rest of Britain by 
                the events of 11 September.</P>
              <P>In an article in <I>The Scotsman</I> of 12 February 2002, Douglas 
                McWilliams stated:</P>
              <P>&quot;Slow growth gradually corrodes a nation.&quot;</P>
              <P>He went on to observe that Scotland might end up poorer than 
                Greece.</P>
              <P>Lurking below the surface of this bleak economic scene is more 
                disquieting evidence of the disparity between Scotland and the 
                rest of the UK.</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I agree 
                with Miss Goldie's analysis. However, does she agree that Scotland's 
                slow growth and relative decline is not a function of the Labour 
                period since 1997 but is in fact the history of post-war Scotland, 
                which has declined relative to the rest of the UK throughout that 
                period? Does she also agree that the opening words of her motion 
                are an admission of the failure, throughout the whole post-war

              <P><strong>Miss Goldie: </strong>I do not agree with Mr Wilson, 
                whose views on the economy are a bit like his sartorial style: 
                casual to the point of being random and demonstrably uncoordinated.</P>
              <P>Scotland saw significant losses in jobs and skills in 2001. Nearly 
                8,000 of those job losses were in the electronics sector. We also 
                failed to cash in on 3,700 jobs that were cancelled within that 
                sector. That gloomy chronicle is continuing, with depressing announcements 
                of current job losses. That is not merely demoralising for the 
                workers involved but an alarming expansion of the skills gap. 
                That gap is worsening and employers increasingly despair about 
                that further challenge.</P>
              <P>This is a picture of a country that does not have an enterprise 
                culture, whose Executive displays an inability to understand business, 
                and in which the economy is stagnating. One must conclude that 
                the Executive and the enterprise networks are not delivering for 
                Scotland. For 2002-03, the </P>

              <P>enterprise and lifelong learning department's staff costs budget 
                is more than £10 million for employing 338 people. There will 
                also be ministerial and related costs. The enterprise network 
                budget for 2002-03 is £465 million. One must ask what all those 
                resources and that beaverish activity have been achieving.</P>
              <P>Scottish Enterprise has been on a rationalisation mission, but 
                the minister stated in a letter to me&#151;dated 18 March 2002&#151;that 
                the projected head count for 2002-03 is estimated at 1,517 people. 
                Still under review is how many of those will be permanent employees, 
                fixed-term employees or contracted staff. That lack of specification 
                is surprising.</P>
              <P>Far less easy to understand, however, given what the enterprise 
                networks have been presiding over, is why Scottish Enterprise 
                thinks it necessary to increase the in-house resource for public 
                relations, which in 2000-01 cost £1.62 million. Over the same 
                period, external public relations services cost £1.4 million. 
                If my arithmetic is correct, Scottish Enterprise has recently 
                spent over £3 million on PR. I presume that it was explaining 
                to anyone who was interested why business start-ups have declined, 
                why Scottish economic growth is so much poorer than the rest of 
                the UK, why job losses continue and why skills gaps are intensifying.</P>
              <P>Is it any wonder that the business community does not have faith 
                in the cluttered political scenery or does not believe in the 
                atrophy of the enterprise network bureaucracy?</P>

                has had nearly three years to provide answers.</P>
              <P>That brings us to the kernel of the problem. What has the Executive 
                been providing? The previous debate on transport indicated that 
                there was a complete absence of strategic planning for transport 
                and roads infrastructure, which is one of the most frequently 
                articulated concerns of business. It is more startling that the 
                Executive has seemed impotent as a conduit to Westminster to stop 
                the aggregates tax, which will have a devastating effect on the 
                Scottish rural economy. The Executive also seemed blissfully indifferent 
                to the lurking menace of tax stamps for the whisky industry until 
                my party debated the matter in the chamber.</P>

                rateable value in England. Not just startling but downright alarming 
                was the Local Government Committee report that was released on 
                Wednesday last, which endorsed reinstating the right of local 
                councils to set business rates and held out the prospect of increased

              <P>If the business community, which is being sold a pup, looks at 
                the minister's amendment it will find only pap, which articulates 
                more eloquently than I can precisely what the problem is.</P>
              <P>Does the situation have to be like this? It does not. My party 
                sends some short, sharp messages to the Executive: it should restore 
                uniform business rate; it should abolish IRIS or give it a meaningful 
                purpose in considering the repeal of existing regulation; it should 
                persuade the Chancellor of the Exchequer to abolish the aggregates 
                tax; it should devise a transport strategy whose immediate priority 
                is the improvement of the main arterial routes in Scotland which, 
                in their current condition, delay, obstruct and frustrate business; 
                and it should have a fundamental review of the role and function 
                of the enterprise network, with the sole objective of creating

                In the unhealthily close atmosphere between the Scottish Executive 
                and the enterprise networks, there is an irreconcilable conflict 
                of interest. The enterprise network cannot be a credible co-ordinator 
                between the Scottish Executive and the business community while 
                it is the delivery arm for numerous Scottish Executive strategies 
                and programmes.</P>
              <P>The apparent visibility and ability to access the Scottish political 
                process is, for the business sector, a sterile prospect. Government 
                meddling and interference in the enterprise process does not improve 
                business start-ups, grow gross domestic product or create jobs; 
                neither does distracting the core function of the enterprise network 
                with ancillary activity such as volume training and social engineering. 
                However, a successful enterprise economy will do more for universal 
                opportunity and real social inclusion than any other factor.</P>
              <P>The confidence of the business community has to be re-engaged. 
                That will happen only if the business community is working not 
                only with a Scottish Executive that displays a greater understanding 
                of the flexibility and space that business needs to survive and 
                prosper, but with a lean and demonstrably effective enterprise

                should be focused on infrastructure improvements which benefit 
                all businesses; further notes the damaging effects of the higher 
                business rate poundage in Scotland compared with the rest of the

              <P>In the spirit of spring, I will examine what the SNP&#151;sorry, 
                what the Conservatives are suggesting. I will turn to the SNP 
                soon enough. I was going to invite the Conservatives to view themselves 
                as the official Opposition for the time being, which, of course, 
                the SNP usually claims to be.</P>
              <P>Official Oppositions are expected to come up with programmes 
                for government. What are the three big ideas in the motion today? 
                First, that the enterprise budget should be redirected towards 
                infrastructure improvements. With regard to that suggestion, I 
                ask: what programmes should be cut and by how much? We are open 
                minded and are asking for information.</P>
              <P>The second big idea is that business rates should be cut. Fair-minded 
                people in Scotland know that the total burden of business rates 
                in Scotland has not risen relative to that in England. Interestingly, 
                the Conservatives have not said whether they support the proposals 
                for small business rates relief in Scotland.</P>
              <P>The third big idea is that there should be</P>
              <P>&quot;a fundamental review of the role and functions of the enterprise 
                network&quot;.</P>
              <P>Why on earth would we want that? We have spent the morning talking 
                about the fact that there are too many reviews. Before we embark 
                on that much-vaunted review, we should think about its purpose.</P>
              <P>The motion shows that the Conservatives do not know what they 
                want to cut in the enterprise budget, that they will not say by 
                how much they want to cut business rates and that they will not 
                say what they want to review in the enterprise network or why 
                they want to do it. Perhaps they should try again.</P>
              <P><strong>Miss Goldie: </strong>What I made crystal clear was the 
                fact that the business community cannot be expected to have any 
                confidence in the devolution process or the presence of the Scottish 
                Executive and the enterprise network if the amounts of budgetary 
                allocation that are being devoted to supposedly improving the 
                economy, starting up businesses and expanding our skills are demonstrably 
                achieving very little.</P>
              <P>My point was that, if certain substantive measures were taken, 
                such as restoring a uniform business rate at a cost of around 
                £170 million and paying for that out of the enterprise budget, 
                business would rejoice. Business people could see that, instead 
                of that money disappearing into a bureaucratic hole, it is appearing

              <P><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>I think that we might have smoked 
                a position out of the Conservatives. They are suggesting that 
                we should cut the entirety of business support&#151;which is worth 
                about £100 million&#151;and slice 25 per cent off the budget of 
                Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise. That 
                is a substantive proposal, but I doubt that it will find favour, 
                particularly when the Conservatives will not say whether they 
                are in favour of the small business rates relief scheme that we 
                have introduced. I challenge them to say whether they are in favour 
                of any specific support for small businesses and, if so, on what 
                basis.</P>
              <P>Having established that that is the sole substantive proposition 
                from the Conservatives, we should examine what the Executive is 
                doing. As people know, unlike the Conservatives, we are not looking 
                for a quick fix of inward investment; we are saying that the future 
                economy of Scotland rests on our indigenous science and skills. 
                For that reason, we have brought together enterprise, research 
                and lifelong learning in one department. We have modernised the 
                enterprise networks at home and overseas by the creation of Careers 
                Scotland and Scottish Development International. Furthermore, 
                we have reformed the financial support that we give to companies 
                at home and overseas and have created new venture capital funds. 
                The central part of the policy is to ensure that science spending 
                rises by 15 per cent over the lifetime of the Parliament. To that 
                end, we have introduced the new enterprise fellowships and proof 
                of concept funds.</P>
              <P>I remind the chamber that, only 18 months ago, during the general 
                election campaign, the Conservatives proposed a cut of more than 
                £1 billion in the budget of the Department of Trade and Industry, 
                which would have meant a cut of £120 million in Scotland. That 
                means that the Conservatives are suggesting that there be £200 
                million of cuts added to the £100 million that they planned for 
                in their budget.</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I welcome 
                the additional money that is being invested in research. However, 
                does the minister accept that the percentage of Scotland's GDP 
                that is spent on research and development will still be only about 
                half the UK rate, which itself is only half the European rate? 
                If we are to catch up with our competitors, we should be talking 
                not about raising science spending by 15 per cent but about almost 
                quadrupling the investment in research and development from the 
                public and private sectors.</P>
              <P><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>The figure of 15 per cent relates 
                to public investment in science. Scotland leads Europe in terms 
                of the investment in research and development by higher education 
                institutions. Our difficulty is how we can stimulate research

                out electronic infrastructure through Project Atlas; creating 
                Scottish Development International as the sales force for Scotland 
                in the world; or launching Careers Scotland, which is the first 
                all-age guidance service operating throughout the UK and is aligned 
                to the enterprise network.</P>
              <P>The situation is not perfect, but we have strong leadership and 
                a programme for action. That compares well with the position of 
                the other official Opposition party, the SNP. Does the SNP still 
                want to abolish the local enterprise company system? The only 
                thing that the SNP has had to say with regard to the science and 
                skills agenda is that, somehow, it would help to make the north-east 
                a centre of excellence in oil and gas if we were to close down 
                Grampian's local enterprise company and relocate to central Glasgow 
                the leadership that it provides.</P>
              <P>The SNP's amendment says that we should tackle root causes to 
                allow</P>
              <P>&quot;the optimal policy mix required to place the Scottish economy 
                at the competitive advantage&quot;.</P>
              <P>What does that optimal policy mix mean in relation to monetary 
                discipline? How would interest rates be set in the short and long 
                term? On fiscal policy, does the SNP have any equivalent to the 
                sustainable investment rule or the golden rule? On tax policy, 
                what is to be the level of corporation tax, personal tax or benefits? 
                On public investment, will the SNP drop its opposition to public-private 
                partnerships? The SNP should either clarify its macroeconomic 
                policy in relation to any of those dimensions or tell us about 
                its alternative proposals to the science and skills strategy.</P>
              <P>The science and skills strategy is the right one for Scotland. 
                Sometimes, we should learn from other small nations not simply 
                individual policy propositions, but lessons about their willingness 
                and ability to build a national consensus for growth. That national 
                consensus for growth will be around science and skills, not quick 
                fixes, either those of the past or those proposed for the future.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Despite 
                Tony Blair's complacent spin that the United Kingdom is the fourth-largest 
                economy in the world, with average earnings of just over £20,000, 
                the UK is sliding down the international league table and now 
                occupies the 19<SUP>th</SUP> place&#151;on the brink of relegation 
                from the premier league. The standard of living for citizens of 
                the country is in relative decline compared to that of those of 
                our main economic competitors.</P>
              <P>Independent Ireland, which was once the economic laughing stock 
                of the British ruling classes, has long since overtaken poor old 
                declining Britain. Its citizens earn on average £5,200 more than 
                ours and are reaping the material benefits of healthy economic 
                growth. At the same time, Ireland is able to make much more rapid 
                progress than we are in building quality public services and addressing 
                social justice issues. Redistribution of wealth and investment 
                in public services are much easier to achieve and encounter much 
                less resistance when a concomitant increase in the tax take or 
                expansion in the tax base is possible through natural economic 
                growth.</P>
              <P><strong>Bristow Muldoon (Livingston) (Lab): </strong>Mr Ingram 
                is talking about the taxation system. Will he clarify what his 
                vision of the taxation system in an independent Scotland is? In 
                particular, will he clarify what percentage of GDP the tax take 
                would be? Would it be akin to that in Ireland or that in Finland?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Ingram: </strong>I am just about to expound those 
                matters. If Bristow Muldoon will be patient, he will get his answer.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Michael McMahon (Hamilton North and Bellshill) (Lab): 
                </strong>I will not hold my breath.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Ingram: </strong>Mr McMahon should try it.</P>
              <P>In Scotland, we are faced with a double disadvantage compared 
                to the Irish. Not only are we stuck with the consistent failure 
                of UK economic policy to stimulate high rates of growth, but we 
                are stuck with economic policies to suit the UK's economic engine&#151;London 
                and the south-east of England. We have no powers of our own to 
                lubricate or maintain the Scottish engine.</P>

              <P>The sad fact is that the union is bad for Scotland's economy. 
                The latest figures show little growth at all in the Scottish economy 
                in the past year. But more damning than that is the long-term 
                growth rate, which runs at half the UK's mediocre performance. 
                Scotland's underperformance against the UK can be costed in cash 
                terms as a loss of £1.4 billion from 1995 to 1999.</P>
              <P>The notion that we have an economic union that provides a level 
                playing field for all its constituent nations and regions to thrive 
                is a myth. Even the Scottish Tories acknowledge that in the mention 
                that their motion makes of business rates. The UK's playing field 
                is much more akin to the old Easter Road slope: it is downhill 
                all the way in favour of London and the south-east of England. 
                Down the slope flow people with outstanding talent and skills, 
                profits, capital and corporate decision making, to the huge detriment 
                of the Scottish economy and every household in our land.</P>
              <P>It is high time that we all acknowledged the leeching of our 
                nation's life blood by the UK's capital city. The dice are loaded 
                in London's favour because it is the centre of political power 
                in the UK. It exerts a huge gravitational pull and creates a large, 
                talented labour pool that is drawn from the UK and elsewhere, 
                which in turn creates a large mass of affluent and influential 
                consumers.</P>
              <P><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>Will Mr Ingram give way?</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>No. He is in his 
                last minute.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Ingram: </strong>London's dominance is self-perpetuating. 
                What is more, little can be done about that as long as Scotland 
                is trapped in a unitary state that imposes uniform tax and interest 
                rates across all its constituent parts. Scotland needs to be free 
                to compete and free to generate high levels of growth and prosperity 
                by placing our economy at a competitive advantage.</P>
              <P>We need to place economic growth at the centre of our policy 
                making in Scotland. We have to stop making do with rearranging 
                the deck chairs on a slowly sinking ship and treating the symptoms 
                of economic decline rather than tackling its root cause. We need 
                the ability to put in place a fiscal regime that will create wealth 
                for the nation, resource excellent public services and provide 
                the leeway to address social justice through redistribution. We 
                need to create a vibrant economy that will grow businesses with 
                R and D capability and attract and retain business headquarters 
                in Scotland. We need to be able to define particularly Scottish 
                business tax measures that will create an incentive for growth 
                as general taxation under European Union rules. We cannot do that 
                unless we achieve independence.</P>

                further notes that the efforts of enterprise development agencies 
                and initiatives within the uniform UK economic policy regime have 
                had no apparent effect on our relative economic decline throughout 
                the period and that the gap in performance would appear to have 
                widened more recently; believes that the policy and debate in 
                Scotland has so far been focused on dealing with the symptoms 
                of this relative economic decline rather than its root causes, 
                and calls for a refocusing of the political debate in Scotland 
                on the potential for the acquisition and use of the range of financial 
                and economic powers available to competitor states such as Ireland 
                and Finland and the optimal policy mix required to place the Scottish 
                economy at the competitive advantage required to achieve faster 
                growth, higher living standards and an improved revenue stream

              <P><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) 
                (LD): </strong>The minister has talked about research and development. 
                I point out to members that everything that the Executive has 
                done to increase access to universities&#151;the abolition of 
                tuition fees and the reintroduction of financial assistance&#151;means 
                that a record number of people are going to Scottish universities 
                and applying to go to Scottish universities. Those people will 
                be the seedcorn for the future growth of business and industry 
                in Scotland. That is one concrete move that we have made and it 
                is there for all to see.</P>
              <P>My second point is a good Highland point. The debate has been 
                on the overall Scottish scale and whether to have a union. That 
                does not go down desperately well in the Highlands, particularly 
                with small businesses. There has been talk in the past in the 
                chamber about future legislation that would enable planning authorities 
                to say to a supermarket company, as and when a new supermarket 
                is built, that part of the planning conditions will be to devote 
                a certain percentage of shelf space to local produce. That would 
                go down exceedingly well in our rural areas. I know that there 
                are difficulties with defining local produce, but I recommend 
                that the Executive consider that carefully indeed.</P>
              <P>My most important point concerns what I have in my wallet. That 
                is a 20 note. I show it to the Tories&#151;in fact, I will pass 
                it round and they can have a look at it. A recent survey of industries 
                in Scotland, which was conducted by the Scottish Council for Development 
                and Industry, showed that 30 per cent of Scottish firms wish to 
                join the euro at the first possible opportunity and that 41 per 
                cent would like to join the euro in the lifetime of this Parliament. 
                That is a huge majority in favour of joining the euro.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Stone: </strong>I will in due course.</P>
              <P>I have given the euro note to the Conservatives deliberately, 
                because they must focus on the key issue for Scotland's economy, 
                which is getting into the euro. It was interesting that Miss Goldie, 
                in a speech that was splendid and fragrant as usual, did not comment 
                on that key issue.</P>
              <P>To return to the Highlands, when we speak to farmers and businesses 
                little and large in the Highlands, they say loudly and clearly 
                to George Lyon, to me and to other Highland colleagues, &quot;For 
                goodness sake, get into the euro.&quot; The fluctuation in currency 
                between the rock of the mighty dollar and the hard place of the 
                euro means that the pound seesaws about. For someone running a 
                retail business and trying to buy fruit, for example, from abroad, 
                it is almost impossible to plan what the price will be. They may 
                find that they have been robbed of their profit.</P>
              <P>I tell the Tories to study the 20 note. It is key to Scotland's 
                future. I look forward to hear what the Tories have to say about 
                the euro in their closing speech. Have they distanced themselves

                20 notes?</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>That is not a

              <P><strong>Alex Fergusson (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>Speaking 
                from a rural perspective, I can say unequivocally that the most 
                important parts of the motion are the plea</P>
              <P>&quot;that public funding of enterprise programmes should be 
                focused on infrastructure improvements&quot;</P>
              <P>and the subsequent call</P>
              <P>&quot;for a fundamental review of the role and functions of the 
                enterprise network&quot;.</P>
              <P>Nowadays, infrastructure falls into two categories: the traditional 
                infrastructure of roads, railways and public transport and the 
                new information and communications technology infrastructure of 
                broadband and the information superhighway. To illustrate my point, 
                I would like to examine both those categories as they currently 
                exist&#151;or rather do not exist&#151;in the south-west of Scotland.</P>
              <P>The problems with the A75, which is a recognised trans-European

              <P>The problems with the A77 and A76 are less well publicised but 
                equally pressing. Those three roads represent the main arteries 
                into and out of south-west Scotland. As long there are only tenuous 
                rail links, commuting possibilities are unrealistic. The public 
                transport system is rendered virtually useless by the rurality 
                of the region, and the end result is an area from which people 
                have to move if they cannot find work within it. That explains 
                why Dumfries and Galloway is the only region of Scotland with 
                a declining population, which is surely a graphic enough statistic 
                to explain why something must be done.</P>
              <P>Despite Jim Wallace's reassurances during the 9 January debate 
                on the Executive's priorities that the pathfinder project in the 
                south of Scotland provides the be-all and end-all of information 
                technology provision in rural Scotland, the information superhighway 
                remains a dream for most individuals, businesses and employers 
                in the south of Scotland. Why else would both the chief executive 
                of Dumfries and Galloway Council and the chief executive of the 
                local enterprise company agree that, unless something is urgently 
                done to bring broadband technology to their region, it will continue 
                to have to play catch-up with the central belt when it comes to 
                attracting jobs into the area.</P>
              <P><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD): </strong>How much 
                of the budget does Alex Fergusson propose to spend on upgrading 
                the roads in the south of Scotland and on providing the information 
                superhighway?</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Fergusson: </strong>If George Lyon had been present

              <P>The equation is quite simple, as people will follow good roads, 
                and jobs will follow people. It does not matter whether those 
                good roads are the traditional vehicular highways or the new technological 
                superhighways; the result is the same. Of course, the Executive 
                understands all that; why else would it include among its principal 
                aims in the glossy document &quot;Rural Scotland: A New Approach&quot; 
                the aim to</P>

                Getting on need not mean going away&quot;?</P>

              <P>one young graduate who gave evidence to the Rural Development 
                Committee last week said that he could find work up in Ayrshire 
                but not the public transport to get there.</P>
              <P>For the community, expansion and business development are almost 
                things of the past, as West of Scotland Water claims that its 
                services can take no more strain and that therefore it cannot 
                condone further developments. That is not a pretty picture.</P>
              <P>If we superimpose the effect of the Executive's legislative impositions 
                on rural Scotland, the picture becomes even less pretty. Never 
                mind the rights and wrongs of a ban on hunting; no matter the 
                muddled thinking behind the land reform proposals; no matter the 
                continued inability of the Executive to support and foster the 
                primary products of our different regions&#151;the result of the 
                eventual legislation will be further deterioration in the jobs 
                and economic prospects of rural Scotland.</P>
              <P>The Executive's answer to that mess is limply to condone the 
                introduction of the aggregates tax on 1 April&#151;what a suitable 
                date! The Confederation of British Industry says that that tax 
                is causing chaos and confusion throughout the country. Chaos, 
                confusion and muddled thinking sums up the efforts of the Executive 
                on rural enterprise. The time to refocus on what are very real 
                problems is long overdue. I totally support the motion.</P>

              <P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Lab): 
                </strong>There is an end-of-term feel to the debate. One wonders 
                whether it is spring when one sees the first moleskin suit, and 
                Andrew Wilson, in whom Simon Templar somehow displaces Harry Potter. 
                However, we come back to earth with a dunt when we hear David 
                Davidson promising that the Tories are going to do the same job 
                on enterprise. Thankfully, he has removed himself from the chamber. 
                When people in my constituency hear that the Tories are going 
                to do the same job on enterprise, they remember the Tory record: 
                the lost businesses and homes and the destroyed hopes. That is 
                one reason why the Tory party, although it may come back in many 
                parts of the country, will remain fifth out of five in Strathkelvin 
                and Bearsden.</P>
              <P>The debate has been unfortunate. Annabel Goldie usually makes 
                spirited contributions to our proceedings, but her speech today 
                was surprisingly lacklustre. I suspect that that was because she 
                did not really believe half what she was saying but felt obliged 
                to have an end-of-term knockabout on the performance of the enterprise 
                network. However, she did not advance much on that front.</P>

              <P>Annabel Goldie touched on one point about which I share some 
                concern. The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning will 
                be aware of my interest in the activities of the Executive's IRIS 
                unit and of my various parliamentary questions. I entirely accept 
                that much of the regulatory burden on businesses arises as the 
                result of European or UK legislation, but I am surprised by the 
                lack of resource that was disclosed in answer to my questions, 
                and in particular by the grades of staff employed in that unit. 
                I urge the minister to consider seriously how we can get the work 
                of those with experience of business impact aligned with the work 
                of the unit so that we may make more progress on that front.</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>If Mr Fitzpatrick could resist 
                sartorial allegations, I would be grateful.</P>
              <P>In the interest of the debate, can the member tell us whether 
                the aim of the Executive's economic policy is to close the wealth 
                gap with the rest of the United Kingdom or just to mitigate our 
                continuing relative decline?</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: </strong>It would take me slightly 
                over my time to give Andrew Wilson sartorial advice, so I will 
                desist from that.</P>
              <P>Andrew Wilson makes a point that was wholly absent from Annabel 
                Goldie's speech. She gave the game away when she spoke about the 
                fundamental review of the enterprise network. She made no mention 
                of social justice ambitions for the network or for employment, 
                nor of widening access to higher education, skills and jobs.</P>
              <P><strong>Miss Goldie: </strong>The point about business expansion 
                is that, if we are to have an enterprise network that operates 
                according to what its name suggests, we have to let it focus on 
                the enterprise economy of the country. I specifically said that 
                we will do more if we succeed in that. The phrase that I used 
                was:</P>
              <P>&quot;for universal opportunity and real social inclusion&quot;.</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: </strong>I am obliged. That contribution 
                takes us back to the essential divide between the far right in 
                the Parliament and the bulk of members of the Parliament, who 
                do not view social justice ambitions as the distaff side of an 
                enterprise economy. After 18 years of these people&#151;the Tories&#151;we 
                realise that putting 3 million people, with their skills, talents 
                and ambitions, on to the scrap heap is not the way to run an economy.</P>
              <P>We have had a hard job returning from the mess that has been 
                left by the Tories. We have built in economic stability and the 
                conditions for growth. There is nothing in the Conservative motion 
                that encourages us to support it, so we should not vote for it 
                today.</P>

              <P><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I feel as 
                though I am intervening in a family feud between two right-wing 
                unionist parties. I could hardly split the difference between 
                them in the eye of a needle.</P>
              <P>I want to make three points in the four minutes that are available. 
                The first is that, irrespective of what the Parliament does at 
                a microeconomic level, if that is not in tune with the macroeconomic 
                policy that is decided in London, it will not have the desired 
                effect in Scotland. I will give some examples of that, starting 
                with taxation policy. No independent Scottish Government with 
                power over fiscal policy would in its right mind have the current 
                fuel tax regime. No Government whose priority interest lay in 
                Scotland would tax its own national drink at the rate of 50 per 
                cent. Would the French tax wine at 50 per cent? No way. That is 
                another example of Scotland trying to promote an industry that 
                is being taxed to the hilt by the chancellor in London.</P>
              <P>I will give members another example. One of the biggest economic 
                problems that we face in Scotland is depopulation. According to 
                one forecast, by 2065 Scotland's population will be down from 
                more than 5 million to 3.8 million, which has major economic implications. 
                We need to do two things. First, we need to keep many more of 
                our young, talented people in Scotland&#151;to encourage them 
                to stay to build a career here. Secondly, we need to have a positive 
                immigration policy&#151;not one that chases people away, sometimes 
                because of the colour of their skin, but one that welcomes all 
                creeds and types to Scotland if they have something to contribute 
                to economic revival. An independent Scotland would have an entirely 
                different immigration policy from that of the UK.</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>No. Brian Fitzpatrick should sit 
                down.</P>
              <P>Another issue is interest rates and their effect on exchange 
                rates. No independent Scottish Government would pursue the interest 
                rate and exchange rate policy&#151;the lunacy&#151;that is being 
                pursued by Gordon Brown. Until we get control of macroeconomic 
                policy&#151;</P>
              <P><strong>Ben Wallace (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>Will 
                the member give way?</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>Ben Wallace should sit down.</P>
              <P>Until we get control of macroeconomic policy, all the strategies&#151;all 
                the enterprise networks and the money that is spent on them&#151;will 
                not work. They will not work unless they are part and parcel of 
                a real national strategy for Scotland.</P>

              <P>comments on research and development, although factually accurate, 
                betrayed complacency. The fact is that one company, Nokia, spends 
                more on research and development than the whole of Scotland spends. 
                Until we lift our eyes&#151;until we get into the same league 
                as the Nokias, the Finlands and Irelands of this world&#151;we 
                will be kidding ourselves about our ability to close the growth 
                rate gap. The venture capital fund is a great idea, and I welcome 
                the £20 million over three years that has been allocated, but 
                that is peanuts compared to what is required.</P>
              <P>My final point relates to the enterprise network. Let us never 
                forget that it was the Tories who destroyed the Scottish Development 
                Agency and created Scottish Enterprise. I agree with much that 
                Annabel Goldie said about the balkanisation of the enterprise 
                network in Scotland. The figure of £100 million for business support 
                has been cited, but how much of that ends up with businesses and 
                how much ends up in the pockets of consultants? That issue needs 
                to be addressed, but we will not be able to address such issues 
                until we have full power. I declare an interest as someone who 
                used to do consultancy work for Scottish Enterprise.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Keith Harding (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>As 
                a Scottish Conservative, I am proud to be part of the only party 
                in Scotland that understands and trusts business. We realise that 
                it is individuals and businesses, not politicians, who create 
                a successful economy and a prosperous society.</P>
              <P>I contrast our approach with the behaviour of the Local Government 
                Committee, which has exposed the long-term plans of the three 
                left-of-centre parties to change business rates. Committee members 
                from those parties all wanted to allow councils to determine and 
                collect business rates, which would hit business and directly 
                stunt investment growth as the inevitable increase in rates removed 
                the current level playing field.</P>
              <P>I was the one voice of dissent on the committee, ensuring that 
                the business community's well-publicised opposition to the proposal 
                was heard. That opposition was completely ignored, as the committee 
                caved in to its chums in the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.</P>

              <P><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>Does Keith Harding not recall 
                that for the first 11 years of the previous Conservative Government 
                local authorities were allowed to set business rates? Does he 
                not also recall that only in 1995&#151;year 16 of 18 years of 
                Tory rule&#151;did the discrimination of higher business rates 
                on Scottish businesses come to an end? Is that not totally inconsistent 
                with the Tory motion that we are debating today?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Harding: </strong>Of course it is not totally inconsistent 
                with the motion. We introduced the uniform business rate and we 
                want it to be maintained.</P>
              <P>Without business wealth creation there would be no public spending, 
                so easing the burden of tax and regulation on Scotland's firms 
                is paramount for the future of the whole of Scotland. Scots firms 
                already pay 9 per cent more than their English counterparts. That 
                makes it more economical for a company to invest south of the

              <P>The fault lies with the Labour party, which abolished the uniform

                businesses is no help, as it is a typical bureaucrat's reaction 
                to a problem. It is extremely unfair on medium-to-large businesses 
                and sends out entirely the wrong message to firms that are considering 
                locating in Scotland. It also discourages expansion in our indigenous 
                firms.</P>
              <P>The Scottish Conservatives recognise the problem and have the 
                solution. Our plan is to bring down the rate poundage for the 
                current year from 47p in the pound to the English level of 43p. 
                The resulting £176 million loss in revenue would easily be funded 
                by a reduction in spending on the enterprise networks.</P>
              <P>It is time for the other parties to join the Conservatives in 
                listening to and understanding business needs. The proposal of 
                the Local Government Committee has met with outright rejection 
                from the business community. Unfortunately, the Conservatives 
                are the only party that has so far rejected the recommendation. 
                It is time that Parliament as a whole woke up to that and accepted 
                our proposals to cut tax and greatly boost business in Scotland. 
                I support the motion.</P>

              <P>I would like to focus on the significant role that is played 
                by the enterprise network in the development of the Scottish economy. 
                The Conservative motion is short-sighted, to say the least, in 
                its understanding of the role played by the development agencies. 
                It fails to grasp the importance of the enterprise network in 
                encouraging new ventures, fostering enterprise and providing strategic 
                oversight for the way ahead.</P>
              <P>Encouraging growth and innovation throughout our economy is dependent 
                on a large number of factors. Quite rightly, developing modern 
                infrastructure is a key pillar of that. However, there is a great 
                need to provide targeted support and assistance to business and 
                entrepreneurs, allowing ideas to be turned into employment. The 
                small business gateway is providing a one-stop shop for a wide 
                array of quality advice and services for new businesses throughout

              <P>foundations. Only last week, Scotchem&#151;a pharmaceuticals 
                supply company based in Kirkcaldy&#151;celebrated achieving significant 
                growth in its first year. The company has cited the essential 
                role that market research, advice and business planning from Fife 
                small business gateway&#151;which is a partnership between the 
                enterprise network and Fife Council&#151;played in its success. 
                That is just one example of a growing band of start-ups in Fife.</P>
              <P>The underlying theme of the Executive's approach to the enterprise 
                network, expressed in &quot;A Smart, Successful Scotland&quot; 
                is enabling ideas and innovations to get out into the marketplace.</P>
              <P>Bridging the gap between innovation, enterprise and capital investment 
                is the essential role that the enterprise network plays. Scottish 
                Enterprise's proof of concept fund is a pioneering example of 
                how that philosophy is being put into practice. The fund of more 
                than £30 million is targeted at assisting commercialisation, particularly 
                in science and technology.</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>I want to be on record as saying 
                that all that is terrific and the Executive is to be lauded for 
                it. However, will the outcome of it be a closing of the wealth 
                gap with the rest of the United Kingdom or just mitigation of 
                our continuing relative decline?</P>
              <P><strong>Marilyn Livingstone: </strong>I shall continue. I hear 
                what Andrew Wilson is saying, but I genuinely believe that improvements 
                need to be made and I will come on to that in the rest of my speech.</P>
              <P>One reason why I mentioned the proof of concept fund is that 
                Alex Neil spoke about the need to commercialise and fund research. 
                We have to consider not just funding but how we develop that research, 
                roll it out into the economy and create new opportunities.</P>
              <P>Work is continuing to improve the enterprise networks, as all 
                the major stakeholders are aware. Scottish Enterprise addressed 
                many issues in January in its strategy for business start-ups. 
                I have concerns about the business transformation programme that 
                is under way. I urge the minister to ensure that in taking on 
                national strategic issues, we ensure that local flexibility is 
                considered. I believe that our success has lain in local imagination 
                and innovation. I ask the minister to ensure that the correct 
                balance is achieved.</P>
              <P>The microeconomic foundations for delivering growth and job creation 
                are in place and what is needed is considered innovative thinking, 
                not right-wing economic dogma. That will build on our foundations 
                and realise fully the vision of a smart, successful Scotland.</P>
              <P>We believe that a strong vibrant economy can generate growth 
                and promote social well-being, </P>

              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I ask that the 
                next two speeches be of three minutes, to allow everybody in.</P>
              <P>12:03</P>
              <P><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con): </strong>I will comment on the 
                situation in Ayrshire and endorse my colleagues' comments on the 
                mishandling of the economy.</P>
              <P>The reality in Ayrshire is that we feel under threat. We have 
                lost more than 1,000 jobs in the past few months in the Prestwick 
                area alone, with many others going in the surrounding areas. Our 
                quarries are under threat from the unfair aggregates tax and the 
                Auchincruive campus is under threat of closure. In short, although 
                spring is coming&#151;as the minister has said&#151;and everyone 
                wants to be optimistic, we must be realistic.</P>
              <P>Yesterday, BT announced the closure of its Ayr call centre and 
                the transfer of around 100 jobs to Glasgow. Earlier in the month, 
                Compaq announced the transfer of 600 jobs from Ayr to its Erskine 
                plant.</P>
              <P>The reality in rural Ayrshire is dreadful too. Ayrshire did not 
                have foot-and-mouth disease, but the farmers whose animals did 
                not have foot-and-mouth are worse off than those whose animals 
                did.</P>
              <P>Tourism has had a dreadful time too, although I welcome the initiative 
                taken to develop the Burns festival. That must be a success and 
                a building block for our tourism industry, which has been so badly 
                represented throughout Scotland in the past.</P>
              <P>Quite simply, the Scottish Executive must do better. A growth 
                rate of 0.8 per cent, while the UK economy grew at 2.6 per cent, 
                is simply not good enough. The Scottish Executive has to realise 
                that people and businesses create jobs. Glossy brochures and fanfare 
                launches do not in themselves make a difference. What makes a 
                difference is the creation of the right climate for businesses 
                to start and grow. Sadly, that climate does not exist in Scotland 
                at the moment.</P>
              <P>It is not easy&#151;I know, because I have tried&#151;to start 
                businesses or maintain new or existing ones. Why would somebody 
                choose Scotland as a place in which to start up businesses, given 
                our high business rates, our excessive red tape, our bureaucracy 
                and our inadequately funded and functioning enterprise network?</P>

              <P>The Conservatives would do more to encourage new and existing 
                businesses. We would reintroduce a uniform business rate and seek 
                to abolish the aggregates tax. We would deliver a genuine less-is-more 
                environment with less bureaucracy, regulation and tax and more 
                targeted encouragement. By doing less, better, we would achieve 
                more.</P>

              <P><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I 
                will keep to my three minutes, Presiding Officer.</P>
              <P>Wendy Alexander referred to quick fixes and Marilyn Livingstone 
                applauded the enterprise system, but the experience in the Scottish 
                Borders has given no cause for that satisfaction.</P>
              <P>It was announced proudly in 1999 that the call centre at Claridge 
                Mills in Selkirk would provide 250 jobs, at least 60 of which 
                would be in place by October 1999. The last figure that I have 
                shows that there were 28 jobs in January, eight of which were 
                in management. I tried to confirm the exact figures this morning, 
                but the company is not answering my phone calls&#151;I wonder 
                why. The cost so far to the public purse of that little enterprise 
                has been £680,000 and regional selective assistance is in the 
                pipeline.</P>
              <P>However, when ordinary people in the Borders try to access enterprise 
                funds they find it extremely difficult. I refer to Thompson and 
                Son Bakers in Hawick. The owner used his own money to renovate 
                an old building and turn it into a bakery, which cost him £56,500. 
                He asked for help from Scottish Enterprise Borders and got £1,500. 
                He has six jobs and another six in the pipeline.</P>
              <P>John Mackay of Eyemouth took over the old Co-op, which overlooks 
                Eyemouth harbour, and redeveloped it into a splendid restaurant, 
                which opened three weeks ago. The business employs 20 people and 
                he is looking to develop it. He got nothing from Scottish Enterprise 
                Borders.</P>
              <P>Another lady in Peebles, who wants only £2,000 to start up a 
                business, got an offer of £500 from Scottish Enterprise Borders 
                for information technology. However, Manpower can get £670,000 
                for providing 28 jobs to date. That is the problem with the system 
                on the ground.</P>
              <P>The other problem with the system is the infrastructure in rural 
                areas, to which Alex Fergusson referred. The Ettrick riverside 
                business centre has just opened in Selkirk. Its aim is to provide 
                a complete business facility for Borders </P>

              <P>people. The problem with that centre is that it does not have 
                broadband. Another problem is the road network to the Borders. 
                The A1 is not complete; the A68 has just a couple of crawler lanes; 
                and the A7 and A702 are definitely scenic routes. I will not even 
                mention the railways. With infrastructure like that, who will 
                locate in the Borders?</P>
              <P>How on earth can the Borders get on? How can enterprise develop 
                in that community with that kind of system in place? Lots of guff 
                gets spoken in here. Ordinary people cannot set up businesses 
                in the Borders, because they cannot access the funds that the 
                large companies can access.</P>

              <P><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD): </strong>The debate 
                has an end-of-term feel to it. The prize for the best put-down 
                must go to the Presiding Officer, for his remark to Jamie Stone.</P>
              <P>The Executive has taken a range of actions to improve the competitive 
                position of Scottish industry, as we have heard from the minister 
                and other members. The introduction of the small business rates 
                relief scheme will benefit an estimated 70 per cent of Scotland's 
                businesses. That figure will be even higher in rural areas, where 
                small businesses make up and dominate the business scene. The 
                new scheme will be of benefit to large numbers of small businesses 
                in my constituency.</P>
              <P>The Executive has also taken action to improve Scotland's skills 
                base and tackle the shortage of skills. The minister alluded to 
                the comprehensive review of the careers service, followed by its 
                rationalisation to ensure lifelong career advice, which is a significant 
                step forward. The actions that have been taken include: the scrapping 
                of tuition fees; the commitment to funding 2,800 additional higher 
                education places; the commitment to funding 40,000 places in further 
                education colleges; and the establishment of learndirect Scotland 
                to give everyone in Scotland one-stop access to post-school training, 
                skills and education.</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>Will the member tell the chamber 
                whether none of that would have happened without the Liberal Democrats?</P>
              <P><strong>George Lyon: </strong>I can assure the member that none 
                of that would have happened without the Liberal Democrats. It 
                certainly happened without him.</P>
              <P>Together, those initiatives should improve our skills base and 
                ensure that we improve our competitive position. However, there 
                is no doubt that the worldwide recession appears to be hitting 
                Scotland's economy harder than the economy in the rest of the 
                UK. The recently published GDP </P>

              <P>figures bear that out.</P>
              <P>Scotland's heavy reliance on big inward investment, especially 
                in the electronics industry, has left us vulnerable in times of 
                recession. When companies such as Motorola are hit by recession 
                and losses, it is all too easy for them to pull the plug on plants 
                in Scotland. The minister has acknowledged that, although the 
                strategy of attracting big inward investment projects into Scotland 
                has been successful, it brings with it the dangers of leaving 
                Scotland exposed to forces that are outwith our control.</P>
              <P>The minister's decision to refocus the Executive's enterprise 
                strategy towards investing in and growing indigenous businesses 
                is therefore welcome. It is interesting to note that Ireland, 
                which successfully pursued a similar policy to Scotland for the 
                past 20 years, has also refocused its enterprise policy towards 
                growing indigenous Irish businesses.</P>
              <P>The SNP's amendment highlights the muddle and confusion that 
                lies at the heart of SNP policy. We heard that in the speeches 
                by SNP members. Their newly rediscovered policy of independence 
                has no clarity. In the same breath, they mention Ireland and Finland 
                as models that they wish Scotland to emulate. One is a high-tax, 
                highly regulated economy; the other is a low-tax, deregulated 
                economy.</P>
              <P>The question for SNP members is which model do they want Scotland 
                to follow? Is it the Finnish model or the Irish model? I hope 
                that Andrew Wilson, who seems to favour the Irish model, will 
                tell us in his wind-up speech. Which model would the SNP follow? 
                There are great implications for whichever model it chooses.</P>
              <P>As for the Tories, Annabel Goldie's proposal to slash the enterprise 
                budget by over £100 million to fund business taxes would go down 
                like a lead balloon in my constituency and throughout the Highlands 
                and Islands. A 25 per cent cut in the HIE budget would spell disaster 
                for economic regeneration throughout the Highlands and Islands.</P>

                cut and deeply hurt by Annabel Goldie's opening comments. It is 
                one of the great ironies and inequities of modern politics that 
                young gentlemen have to accept slings and arrows from ladies on 
                their sartorial elegance, but making such remarks vice versa is 
                impossible. I open by commenting that Miss Goldie's purple dotted 
                cravat is lovely.</P>
              <P>The debate is important to Scotland's future success. The Parliament

              <P>must get their act together and acknowledge the realities of 
                Scotland's performance, which is utterly mediocre. It gives me 
                no pleasure to say that, but the simple truth is that our growth 
                performance is unacceptable. Our amendment seeks to bring to the 
                debate a call for all parties to acknowledge that fact and to 
                have an open-minded look at how we can equip ourselves with the 
                powers to have the policy mix that George Lyon pointed to.</P>
              <P>I welcome George Lyon's question. I would love to have the debate 
                about Scotland's national target. Do we follow the Scandinavian 
                model or the Irish model?</P>
              <P><strong>George Lyon: </strong>You tell us.</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>If the member would apply his 
                ears more than his mouth, he might learn.</P>
              <P>The Conservatives might seek a low-tax deregulated economy. The 
                Labour party might seek to follow that route and the Liberal Democrats 
                might follow another. The point of the SNP amendment is that that 
                debate cannot begin in Scotland, because we have a model imposed 
                upon us from outwith.</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Neil:</strong> On a point of order, Presiding Officer.</P>
              <P>Throughout the debate, Jamie Stone has moved around the chamber, 
                talking over the member who is speaking. If he wants to act like 
                the licensed clown, let him, but surely he should give respect 
                to all the speakers in the debate.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I had not heard 
                Mr Stone. That is something that you should leave for me to worry 
                about, Mr Neil.</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>With all due respect, we cannot hear 
                what is being said.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I can hear Mr 
                Wilson very clearly.</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>I cannot.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I would be grateful 
                if Andrew Wilson would continue.</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>I am grateful, Presiding Officer.</P>
              <P>My point was that I want Scottish political debate to focus on 
                such serious questions. I have my own ideas and we all bring our 
                own ideas to the debate. However, this morning the focus has been 
                on two parties that say that they are better placed to manage 
                Scotland's relative decline. My comment to the Conservatives is 
                that yes, the Labour party's performance on Scotland's economy 
                in the past few years has been utterly mediocre. I do not even 
                think that that is a function of Labour party policy; it is the 
                context in which it finds itself. The Conservative's policy approach 
                would produce no real difference. The post-war </P>

              <P>experience in Scotland has been of managed relative decline. 
                It is a long-term problem, which is not due to the worldwide recession 
                but arises from our being part of an economic union without being 
                able to place ourselves at a competitive advantage to the rest 
                of the United Kingdom.</P>
              <P><strong>George Lyon: </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>I have had three offers and three 
                declines. I will move on.</P>
              <P><strong>George Lyon </strong><I>rose&#151;</I></P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> The member is 
                not giving way.</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>The Executive and the other parties 
                have to answer a simple point. I support the Executive team on 
                many of the programmes that it brings to the table, but what will 
                it do to close the wealth gap that has been identified between 
                Scotland and the rest of the UK and Europe? Is the issue one of 
                overtaking our competitors or mitigating our relative decline? 
                The simple truth is that, at present, disposable wealth in the 
                rest of the UK is growing three times faster than in Scotland. 
                In the past six years, the growth in disposable wealth in the 
                south-east has been 24 per cent, but in Scotland growth has been 
                9 per cent. If we had grown at the same rate, we would have £8.4 
                billion more in the Scottish economy. That is the gap that we 
                have to close.</P>
              <P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Given all the interruptions that 
                I have had, I need to move on.</P>
              <P>This is a long-term problem. Labour's approach to politics has 
                been to nursemaid Scotland's political, economic and social symptoms 
                since the war. Everyone loves a nurse, so Labour has been popular, 
                but that approach has not changed the underlying causes of our 
                relative decline. Politics needs to grow up and move on. We need 
                to have a debate on the economy that is more mature in tone than 
                the stupid, narrow sniping that we have had over the past few 
                years. I hope that Wendy Alexander will address that issue in 
                her summation and show some leadership to her party, which she 
                can do.</P>
              <P>My simple point is that we would trust the Executive ministers 
                with the full powers of independence at their disposal. It is 
                ironic that in Scotland we have the only finance minister on earth 
                who does not trust himself with the nation's finances, and we 
                have the only economics minister on earth who does not trust herself 
                with the nation's economic powers. We would. Let us get moving, 
                tackle the mediocrity and have a proper and mature debate.</P>

              <P><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>I thank colleagues for their contributions 
                to the debate. There were a number of suggestions on how we might 
                improve the enterprise network. In particular, Alex Fergusson 
                referred to the need to strengthen our capability to support rural 
                Scotland. Annabel Goldie and Brian Fitzpatrick talked about the 
                IRIS unit and how more expertise has been brought to bear. Alex 
                Neil made the point that Scotland is an attractive place to live 
                and work, and said that the talent strategy in Scottish Enterprise 
                needs to be expanded. Christine Grahame eloquently made the case 
                for why we should support indigenous businesses more by reconfiguring 
                regional selective assistance in the future.</P>
              <P>I turn to some of the bigger issues. The Conservatives made a 
                charge about the atrophy of Scottish Enterprise's bureaucracy. 
                An organisation that is seeing its head count go from 1,900 last 
                year to 1,500 next year&#151;a cut of 400&#151;could hardly be 
                accused of atrophying. The cost of public relations external services 
                is also falling by a quarter in the current year, so there is 
                movement on some issues.</P>
              <P>I am still unclear about whether the SNP's position is that it 
                wishes to abolish the LEC network. I am also unclear about whether 
                the Tories support a small business rates relief scheme. That 
                takes us to the central policy choice that is before us. The Tories' 
                solution is to cut a further £180 million, in addition to the 
                £100 million that they wished to cut from the budget last year. 
                The Conservatives should use the Easter holidays to think about 
                the wisdom of proposing cuts of £280 million. Such cuts would 
                end investment in science and replace it with an indiscriminate 
                cut in business rates that would benefit big business&#151;because 
                the Conservatives do not support a scheme for small businesses&#151;and 
                inward investors. A £280 million cut, resulting in the ending 
                of the investment in science that we seek to achieve, is antithetical 
                to a science and skills strategy.</P>
              <P>Andrew Wilson said that he wanted to have a macroeconomic policy. 
                Let us be clear. Scotland has a choice of macroeconomic policies. 
                It can choose the policy under the current constitutional arrangement, 
                which I will not go over, because people know it. Jim Mather and 
                Alex Neil appear to favour that macroeconomic policy, which places 
                us outwith the European single currency area. John Swinney's macroeconomic 
                policy is that we should not favour cuts in corporation tax, but 
                Andrew Wilson is willing to do that. I will go to the heart of 
                what the SNP said. One option is not considering Scotland relative 
                to England. The choice is to do what it takes to get Scotland 
                growing again. That is at the heart of our difficulty </P>

              <P>with the SNP. Its constitutional solution requires us to break 
                up Britain before we can pursue any of its policy prescriptions, 
                on which the SNP has as wide a range of views as it has members.</P>
              <P><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>As a director of Scotland in 
                Europe, Jim Mather can hardly be against the euro. I am not for 
                the break-up of anything. I want to empower the Scottish Executive. 
                The minister referred to the research and development money that 
                might be provided in the next UK budget. What will that do to 
                improve Scotland's position relative to its competitors in the 
                rest of the UK and to close the gap?</P>
              <P><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>That is the central con of the 
                SNP's policy. I ask the SNP to show me any sovereign state in 
                Europe in which different areas have different corporation tax 
                rates. The only way to say that the rate should be 18p, 20p or 
                35p in Scotland is to break up Britain first. That is the dishonesty 
                of the policy that the SNP peddles.</P>
              <P>A wider issue that links the SNP and the Tories is the suggestion 
                that our economic salvation lies in competitive undercutting on 
                tax. If members look around the Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
                and Development, they will see that the total tax take in Japan&#151;the 
                &quot;economic basket case&quot; of the OECD&#151;is 30 per cent, 
                whereas the level in Scandinavian countries is higher than 50 
                per cent. Therefore, the idea that, uniquely, our economic salvation 
                lies in competitive undercutting of one or another element of 
                the tax burden is not borne out by the evidence.</P>
              <P>The evidence is that investing in science and skills is the answer 
                to boosting Scottish performance. That means the first-ever science 
                strategy, links between the University of Edinburgh and Stanford 
                University, the Alba Centre as a focus of research in microelectronics, 
                enterprise fellowships, technology institutes and five times as 
                many modern apprenticeships as before.</P>
              <P><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>Will 
                the minister give way?</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>No. The minister 
                is closing.</P>
              <P><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>The answer involves creating careers 
                Scotland, an adult literacy scheme and a Scottish university for 
                industry. Scotland's economic salvation lies in the consistent 
                pursuit of that strategy, around which we want to build a consensus 
                that stretches beyond the coalition parties, out across Scotland 
                and to other parties.</P>
              <P>Scotland's salvation does not involve super profits through corporation 
                tax cuts for inward investors or bigger business rates bribes 
                for big business. It involves a balanced taxation policy and a 
                strategy for growth. The Executive is pursuing that approach. 
                We invite support for it.</P>

              <P><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>One 
                disappointing element of the debate is that it was undersubscribed. 
                That is unfortunate, because we spend too much time debating how 
                we spend Scotland's wealth, rather than how we will create it. 
                A morning devoted to discussing the economy and one of the most 
                important components in improving economic growth&#151;our transport 
                infrastructure&#151;is well spent.</P>
              <P>The speeches from the principal parties in this morning's debates 
                have been interesting. However, it cannot be more clear now that 
                only one party in Scotland is committed to improving Scotland's 
                transport infrastructure and delivering for business and the economy. 
                That party is the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party.</P>
              <P>I do not doubt the minister's good intentions, but five years 
                of failure since Labour's election in 1997&#151;almost three of 
                those years post devolution&#151;have meant that fact has given 
                way to spin and self-justification.</P>
              <P><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: </strong>Will the member give way?</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>I will do so in a moment, because 
                I feel sorry for Sylvia Jackson.</P>
              <P>We hear a range of views from the SNP&#151;from the out-and-out 
                Stalinism of some members&#151;Mr Quinan comes to mind&#151;to 
                the more Milton Friedman-style economics that Mr Wilson prefers. 
                That range of views demonstrates that, while SNP members&#151;or, 
                at least, most of them&#151;may be bound by a common commitment 
                to independence, the SNP does not have a coherent strategy for 
                Scotland's economy or its transport infrastructure.</P>
              <P>When the SNP leader, John Swinney, unveiled the SNP's &quot;Talking 
                Independence&quot; campaign a few weeks ago, he pledged that his 
                party would provide</P>
              <P>&quot;the most sophisticated economic presentation on independence 
                ever devised.&quot;</P>
              <P>So far, the SNP has failed to live up to that promise. No matter 
                how many prawn cocktails are consumed or lattes are drunk, I cannot 
                believe that anybody in the business community in Scotland believes 
                that the stewardship of the Scottish economy would be better in 
                SNP hands. Nothing that has been said this morning makes me change 
                that view.</P>
              <P><strong>Dr Jackson: </strong>David Mundell's comments so far 
                have been rather negative. Will he comment on the new business 
                start-up rate in the Scottish Enterprise Forth Valley area? In 
                common with the Fife area, very good results have been achieved 
                by Scottish Enterprise Forth Valley, which has passed its original

                basis that so bedevils the Scottish Executive. Businesses have 
                to make choices, and the Scottish Executive has to do that too.</P>
              <P>We are brave enough to make those choices and to answer to the 
                Scottish people and to businesses for the choices that we make. 
                When it comes to the economy, the choice is quite clear: either 
                we put substantial investment into our transport infrastructure 
                and into delivering broadband infrastructure&#151;the roads and 
                the railways of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century&#151;so that businesses 
                can thrive and develop, or we continue to fritter away money on 
                myriad schemes and initiatives that are operated by the enterprise 
                companies or the Executive. That is not a difficult call, because 
                it is clear that existing arrangements are not working. Let us 
                not shirk the choice, but let us come down firmly in favour of 
                investment in transport and technology infrastructure.</P>
              <P>One of the most positive features of the Parliament is the opportunity 
                that it has provided for proper scrutiny of budgets that are spent 
                in Scotland, in particular in the case of non-departmental bodies. 
                George Lyon may have sung the praises of Highlands and Islands 
                Enterprise, but members of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 
                Committee, including his colleague Tavish Scott, were much more 
                concerned to hear that 20 per cent of Highlands and Islands Enterprise's 
                budget is spent on administration. We have to get to the bottom 
                of facts such as those, because they show that there is considerable 
                scope for transfer of funds. That exercise must be undertaken 
                and we continue to scrutinise the Executive in debates such as 
                this one.</P>
              <P><strong>Des McNulty (Clydebank and Milngavie) (Lab): </strong>Given 
                David Mundell's interest in transfer of funds, does he agree that 
                particular consideration should be given to West Dunbartonshire? 
                Is it a place to which he would be content to transfer some of 
                the funds that are not being spent in rural areas?</P>
              <P><strong>David Mundell: </strong>I am sure that the Deputy Presiding 
                Officer would like me to commit all sorts of funds to the Dunbartonshire 
                area, but I cannot </P>

              <P>do that in this speech.</P>
              <P>I do not accept criticism of the calling to account of Scottish 
                Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. It is our job, 
                on behalf of the taxpayer and the business community, to call 
                those organisations to account. We make no apology for doing that. 
                The significant costs that are attributed to those organisations 
                are a direct cost on every business in Scotland. I note Sylvia 
                Jackson's positive comments about Scottish Enterprise Forth Valley, 
                but we have to judge every component of the enterprise network 
                on the basis of what difference it makes. We have to ask, &quot;What 
                are the outputs and how can we measure them?&quot; Furthermore, 
                we have to do that in a context of asking whether local authorities 
                could perform any of the functions better.</P>
              <P>Although Ms Alexander might not be asking such questions, we 
                most certainly are. Alex Neil is right to say that the Conservatives 
                introduced the present form of the enterprise network. However, 
                it is quite clear that times have moved on, not least with the 
                creation of the Scottish Parliament, and what was appropriate 
                a decade ago might no longer be so.</P>
              <P>My colleague Alex Fergusson highlighted the difficulties that 
                are being faced in rural Scotland, and Christine Grahame eloquently 
                did the same. At least the minister did not say&#151;as she did 
                on transport matters&#151;that the rural economy has been fixed, 
                although it would be helpful to all concerned if she pointed out 
                to us where her responsibilities for the rural economy end and 
                Ross Finnie's responsibilities begin.</P>
              <P>Keith Harding concentrated on business rates and made clear our 
                opposition to the Local Government Committee's ill-conceived proposals, 
                which not only unfairly target businesses across different local 
                authorities in Scotland but completely undermine the commitment 
                to a uniform business rate that business in Scotland has struggled 
                to achieve. We cannot and would never support such measures and 
                will take every parliamentary opportunity to demonstrate just 
                how damaging they are.</P>
              <P>To improve our economic performance in Scotland, the Scottish 
                Executive could take certain positive steps, the most obvious 
                of which is significant investment in our transport infrastructure. 
                It is time that the Executive made that a real priority in its 
                economic policy instead of prioritising regulation, bureaucracy 
                and increased business rates.</P>

              <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Cancer Research Trials</strong></P>
              <P><strong>1. Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether cancer patients have sufficient 
                opportunities to participate in clinical trials for new drugs 
                and therapies. (S1O-4972)</P>
              <P><strong>The Minister for Health and Community Care (Malcolm Chisholm): 
                </strong>The Scottish Executive encourages clinicians to ensure 
                that as many patients as possible are included in relevant trials. 
                I announced last week that £1 million is being made available 
                to provide more research nurses and other support for clinical 
                trials.</P>
              <P>Participation in clinical trials is subject to patient eligibility 
                against preset research criteria and, of course, patient choice.</P>
              <P><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>I am delighted that my question 
                prompted the minister's announcement of a new cancer research 
                network and £1 million for clinical trials for cancer patients 
                in Scotland.</P>
              <P>Given that Scotland is a world leader in the development of new 
                cancer drugs and that patients who are involved in clinical trials 
                have better outcomes, will the implementation plan provide continuing 
                information technology and clinical staff support and a continued 
                commitment to allow the NHS in Scotland to lead the world in patient 
                involvement in cancer research trial work?</P>
              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I will set aside the fact 
                that the timing of the announcement did not quite coincide with 
                Mary Scanlon's interpretation of events. I am glad that she welcomes 
                the extra money that we put into clinical trials last week. We 
                intend to get that money out into the research network so that 
                more patients can be recruited for trials.</P>
              <P>The support is already in place, to an extent, because of the 
                Scottish cancer therapy network&#151;the infrastructure already 
                exists. That is why we can put all the additional money, more 
                or less, into developing clinical trials in hospitals and in the 
                various regional cancer networks.</P>
              <P><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>I declare 
                an interest, as I am the patron of the Scottish Breast Cancer 
                Campaign. I want to ask the minister about a matter that is related 
                to clinical trials and money, as I know that he met representatives 
                of the campaign earlier this week. </P>

              <P>Does the minister agree that the work undertaken voluntarily 
                by the campaign to produce its questionnaire 2000 could be used 
                as a pilot study to discover the experiences of women in Scotland 
                who are diagnosed with breast cancer, provided that such a study 
                was funded by the Executive and undertaken by an independent body?</P>
              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I agree with Margo MacDonald 
                that we should pay tribute to the superb work that the Scottish 
                Breast Cancer Campaign has done over the past eight years. The 
                campaign's questionnaire was extremely useful for everyone who 
                is involved in delivering cancer services. It is clear that a 
                lot of work is being done on patient involvement in cancer services. 
                Many of the campaign's suggestions fit in with the wider agenda 
                of developing patient involvement and feedback in order to improve 
                services. I was able to give a positive response to the points 
                that the campaign's representatives raised, although I am still 
                pursuing some of the detailed questions that they asked.</P>

              <P> <strong>3. Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether it has identified any adverse 
                implications for economic development following the freezing of 
                the contract for the building of an en route air traffic control 
                centre in Prestwick. (S1O-4988)</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong 
                Learning (Lewis Macdonald): </strong>No. The Scottish Executive 
                supports the UK Government's commitment to the new Scottish centre 
                at Prestwick and I understand that both site preparations and 
                the drawing up of contracts are proceeding in line with the revised 
                timetable that was agreed by UK ministers.</P>
              <P><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>Surely the minister recognises 
                the importance of the development of the centre to South Ayrshire's 
                economy&#151;the development will have a major input into that 
                economy. Surely he should represent Scottish economic interests 
                and try to persuade his Cabinet colleagues to unblock that contract 
                now. Does he recognise that, in addition to the short-term economic 
                effect of the block on air service development, there is a longer-term 
                economic effect? The block may also affect the safety of passengers 
                in the long term.</P>
              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Of course we are aware of the 
                importance of the centre, the development of which we fully support. 
                As I said, that work will go ahead in accordance with the revised 
                timetable. Employment in the area will be boosted by the construction 
                phase in particular, and it is clear that the sooner construction

              <P>boost will happen. If construction is delayed, the boost will 
                simply be deferred, but it will happen in any case.</P>
              <P>On the air traffic side, the number of jobs that is predicted 
                at the new centre is similar to the number of jobs at the present 
                centre. In that respect, there will be no employment impact. We 
                have spoken with Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire, which has responsibility 
                in that area. That organisation is content that the only economic 
                impact of a delay will be a delay in the relevant construction 
                jobs and that there will be no wider negative impact on the Ayrshire 
                economy.</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Is the minister 
                aware that any further delay in the project will result in a real 
                danger that Scotland might lose the project to Ireland? Will he 
                and the Executive do everything that they can to ensure that that 
                does not happen?</P>
              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>As I said to Mr Gallie, we 
                are committed to supporting a two-centre strategy that involves 
                Prestwick. We are not aware of any threat to that strategy. We 
                are not aware that National Air Traffic Services or the airline 
                group has any intention of reconsidering its commitment to Prestwick. 
                We will continue to talk to those parties about the timing of 
                their project and the construction. We are confident that the 
                project will go ahead and will provide a service that protects 
                air safety and provides employment in Ayrshire.</P>
              <P><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con): </strong>Given the impact of

                </strong>On 31 October 2001, we announced details of a new community 
                safety award programme, which will give all council-led community 
                safety partnerships a share of £12 million over the next three 
                years for local community safety initiatives. The programme will 
                allow community safety partnerships to secure, for the first time, 
                sustained mainstream funding to be used solely for the purposes 
                of taking forward the community safety agenda.</P>
              <P><strong>Elaine Thomson: </strong>I know that the extra funding 
                for the many anti-crime initiatives that are being developed by 
                Aberdeen community safety partnerships is making real improvements. 
                For instance, there has been a significant reduction in house-breaking. 
                Is the minister aware of the problems of youth disorder in certain 
                areas of my constituency, such as Bridge of Don? What more can 
                be done to develop diversionary projects, such as youth caf&eacute;s 
                and other initiatives, to ensure that young people do not get 
                involved in drugs or in other anti-social behaviour?</P>
              <P><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>The Executive is aware of the concerns 
                of many MSPs and of their constituents about youth crime. We believe 
                that community safety partnerships&#151;which involve the local

                including the communities that are seriously affected by crime&#151;have 
                the opportunity to bring forward many different projects, of which 
                there are excellent examples across the country. The Audit Commission 
                has published a report on community safety partnerships and has 
                put an audit system in place. It is possible to develop all sorts 
                of new projects and many exciting projects are taking place. I

              <P><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>As Lord James will no doubt be aware, 
                a report on the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has 
                been published. Indeed, one of the Parliament's committees has

              <P><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Given 
                the fact that much of the crime in the north-east of Scotland 
                to which Elaine Thomson referred is due to Grampian's drug misuse 
                problem, will the minister investigate the level of rehabilitation 
                after-care services in the north-east of Scotland? In recent years, 
                there has been an enormous rise in drug misuse in the region. 
                If we were to increase the level of such services, we could reduce 
                crime.</P>
              <P><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>The behaviour that arises from drug 
                misuse is significant. One of our reports indicated that 40 per 
                cent of families in council flats said that vandalism and people 
                drinking or taking drugs were common problems in their neighbourhoods. 
                Tackling such problems is part of the community neighbourhood 
                strategy that we are trying to develop. It is important that we 
                ensure that the rehabilitation services are not only available, 
                but available at the right time.</P>
              <P>The effective interventions unit of the health department, with 
                which I work closely, is developing a programme on integrated 
                care that will allow us to ensure that the proper services are 
                available in individual areas for those who are involved in drugs. 
                The programme will help people move out of drug misuse into more 
                appropriate behaviours.</P>

                stage 2.</P>
              <P><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP): </strong>The minister 
                will be aware that when the bill finally becomes law it will be 
                up to landowners to make decisions about providing access to commercial 
                companies. The real concern arises out of possible changes under 
                section 9(2)(a). Given that most of the concerns of landowners 
                seem to be about the possibility of people staging rock concerts 
                or similar day-long events, what consideration has the minister 
                given to redrafting section 9(2)(a) so as to include only ventures 
                that involve the erection of a tangible structure&#151;even if 
                it is temporary&#151;and to exclude others, such as mountain guides, 
                who are exercising ordinary access rights?</P>
              <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>During the closing speeches of 
                the stage 1 debate I indicated&#151;although perhaps not as definitively 
                as I might have&#151;that I want to draw a distinction between 
                exercising as passage within a property, as Mr Matheson suggested, 
                or as a passage across land, and activity similar to that to which 
                Roseanna Cunningham has referred. It is not quite as simple as 
                that, but as I indicated in the debate that is the direction in 
                which my mind is moving. There are distinctions to be drawn and 
                I hope to lodge an appropriate amendment at stage 2.</P>
              <P><strong>Alex Fergusson (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>Seeing 
                the difficulty that the minister has in rising from his chair, 
                I offer him both my sympathy and the telephone number of my wife&#151;but 
                only because she is an accomplished physiotherapist. [<I>Laughter.</I>] 
                I mean that to be a helpful offer.</P>
              <P>In terms of commercial activity, will the minister undertake 
                to ensure that the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will protect the 
                interests of the Historic Houses Association, the commercial activities 
                of which&#151;mainly charging for access&#151;are important ingredients 
                in being able to maintain and preserve ancient buildings that 
                are vital to Scotland's heritage?</P>
              <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I am grateful to the member for 
                his sympathy. In my present state I would not wish to exclude 
                physiotherapy under section 9(2)(a). Apart from that most helpful 
                offer, more often the member is given to making declarations of 
                interest on agricultural matters, rather than to advertising.</P>
              <P>To answer Mr Fergusson's question seriously, the Executive's 
                intention in relation to commercial activity is not to exclude 
                those activities that currently take place. That is not our intention. 
                We have acknowledged that the section as it is currently drafted 
                might be misconstrued in that way and, as I said, I intend to 
                lodge an amendment to section 9(2)(a) to clarify the position.</P>

                </strong>I welcome the minister's strong hint about lodging an 
                amendment. I hope that he will consider the impact of a restrictive 
                interpretation of section 9(2)(a) on the delivery of our social 
                justice agenda. I am thinking of children in my constituency who 
                benefit from being taken on land in safety and guided by those 
                who know what they are doing. I hope that the minister will bear 
                that in mind when framing the amendment, in order to make a distinction 
                between natural and non-natural uses of land.</P>

              <P> <strong>10. Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab): </strong>To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether it will introduce any changes 
                to legislation on freshwater fisheries in order to improve public 
                access to angling on rivers and lochs. (S1O-4968)</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development 
                (Allan Wilson): </strong>Public access is one of the issues covered 
                by the recent green paper, &quot;Scotland's freshwater fish and 
                fisheries: Securing their future&quot;<I>. </I>I am currently 
                considering with my officials how we might take forward the proposals 
                in light of the responses of consultees. I shall make a statement 
                on that shortly.</P>
              <P>Some action to give effect to the green paper's proposals can 
                be taken administratively and that is already under way. Some 
                issues are dependent on subordinate legislation and we are considering 
                those. The remaining green paper proposals include improvements 
                to public access, which is governed by a system of protection 
                orders and will require primary legislation. My officials will 
                undertake a review of the current system and I will consider sympathetically 
                any proposals emerging from the review.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Home Robertson: </strong>It is now two years since 
                I launched the Executive's consultation on protecting and promoting 
                Scotland's freshwater fisheries, so I hope that the minister will 
                be able to make progress on the matter soon. Will he confirm that 
                the existing legislation on freshwater fish is a mess, that there 
                is an urgent need for new legislation to protect native fish species 
                and that the Labour party's objective must be to help local angling 
                clubs to increase public access to an extremely popular sport, 
                not only for our citizens but for tourists who are visiting Scotland?

              <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>John Home Robertson makes two 
                substantive points. I agree that legislative change is required; 
                the green paper is acknowledged to be one of a series of measures 
                that we envisage will be necessary to create a structure for the 
                better conservation and management of our freshwater fish. A bill 
                to consolidate the Scottish salmon and freshwater fisheries legislation 
                is at an advanced state of development and is scheduled to be 
                presented to Parliament later this year. It is the first such 
                consolidated bill.</P>
              <P>On access for anglers to enjoy their sport, I confirm Labour's 
                commitment&#151;which I am sure is shared by our coalition colleagues&#151;to 
                improve access to our rivers and lochs in line with our broader 
                commitment to ensure and broaden responsible access to the countryside. 
                We aim to repeal the Freshwater and Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) 
                Act 1976 and replace protection orders with a new system when 
                a legislative opportunity arises.</P>
              <P><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>Is the minister 
                aware that Lord Mackay of Clashfern, when he was the Lord Advocate, 
                stated to me in a letter that the common-law position in Scotland 
                is that freshwater fish in free-running water are not the property 
                of anyone until they are caught, when they become the property 
                of the person who caught them irrespective of whether that person 
                is the owner of the fishing rights or has permission to fish from 
                the owner of the fishing rights? Will the minister tell landowners 
                to remove all &quot;No Fishing&quot; signs from areas that are 
                not covered by a protection order?</P>
              <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Whatever else I am responsible 
                for, I am not responsible for the statements of Lord Mackay of 
                Clashfern&#151;unfortunately. It is our intention to introduce 
                a Scotland-wide system to balance the interests of anglers and 
                riparian landowners. You will be aware, Dennis&#151;you were probably 
                at Westminster in 1976&#151;that the current system is considered 
                in certain areas to have failed in its primary objective of guaranteeing 
                significant increases in angling access, although you introduced 
                the legislation with admirable intent.</P>
              <P><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>No, I voted against it.</P>
              <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>That can be checked, I am sure.</P>
              <P>The monitoring mechanisms have failed. As soon as a legislative 
                opportunity arises, we will introduce legislation to repeal the 
                1976 act.</P>
              <P><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab): </strong>Will the 
                minister agree to introduce such a bill as soon as possible? Anglers 
                who fish in the Stirling Council area say that low-income families 
                and elderly and disabled people are increasingly being excluded 
                from fishing and that the situation is getting worse.</P>

                the Scottish Executive what progress is being made on electoral 
                reform for local government. (S1O-4994)</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services (Peter 
                Peacock): </strong>Yesterday we published our white paper on renewing 
                local democracy, which, among many other things, seeks views on 
                options for electoral reform.</P>
              <P><strong>Iain Smith: </strong>Is the minister aware that Liberal 
                Democrat members consider the white paper that was published yesterday 
                to be a real step forward in the progress towards electoral reform? 
                Will he confirm that the Executive has given instructions for 
                the necessary sections to be drafted that would allow for the 
                introduction of the single transferable vote in elections for 
                local government in Scotland?</P>
              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>I confirm that Executive officials 
                have been instructed to draft appropriate sections in line with 
                the options that are suggested in the white paper. I agree with 
                Iain Smith that the paper that we published yesterday represents 
                real progress on the issue. The white paper is not just about 
                electoral reform; it is about how we modernise and make relevant 
                local government in the future. Local government is central to 
                the improvement of service delivery in Scotland.</P>
              <P><strong>Tricia Marwick (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP): </strong>The 
                white paper includes the McIntosh commission recommendation that</P>
              <P>&quot;Proportional Representation should be introduced for local 
                government elections. A review should be set up immediately, to 
                identify the most appropriate voting system for Scottish local 
                government.&quot;</P>
              <P>However, it is curious that Peter Peacock left out the fact that 
                McIntosh also said that that system should be in place by 2002. 
                Does he really think that the white paper is a step forward? It 
                is, in fact, a step back. Will he give a guarantee that legislation 
                to introduce PR in local government elections will be enacted 
                in the Parliament by May 2003?</P>
              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The only thing that is heading 
                backwards is the SNP with its arguments for independence for Scotland. 
                The truth of the matter is that the Executive's Liberal and Labour 
                partners are striding forwards actively to reinvigorate local 
                democracy, because it is centrally important to how Scotland operates.</P>

                nothing in time for the next local government elections?</P>
              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>That is an unduly cynical comment. 
                Keith Harding is obviously in need of a holiday. The white paper 
                represents substantial progress. Keith Harding fails to understand 
                the true relationship between the Liberals and the Labour party 
                in the coalition, which is a relationship of constructive engagement 
                to seek progress in Scotland's public services.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr John McAllion (Dundee East) (Lab): </strong>Rather 
                than fretting over which electoral system rewards this or that 
                political party, should not we focus on which electoral system 
                rewards not only the voters in our own parties but all the voters 
                in Scotland? Surely the single transferable vote system is the 
                system best suited to deepening and extending Scottish democracy 
                in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century, unlike first past the post, which 
                consistently rewards the majority at the expense of the excluded 
                minority?</P>
              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>John McAllion's views on the 
                subject are well known and he has held them firmly for many years. 
                The whole purpose of the white paper is to open up proposals to 
                scrutiny and to seek the views of people about potential changes 
                in the electoral system. Once we have heard the results of the 
                consultation, we will make up our minds about what to do next

                sector and to modernising the legal, financial and infrastructure 
                framework in which it operates. We have increased direct financial 
                support for the sector from £23 million in 1998-99 to £39 million 
                in 2001-02. We are nearing completion of the review of our direct 
                funding of the sector and have announced our response to the review 
                of support for the minority ethnic voluntary sector. We are reviewing

                ensure that three-year funding packages are in place for voluntary 
                organisations?</P>
              <P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>As Sarah Boyack knows, I am aware 
                of the problems that the Edinburgh Streetwork Project recently 
                faced. I am glad that a solution was found and that the excellent 
                work that the project undertakes with the homeless in Edinburgh 
                will continue. The Executive indicates three-year finance levels 
                to local authorities and we believe that that should allow local 
                authorities in turn to indicate three-year finance levels to the 
                voluntary sector organisations that they support. I accept that 
                that does not always happen, which is one of the reasons behind 
                the strategic review of voluntary sector funding that we have 
                now agreed to begin. That review will examine the partnership 
                between the Executive, the voluntary sector and local government 
                to see what can be done to improve funding commitments and make 
                them more effective. Officials have already had informal talks 
                with the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations and the

                the Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services rejected allocating 
                any of the £200 million underspend to Scottish Borders Council, 
                and that, as a consequence, voluntary organisations such as the 
                Gala Youth Project, which I have mentioned before and which supports 
                hundreds of young people in difficulties, and Penumbra, which 
                provides supported accommodation for vulnerable young people, 
                will lose out and could close down? Does he think that his Cabinet 
                colleague is supporting voluntary organisations in the Borders?</P>
              <P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The different roles of different 
                layers of government and their relationship with the voluntary 
                sector are important. It is right and proper that local authorities 
                have the autonomy to take decisions about how services are delivered 
                in their area and I would expect such decisions to include consideration 
                of how and where the voluntary sector can make services more efficient 
                and effective. Local authorities rightly have autonomy and rightly 
                must answer to their electorates for their decisions. Our role 
                is to provide a legal framework and support the national infrastructure. 
                In replying to previous questions, I have tried to show that we 
                have done that. The issue of the funding of Scottish Borders Council

              <P><strong>Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh (Central Scotland) (Con): </strong>How 
                does the Executive ensure that money that is allocated to community 
                projects reaches those who need it most and does not find its 
                way to schemes that are outwith stated priority areas?</P>
              <P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>I did not catch the end of Lyndsay 
                McIntosh's question.</P>
              <P><strong>Mrs McIntosh: </strong>Should I repeat it?</P>
              <P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>If she raised a specific issue, it 
                would be helpful if she gave me details. If she asked whether 
                we should ring fence money that we expect to be used to fund voluntary 
                organisations, I should say that that is not our approach&#151;I 
                have just described our approach. Local authorities are in the 
                lead in respect of responsibility for service delivery in their 
                local areas. They must deliver services through best value and 
                in the best way that they can. We believe that the voluntary sector 
                has a significant role to play and when we make our community 
                regeneration statement, which will be soon, we will elaborate 
                on the additionality that the voluntary sector can bring. In the 
                end, decisions are properly for local authorities, which answer 
                to their electorates for those decisions.</P>

                and Cleanaway's plant at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire are able to

                storage and draft regulations are not good enough? Will he tell 
                us when he plans to produce final guidelines? The Government's 
                delay and dither are preventing Scots companies from creating

                nature of the ban of the foam substance was not known two years

              <P><strong>Mr Quinan:</strong> Does the minister agree with Professor 
                Phil Hanlon, the director of the Public Health Institute of Scotland, 
                who was quoted in <I>The Scotsman</I> on Monday calling for the 
                introduction of single vaccines for children whose parents resolutely 
                refuse to have them immunised with the MMR vaccine? Will the minister 
                implement the expert group's recommendations, regardless of whether

              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The fact of the matter is 
                that Professor Hanlon has no doubts about the safety of MMR, as 
                he has made clear. There are conflicting reports about the context 
                of his remarks. The fact is that majority medical opinion clearly 
                supports MMR. Professor Hanlon made it clear that he was making 
                a pragmatic judgment, but the pragmatic judgment of the majority 
                of medical people is that, if we moved to single vaccines, coverage 
                would fall dramatically and we would be putting the population

                ask the First Minister what issues will be discussed at the next 
                meeting of the Scottish Executive's Cabinet. (S1F-1794)</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>The 
                Cabinet will meet again on 17 April and we will agree the agenda 
                the previous week.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>I thank the First Minister for his 
                answer. Last week, the Minister for Justice said that a firm of 
                private accountants had carried out an audit of the figures that 
                have been used to justify the privatisation of Scotland's prisons. 
                Is that statement true?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>The firm of accountants, 
                as I explained to Mr Swinney last week, carried out a clear and 
                accurate analysis of the figures that we had been presented with 
                in relation to the comparisons on different options for the future 
                of the prisons estate. In comparing those options, it was clear 
                that the financial decision that was of best value to the public 
                sector in Scotland was to choose the route that was outlined last 
                week in the chamber. That analysis was backed up by the analysis 
                that was carried out by the firm that was employed to do so and 
                the figures were published last week.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>The First Minister is clearly wriggling 
                on that issue. The Minister for Justice said last week that PricewaterhouseCoopers 
                had carried out an independent audit of the figures. Page 11 of 
                the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, states:</P>
              <P>&quot;we have not undertaken work in the nature of an audit&quot;.</P>
              <P>So there has been no audit; there has been no audit because the 
                numbers do not add up. In that report&#151;which argues for private 
                prisons in Scotland, based on the cost of private prisons in England&#151;the 
                saving to the public purse is alleged to be 50 per cent. Another 
                report on privatisation of prisons in England, which examined 
                the same exercise and the same prisons in England, stated that 
                the saving to the public purse was 14 per cent. The PricewaterhouseCoopers 
                report states that the saving is 50 per cent and the other report, 
                by Mouchel Consulting Ltd, states that the saving is 14 per cent. 
                Those reports carried out the same exercise in relation to the 
                same private prisons in England. They cannot both be true. Is 
                not it the case that the 50 per cent saving that the First Minister 
                is hiding behind is incredible and unbelievable?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>No. No one is hiding behind 
                any figures. The figures were published last week, </P>

              <P>as part of a three-month consultation. If people have any questions 
                or want to put an alternative point of view on the figures, Mr 
                Wallace made it clear in the chamber last week that they should 
                raise those questions and present those figures during the consultation 
                period. I do not know the second report that Mr Swinney mentioned. 
                I would be very surprised if the two comparisons to which he refers 
                are exactly the same comparisons of exactly the same prisons in 
                exactly the same locations and in the same time span. The analysis 
                that was carried out, which has been checked and has now been 
                published so that it can receive this sort of scrutiny, is the 
                analysis on which that consultation should be based.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>We now know that no audit of the 
                figures was undertaken. That is crystal clear.</P>
              <P>All the information is the same, apart from the fact that the 
                review of the exercise in Scotland excludes the most expensive 
                private prisons in England, which makes the case even worse. Is 
                not it the case that this week we are seeing the unravelling of 
                bogus arguments about privatisation of our public services? In 
                prisons, the numbers do not stack up. In the Post Office and in 
                dockyards, workers have been thrown on the dole for the sake of 
                privatisation. In our hospitals, national health service cleaners 
                are getting the sack and hospital acquired infection is rising. 
                On our railways, private shareholders get public money and the 
                public do not even get their trains. Does the First Minister agree 
                that the only way that he can stand up for the case for privatisation 
                of our public services is to stand up in Parliament and con the 
                public?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>Absolutely not. It is important 
                to check whether what some members say&#151;and the statistics 
                that they regularly manipulate and misrepresent&#151;reflect their 
                true vision for Scotland. The document that Mr Swinney published 
                last Tuesday contains 54 pages and 14,308 words on independence 
                and states that it is</P>
              <P>&quot;a confident presentation of our vision&quot;</P>
              <P>for Scotland.</P>
              <P>That document contains 47 mentions of the word "tax". How many 
                mentions does it contain of the word "teachers"? None. It contains 
                16 mentions of the word "negotiations", but how many mentions 
                of the word "nurses"? None. How many mentions of the word "passengers"? 
                None. It contains 46 mentions of the word "constitution", but 
                how many mentions of crime? None. It contains 211 mentions of 
                the word "independence". Mr Swinney's priorities for Scotland 
                are about constitutional upheaval, not public services. The public 
                know that the partnership Executive puts public services first.</P>

                the achievements of the Scottish Executive's first 1,000 days, 
                for they are not Camelot. The proposals in the Criminal Justice 
                (Scotland) Bill sum up the failure of the Executive's approach. 
                No clear line can be drawn in the sand to provide parents with 
                a guide in every circumstance. Does the First Minister agree that 
                the Minister for Justice's rather muddled and confused explanation

                not accept that the present legal position provides the flexibility 
                that is required to deal with individual cases? Instead of trying

              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>Nobody is trying to criminalise 
                parents in Scotland; it is wrong to accuse anyone of that. The 
                proposals in the bill are based on a white paper that was based 
                on full consultation. The proposals have been laid before, and 
                will be debated in, the Parliament and they include something 
                with which the Conservative party is uncomfortable. Sam Galbraith 
                proposed a ban on smacking or the use of implements against children 
                to the House of Commons in 1995, but the Conservative Government 
                of the time voted down that proposal. A ban on the use of implements 
                against children is desperately needed in 21<SUP>st</SUP> century

                existence and the make-work army of 20 ministers by giving them 
                something to do. That approach undermines faith in the Parliament. 
                When the First Minister came to office, he said that he would 
                change that approach. He has been in charge for five months; when 
                will he get round to doing less, doing it better and, preferably, 
                doing it with fewer?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>The good voters of Edinburgh 
                and the Lothians would be interested to know that the following 
                list of items, which are in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, 
                are considered to be small and trivial and not deserving of Parliament's 
                support. The bill includes new rights for victims, which are long 
                overdue in Scotland and will be delivered by Parliament during 
                its second 1,000 days. The bill includes the creation of new penalties 
                for sexual offences in Scotland, which are long overdue and will 
                be put before Parliament in the months ahead. The bill also contains 
                plans to ensure the remote monitoring of prisoners, which will 
                get more people out of our prisons but allow an eye to be kept 
                on them when they are out in the community. The bill has plans 
                for drug courts and for non-custodial punishments.</P>
              <P>All those proposals will make key changes in our law. They might 
                not be the kind of matters that Mr McLetchie intended to talk 
                about when he was planning his diversionary question yesterday, 
                but those fundamental proposals will change the face of tackling 
                crime in Scotland and are a priority for the Administration. In 
                the months ahead, we will take forward those proposals, which 
                will give Parliament a good reputation for its second 1,000 days.</P>
              <P><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>That is all very well, but 
                the First Minister avoided the point of the question. Why will 
                we in Scotland have laws banning the smacking of children, which 
                are not required in any other part of the United Kingdom? Let 
                us not have any more flannel and bluster. It is a simple question. 
                If the existing law on looking after children is good enough for 
                parents in England and Wales, why cannot we rely on the same common 
                sense provision for parents in Scotland?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I thought that Mr McLetchie, 
                as a practising solicitor, would have been aware that the legal 
                systems north and south of the border have been different for 
                some time. A key reason for the creation of the Parliament was 
                to create our laws, have our debates and make our decisions. We 
                intend to do that.</P>

                the First Minister what action the Scottish Executive is taking 
                to mitigate loss of employment at Faslane and Coulport. (S1F-1799)</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>We will 
                respond rapidly to retrain and provide employment advice to those 
                who need it. That support will be provided to affected workers 
                through local teams that are already in place under the partnership 
                action for continuing employment framework&#151;PACE. However, 
                the scale of any job reductions cannot be confirmed until Babcock 
                Engineering Services Ltd has conducted its review.</P>
              <P><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The First Minister will be aware 
                of the real sense of anger in the work force about the substance 
                of the Ministry of Defence's decision and the process that was 
                followed. Over the years, that work force has given loyal and 
                excellent service and has displayed a willingness to adapt to 
                new working practices. I acknowledge that the issue matters to 
                the whole UK, but the impact of the decision has a direct bearing 
                on devolved matters.</P>
              <P>I understand that the MOD is aware that of a potential 750 job 
                losses throughout the UK, about 500 will be at Faslane and Coulport. 
                That will have a devastating effect on the individuals who are 
                affected, their families and the local economy. The impact will 
                be felt in many areas that are beyond my constituency. I ask the 
                First Minister to ensure that the Executive, working with the 
                MOD, provides additional resources beyond the PACE programme for 
                retraining, reskilling and job creation. Those resources are needed 
                now to prevent people from becoming unemployed through redundancy.</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I am happy to give that 
                commitment. I would also be pleased to offer to Jackie Baillie, 
                Des McNulty and West Dunbartonshire Council the opportunity of 
                a meeting to discuss those important matters. The Faslane and 
                Coulport work force is skilled and has an excellent reputation. 
                I believe that the work force will cope admirably with the new 
                situation, if it must. We must talk up that fact as well as express 
                concerns. In the months ahead, I hope that we can look to the 
                wider problems of West Dunbartonshire and ensure that appropriate 
                action secures the long-term employment of skilled workers, other 
                workers and those who are currently unemployed in that area.</P>

                about Labour's commitment to defence diversification and arms 
                conversion?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>No, I do not agree. There 
                is much work going on in diversification. Members might have reservations 
                about this week's announcement, but even Babcock has been involved 
                in much of that diversification activity.</P>
              <P>I must say, whatever concerns the workers in Faslane and West 
                Dunbartonshire might have, that they would be an awful lot more 
                concerned if a nationalist Government were in place in Scotland. 
                Only a month ago, Mr Swinney was at Faslane calling for the base 
                to be closed, which would result in all its workers being put 
                on the dole. He wants the workers put on the dole; we want them 
                to be retrained and back in work with secure futures.</P>
              <P><strong>Miss Annabel Goldie (West of Scotland) (Con): </strong>The 
                First Minister has alluded to the matter of the loss of skills. 
                Is he disturbed by the possible loss of a particular set of skills? 
                The skills in the defence industry are important. Has the First 
                Minister had any discussions with his counterpart in the Ministry 
                of Defence in Westminster about how we might try to consolidate 
                the retention of the skills in the overall defence procurement 
                situation in Scotland?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>That would be an important 
                discussion. It is also important to ensure that responses to the 
                situations that we are discussing are tailored to circumstances. 
                When the closure of the Motorola factory in West Lothian was announced 
                last year, one of the main aspects of the response to that was 
                to ensure that those who were leaving employment at the factory 
                were able to take up the European computer driving licence to 
                ensure that they had the skills that would allow them to access 
                work in the Edinburgh financial services sector. When people leave 
                the Clyde shipyards, we ensure that they can retrain to take up 
                new jobs as central heating engineers to do the work that will 
                have to be done to ensure that our policy of giving every old 
                person in Scotland proper central heating in their home is delivered 
                with a high level of skill.</P>

                the great disappointment and concern that has been expressed by 
                my constituents who travel to Faslane and Coulport every day. 
                While we would expect and welcome action from the Scottish Executive, 
                we need to ensure that the Ministry of Defence faces up to its 
                responsibilities to the workers and communities who have served 
                it well for a long time. Will the First Minister recognise that 
                the impact of the job losses will affect many communities at the 
                Tail o' the Bank and that any action plans should reflect that 
                situation?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I am happy to take on board 
                the point that Duncan McNeil makes. Clearly, the decision will 
                have an impact on both sides of the Clyde, in his constituency

                ask the First Minister what reassurances the Scottish Executive 
                can give that tap water poses no risk to the health of consumers. 
                (S1F-1796)</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>Our 
                drinking water monitoring regime is one of the toughest in Europe 
                and our latest figures show that, in 2000, significantly less 
                than 1 per cent of more than 37,000 tests carried out on tap samples 
                failed to meet key microbiological standards. All failures in 
                that set of circumstances would be investigated.</P>
              <P><strong>Mary Scanlon: </strong>Recent problems in Aberdeen highlighted 
                the fact that health chiefs took five weeks to notify the public 
                and then wrote to hospitals and general practitioners asking them 
                to advise patients who reported to them with symptoms to boil 
                water before drinking it.</P>
              <P>Given the commonly held belief that our tap water is clean and 
                safe to drink, is the First Minister concerned by the response 
                of the public bodies to the problems? How will he address the 
                confidence of consumers, given that Athens, Marseilles and Rome 
                have all recently been judged to have better all-round quality

              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>There are differing sets 
                of statistics floating around this issue. No doubt some of them 
                accurately report the situation, but others misrepresent it. We 
                must have the facts because the safety of our drinking water is 
                critical. </P>

              <P><strong>The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>The 
                most effective way to raise standards in schools is to ensure 
                that teachers match tasks as closely as possible to pupils' individual 
                needs, aptitudes and interests. The framework of national priorities 
                allows education authorities and schools to take a flexible approach 
                toward class organisation to ensure that the potential of every 
                pupil is maximised. Grouping of pupils and classes by their current 
                levels of ability can benefit all levels of ability, but I know 
                from personal experience that flexibility within such an arrangement

              <P>That is consistent with the advice that he has received from

                all independent research. Why does not he just say it again?</P>
              <P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I do not say it because 
                we need to make an intelligent response to the matter. Mr Russell 
                might be prepared to debate the Scottish education service on 
                the basis of slogans and abuse across the chamber, but that is

                next item of business is stage 3 of the Education (Disability 
                Strategies and Pupils' Records) (Scotland) Bill. Members should

              <P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Amendment 1 is 
                in a group on its own.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Education and Young People (Nicol 
                Stephen): </strong>Amendment 1 is a purely technical amendment 
                to clarify the interpretation of the bill. It does not change 
                the bill's substance or purpose. The amendment clarifies to responsible 
                bodies that any reference in the bill to an accessibility strategy 
                refers not only to the first strategy that is prepared but to 
                any revised versions of the strategy or any subsequent accessibility 
                strategies.</P>
              <P>That should also make it clear&#151;if it does not, these words 
                should assist&#151;that subsequent accessibility strategies, which 
                will normally be prepared every three years, should be considered 
                to be new strategies, not simply revised strategies. That will 
                be the case even if the new accessibility strategy carries on 
                a lot of the long-term work that may have started under the previous 
                strategy.</P>

              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>No other member 
                wishes to speak to amendment 1. I take it that the minister does 
                not wish to sum up.</P>

              <P>We have worked hard to respond to the Education, Culture and 
                Sport Committee's views on the bill, and amendments 2 and 3, which 
                amend sections 1 and 2, are revised versions of two amendments 
                that Jackie Baillie lodged at stage 2. The intention was to ensure 
                that responsible bodies not only plan for communications to pupils, 
                but ensure appropriate communications and an appropriate dialogue 
                between pupils and school staff. We did not feel </P>

              <P>that the wording of Jackie Baillie's stage 2 amendments was quite 
                what was required, and agreed to lodge amendments to reflect their 
                intention, with which I think everybody agreed, at stage 3.</P>
              <P>We have slightly altered the original amendments and have approached 
                the problem in a different way. We now have amendments that provide 
                for a wider, more up-front and more general duty to improve communication 
                to and from pupils with disabilities. The amendments come in at 
                the start of sections 1(2)(c) and 2(1)(c) respectively. As before, 
                the duty will be on responsible bodies, which will need to provide 
                information to pupils in alternative forms and improve their provision 
                of information to pupils with disabilities as appropriate.</P>
              <P>Amendments 2 and 3 will ensure that responsible bodies, in their 
                accessibility strategies, cover the improvement of all communication 
                with pupils with disabilities. Previously, the bill covered only 
                the provision of written information in alternative forms and 
                communication directly related to teaching within the curriculum.</P>
              <P>The amendments will widen the scope of the third duty, to cover 
                all communication with pupils even if that communication does 
                not form part of the curriculum. That will mean that responsible 
                bodies should plan to ensure that their staff and others who may 
                work with pupils can communicate with them, and that the pupils 
                can communicate their views back to staff. That should ensure 
                that the views of all pupils, including those with language and 
                communication difficulties, can be taken into account on issues 
                in which they might have an interest, in relation not only to 
                the school curriculum but to school events or school visits, for 
                example. I hope that the amendments reflect the intention of the 
                Education, Culture and Sport Committee.</P>
              <P>I move amendment 2.</P>
              <P><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab): </strong>I welcome 
                very much amendments 2 and 3. They accurately reflect the discussions 
                held during stage 2 by the Education, Culture and Sport Committee. 
                Our concern at the time was to ensure that communication is a 
                two-way process&#151;in other words, that it is about not just 
                doing to, but doing with. The Standards in Scotland's Schools 
                etc Act 2000 and the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 recognise that 
                education authorities must have due regard to the views of children 
                or young people on issues that significantly affect them. Amendments 
                2 and 3 bring the bill very much into line with the spirit and 
                ethos of the foregoing legislation. Therefore, the Parliament 
                should support them.</P>

                in a group on its own. I invite the minister to speak to and move 
                the amendment.</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Amendment 4 is a revised version 
                of amendment 14, which Jackie Baillie lodged at stage 2 and which 
                we agreed to work on and to bring back at stage 3. Amendment 4 
                specifies that responsible bodies should send the Scottish Executive 
                a copy of their accessibility strategies when those strategies 
                are finalised. Copies of the first accessibility strategies that 
                have been prepared by responsible bodies should be received by 
                April 2003. That will allow the Scottish Executive to maintain 
                an overview of accessibility strategies and to consider the progress 
                that has been made on their implementation. It will enable us 
                to identify areas in which further progress needs to be made.</P>
              <P>The amendment requires strategies to be sent to the Scottish 
                Executive only, and not also to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of 
                Education, as Jackie Baillie's original amendment proposed. We 
                undertake to provide HMIE with access to the accessibility strategies 
                that are sent to Scottish ministers and the inspectorate will 
                be able to advise the Scottish Executive on them. Indeed, from 
                time to time we intend to take advice from HMIE on accessibility 
                strategies as they develop. HMIE will also examine accessibility 
                strategies during its routine inspections of schools and education 
                authorities. However, it does not require a second copy of every 
                strategy to be sent to it.</P>
              <P>Amendment 4 does not mean that responsible bodies will have to 
                send in a copy of their strategy every time that they revise it, 
                as they may find that they need to revise the strategy several 
                times each year. However, new section 4(4)(b) will allow the Executive 
                to request that a responsible body sends in the most up-to-date 
                version of its accessibility strategy if, for example, the Executive 
                receives a complaint about a particular aspect of the strategy 
                or feels that, because of revisions, the strategy has changed 
                so significantly that it is appropriate for the Executive to obtain

              <P><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>As I said at stage 2, I consider 
                monitoring to be one of the most important issues before us. I 
                welcome the very positive attitude that the Executive has taken 
                by lodging amendment 4. I am in no doubt that the effectiveness 
                of any policy or piece of legislation is dependent on the effectiveness 
                of the monitoring framework that is in place. It is important 
                that we have&#151;for want of a better phrase&#151;a way of knowing 
                that strategies are working on the ground.</P>
              <P>I am pleased that the Executive will monitor the strategies and 
                the progress that is made. I am also pleased that the minister 
                has confirmed that HMIE will examine accessibility strategies 
                as part of its routine inspection of schools. On that basis, strategies 
                will become a reality on the ground and, over time, their application 
                will become much more sophisticated. It is about providing not 
                just physical access to premises, but access to the curriculum 
                and to information and staff training.</P>
              <P>I am pleased that the Executive has lodged amendment 4 and I 
                urge the chamber to support it.</P>

                in a group on its own. I invite the deputy minister to speak to 
                and move the amendment.</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Amendment 5 arises from comments 
                made by the Subordinate Legislation Committee. The Subordinate 
                Legislation Committee felt that there should be a commitment on 
                the face of the bill to consult on regulations, so that the need 
                to consult would apply if regulations were revised at any time 
                in the future.</P>
              <P>I thank the committee for raising that important issue. We have 
                already committed ourselves to consulting publicly as soon as 
                possible on draft regulations on both pupils' educational records 
                and accessibility strategies. Amendment 5 will ensure that the 
                Scottish Executive consults interested parties about any regulations 
                that are made, now or at any time in the future.</P>

              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Amendment 6 is 
                in a group on its own.</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Amendment 6 relates to the potential 
                confusion that the Education, Culture and Sport Committee identified 
                in relation to the term &quot;pupils' records&quot;. There was 
                a general feeling among committee members that there could be 
                confusion about the short title and that the term could be taken 
                to mean pupils' records of needs. The officials and legal advisers 
                gave us ample reassurance that there would be no confusion in 
                any interpretation of the act in the courts, but there was a general 
                feeling in the committee that clarification would be helpful.</P>
              <P>The regulation-making power in section 4 relates to pupils' educational 
                records generally. Members of the Education, Culture and Sport 
                Committee suggested that that was not reflected clearly in the 
                short title of the bill. Jackie Baillie lodged a series of amendments 
                that suggested that clarification could be achieved by replacing 
                references to &quot;records&quot; with references to &quot;information&quot;. 
                We considered that carefully, but the advice that I received was 
                that &quot;information&quot; was not the correct legal word to 
                use and that it could be interpreted more widely than the term 
                &quot;pupils' records&quot;.</P>
              <P>Nevertheless, I felt that although the term &quot;pupils' records&quot; 
                was legally correct, it would be more appropriate to use in the 
                short title the term that is used in the Data Protection Act 1998 
                and in the body of the bill, which is &quot;educational records&quot;. 
                That will address the committee's concerns. Everybody involved 
                with the bill will welcome the change, although I might be surprised 
                by a flurry of members wanting to speak at the end of my speech.</P>
              <P>I propose amendment 6 as an alternative means of clarifying the 
                short title, so that it reflects accurately the provisions made 
                in the bill and so that there is absolutely no confusion with 
                records of needs.</P>
              <P>I move amendment 6.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I am afraid that 
                I cannot conjure you up a flurry, minister, but I will call Jackie

                a flurry if the Presiding Officer lets me go on for long enough.</P>
              <P>The minister is absolutely right. There was confusion about the 
                use of the word &quot;records&quot; in the title of the bill,

                the motion. I start by thanking everyone who has been involved 
                in the work leading up to the bill's being introduced to Parliament 
                and in its passage through the Parliament, the committee stage 
                and back to the chamber today. Particular thanks ought to go to 
                the people who worked on the bill team, the people in the voluntary 
                sector and wider education community who contributed their views 
                and opinions and MSPs who offered many helpful suggestions during 
                the course of the bill's passage.</P>
              <P>I am pleased that so many MSPs have taken an interest in the 
                bill. I thank the members of the Education, Culture and Sport 
                Committee for the way in which they worked in partnership with 
                the Executive. I also thank the members of the other committees 
                that took time to consider the bill. The way in which the committees 
                worked with the Executive as they tried to secure and finalise 
                improvements to the bill, from its introduction and through stages 
                2 and 3, is a model that I hope we can continue to work with in 
                future. If we all work together to secure the best possible options 
                for children and young people, we will find more that unites us 
                than divides us. That may not make for an exciting debate in the 
                chamber, but the bill that we will pass this afternoon will make 
                a difference to the lives of people out in the real world. After 
                all, that is our priority.</P>
              <P>The Scottish Executive is committed to providing the promotion 
                of equal opportunities in education for children and young people 
                with disabilities with every chance. We are clear that we want 
                all pupils with disabilities to be able to benefit from the same 
                opportunities in education that their peers have and, as a result, 
                to be given the skills that they need to play a full and active 
                role in society as adults.</P>
              <P>That is why we wanted to advance in the bill the principle that 
                education providers must be </P>

              <P>proactive in developing strategies, so that services for pupils 
                with disabilities meet their needs. At present, many providers 
                tend to react to the needs of each child who attends their school. 
                That approach is perfectly correct and of course providers should 
                continue to use it. Individual needs are important.</P>
              <P>However, we are aware that a growing number of children with 
                a wide range of increasingly complex needs are being placed in 
                mainstream schools and in special school settings. It is important 
                that, in future, we have in place accessibility strategies that 
                aim to ensure that school staff and the facilities and services 
                that they provide are suitable and meet the needs of that range 
                of pupils.</P>
              <P>With this piece of legislation, we are asking people to build 
                on and develop the good practice that is already happening throughout 
                Scotland. The bill will allow education providers to increase, 
                over a period, the number of schools, nursery classes and other 
                education settings that are able to support fully pupils with 
                a variety of disabilities. That will be achieved by the responsible 
                bodies working together, consulting closely those with expertise 
                and those affected by the improvements: school staff, pupils, 
                parents, voluntary organisations, health and social work colleagues, 
                to name but a few.</P>
              <P>We believe that developing the strategies with so many interested 
                groups working together will ensure not only that the strategies 
                are improved and that we get them right, but that we have the 
                opportunity to raise awareness of the implications of the strategies 
                and support for their aims and principles.</P>
              <P>We believe that the bill is realistic. It allows the responsible 
                bodies some flexibility in determining their priorities, according 
                to their pupil populations and how much progress has been made 
                already in developing access. Different authorities will obviously 
                start from different points. However, the bill places a clear 
                statutory duty on those bodies&#151;local authorities and independent, 
                grant-aided and self-governing schools&#151;to plan for the future 
                and to make improvements.</P>
              <P>We are clear that those improvements must cover three broad areas: 
                access to the curriculum, access to the physical environment and 
                communication with pupils. Those areas have been highlighted both 
                today and during the course of members' consideration of the bill. 
                In particular, Jackie Baillie emphasised those areas in her comments 
                on the need to ensure that the bill is not just about school buildings 
                but about how we work with vulnerable children and young people.</P>
              <P>That wide-ranging duty will benefit all pupils, whether they 
                are young people with learning </P>

              <P>difficulties or whether they have physical disabilities. I stress 
                again how important it is that the strategies do not deal with 
                physical access alone. Only a small percentage of people with 
                disabilities require wheelchair access. Therefore, improving access 
                to the curriculum and to communication is as important as improving 
                the physical environment.</P>
              <P>The bill is also about pupil records. We have heard eloquent 
                contributions on some of the difficulties that surround the bill's 
                title and the confusion that that caused in the initial stages, 
                because of the meaning of pupil records and record of needs and 
                the possibility of confusion around that. We were happy to clear 
                up that confusion with our stage 3 amendments.</P>
              <P>The bill is important because it enables us to reinstate an independent 
                right for parents in Scotland to access their children's educational 
                records. Unfortunately, that right was removed when the Data Protection 
                Act 1998 extended data protection legislation to manual records 
                as well as computerised records. We will introduce new regulations 
                under section 4 of the bill, so that parents in Scotland once 
                again will be able to enjoy that right.</P>
              <P>The bill is an important piece of legislation. Again, I thank 
                everyone for their co-operation, which ensured that the bill progressed 
                sensibly, quickly and in a way that will make a difference to 
                people who require support. The bill will advance progress in 
                access in two areas of education. It is part of our continuing 
                strategy to improve the life chances of all young people, particularly 
                those who are vulnerable and have special needs.</P>
              <P>I move,</P>
              <P>That the Parliament agrees that the Education (Disability Strategies 
                and Pupils' Educational Records) (Scotland) Bill be passed.</P>
              <P>15:57</P>
              <P><strong>Irene McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Although 
                the bill is a relatively short and fairly technical piece of legislation, 
                it has the potential to improve significantly the situation for 
                many of the estimated 15,000 children and young people in Scotland 
                with disabilities.</P>
              <P>We welcome the fact that from September of this year all education 
                providers will have to produce, implement and review strategies 
                for improving access in their schools. As we have heard, access 
                covers physical access and access to the curriculum and to information. 
                Crucially, that means that access covers all school activities, 
                not just the core educational elements. The research that was 
                carried out for the Executive by Capability Scotland confirmed 
                that although access to core facilities in schools is high, it 
                is almost non-existent </P>

              <P>for other activities and school trips and is limited in relation 
                to playgrounds and dining halls.</P>
              <P>During stage 2, amendments were lodged on several areas. Some 
                amendments were more successful than others. Many of us were concerned 
                to ensure that the strategies would be effective. We argued that 
                unless a duty to publicise and disseminate the information was 
                imposed on responsible bodies, people who could benefit from the 
                strategies might have no knowledge of their existence. We also 
                sought assurances that effectiveness would be monitored year on 
                year and we were keen that there would be a formal right of remedy&#151;a 
                locally available, accessible complaints procedure.</P>
              <P>I am reassured that the minister has listened to those concerns 
                and has gone some way towards amending chapter 4 of the guidance 
                to strengthen those provisions even more. I remain of the opinion 
                that independent monitoring would be more appropriate, as would 
                some mechanism for enforcement of the strategies, and if we want 
                to be really aspirational, perhaps, in the fullness of time, an 
                education tribunal system for Scotland.</P>
              <P>None of that comes cheap. I remind the minister that resources 
                will be essential to implement the changes that the strategies 
                identify. We have heard from many local authorities that the estimated 
                allocations from the Executive will be insufficient. We note that 
                clarification from the Executive of the funding that will be available 
                to voluntary sector education providers to implement their educational 
                strategies would be appreciated.</P>
              <P>If the bill is to be as effective as it needs to be, there must 
                be training and education on equality issues for teachers and 
                others. We support the ideal of fully inclusive education that 
                gives disabled children and young people access to exactly the 
                same experiences as their non-disabled peers. The bill will help 
                to bring that into effect.</P>
              <P>16:00</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>On 
                behalf of the Conservatives, I am pleased to support the bill 
                after its third stage. I associate myself with the thanks that 
                the minister gave to the clerks and to all those involved in taking 
                the bill to the point where it can be enacted. I am pleased to 
                see a bill that aims to improve access and to restore to parents 
                the right to see the educational records of their children. Who 
                could disagree with that?</P>
              <P>For the sake of brevity, rather than repeat the concerns that 
                have already been expressed, I will pick up a number of different 
                points. I agree with everything that has been said so far by the 
                minister and by Irene McGugan. It is important that </P>

              <P>the appeals process works to the benefit of parents and that 
                the process is clear. It is also important that the communications 
                procedure ensures that people have the necessary information. 
                I welcome the amendments that were agreed to earlier.</P>
              <P>I must say that the Deputy Minister for Education and Young People 
                has taken the occasional bruising when he has appeared before 
                the Education, Culture and Sport Committee. However, in the minister's 
                defence, I always find that he listens intently and seeks to find 
                a resolution. The fact that the amendments were agreed to without 
                division shows that the minister has been willing to work with 
                the committee. I express my thanks to the minister for his approach.</P>
              <P>There was a danger that accessibility strategies would lead to 
                over-regulation and to head teachers and deputy head teachers 
                being tied up in more administration and red tape. However, I 
                believe that the solution that is proposed in the minister's amendments 
                strikes the right balance. For instance, requiring that the Scottish 
                Executive be provided with the accessibility strategies was the 
                right thing to do, as there was a danger that the strategies might 
                have been sent hither and yon, which would have been problematic. 
                It is proper that the strategies should be sent to the minister, 
                whose department can then look at them.</P>
              <P>The one thing that I will say on the important issue of resources 
                is that central Government must appreciate the burden that it 
                must take on. It will be no use to expect local authorities, which 
                raise such a small amount of their income locally, to take up 
                that burden. Given the fact that, quite rightly, the burden has 
                been placed on them, it is proper that central Government ensures 
                that adequate resources are passed on to local authorities to 
                deal with the new responsibilities.</P>
              <P>As well as dealing with access for pupils with disabilities, 
                the bill touches on pupils' educational records, on the history 
                of which I want to make a few comments. As I have said before, 
                the establishment of such records was helped by Alex Fletcher's 
                Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and the School Pupil Records (Scotland) 
                Regulations 1990. As has been said, it is regrettable that parents' 
                rights were removed by the Data Protection Act 1998. It is also 
                regrettable that Sam Galbraith's Standards in Scotland's Schools 
                etc Act 2000 could not have solved the problem or that a Sewel 
                motion was not used when Westminster made the appropriate changes 
                back in 2000. However, that is water under the bridge. We should 
                all welcome the fact that the problem has now been solved.</P>
              <P>I pray that the bill has got it right. The Education, Culture 
                and Sport Committee repeatedly finds that </P>

                That is highly regrettable, causes great irritation and raises 
                a question mark over the standards of drafting of our legislation. 
                We have already had to amend the Standards in Scotland's Schools

              <P>I have no intention of detaining the chamber longer than necessary. 
                I made it clear at stage 1 that the Liberal Democrats support 
                the principles of the bill, both in the establishment of a requirement 
                for responsible bodies to produce strategies that will give disabled 
                pupils access to education&#151;as has been said, that means physical 
                access, access to the curriculum and access to communication between 
                the authorities and the pupils&#151;and in the restoration of 
                parents' rights in relation to pupils' records. I accepted those 
                principles and I welcome the amendments that we have agreed to 
                today, which came in response to the Education, Culture and Sport 
                Committee's comments. In my view, they strengthen the bill.</P>
              <P>I was going to say something nice about the Deputy Minister for 
                Education and Young People, Nicol Stephen, but it might have seemed 
                a bit incestuous. I am delighted that Brian Monteith made kind 
                comments. I thank Cathy Jamieson and Nicol, and indeed the officials, 
                for the way in which they have dealt with the committee's responses 
                to the bill.</P>
              <P>I see the bill as another small but significant step in a range 
                of policies that will lead to more equitable treatment for disabled 
                youngsters across Scotland. In a week that has seen bad publicity

              <P>and because of the Parliament's consensual atmosphere. As somebody 
                else said, although we may occasionally disagree about how to 
                get there, most of the time we agree on where we want to go.</P>
              <P>Like others, I hope that we will remain vigilant in the matter 
                of funding and I worry that, rather like a certain building down 
                the road, the project may well cost more than our original estimates. 
                However, I very much hope that the final result will work well 
                and will do us credit.</P>
              <P>We must ensure that the time scale for the implementation of 
                the strategies and the other items in the policy documents is 
                not open-ended and is not totally elastic. We must see this as 
                a programme to be implemented.</P>
              <P>In our consideration of children with disabilities and special 
                educational needs, good groundwork has been done across the board 
                and a framework for equality of opportunity is beginning to be 
                put in place. Within the next few years, we must begin to make 
                progress in the strengthening of the framework that we have begun 
                to erect in this first session of the Parliament. I am happy to 
                support the words of the minister in opening the debate, and I 
                am therefore happy to support the motion to pass the bill.</P>

              <P><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab): </strong>Just as the 
                chamber unanimously welcomed the principles of the bill, I now 
                welcome the detail of the bill at stage 3. I would like to say 
                a word or two on process before I move to substance.</P>
              <P>Dialogue with the minister at stage 2 resulted in the introduction 
                of a number of helpful amendments, all of which the chamber has 
                accepted. I therefore echo the minister's comments about our beneficial 
                and collaborative way of working. It has been instructive and 
                I look forward to it happening again in future.</P>
              <P>I also echo the thanks that have been given to the clerks, the 
                voluntary organisations and, indeed, the Executive. Many people 
                put a lot of effort into getting us where we are today.</P>
              <P>I want to move on to the substance, which is much more important. 
                What the bill will achieve will be nothing short of a challenge 
                to the way in which education is delivered for the 15,000 or so 
                children and young people who have a disability. My colleagues 
                in the Labour party and I have long held the belief that education 
                is the key to unlocking opportunity in later life. It is not the 
                privilege of the few but a fundamental and basic right for all 
                our children and young people. Access </P>

              <P>to schools and to the school curriculum is critical if disabled 
                children and young people are to be enabled to fulfil their potential.</P>
              <P>The bill brings those key principles together, building on the 
                recommendations of the disability rights task force and the Disability 
                Discrimination Act 1995. As Irene McGugan said, by September 2002, 
                every education provider in Scotland will have to produce an accessibility 
                strategy&#151;addressing not only access to buildings but access 
                to the school curriculum, information and communication.</P>
              <P>Access to mainstream education can now become a reality. Thinking 
                ahead about children's needs and planning for them will become 
                the norm. That is a positive change in the culture. As I said 
                in a previous speech, if we are to achieve the step change in 
                the experience of disabled children in their school years that 
                we all desire, it is essential that we have a robust monitoring 
                and evaluation mechanism. Accessibility strategies will only ever 
                be as good as their implementation. The Executive's proposals 
                on monitoring reassure me that the documents will become living 
                and breathing strategies, rather than be destined to gather dust 
                on a shelf. Given that Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education 
                is involved in monitoring implementation as part of its regular 
                inspection of schools we will know whether it is working on the 
                ground.</P>
              <P>The bill is welcomed by statutory organisations, voluntary organisations, 
                members and, most important, by all parents and children. It is 
                an important step in achieving equality in education for all our 
                children and provides a real opportunity to ensure that we unlock 
                the potential in every child, irrespective of their ability. I 
                urge members to support the bill.</P>

              <P>The important point that I want to make is not a whinge, but 
                a reality. The briefing that Capability Scotland provided to members 
                for the debate, which urges us to support the bill, points out 
                the figures that are at the heart of the issue. It states that 
                the Westminster Government, under</P>
              <P>&quot;the Schools Access Initiative ... has allocated £220 million 
                for 2002-02005; and £100 million for 1999-2002&quot;.</P>
              <P>Capability Scotland estimates that the proper figure for Scotland 
                for 1999-2005 would be at least £32 million, which does not approach 
                the amount that has been allocated. If we want the policy to succeed, 
                we will have to resource it. The simple fact is that we must find 
                the right amount of resources to back the policy.</P>
              <P>In the stage 1 debate, I said that I thought that there would 
                be huge demand and that when people realised what things could 
                be done, they would want them to be done quickly. It is a similar 
                problem to that faced by the Scottish Parliament: there is huge 
                demand and expectations that have not been fulfilled. It would 
                be sad if the expectations of the bill&#151;an important piece 
                of legislation&#151;were not fulfilled, simply for financial reasons. 
                I point out to Mr Jenkins that that is not a whinge but simply 
                reflects what the bodies that know what is happening are saying 
                about the bill. I hope that the minister will think on the matter 
                and if possible indicate during his summing-up speech that some 
                movement will be made on resources. If that is not possible, I 
                hope that the minister will keep thinking about the matter and 
                will issue proposals to resource the policy.</P>
              <P>The bill is an example of the way in which members can work together 
                in the Parliament. Ian Jenkins is right to point out that in a 
                difficult week&#151;our 1000<SUP>th</SUP> day ringing in our ears&#151;it 
                is important to show what the Parliament can do in co-operation 
                with the Executive. The Parliament has co-operated with the Executive 
                on the bill, but there have also been useful tensions and arguments. 
                We have created legislation to help children in Scotland&#151;that 
                is what the Parliament is here to do and that is what we have

              <P>members have identified why it is important. When we come to 
                write the history of the Parliament, we will focus on the small 
                things that have genuinely made a difference to many of the people 
                who have been excluded for far too long. The fact that very few, 
                if any, of the parliamentary journalists are in the press gallery 
                to report on an issue that affects the most excluded in our communities 
                signals to me how important they consider such issues to be compared 
                to the criticism that much-maligned parliamentarians receive when 
                trying to make legislation that will make a difference.</P>
              <P>The fact that members from all parties have contributed to the 
                bill might concentrate the minds of those on the Conservative 
                benches, such as Brian Monteith, on the contribution that 129 
                members can make to debates in the Parliament and to making a 
                genuine difference for the future.</P>
              <P>Jackie Baillie, Irene McGugan and other members of the Education, 
                Culture and Sport Committee have focused primarily on issues relating 
                to the bill. As deputy convener of the committee, I thank them 
                for identifying ways of moving forward at stages 2 and 3. Their 
                gentle, probing words demonstrated the iron-fist-in-a-velvet-glove 
                approach that is the hallmark of Jackie Baillie. I have known 
                that approach in the past, and the Deputy Minister for Education 
                and Young People recognised it during stage 2 debates and responded 
                appropriately this afternoon.</P>
              <P>It is important to monitor the accessibility strategies. The 
                fact that we have set out guidelines on that will be important 
                for the future. At this point in history, we do not know exactly 
                what the impact of the bill will be. However, we will have the 
                answers if over the next three or four years we monitor the extent 
                to which it makes a genuine difference for the individuals whose 
                educational experience it is meant to improve.</P>
              <P>I welcome our recognition of the fact that accessibility strategies 
                need to be engaged with, and that people who are experiencing 
                the negativities of accessibility must be included. All the major 
                organisations and institutions that must provide that accessibility 
                will work in partnership over the next few years to improve the 
                situation immeasurably. I recognise the problem that Capability 
                Scotland raised of ensuring that resources are appropriate to 
                the tasks that are set out in the bill. The committee will endeavour 
                to examine that matter in the coming period. The fact that we 
                have set a template for recommendations will concentrate the minds 
                of the agencies that have to deliver the accessibility strategies. 
                As well as seeking additional resources, they will have to examine 
                their existing resources to see how to reprioritise within their 
                global sum, now that accessibility is enshrined in legislation.

              <P><strong>Murdo Fraser (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>As 
                my colleague Brian Monteith said, the Scottish Conservatives welcome 
                the bill. I have no wish to detain members unduly&#151;I know 
                that we are getting into end-of-term mode&#151;but I have one 
                point to make briefly. It follows on from what I said in the stage 
                1 debate about the costs of implementation. A few other members 
                have also raised that issue. I shall address the costs as they 
                affect independent schools, a number of which I have visited in 
                the past few weeks.</P>
              <P>Independent schools have no problem with the principles of the 
                bill. In fact, many of them have better provision for disabled 
                children than many state schools. However, there is concern over 
                the possible costs of implementation of the bill and the impact 
                on boarding schools especially, of which there are several in 
                Perth and Kinross. The bill follows the recent Regulation of Care 
                (Scotland) Act 2001, which also introduced a burden on independent 
                schools, and there is concern about an on-going march of regulation 
                that may affect their economic viability.</P>
              <P>It would be reassuring if the minister could confirm that no 
                attempt is being made at a back-door assault on independent schools; 
                that the Executive understands that independent schools are an 
                important component of the educational framework in Scotland; 
                and that the Executive supports the right of parents to choose 
                independent schools if they are in a position to do so.</P>
              <P>I close by reiterating that we support the bill.</P>

              <P>welcome the bill. It puts in place an important part of the jigsaw 
                that underpins the presumption of the inclusion of pupils with 
                special educational needs in mainstream schools. It also underpins 
                our long-standing commitment to educate pupils in schools in their 
                communities, which fits in with our signing of the UN Convention 
                on the Rights of the Child and the &quot;Salamanca Statement and 
                Framework for Action on Special Needs Education&quot;.</P>
              <P>Every child has the right to be educated in their community. 
                It is salutary for us to remember that it is only since the 1970s 
                that children have had the right to education. Until the 1970s, 
                many children were categorised as educationally subnormal. Thank 
                God we have come a long way since then.</P>
              <P>The bill places an important duty on education providers. Until 
                now, far too much has been left to chance. Many schools have established 
                policies to ensure that they provide appropriate education for 
                all pupils and many have implemented whole school policies on 
                children with special educational needs. However, that work has 
                often been left to committed senior managers or teachers of children 
                with special educational needs. HMIE has inspected that aspect 
                of schools before, but now it will be able to inspect local authorities' 
                accessibility strategies. It is important that local authorities 
                have a duty to draw up those strategies.</P>
              <P>I agree that accessibility means a lot more than simply physical 
                access. Access to the curriculum is vital. There is no point in 
                children being physically integrated in schools if they are not 
                able to access the curriculum and interact and learn. Being there 
                is not enough&#151;they have to access the curriculum.</P>
              <P>I also welcome the partnership working with parents, pupils, 
                school voluntary sector organisations and a range of other agencies. 
                In future policy documents, warm words will not be enough. There 
                will have to be strategies and action plans and, important, those 
                will have to be monitored and evaluated. We need the framework 
                to ensure that, at last, we can fulfil our policy commitment to 
                include all pupils and ensure that the right of every pupil to 
                be educated in their community is upheld.</P>

              <P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Education and Young People (Nicol 
                Stephen): </strong>I add my thanks to the Education, Culture and 
                Sport Committee, its staff, the bill team, the voluntary organisations 
                and the other interested individuals and bodies that contributed 
                to the progression of the bill through the Parliament. I also 
                thank Brian Monteith for his kind remarks.</P>

              <P>the large number of initiatives that the Executive is implementing 
                to promote equal opportunities for all pupils who have additional 
                support needs. We should remember that there can be short-term 
                needs and long-term and serious disabilities. All needs should 
                be covered.</P>
              <P>I understand the point that members made about funding. The Executive 
                is already providing significant funding for improved provision 
                for children with special educational needs and children with 
                disabilities through funding for inclusion, staff training, research 
                and development and capital investment in schools. At stage 2, 
                the committee discussed the need to integrate initiatives that 
                relate to disability legislation and initiatives that relate to 
                special educational needs legislation. I agree that there is such 
                a need.</P>
              <P>Local authorities are continuing to put all the available funding 
                to good use in providing for pupils with disabilities. The situation 
                will be kept under review and there will be opportunities to inject 
                new funding. At this stage on a Thursday afternoon during a stage 
                3 debate, it would be wrong to make an announcement, but there 
                are opportunities through the inclusion programme, for example, 
                to consider additional sources of funding. It is vital to ensure 
                that strategies deliver. They will achieve nothing if they remain 
                strategies&#151;they must be turned into reality.</P>
              <P>My speaking note does not have the word educational, but I assume 
                that the message will go out that the act will be known as the 
                Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils' Educational Records) 
                (Scotland) Act 2002. I assure members that we will make clear 
                regulations under section 4 of the bill as soon as it becomes 
                an act so that parents in Scotland can once again access the records 
                that schools hold about their children.</P>

              <P>I am two sentences away from the end of my contribution, but 
                I will give way to Mr Monteith.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>It is over a minute from when we 
                are meant to finish.</P>
              <P>I thought that the minister would respond to what Murdo Fraser 
                said about independent schools. I want to add to what he said 
                and ask the minister to respond. One of the concerns about independent 
                schools is that many of them are listed buildings, and often A&#151;listed 
                buildings, such as Fettes College, which many members know well. 
                If buildings are listed, there are difficulties in making physical 
                changes. Financial support will be required. [<I>Interruption</I>.]</P>
              <P><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Things are being thrown at 
                Brian Monteith now.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>That aim was bad. I think that 
                things were thrown at Mike Russell, actually.</P>

              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>The debate has 
                been remarkable in many ways. Will you conclude what you were 
                saying, Mr Monteith?</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>Will it be in order for listed 
                schools to apply to Historic Scotland through the normal process 
                for grant aid to make the necessary physical changes and to use 
                grant aid that would normally be available for general restoration 
                purposes to make various changes?</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>The minister has 
                only 30 minutes left.</P>
              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The short answer to Mr Monteith's 
                question is that I am not sure. I am happy to investigate that 
                issue in respect of independent schools. I will write to Brian 
                Monteith and give him accurate information rather than an off-the-cuff 
                response.</P>
              <P>We have a good relationship with independent schools. I appreciate 
                that there are new burdens for the independent sector&#151;for 
                example, the McCrone settlement is an additional burden and the 
                new probationer scheme is a potential additional burden. The bill 
                also carries additional responsibilities, but the independent 
                sector consistently takes a positive approach because it recognises, 
                as members do, that improvements will benefit the whole of education 
                in Scotland. We welcome that approach.</P>
              <P>I said that I was two sentences away from concluding; in fact, 
                I notice that I am only one sentence away.</P>
              <P>I thank MSPs for their support in driving the bill forward and 
                I hope that members can be further involved in its implementation. 
                It has been a good example of a bill where members from all political 
                parties on the Education, Culture and Sport Committee and on other 
                committees have worked together. That has been reflected in the 
                level of agreement that has allowed us to get through business 
                so swiftly this afternoon.</P>

              <P><I>Motion, as amended, agreed to.</i></P>
              <P><i>Resolved,</i></P>
              <P>That the Parliament notes the importance of transport to the 
                economy in delivering growth and investment to Scotland; welcomes 
                the publication of <I>Scotland's Transport: Delivering Improvements</I> 
                which sets out the Scottish Executive's transport vision for Scotland; 
                endorses this Executive-led vision of an efficient, safe transport 
                system which meets the needs of all in society: individuals and 
                businesses, car and public transport users, cyclists and pedestrians, 
                whilst protecting our environment and promoting sustainable development; 
                commends the integrated package of measures that the Executive 
                is pursuing: tackling congestion, ensuring greater access to a 
                modernised and improved public transport system, promoting alternative 
                modes of transport to the private car, and targeted motorway and 
                trunk roads improvements, and further commends the specific articulation 
                in this transport delivery report of the Executive's top priorities 
                for delivery.</P>
              <P><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>On a point of 
                order, Presiding Officer. I understand the circumstances that 
                led to decision time being brought forward. However, when decision 
                time is brought forward in such a way, would it not be reasonable 
                to give at least five minute's notice, so that MSPs who are in 
                their offices down the road can get to the chamber in time to 
                cast their votes?</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>That might be 
                reasonable, but it is not the procedure that exists. This afternoon 
                I deliberately and carefully drew members' attention to the fact 
                that we were at that stage running 40 minutes early. We in fact 
                finished 29 minutes early. That is the best notice that I am in 
                a position to give. Mr Canavan might wish to write to me about 
                the mechanics of the procedure.</P>
              <P>The next question is, that amendment S1M-2946.2, in the name 
                of Wendy Alexander, which seeks to amend motion S1M-2946, in the 
                name of Annabel Goldie, on enterprise and Scotland, be agreed 
                to. Are we agreed?</P>

              <P>16:39</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>On 
                a point of order, Presiding Officer. Business in the chamber has 
                been brought forward and the members' business debate will now 
                start early. Does that take into consideration attendance at the 
                debate by members of the public, who will believe from the published 
                business bulletin that the debate begins at 5 o'clock and not 
                at 16:39? We are in danger of being exclusive. A number of people 
                whom I know and who intended to attend the debate are not yet 
                in their seats in the public gallery. It is at best ill-mannered 
                of us to proceed with a debate at 16:40, when the debate was advertised 
                in the public domain as beginning at 5 o'clock.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr Murray Tosh): </strong>In 
                relation to this point of order and the previous one, today's 
                business bulletin advised all members that decision time was likely 
                to be early and that members' business would probably be brought 
                forward. I asked earlier today whether the member who had lodged 
                the motion for members' business would be aware of that possibility 
                and whether people who were likely to attend the debate would 
                be aware of that possibility. I was assured that that would be 
                the case.</P>
              <P>I am unable to say whether that was the case, but, as far as 
                I am concerned, the Presiding Officers have done their best to 
                ensure that people who would be attending this debate were aware 
                that the debate would probably be brought forward.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Quinan: </strong>Further to that point of order, Presiding 
                Officer. You referred to the fact that members are informed of 
                the time of the debate in the business bulletin, but I suggest 
                that we should consider the information that is given to the public, 
                because they should take precedence. That is particularly the 
                case for members' business debates, which are primarily for the 
                benefit of members of the public and specific groups. We cannot 
                make decisions about when we will do things when we have previously 
                publicised to the people who put us here that debates will happen 
                at particular times on particular days. We must look seriously 
                at this matter. I move that we suspend this meeting of the Parliament 
                until five o'clock.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>You are not in 
                a position to make that move, Mr Quinan.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Duncan McNeil (Greenock and Inverclyde) (Lab) </strong><I>rose&#151;</I></P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Let me rule on 
                the first point of order, please.</P>

            <TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
              <P>The issue is that the business bulletin is a public document. 
                Invariably, in my experience&#151;which, I admit, is only that 
                of a few months&#151;when a debate is likely to be brought forward, 
                contact is made with the member who lodged the members' business 
                debate motion to ensure that the member is aware of what is proposed. 
                I believe that that was done in this case. It is also generally 
                the case that members of the public who arrange to come to a debate 
                do so through contact with members who are associated with that 
                debate. I am sure that that system is not foolproof, but it is 
                all that is available to me under the existing standing orders.</P>
              <P><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>On a point of 
                order, Presiding Officer.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Mr McNeil previously 
                notified a point of order.</P>
              <P><strong>Mr McNeil: </strong>I have a point of information. The 
                issue of debates being brought forward was discussed in the Parliamentary 
                Bureau, as the Presiding Officer described, and the conclusions 
                were published. The Parliamentary Bureau also agreed that the 
                business managers would inform members who lodged a members' business 
                motion of the possibility of the debate being brought forward, 
                so that they could contact organisations and so on. Perhaps Gill 
                Paterson could inform us whether that action was taken in this 
                case.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>So far, the member 
                who will speak to the motion has not indicated any concern, but 
                that is a matter for him.</P>
              <P><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>Since I made my previous point 
                of order, I have looked again at the business bulletin and checked 
                the exact wording. It says:</P>
              <P>&quot;The Presiding Officer wishes to inform members that, should 
                this afternoon's business conclude prior to 5.00 pm, Decision

              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>The system that 
                we have operated for almost three years is that when we come to 
                the end of business before decision time, we either suspend and 
                await decision time at five o'clock, or we bring forward a motion 
                without notice to hold decision time immediately. There is no 
                precedent for what Mr Canavan suggests. We could consider doing 
                what he suggests, but, so far, the business managers have made 
                no such a request, nor have the Presiding Officers received one.</P>
              <P>I can only suggest that Mr Canavan do what I always do when I 
                am in my office and am aware that business is likely to be brought 
                forward. I have the television on and watch for the closing SNP 
                speaker, knowing that that will give me time to come across to 
                the chamber for decision time. In the absence of any change to 
                standing orders or more formal procedures, I offer that as constructive 
                advice. That is the best that I can do in the circumstances.</P>
              <P><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>That is not good enough.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>If you are not 
                satisfied, the mechanism is that you should put a proposal to 
                the Presiding Officer, which can be discussed by the Parliamentary 
                Bureau or the Procedures Committee. We do not make up rules at 
                twenty to five on the last day before the recess. If you have 
                specific proposals, you can make them in the proper way. You will 
                be entitled to be represented at whatever stage the decision is 
                taken.</P>
              <P><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>For the record, I stress that 
                I am not asking for the rules to be changed but for there to be 
                a more helpful interpretation of the rules.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I can say only 
                that the rules have not been interpreted in that way for the best 
                part of three years. Your request for a change in practice is 
                perfectly appropriate. I invite you to make a formal proposal 
                in the recognised way in which many members make such suggestions.</P>

              <P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr Murray Tosh): </strong>I 
                would now like to begin the members' business debate on motion 
                S1M-2698, in the name of Gil Paterson, on child witness reform.</P>
              <P><I>Motion debated,</I></P>
              <P>That the Parliament welcomes the report <I>Justice for Children 
                - The Welfare of Children in the Justice System</I>; commends 
                Children 1st, Childline, NCH Scotland and the other participants 
                for producing this report, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
                should look closely at the findings and recommendations of the 
                report and act accordingly.</P>
              <P>16:46</P>
              <P><strong>Mr Gil Paterson (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>It 
                would be fitting for me to state that I was given due notice of 
                the likelihood that this debate would take place a bit earlier 
                than expected. We tried to contact as many interested organisations 
                as possible to inform them of that. Nevertheless, I thank my good 
                friend Lloyd Quinan for raising the matter. He was trying to help 
                me and the people who are concerned about the issue.</P>
              <P>I thank some of the organisations who are involved with the report: 
                ChildLine Scotland, Children 1<SUP>st</SUP> and NCH Scotland. 
                I welcome some representatives of those organisations to the debate. 
                I know that the gallery is sparsely populated, but I assure members 
                that some of them are there.</P>
              <P>If I were to suggest that four-and-a-half-year-old children, 
                rather than going to nursery school, primary school and then secondary 
                school, should go straight to university&#151;an adult institution&#151;everyone 
                would think that I was out of my tiny mind. However, we expect 
                our children to cope with the Scottish justice system, which has 
                been developed by adults for adults. Because of that, the concerns 
                and needs of children are not understood or dealt with adequately.</P>
              <P>The criminal justice system is based on the rights of the defendants, 
                which is right, but the needs and rights of victims must be recognised 
                as well. There must be balance. The present system is harmful 
                to children. That has to be accepted by all parties before we 
                can ensure that the rights of all are protected during the criminal 
                justice process.</P>
              <P>I have a number of quotes from children who contacted ChildLine. 
                A 13-year-old said:</P>
              <P>&quot;My uncle raped me 4 years ago. He went to court but was 
                found not guilty. No one believed me. Something else has happened. 
                I'm not telling anyone this time.&quot;</P>

              <P>&quot;Dad hurt mum. Dad's going to court. I'm terrified. I don't 
                want to go against my dad.&quot;</P>
              <P>Another child said:</P>
              <P>&quot;The case was dropped and they haven't told us why.&quot;</P>
              <P>He thinks that it is all his fault and says that he is going 
                to kill himself.</P>
              <P>Children who appear as witnesses feel that they are the accused 
                and that the defence is the prosecution. The effects of adversarial 
                cross-examination of children and their inability to withstand 
                heavy pressure to accept a strongly put and adult version of events 
                is one of the main reasons given for the low prosecution rates 
                and high failure rates of such cases.</P>
              <P>It is time for the Executive to act. The Lord Advocate's department 
                reported on the subject in 1999. Its recommendations are still 
                waiting to be implemented. We are dealing with children's lives, 
                in a way which will shape their future. It is time to take urgent 
                action to ensure that the criminal justice system is responsive 
                to the needs of children and that going to court does not do long-term 
                damage rather than the good that we expect from it.</P>
              <P>The report &quot;Justice for Children: The welfare of children 
                in the justice system&quot; has 10 recommendations that deal with 
                the whole process&#151;not just the children's appearance at court&#151;which 
                is why it is important that the Executive takes notice and acts 
                for the benefit of our children. I will deal with a few of the 
                recommendations. I am sure that my colleagues will deal with a 
                few others.</P>
              <P>The second recommendation calls for standards to be set for any 
                investigations that involve child welfare to ensure that prosecutions 
                do not rely solely on child statement. A high importance should 
                be attached to gathering other evidence that can back up a child's 
                claim, such as the child's behaviour. A high importance should 
                also be attached to ensuring that people who take evidence from 
                children are accredited so that interviews are carried out properly, 
                which ensures that the child is able to give evidence.</P>
              <P>Support for a child before, during and after any investigation 
                or a court case is extremely important. A service such as the 
                child witness support service that was recommended by the Lord 
                Advocate's report should be the basis of support for children 
                and their carers. Therapy prior to trial should be available at 
                point of need as a right; it should not be withheld because it 
                may weaken a case.</P>
              <P>During trial, methods that are presently available should be 
                offered as a right. Evidence by videotape or commission are both 
                currently available but rarely used. Anyone who takes </P>

              <P>evidence from children or cross-examines them must have an understanding 
                of how to deal with children, as it is clearly not the same as 
                dealing with adults.</P>
              <P>In Scotland, our legal system is at times treated like a holy 
                grail. To dare to suggest, as we are, that changes are needed 
                is frowned upon by those with vested interests. The facts speak 
                for themselves. Too often, our criminal justice system lets people 
                down. It is time that changes be made to ensure that the rights 
                of all involved are protected. &quot;Suffer the little children&quot;: 
                when it comes to children, just to take wigs and gowns off is 
                not enough. We must give them the right to give the truth. Justice 
                is not only for adults.</P>
              <P>16:53</P>
              <P><strong>Maureen Macmillan (Highlands and Islands) (Lab): </strong>The 
                subject is a serious one. I know that the Crown Office is taking 
                it seriously indeed and is working at ways to try to protect child 
                witnesses and make them feel that court is not such an ordeal. 
                I will speak about two aspects of that. One is the methods that 
                are used and the other is the premises.</P>
              <P>I do not have a lot of experience of having come across children 
                who have been involved in serious cases&#151;only what I read 
                in the newspapers&#151;but I have spent a lot of time visiting 
                sheriff courts in rural areas and I have been taken aback at how 
                inadequate the provisions for children are. I know that the courts 
                are doing the best that they can, but a lot of the courts are 
                in old Victorian buildings. We find, for instance, that the courtroom 
                has a screen at the side where the child is put if they are going 
                to be a witness. An awful lot of investment must go into dealing 
                with children properly. That investment must be in the structure 
                of the court buildings and taking the child to some other place 
                where they can be talked to.</P>
              <P>As Gil Paterson has said, the adversarial system of Scottish 
                justice is not how we should deal with children. I know that we 
                must test evidence, but we must consider ways of testing it that 
                do not reduce a child to a quivering jelly. It is bad enough for 
                adults to have to go to court. Through Women's Aid, I have known 
                women who, if they had to go to court, were in a high state of 
                nerves. For children, who often do not understand what is going 
                on, it is even worse.</P>
              <P>I do not think that I have taken up my three minutes, but I have 
                a train to catch, so I will stop with these two pleas: that we 
                examine the adversarial system and see what we can do to develop 
                a more child-friendly system. I am pleased to consider the questions 
                of facilities for children within courts and how children are 
                dealt with.</P>

              <P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>Maureen 
                Macmillan managed to say a lot in a few words. I warmly welcome 
                the motion and congratulate Gil Paterson on his success in raising 
                the matter. It is essential that the best interests of children 
                are given paramount importance. It follows that, in cases where 
                children may be witnesses, there must be three aims: to uphold 
                the best interests of the child; to secure the ends of justice; 
                and to ensure fairness to the accused. Those aims should be pursued 
                in harmony with each other.</P>
              <P>I strongly welcome the recommendations of Children 1<SUP>st</SUP>, 
                ChildLine Scotland and NCH Scotland as an important contribution 
                to the debate, in which the Law Society of Scotland, together 
                with the Crown Office, has been closely involved for a considerable 
                time.</P>
              <P>I understand that lawyers from the criminal law committee of 
                the Law Society last year entered into discussions with the Crown 
                Office on the guidance that should be given. Only last month, 
                the Law Society was asked by the Executive to take part in a project 
                relating to the cross-examination of children in court. As long 
                ago as 1995, the then Lord Advocate set up a working group on 
                child witnesses, with the aim of improving arrangements for the 
                support and preparation in court of child witnesses.</P>
              <P>That group made a large number of substantial recommendations 
                in 1999, a number of which have been accepted, and an implementation 
                group has been set up within the Scottish Executive justice department. 
                A small working group has also been created to prepare guidance, 
                which it is hoped will be available by the end of the year.</P>
              <P>When considering this subject, it is necessary to keep in mind 
                the three aims that I have already mentioned. I will give an example 
                of the difficulty that might be experienced. I vividly recall 
                a small child giving evidence in a murder case. Under cross-examination, 
                he admitted that he had made the wrong identification of the accused 
                under pressure from a relative.</P>
              <P>The report &quot;Justice for Children&quot; recognises such problems. 
                Paragraph 42 says:</P>
              <P>&quot;Extreme caution should be exercised in relation to prosecuting 
                a case which relies solely or mostly on a child's statement ... 
                Children, particularly under 12 years do not respond well to, 
                or understand the purpose of, traditional cross-examination. Children 
                are brought up to do what adults tell them. It is very hard for 
                most children to contradict what an authoritative adult tells 
                them is the case ... This observation is not a case for fewer 
                prosecutions, but for a rigorous process of investigation.&quot;</P>
              <P>However difficult it is to take the matter forward, that should 
                certainly be done. I am particularly </P>

                report, &quot;Justice for Children&quot;, which addresses long-standing 
                concerns about the experiences of children in the welfare system.</P>
              <P>Those concerns stem from a recognition that children are different 
                from and are worse off than adults when it comes to contact with 
                the courts. Current legal procedures and practices were not designed 
                with children in mind, despite the fact that children are now 
                recognised as vulnerable witnesses and that some effort has been 
                made in recent years to offer them a degree of protection, for 
                example by the use of television links.</P>
              <P>The proposals in the report are radical, and recognise that such 
                changes are what it will take to safeguard children adequately. 
                The changes are informed by evidence and information from current 
                domestic, European and international best practice.</P>
              <P>Many people fear that changes such as those proposed might interfere 
                with the rights of the accused and that justice might be compromised 
                in some way. I am also aware that there may be resistance to a 
                number of the proposals from members of the legal profession. 
                However, I am confident that there must be a way of achieving 
                justice in both civil and criminal proceedings without damaging 
                the welfare of the child or the legitimate interests of others. 
                Anyone who has had to support a child through the court process 
                will concede that improvements are urgently required, so that 
                children do not have to endure a prolonged wait before their case 
                is called and are not denied access to relevant support or counselling. 
                It should be possible for an assessment to be made of children's 
                ability to give evidence that puts the child's best interests 
                at the heart of that decision.</P>
              <P>I particularly welcome the recommendation that we adopt a collective, 
                multi-agency approach. As the report indicates, that is both possible 
                and necessary. It recognises that improvements affect </P>

              <P>Children who have experienced our justice system are almost universally 
                negative in their view of it. That is reflected in the foreword 
                to the report and should be our guiding principle. It would be 
                a credit to the Parliament if we could show commitment to reforming 
                the current system, with the aim of securing justice while safeguarding 
                the welfare of children.</P>

              <P><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>I, too, 
                congratulate Gil Paterson on securing this debate. I congratulate 
                in particular the group of children's organisations that has produced 
                the report that we are discussing.</P>
              <P>Quite often, reports by enthusiasts go beyond what most people 
                would regard as a reasonable way of dealing with an issue. However, 
                this is a very reasoned report; it makes good suggestions that 
                are in the realm of the possible and the desirable, and that are 
                not extreme. I was particularly taken by the section on studying 
                children's behaviour. The report suggests that children's evidence 
                does not start when they are interviewed, but that by considering 
                their history, body language and so on it is possible to form 
                a view on whether they are telling the truth. People are trained 
                in that art&#151;which would be useful in this chamber. It would 
                be helpful if we could assess better than we can at the moment 
                who is or is not telling the truth in debates. I hope that we 
                can take that on board. It is certainly very important for children.</P>
              <P>Recently we passed a bill relating to evidence given by women 
                who allege that they have been raped. We are now protecting them, 
                so it is logical that we should deal sympathetically with children 
                in the same situation.</P>
              <P>The report contains good material about planning interviews in 
                advance. As I never plan anything in advance, I found that very 
                sensible. I hope that the proposal will be implemented and will 
                try to take lessons from it.</P>
              <P>I was very interested in the idea&#151;which is new to me&#151;of 
                the interviewer acting as an intermediary. The report suggests 
                that other people should be able to participate through whatever 
                technical means are available. They could not all question the 
                child directly, but they could say to the interviewer, &quot;We 
                think you should ask him about X&quot;. I see that as a good idea&#151;for 
                an interviewer to deal with the child one to one, but to have 
                access to other people so that both sides can be seen to be fairly 
                treated. We must </P>

                to being disciplined by making all sorts of allegations against 
                them. We must guard against that, as well as properly safeguarding 
                the rights of children.</P>
              <P>There is an issue of funding, to which the report of the working 
                party led by the Lord Advocate's department referred. No figures 
                are contained in the youth organisations' report. However, if 
                we are to provide proper support&#151;which is an important recommendation 
                of the report&#151;the necessary money must be made available 
                for that. All politicians are prone to have good intentions and 
                to produce nice theoretical schemes, but unless the money is put 
                in, those will be no good.</P>
              <P>The point about having good statistical information is valuable. 
                All of us, in every sphere of public life in Scotland, find that 
                statistical evidence is ghastly. We have a poor system for organising 
                statistics. We have to learn from that when we start a new system, 
                which I hope we will do. Factual information is very important.</P>

              <P><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I 
                congratulate Gil Paterson on securing the debate. A debate on 
                protecting the interests of vulnerable witnesses, particularly 
                children, and the rights of the accused to a trial in which the 
                onus is on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable 
                doubt is difficult to resolve. There are huge difficulties with 
                the adversarial system, but nevertheless, one must test the evidence. 
                I do not know the answer to that difficulty. I hope that we will 
                come to a view on it in the discussions with the Executive that 
                will follow.</P>
              <P>The worst thing that can happen is that a trial collapses because 
                somewhere further down the chain there is not a proper way of 
                addressing the evidence of the child. That is particularly true 
                if the evidence of the child is the only evidence, corroborated 
                by the evidence of other children or if there is minimal corroboration 
                by other circumstantial evidence.</P>

                of all the agencies involved that it proposes right from the beginning 
                of the chain when a crime is investigated. Evidence has to be 
                taken in a sustained and sensitive matter, making it secure. That 
                has to be maintained when the evidence goes to the Procurator 
                Fiscal Service&#151;or Crown Office for more serious crime. We 
                have to consider the assessment of the evidence and how the child

                is put in the position in which everything is unsatisfactory.</P>
              <P>The trial itself should be conducted in a forum in which the 
                best evidence is taken from a child. We must also always bear 
                in mind the interests of the accused. We should consider simple 
                things such as separate witness rooms, which Maureen Macmillan 
                mentioned before she ran for her train.</P>
              <P><strong>Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh (Central Scotland) (Con): </strong>Does 
                the member agree that there are occasions on which it takes a 
                child some time to develop giving their evidence? Does she agree 
                that it would be enormously helpful for us to take cognisance 
                of the time spans that can be involved, because children cannot 
                give evidence quickly?</P>
              <P><strong>Christine Grahame: </strong>I quite agree. That is where 
                we must develop skills and a multi-agency approach. We must take 
                into account the delays in bringing cases to court. How many adults 
                here can remember what they had for dinner this time last week? 
                That might not be a dramatic period of time, but it is hard to 
                think back and a week is a lifetime for a child.</P>
              <P>There are other complexities to consider surrounding the evidence 
                of children. A child might be the victim and prime witness or 
                they might be witness to something else. They might be witness 
                to something involving a member of their family, a trusted friend, 
                priest or teacher. That can make it much more difficult for a 
                child to give evidence when facing the alleged accused in court.</P>
              <P>There is also the matter of what happens post trial. What happens 
                post trial if the accused, who is a member of the child's family, 
                is convicted. What happens if the accused is acquitted? What happens 
                if the case is not proven? So much support has to be given to 
                children in such circumstances. When a child is a witness, we 
                do not want there to be a collapsed trial. It is not in the interests 
                of justice for the child, accused and system to be blighted.</P>
              <P>The question of protecting child witnesses is not an easy one 
                to crack. I am interested to hear what the minister has to say. 
                We must ensure that we have sensitively taken, but robust evidence 
                from children, and just solutions. We must ensure that accused 
                people who have genuinely done the deed are convicted and that 
                the innocent are freed. That is what we have to consider.</P>

              <P>Like Donald Gorrie, I was pleased that the Parliament has been 
                able to deal with one category of vulnerable witness&#151;complainers

                to do for children, who are in another category of vulnerable 
                witnesses.</P>
              <P>Personal experience always reinforces a general point. Let me 
                give what is, to be honest, a trivial example from my own life. 
                When I was about seven or eight, I was sitting on the front wall 
                when a bus gently reversed into a car at about 5mph. A policewoman 
                interviewed me because there was a dispute between the drivers 
                over who was responsible for the incident. It is a tribute to 
                how impressionable I was that, when someone in authority and in 
                a uniform came to see me, I was quite confused and disturbed by 
                the questioning process. I still remember that, despite the fact 
                that it was a trivial incident in which I was not involved&#151;I 
                was merely a spectator. How much more traumatic is such questioning 
                for a child, of whatever age, who has been involved in an incident 
                that eventually leads to a court case?</P>
              <P>Members will know of my constituency interest in HMP Peterhead, 
                which contains around 200 paedophiles and 300 sexual offenders 
                in total. A prison officer told me a story that illustrates the 
                subtle ways in which children can be affected and influenced by 
                what goes on in their lives. The story concerns a child who had 
                been through the justice system and whose father had been convicted, 
                quite properly. Toward the end of the sentence, a reconciliation 
                interview took place and both child&#151;by this time, a late 
                teenager&#151;and father were brought together. The father sat 
                and talked in a friendly way with his daughter, but throughout 
                the interview he clicked a pen. At the end of the interview, when 
                the father was taken away, the daughter broke down in tears because 
                the father had used a pen to abuse her. Sometimes the signals 
                between adult and youth are subtle and not understood by us.</P>
              <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the subject of justice in 
                the criminal justice system, particularly when the Crown Office 
                and Procurator Fiscal Service is under close attention. We will 
                debate the detail of that on another occasion, but in the review 
                of resources in the COPFS, there is a recognition at paragraph 
                1.4.4 that special skills are required when one is dealing with 
                child witnesses. However, I note in passing that the vision and 
                objectives of the COPFS make no reference to children as a group 
                that the service should be paying particular attention to.</P>

              <P><strong>Dr Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands) (SNP): </strong>In 
                my previous life as a practitioner in the criminal courts, I once 
                cross-examined a child witness on a matter that was vital to the 
                innocence of my client. I happened to believe my client, although 
                that is irrelevant. In the middle of the cross-examination, the 
                child fainted and crashed to the floor, hurting her head. The 
                accused begged me to stop the cross-examination, which I did. 
                Thereafter, when I had the choice&#151;if one was doing one's 
                service on the poor roll, one could not choose to turn cases away&#151;I 
                never again took on a case in which I would have to cross-examine 
                a child, because I found it a traumatic experience. I still live 
                through that moment.</P>
              <P>I will mention the famous Orkney case, which is another case 
                in which witnesses were wrongly interpreted and in which children 
                were removed from their parents. I was deeply involved in that 
                case and tried to gather all the evidence that I could. The sheriff 
                who finally dealt with the case was very critical of the way in 
                which the children's evidence had been gathered by the Royal Scottish 
                Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Whatever system 
                we adopt, I point out that that was not a system that worked. 
                It turned out that the plot of a fairly lewd and horrible video 
                that had been doing the rounds&#151;probably illegally, given 
                that the children were under age&#151;was transposed into a story 
                that was then shared by a number of the children.</P>
              <P>That situation ended up in utter misery for a poor minister&#151;who 
                was absolutely got at by the press&#151;for the parents and for 
                the children. Eventually, the children were returned. Their evidence 
                was roundly criticised. I met all the children and parents afterwards 
                and have met them since from time to time. There was no doubt 
                that they would be affected for the rest of their lives. Therefore, 
                the gathering of evidence is crucial.</P>
              <P>I agree with Lord James Douglas-Hamilton on the idea of taking 
                evidence on video or by a separate commission. We must opt for 
                that. Knowledge of the Orkney case&#151;a travesty from beginning 
                to end, which caused a great deal of human misery&#151;is enough 
                to make me support Gil Paterson's intentions all the way.</P>

              <P>&quot;Justice for Children&quot; report and I congratulate Gil 
                Paterson on drawing the report to the Parliament's attention. 
                I participated considerably in members' business debates when 
                I was a back bencher and I still believe that they represent one 
                of the most important parts of the Parliament's function. They 
                allow serious discussion of serious issues in a less partisan 
                way.</P>
              <P>The report's central theme is that the best interests of children 
                should be at the heart of our justice system&#151;criminal and 
                civil. The Executive and, in particular, the First Minister have 
                said that the welfare of children&#151;especially children under 
                pressure&#151;must be at the centre of what we do. The report 
                picks up some of the key themes that the Executive is attempting 
                to address.</P>
              <P>The points that Christine Grahame and Lord James Douglas-Hamilton 
                made, which were referred to in passing by Winnie Ewing, are important. 
                We are dealing with a matter of balance. As the right balance 
                is incredibly difficult to achieve, there have been delays, which 
                have sometimes been regarded as rather lengthy, in achieving what 
                we all seek&#151;justice for the accused and sensitive handling 
                of the children in all respects. We agree that balance is key.</P>
              <P>The report stresses the importance of effective inter-agency 
                working within a properly structured framework. That is crucial.</P>
              <P>As a doctor, I was involved in interviewing children about quite 
                significant issues. There are problems in interviewing children&#151;as 
                Winnie Ewing suggested, it is not an easy task to undertake. However, 
                if children are given the right set of circumstances, they can 
                be very reliable witnesses. Although we should not suggest that 
                children are less reliable, they can be made to be unreliable 
                if the questioning is inappropriate. The report stresses the importance 
                of having the right range of options available to those who deal 
                with children. It should be possible for child witnesses to give 
                evidence in a way that allows them to be questioned fairly by 
                the defence, without the experience being frightening or confusing.</P>
              <P>The report also underlines that cases that involve children should 
                be given priority throughout the process of case preparation and 
                presentation. Irene McGugan referred to the fact that it is not 
                just the event that is important&#151;everything that goes before 
                it matters. Teachers and psychologists are involved in establishing 
                the capacity of children to deal with the way in which cases are 
                presented. There is a great deal of common ground on priorities 
                for action.</P>
              <P>The issue is not new. I think that the Scottish Law Commission 
                reported on it as long ago as 10 years ago. Plotnikoff carried 
                out research in 1995 and Gil Paterson quoted some horrifying examples

              <P>of practice that needed to be addressed. The Lord Advocate's 
                working party, which reported in 1999, made some 32 recommendations. 
                We have implemented four of those. More important, we are progressing 
                the work, although there was a delay in starting the process because 
                of the pressure that the department has been under on such matters 
                as the Sexual Offences (Procedure and Evidence) (Scotland) Bill. 
                I am not sure that that represents a correct set of priorities. 
                However, we are making progress.</P>
              <P>The implementation group, which is a multi-agency group, got 
                under way in September 2001. Children 1<SUP>st</SUP> and NCH Scotland 
                are involved in the process and their contribution is greatly 
                appreciated. The group is working through three sub-groups. One 
                sub-group is examining improved operational support for child 
                witnesses and is preparing a paper for ministers' consideration 
                on the options for organising that support. We intend to consult 
                more widely before reaching final decisions. That group is looking 
                at recommendations 1, 4 and 5 of &quot;Justice for Children&quot; 
                and at recommendations 1 and 3 of the Lord Advocate's working 
                group report.</P>
              <P>The second group is preparing national guidance to improve the 
                quality of investigative interviews with children. Before that 
                guidance is finalised, there will be consultation with key organisations. 
                Any guidance that is issued will be made widely available on the 
                web. The second group is dealing with recommendations 3 and 8. 
                The planning interviews that Donald Gorrie mentioned are also 
                part of the working group's efforts.</P>
              <P>We are also about to publish a report on vulnerable witnesses 
                which, although not dealing specifically with children, will deal 
                with issues that overlap and can be read across.</P>
              <P>We are working on guidance on the questioning of children in 
                court. That work is closely linked to the separate work on vulnerable 
                witnesses that I referred to. A consultation looking at the definition 
                of vulnerable persons will be published towards the end of April. 
                The consultation will also consider what current and future special 
                measures could be taken to make it easier for all who need extra 
                support in giving evidence.</P>
              <P>In addition to the three sub-groups and the central group, which 
                are examining all the recommendations, other groups are considering 
                the matter. For example, Gil Paterson referred to recommendation 
                2, which concerns the standards that should be set for the investigation 
                of cases. That is a matter for the Lord Advocate, but detailed 
                guidance is given in chapter 16 of the Crown Office and Procurator 
                Fiscal Service's book of regulations. The Lord Advocate is looking 
                at the matter.</P>

              <P>Recommendation 10 is that specialist training should be undertaken, 
                but there are specialist training courses already. Indeed, Crown 
                counsel attended one such course last weekend, as they do each 
                year. The Law Society of Scotland has also been involved in training. 
                The provision of such training for judges and sheriffs is a matter 
                for the judicial studies committee, but it is clearly important 
                that people who question and manage children have the appropriate 
                training to deal with those difficult issues.</P>
              <P>A great number of areas of work are being taken forward. I can 
                give my colleagues an undertaking that I will press the issue 
                with the greatest possible urgency. However, we need to be careful 
                that we strike the balance that I referred to. My colleagues Jim 
                Wallace and Cathy Jamieson have agreed to meet representatives 
                of the three organisations that sponsored the report so that we 
                can explore their ideas in more depth. However, members will understand 
                that we also need to take into account the views of others.</P>

              <P>There is no doubt that the First Minister, the Executive and 
                the Parliament have all made dealing with our children a priority. 
                If one child is traumatised and damaged by an insensitive justice 
                system, that is one child too many. Some of the examples that 
                were given by Stewart Stevenson, Winnie Ewing and others indicate 
                how difficult this area is and how sensitively it must be handled.</P>
              <P>I will end as I began, by thanking Gil Paterson for initiating 
                the debate. I also thank the organisations for their helpful report. 
                Their report has a read-across to the Lord Advocate's report and 
                to the work that we are doing. Their report has helped me to focus 
                on the way in which we are taking matters forward. The debate 
                has been up to the usual high standard of members' business debates. 
                We will attempt to get the right answers for the children of Scotland 
                in the near future.</P>
              <P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>That concludes 
                the debate on child witness reform. I wish all of you a happy 
                Easter break.</P>
