(Lothians) (SNP): </strong>On a point of order, Mr Deputy Presiding Officer.
Could you give me some advice on procedural matters? They arise out of
the message from the Presiding Officer in business bulletin No 7. According
to that very thoughtful message-I am not sucking up-Mr Gorrie's motion
on the Holyrood Parliament site is unlikely to be taken until after the
Parliamentary Bureau has met. I ask the First Minister, or the person who
is sitting in his chair, for an assurance that no more public contracts
will be signed until the Parliament has had the chance to see a review
of the current position.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George

on the matter.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</strong>May<strong> </strong>I too seek some procedural advice from you? Yesterday a
number of us pressed the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning
on the issue of the publication of concordats. We were told that it was
unclear when they would be published. This morning, I read in <i>The Herald</i>
details about one of the concordats, in relation to the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office-a concordat and gentleman's agreement between the First Minister
and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. What procedural
advice can you give me about how this matter can be addressed and how this
Parliament can be treated with more respect and courtesy than the contempt
it is receiving from the Executive?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> The
member should be careful of using points of order as points of argument,
but I indicate to him that the whole matter of parliamentary privilege
will be considered by the Standards Committee prior to bringing forward
recommendations on a code of conduct for members.</font></td>

formally move only the first of the motions at this stage but will speak

I will ask Mr McLeish formally to move his second motion before questions

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning (Henry McLeish): </strong>Before going into the details of the two
orders, I will try to put them into context. The white paper "Scotland's
Parliament" of 1997 recognised, in paragraph 2.10, that there would be
areas where public bodies with a UK or GB remit operate in devolved areas.
It will be for the Scottish Parliament to decide whether to put in place
separate Scottish bodies, but we should recognise the advantages of current
arrangements that allow sharing of knowledge and expertise and greater
efficiency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Section 88 of the Scotland Act provides
mechanisms for cross-border public authorities to be specified. Some 65
such bodies have been identified. Section 88 provides for them. Scottish
ministers will have the right to be consulted on membership and on other
functions relating to such bodies, as the white paper set out. Section
88 also gives Parliament the chance to scrutinise reports of the bodies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

case examination of bodies and for transferring additional functions to
the Scottish ministers, or otherwise adjusting the basic position provided

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">section 88. That
is what the present order does. It also offers an opportunity to move forward,
with Westminster, to put in place suitable arrangements for cross-border
public authorities that will give UK and Scottish ministers and the two
Parliaments appropriate control.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;I would like to commend-perhaps surprisingly-the
guidance notes that have been published on two of the orders, which, unlike
some guides that I have read, are reasonably straightforward and put into
a wider context the orders that we are discussing. The guide on cross-border
authorities identifies the 30 bodies in question and goes through the type
of consultation and the type of decision making that will apply to each
of them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will speak first to the draft Scotland
Act 1998 (Cross-Border Public Authorities) (Adaptation of Functions etc.)
Order 1999. The purpose of this order is to put in place customised arrangements
for the control and accountability of certain public authorities that have
been specified as cross-border public authorities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section 88 of the Scotland Act 1998 has
been used to designate a number of authorities as cross-border public authorities.
They are bodies, Government departments, offices or office holders with
mixed functions, in that some of their functions relate to devolved matters
in Scotland and some do not. Examples include bodies such as the Forestry
Commissioners, which deal with devolved matters in Scotland and England
and Wales. Another example is the Scottish Committee of the Council on
Tribunals which, although operating only in Scotland, deals with both reserved
and devolved matters.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is worth noting that the border to which
I refer, in talking about cross-border public authorities, need not be
the geographical border between Scotland and England. Rather, those bodies
are partly within devolved Scotland and partly not. Because of that, certain
of the general provisions of the Scotland Act 1998-in particular, the provisions
on the transfer of ministerial functions-could cause problems when they
are applied to such bodies. As I will explain, designation of such a body
as a cross-border public authority, under section 88 of the Scotland Act
1998, is designed to address those problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scotland Act 1998 (Cross-Border Public
Authorities) (Specification) Order 1999, which was made by Her Majesty
in Council on 11 May, specifies 65 cross-border public authorities. Specification
as a cross-border public authority applies what might be called the default
provisions in section 88 of the Scotland Act 1998. That means-and I stress
this-that the ordinary transfer of ministerial functions, under section
53 of the Scotland Act 1998, is disapplied to functions&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">which are specifically
exercisable in relation to the authority, such as powers to give directions
specifically to that authority.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scottish ministers will not, therefore,
automatically acquire such functions in connection with the authority.
However, ministers of the Crown must, in such cases, consult Scottish ministers
before exercising certain functions in relation to the body-in particular,
powers of appointment or removal of members of the authority or functions
which might affect Scotland otherwise than wholly in relation to reserved
matters. Requirements for reports relating to the authority to be laid
before Parliament are now extended so that the reports are also to be laid
before the Scottish Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section 89 of the Scotland Act 1998 goes
further. It provides a wide-ranging power to make provision, by Order in
Council, in relation to a cross-border public authority. The default provisions
in section 88 can be adjusted by an order under section 89. The draft order
that is before us today uses that power to supplement or replace the default
provisions for 30 cross-border public authorities. The provision that is
made for each authority is tailored to that authority, and it is not possible
to describe those arrangements fully in general terms. However, the general
theme of the order is to give the Scottish ministers and the Scottish Parliament
greater control than is afforded by the default arrangements. That means,
for example, providing for certain functions to be exercised by the Scottish
ministers rather than by a minister of the Crown.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;For the assistance of members, we
have prepared a guide to the order, which sets out the background to each
of the bodies that are dealt with in the order and explains the overall
effect on them of the Scotland Act 1998 and the order. That was the guide
to which I referred earlier. As I said, I think that in this constitutional
context the guide is a reasonable read, which is quite surprising.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It may be helpful to members if I cite
one example. One of the more important authorities that is dealt with in
the order is the Forestry Commissioners. Forestry is a devolved matter.
Decisions on forestry in Scotland will therefore be taken by the Scottish
ministers and the Scottish Parliament. Nevertheless, in devolving forestry
it would be a mistake to abandon structures that have served the forestry
sector well for so many years. Allowing the Forestry Commission to continue
to operate on a Great Britain-wide basis will ensure that Scotland, England
and Wales can take advantage of access to shared knowledge and expertise,
and will ensure greater efficiency in the use of resources. It is for those
reasons that the Forestry Commissioners have been specified as a cross-border
public authority. The devolution&nbsp;</font></td>

means that the powers of the forestry ministers over forestry in Scotland
will transfer to the Scottish ministers. Responsibility for financing the
commission's activities in Scotland will also be transferred.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The primary intention of the order is that
the power of direction over the commission currently exercised by the Secretary
of State for Scotland should transfer to the Scottish ministers in relation
to the exercise by the commission of its functions as regards Scotland.
The Scottish Parliament will also be responsible for funding forestry in
Scotland. The order provides for the Scottish activities of the commission
to be funded out of the Scottish consolidated fund and similarly for proceeds
from the commission's activities in Scotland to be paid into the Scottish
consolidated fund.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The order makes sensible provision to ensure
that cross-border public authorities can continue to operate after 1 July
with appropriate input and control for the Scottish ministers and for the
Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I come now to the Scotland Act 1998 (Border
Rivers) Order 1999.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The border between Scotland and England
crosses the Tweed and Esk rivers. Unless otherwise addressed, that would
have meant that legislative responsibility for fishery matters in those
rivers would have been split between this Parliament and Westminster. Most
members of this Parliament would agree that that would have been a ludicrous
state of affairs. Fish are obviously no respecters of national borders
and it would have been bizarre to contemplate the prospect, however remote,
of conservation measures being taken on one side of the border and free
exploitation on the other.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What section 111 of the Scotland Act 1998
therefore provides is the scope for whole-river management of the two rivers
by this Parliament and by Westminster, acting by means of Orders in Council,
of which this is the first.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In essence, the order before us does several
things. First, it allows the continuation of the status quo in management
terms. In other words, the Tweed throughout its length will continue to
be regarded as essentially a Scottish river, managed by the River Tweed
Council. For its part, the Esk will continue to be regarded, throughout
its length, as an English river and, as such, it will be regulated by the
Environment Agency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, the order clarifies the powers
of the Environment Agency in relation to the Esk, places an obligation
on the Environment Agency to provide an annual report of its activities
to this Parliament, and enhances enforcement powers.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thirdly, the order
seeks to address the age-old problem of fishery rights in the Solway where
the Esk tends to meander, sometimes to the north of the border that runs
down the middle and sometimes to the south. In brief, the order allows
Scots netsmen to fish out to the middle of the Esk from the north side
and English netsmen to fish out to the middle of the river from the south
side, regardless of the position of the river at the time. The proviso,
of course, is that the netsmen must be properly licensed or authorised
to do so. That is obviously a matter of vital importance. None of this
affects the exclusive right of the good people of Annan to fish within
what is known as the Annan box, bestowed on them by royal charter in the
16<sup>th</sup> century.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All of this, I think, demonstrates our
commitment to the principle of whole-river management for the two border
rivers. At the same time, it offers proof, if proof was needed, of the
democratic accountability of the process to those on either side of the
border with fishery interests in the rivers. The key part of this order
is to ensure that there is consistent management of both rivers, north
and south of the lines that we have identified.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I commend these orders to the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that that general welcome is accepted
in the spirit in which it is given. One might call it the spirit of the
new politics, although the fact that there is no common definition of the
new politics seemed to affect yesterday's debate. Perhaps members could
move towards making such a definition, rejecting Mr McAllion's definition
of new politics as being about Opposition members simply keeping their
mouths shut. The Opposition has a duty to welcome progress and to scrutinise

other than mere abuse? It should involve listening to what people have
to say in context. To be honest, new politics is not about people simply
agreeing with one's views. It is about taking seriously what everybody
has to say. That does not mean that debate cannot be robust. Mr McAllion's
contribution was certainly robust, but it was also fair and hard-hitting.
It is rather disappointing, therefore, that Mr Russell has taken only one
phrase from it. That is not new politics; that is old abuse.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>I will accept Johann
Lamont's definition of the new politics as being where we have consensus
and we work together. The basis of consensus is, of course, consultation.
The issue that we were debating yesterday was that there was no consultation.
I had the advantage of seeing Mr McAllion's performance from the front,
whereas Ms Lamont had the disadvantage of seeing it from the back. It was
not only the words, but the spirit of what he said that was the problem.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The general welcome that I give to the
orders does not exclude detailed scrutiny of them. This order has notable
omissions. I yield to no one in my enthusiasm and support for the controller
of plant variety rights. I have no doubt-and I speak as someone who once
worked for the Scottish Bedding Plants Association-that the work of the
plant varieties and seeds tribunal is extremely important, but I would
have thought that there were other bodies that required consideration because
they work in reserved areas across both Parliaments and meet the definition
given in the white paper of being bodies operating in reserved areas in
relation to their activities in or affecting Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is interesting to note that the white
paper-published, it seems, so long ago now-listed a number of other bodies
that have not made it into the order. Those bodies include the energy regulators;
the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising; the Health and Safety Commission;
the Commission for Racial Equality, which wanted to be considered in this
way; the Employment Service; the Benefits Agency; the Post Office and broadcasting
and telecommunications organisations such as the BBC and the Independent
Television Commission.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For schedule 1 to the order to omit those
bodies is to produce a piece of legislation that is seriously defective.
Those bodies affect the everyday life of everyone in Scotland. All the

invite representations from all those bodies. The controller of plant varieties
can come and talk to us, but it is a deficiency of the order that he cannot
be required to come and give evidence and tell us the truth of what is
happening. I am sure that an invitation from Mr Dewar or Mr McLeish or
even Mr McConnell is not something to be treated lightly, but it would
be much more important if the Parliament and its committees could say,
"We require you to attend" and, "We require you to give information on
what is happening."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will confine my comments to broadcasting.
It was clear from last year's debate on the Scottish Six that it would
be vitally important for the Parliament to question those making the decisions.
Some of the people in this chamber were present at the BBC governors' dinner,
which was held in Glasgow at the end of the governors' meeting last year.
That was a remarkable event. Those who were invited were soft-soaped with
warm words by a hard-faced group of people who had already made up their
minds about what was going to happen. No amount of debate or discussion
would make any difference. What actually happened was that there was no
real consultation. The Broadcasting Council for Scotland made its views
known, and was ignored. The political parties in Scotland made their views
known, and were ignored, as were the listeners and viewers organisations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Virtually the whole of civic Scotland argued
for some change in the way that the BBC treated Scotland. What they got
was a typical BBC fudge-the offering of something that is referred to north
and south of the border as "Newsnet". It is an appalling way to treat audiences
in Scotland, because it removes that programme of great quality, "Newsnight".
It denies part of that programme to the Scottish audience while substituting
something else. That is an unacceptable compromise, and it is not I who
says it, but the broadcasters who work on those programmes. The committee
of this Parliament that is responsible for broadcasting should be able
to call the chairman of BBC Scotland, or the director general of the BBC,
or any of those responsible for similar decisions and to scrutinise the
decisions as they are made.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The failure to give this Parliament the
power to demand attendance is a major weakness of this order. That applies
right across the spectrum. I am glad that many of the Liberal Democrats
agree that the Parliament should have this basic right. It also applies
to the ITC. Some members are concerned that the honouring of licences in
certain places in Scotland has not come up to public expectation. In such
circumstances it would be vital to demand the attendance of officials from
the ITC to examine them on the issue. That is a major&nbsp;</font></td>

be given to some of these issues, both in terms of the bodies that touch
our lives but which are not in the order and in terms of ensuring that
this Parliament can be an effective voice for the people of Scotland. I
hope that it will not be a Parliament that receives the odd annual report
or letter from the director general, but one which can ask him what is
going on, and ensure that he understands the strength of opinion and passion
in Scotland for the Parliament to work.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>The Conservatives go along, in the main, with Mr McLeish's comments,
but-if the chamber will bear with me-I seek clarification on a number of
the schedules.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Schedule 9 to the order on cross-border
authorities refers to the Council on Tribunals. We very much welcome the
passing of control of the tribunals to the Scottish Parliament, but we
have some concerns about industrial tribunals in particular, especially
given the weird and wonderful decisions that they have made recently. How
much control will the Parliament have over the make-up of the chairmen's
panels? Will changes be made in the methods of taking and recording evidence?
We feel that that is necessary. If the statute gives us that right, we
applaud it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A number of questions arise from schedule
10, which concerns criminal injuries. Under paragraph 2 of part II, the
adjudicator will be either the secretary of state or the Scottish ministers,
but who will have the final say? Who is the authority? If there is a dispute,
who will make the decisions? A similar problem arises with net expenditure,

Scottish ministers may make payments on Scottish issues, but is there a
choice? Once again, where does the money come from? Is this a change of
status and will the order in effect lead to a reduction in the block grant?
There is another aspect to that, because the involvement of the Scottish
police service would benefit NCIS. We wonder whether there is some direct
means of re-injecting cash back into the Scottish police force rather than
paying the money to the Secretary of State for Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On schedule 21, we are aware that there
will be much support for the retention of the UK-wide agreement on police
pay scales, which is almost certainly necessary if we are to maintain harmony
and co-operation among the police forces across the UK. The retention of
the agreement would without doubt be welcomed by the Scottish Police Federation
and the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One or two queries come to mind with regard
to cross-border policing and the powers of arrest of the English and the
Scottish forces, particularly when a crime is committed in Scotland and
Scottish policemen pursue the criminal. When they cut across the border,
what powers will be left for the English police to apprehend the criminal
and assist the Scottish police on what has become a cross-border matter?
I believe that we have nothing to worry about, but I seek assurances because
some concerns may arise about the matter.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is all very well to talk about pay structures
and pay negotiations for Scottish police officers, but recent statements
in the press have given rise to concerns about the structures in which
they serve. One of the Scottish nationalists recently referred to a reduction
in the number of police forces. Currently, Scotland has eight police forces
and the suggestion in the press was that the number would be reduced to
three. My understanding is that the secretary of state suggested, about
a year ago, that there would have to be a review of police structures.
Since then, some negotiations have taken place with various interested
parties and I understand that a steering committee has been established.
I welcome that, but one year on from the secretary of state's statement,
which referred to a comprehensive spending review that would examine only
the costing of the police service, I ask the minister whether the way in
which the police service carries out its duties is now being looked at.
How many times has the steering committee met? Is it making positive progress?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>Much
of the advance publicity for today's debate was about the motion on the
Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order and I understand the Scottish
fishing community's concern and anger about the effects of that order.
However, there is also understandable concern about the future of freshwater
fishing in Scotland and I am particularly concerned about the effects of
the Scotland Act 1998 (Border Rivers) Order 1999 on salmon and freshwater
fisheries in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A letter, sent to me by a former Lord Advocate,
gives an excellent statement of the common-law position in Scotland on
freshwater fishing. I will quote from that letter, because it is important
that the statement is put on the Scottish Parliament's official record
at an early date:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The common law position in relation to
both salmon and trout is that they are not the property of anyone until
they are caught. Thus, brown trout in waters not protected by an order
under the Freshwater and Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act 1976 do not belong
to anyone whilst they are in the water but become the property of the fisherman
or person who catches and lands them whether or not that person owns the
fishing rights and whether or not permission has been given."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Since that letter was sent to me on 8 April
1981, it has been photocopied hundreds, possibly thousands, of times and
has been used as an excellent defence by many Scottish anglers when they
have been challenged by irate landowners, who try to chase them off the
land and refuse them the right to fish the waters of Scotland. Lest anyone
thinks that the letter was written by some left-wing, revolutionary lawyer,
it should be noted that it was signed by James Mackay-Lord Mackay of Clashfern-who
was a very distinguished Conservative Lord Advocate and, later, Lord Chancellor.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Lord Mackay gave the common-law position
in that letter but, of course, in salmon fishing the common law has been
overridden for many years in Scotland by statute law. It was not until
the Freshwater and Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act 1976 was passed that
it became a criminal offence to fish for brown trout in protected waters.
Sadly, since 1976 there has been a succession of protection orders covering
many of the rivers, burns and lochs of Scotland. Although the spirit, and
the declared intention, of the act was that there should be more protection
in return for&nbsp;</font></td>

that has not happened. Many anglers complain about a decrease in access
as a result of the act.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am reliably informed that the River Esk-which
flows into the Solway firth and is covered by the Scotland Act 1998 (Border
Rivers) Order 1999-is not governed by any protection order. That is true
of both the Upper Esk and the Lower Esk. I also understand-this seems to
have been confirmed by the minister's opening remarks-that since 1865 the
River Esk has been run as if it were an English rather than a Scottish
river, as it is in part. I am concerned because this statutory instrument
gives new powers to the Environment Agency-that is the Environment Agency
south of the border-to make byelaws on fishing in the Upper Esk. The order
creates a new offence of unauthorised fishing in the Lower Esk, gives power
to water bailiffs to enforce the new provisions and extends the existing
powers of water bailiffs and other authorised persons to the whole of the
River Esk-in both the Scottish and English parts of the river. The order
also creates new offences that are applicable to the powers of water bailiffs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Even before this statutory instrument came
before us, concern was expressed in many parts of Scotland about the extension
of criminal law to freshwater fishing. That concern is understandable if
we bear in mind the fact that angling is probably the most popular participatory
sport in Scotland. Most responsible anglers do not want a free-for-all;
they realise that there must be control. However, control of things such
as access, pricing, stocking and the management of freshwater fisheries
ought to be democratic.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have said many times in the House of
Commons that there should be a democratically constituted Scottish anglers
trust to administer all freshwater fishing rights in Scotland. I hope to
have an opportunity at a later date to speak about that in greater detail-possibly
when legislation on it is introduced in this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

in, shouting, waving our hands in the air and bobbing up and down like
a river full of demented corks. We all said that we wanted the Scottish
Parliament to display a new style of politics, so it is up to us to make
that happen. I do not feel that we achieved it yesterday.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I must confess that, at first, I misread
the order and understood that it concerned the Border reivers, which might
have been a little more colourful. However, the order is necessary because
it outlines the joint responsibilities of UK and Scottish ministers and
Parliaments in respect of rivers and estuaries that flow across the border
between Scotland and England. It modifies the Environment Act 1995, which
relates to the conservation, management and exploitation of salmon, trout,
eels and freshwater fish. It requires agreement to be reached between Scottish
and UK ministers and gives the Environment Agency new powers to make byelaws
in connection with such matters.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Mr Canavan said, the order creates a
new offence of unauthorised fishing in the Lower Esk that can be enforced
by water bailiffs. Angling is a popular sport but it does not need to be
managed for the sake of fish stocks. The order does not take away current
legal rights to fish for salmon-I am sure that my constituents in the burgh
of Annan, who were granted that right by royal charter by James V on 1
March 1538 will welcome that. The order refers to the burghers of Annan-however,
those who make the excellent decision to visit that lovely and historic
area should be aware that Annan is actually better known for the fine quality
of its fish and chips than for its burgers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The order also clarifies the rights of
Scottish fishermen to fish in any part of the Lower Esk that lies on or
to the north of a line in the main channel of the River Esk that represents
what is called the medium filum-which I presume is the mid-point-at low
water. I am not sure whether that line in the middle of the Esk also defines
the boundaries of my constituency. If it does, I will not take up any challenge
from my colleagues to walk around the perimeter of my constituency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

opposite a noble residence, studiously ignored by everyone save a few distant
onlookers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Canavan has some misconceptions about
freshwater fishing. What he must understand about the order is that it
allows the management of the whole Tweed river system, including those
bits that are within England. However, a more important point is that more
than 90 per cent of fishable water for brown trout on the Tweed system
is open to anglers. They have to pay a modest fee and I will sell him a
ticket any time that he wants.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan: </strong>How much?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>I will give the prices
for my local association: &pound;5 for a day, &pound;10 for a week and
&pound;20 for a season. All that money is reinvested into the river.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is the point: the Tweed protection
order, about which there was considerable debate recently, has enhanced
fishing and allowed its management. Fishing is predominantly managed by
local angling associations. While I share Mr Canavan's concerns about access
to fishing, I believe that protection orders can, if they are properly
managed, assist in developing fishing and in allowing as many people as
possible to fish.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

That makes one wonder why some Conservative members believe that extending
Scottish jurisdiction-which is what independence is, after all-would bring
western civilisation as we know it to an end.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The order makes reference to other acts,
which in turn refer to further acts, so reading it demands a great deal
of attention. I would be glad if the minister would confirm one of my interpretations.
He alluded to the duty of the Environment Agency to lay reports before
the Scottish Parliament, but will he confirm that, under paragraph 4(2)
of the order, the making of byelaws for the Upper Esk-which for the majority
of its length, beginning not far north from Scotsdike, is an entirely Scottish
river-cannot take place without the concurrence of a Scottish minister?
The order does not make that clear.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have one or two other questions of detail,
which I am sure the minister will welcome. In the Lower Esk, the Environment
Agency still has the power to grant licences to fish south of the medium
filum. Medium filum means the middle; Brian Donohoe used it in a riveting
adjournment debate in the House of Commons not long ago when he was talking
about the fascinating subject of boundary walls. Can the minister confirm
that the entire area north of the medium filum-that is, on the Scottish
side-is allocated to existing legal rights to fish for salmon, and that
there is no area north of the medium filum that is currently unallocated
in respect of such rights?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Can he also explain for the benefit of
the curious why, if I understand it correctly-the logic of this escapes
me, but I am sure that there must be a good explanation-the only people
who can fish for trout north of the medium filum on the Esk are those who
have the right to fish for salmon? It seems to me that the two species
could be separated.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another subject that relates to the Esk,
but is not directly dealt with in the order, is the shellfish fishery in
the Solway. Recently, there has been a large increase in the number of
people hand raking for mussels on the Solway. That practice attracts people
from as far afield as Wales and Liverpool. There is some concern locally
that the use of four-wheel drive vehicles is causing great damage to the
foreshore and that the stocks of shellfish, particularly cockles, may be
in jeopardy from that practice. Will the minister say whether he is considering
a regulatory order for shellfish in the Solway?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, will the minister be tackling
the situation regarding migratory fish in the Solway by means of an order,
as was suggested by the Environment Agency last year?</font></td>

that the references are, in one case, to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries

clear in the schedules, although obviously they are clear in the acts that
the orders will change. I suggest that, for the benefit of those of us

clear which secretary of state would be acting jointly with the Scottish

Mr Deputy Presiding Officer, that you would announce that I should rise

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will take Donald Gorrie's points first.
Schedule 20 to the Scotland Act 1998 (Cross-Border Public Authorities)
(Adaptation of Functions etc.) Order 1999 is not confused, because the
purpose of the order is to try to clarify whether it should be the UK or
Scottish ministers who deal with particular appointments. I hope that he
will accept that reassurance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Schedule 9 to the order refers to the Lord
Chancellor because he is the responsible member of the Westminster Government
who deals with the matter concerned. It is nothing more sinister than that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Donald Gorrie also asked to which secretary
of state the schedules referred. I realised only about three years ago
that, in any piece of Westminster legislation, there was seldom a specific
reference to the Secretary of State for Defence, or to the Secretary of
State for Scotland and so on. The only reference is to "secretary of state"-that
is the terminology used. In this case, depending on what the schedule was,
it would reflect the appropriate minister. The references are not to the
Secretary of State for Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have dispensed with the easier parts
of my response. I will take Michael Russell's comments next, because, in
a sense, if we were here to talk about a settlement for a separate, independent
Scotland, there would be some validity to the points that he made, and
I say that to the SNP in a constructive sense.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Michael Russell knows full well that in
the "Scotland's Parliament" white paper-which was published in 1997 and
which was the subject of a very successful referendum of the Scottish people-we
were absolutely clear about cross-border public authorities and indeed
about the bodies to which he referred, such as the energy regulators, the
Office of Passenger Rail Franchising and the Health and Safety Commission.
In the white paper, we said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"In certain reserved areas, the activities
of other UK/GB bodies which are accountable to the UK Parliament will continue
to be significant in the economic or social life of Scotland, and therefore

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, those
are reserved matters. I think that Michael Russell knows that there will
be an opportunity for Scottish ministers to become involved in appointments
to the bodies that we have just described and to other bodies. There will
also be an opportunity for reports of those organisations to be lodged
in this Parliament. We can make a distinction between a demand and an invitation,
but I suspect that many of those bodies will accept an invitation from
this Parliament to meet a committee or the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the things that we tend to forget
about devolution is that, whether the matter is reserved or devolved, this
is a very powerful Parliament. The Parliament will be listened to if it
discusses issues that touch on reserved matters. As for the specific bodies
that Michael Russell mentioned, we have faithfully delivered on the white
paper commitments. His comments would have been more valid if there had
been another type of settlement, and I suggest that he knows full well
the position regarding those bodies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As for the Equal Opportunities Commission,
the Independent Television Commission and the Radio Authority, the orders
debated yesterday give Scottish ministers involvement in appointments to
those bodies. Those bodies are of interest to Scotland, and the Parliament
could consider issues that pertain to them, which backs up my point about
the Parliament's involvement in wider issues.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Equal Opportunities Commission, the
ITC and the Radio Authority are not cross-border public authorities, but
operate in reserved areas. I should stress that, as part of the devolution
settlement, we have substantial devolved powers and substantial executive
devolution, and the Parliament has a role in matters wholly reserved to
Westminster. That role has been detailed not only in the white paper, but
in every step along the way to the current situation of the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):
</strong>The minister will remember that the Commission for Racial Equality
wished to have its functions devolved, because it thought-rightly-that
racial equality legislation might be stronger if dealt with by this Parliament
rather than by the UK Parliament. That organisation was listed in the white
paper in 1997, but has disappeared from the orders that we are debating.
Will the minister refer in particular to the Commission for Racial Equality,
because many people are interested in how this Parliament will relate to
that organisation?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Alex Salmond makes
a reasonable point, because what is important in the orders that I outlined

is right to say that there has been a debate on racial equality. It is
a very important and sensitive issue,&nbsp;</font></td>

it on record that racial equality is a very important issue, and I do not
want to detract from Alex Salmond's constructive comments.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Michael Russell also made the point about
how we define the new politics. Perhaps a common definition would be a
constructive tone in the chamber; concentration on some of the big policy
issues on which we campaigned in the election; and a mutual respect for
comments made on every side of the chamber. If we achieve that in the first
few weeks, people here and the wider public will respect that. That comment
is aimed at everyone-I am not singling out any one party-but if we could
meet that definition of the new politics, we would be paying tribute to
the fact that we have a Parliament. The Scottish people would want us to
act in such a way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Phil Gallie identified a number of schedules.
The schedules go into detail on how the responsibilities are split up and

in Scotland about the future of the police forces. We have established
a review to consider the police force structure, but no decisions have
been made on that matter and there is no hidden agenda as to what the outcome
might be. We are involving all the parties, and the guiding principle is
that we are committed to the best policing. That will be the guiding criterion
and not whether there are two, three, four, five, six, seven or eight forces.
We gave a cast-iron reassurance that it will be a proper debate, and this
Parliament, as well as the new Executive, can engage in it. I hope that
Mr Gallie accepts that assurance, which is unaltered by anything that is
being discussed today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that we have not defined before, but I can reassure him that there is not
a financial hit in relation to that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was going to say that I will deal with
Dennis Canavan's points, but that might be ambitious as I know from experience
at Westminster that Dennis Canavan has a great deal more knowledge of this
subject than most. On the order affecting the Solway, I cannot promise
a debate on the wider issues, because that is not a matter for me. To quote
a Westminster phrase, I acknowledge the matter and will pass it to the
appropriate minister-Mr John Home Robertson-who is also in the chamber
today, so he will take cognisance of this debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Suffice it to say that under the section
111 order, the border remains the medium filum. However, the new offence
is one of fishing without authority, wherever that fishing may have taken
place. Scottish fishermen may fish from the north to the medium filum and
English fishermen from the south, but now anyone fishing without authority-a
legal right or written permission in Scotland, or a licence from the Environment
Agency in England-is guilty of an offence and can be tried in court in
Dumfries and Galloway, or in Cumbria. That in no way satisfies the other
wider concerns raised by Dennis Canavan; I hope that they will be the subject
of a more detailed response from the appropriate minister and department.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Rural Affairs (Ross

I refer to the important issues that it raises, I should like to make a
few general remarks on fisheries in this, my first speech in my present
capacity.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to make it clear to the Parliament
that I am aware of the importance of the fishing industry to the Scottish
economy. Last year, landings in Scotland were valued at over &pound;300
million, which represented nearly two thirds of the total value of landings
in the United Kingdom. I also recognise that fishing is the economic mainstay
of many fragile rural communities, especially in the Highlands and Islands.
I want a modern, sustainable fishing industry in Scotland that will support
those fishing communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to involve the Scottish fishing
industry in achieving that goal. From the outset, I want to make clear
the importance that I attach to involving the industry. If the whole episode
over this order has taught us one thing, surely it is that we cannot-as
a substitute for real consultation and dialogue-rely on indirect communication
through the issue of press notices and the like. What passed for consultation
at Westminster will not suffice in this Parliament. I want to give a positive
assurance that-certainly on matters in my domain-that will be the case.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Furthermore, I do not have any difficulty
with the principle that the Scottish Parliament should be able to request
Westminster to reconsider a proposal that has already been before it. However,
we should do so only when what is proposed, or has been proposed, by Westminster
causes a material disadvantage to those affected by the proposal. In relation
to the order, my difficulty is that reading of the facts indicates that

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The subject of this debate is a key element
of the devolution process. Members have heard a great deal about the Scottish
Adjacent Water Boundaries Order, but I regret that much of what has been
said has been misinformed. I want to take the next few moments to stick
to the facts about what is set out in the order. An example of that misinformation
is, as I read or heard somewhere, that the boundary begins at Carnoustie:
that is simply not true. The exact distance due east from Carnoustie to
the boundary line is nearly 93 miles, or-as I understand some members are
keen that it be expressed both ways-81 nautical miles. At its nearest point
to Carnoustie, the boundary is closer to north Sunderland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The most important point is that it is
also wrong to claim that a legally enforceable boundary line has been shifted.
This is the first time that a fisheries boundary has been fixed in law.
Before devolution, there were no Scottish fishing waters. There were only
British fishing limits. The so-called existing line is simply part of an
administrative arrangement within a UK-wide management regime. The boundary
lines in the order are being drawn in accordance with international convention
on such matters and-as members who have studied this matter will be aware-have
involved the use of median lines.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The net effect of that approach is that
every point on the boundary line is equidistant from Scotland and England.
All the sea in the Scottish zone is closer to Scotland and all the sea
south of the boundary is closer to England. I find that approach to be
demonstrably fair, reasonable and legally defensible. We are talking about
an aspect of the devolution settlement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):
</strong>I am trying to reconcile Mr Finnie's last statement about the arrangement
being demonstrably fair, and so on, with his first statement about consulting
the fishing industry. The industry does not regard the settlement as fair.
Did Mr Finnie consult the industry before making his statement about that
demonstrably fair system? If not, how does he reconcile that with his pledge
about consultation before statements?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I understand that the
industry has made no claim of unfairness in relation to its ability to
fish. The important point is that we are establishing an administrative
boundary that must be part of a devolution settlement. We are not talking
about questions of independence. The result is that the Scottish Executive
has exclusive jurisdiction over all the sea that is closest to Scotland.
Ministers will have responsibility for dealing with the waters that are
closest to them. That is fair and reasonable.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A third claim is
that the fishing grounds have been handed over to England. That is not
the case. The rights of fishermen are not altered by the order. After 1
July they will be able to fish exactly as they do today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The facts are relatively straightforward.
The establishment of a boundary within the British fisheries limits east
and west of Scotland is essential. By fixing the boundary, we can be absolutely
clear about the scope that this Parliament has to regulate sea fisheries.
Before devolution, many of the functions of managing sea fisheries lay
with the four fisheries ministries. Those jointly exercised powers apply
throughout the United Kingdom; the effect of the Scottish Adjacent Waters
Boundary Order is that Scottish ministers in the Scottish Parliament can
exercise exclusive powers over the zone, in the wider framework of the
common fisheries policy. That means that the responsibility for regulating-I
am told that this figure is absolutely accurate-the 127,231 nautical square
miles has been transferred from the UK Government to the Scottish Parliament.
I remind members that that relates to exclusive jurisdiction. It does not
limit the ability of Scottish fishermen to fish within British fishing
limits.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I understand the genuine concern expressed
by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and other representatives. There
is a worry that Scottish fishermen who are alleged to have committed an
offence outwith the new Scottish zone and, in particular, within the area
affected by the change, will be prosecuted in an English court.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For the benefit of members, let me put
that concern into perspective. No prosecutions have arisen in that area
in the past three years-none at all. Indeed, the area is relatively lightly
patrolled by the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. I find it incredible
to believe that the passing of the order will lead to an outbreak of illegality
by Scottish fishermen, nor do we expect any change in that patrol pattern.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, strong representations have been
made to me on that point and strong feelings have been expressed by fishermen
and their representatives. Accordingly, I intend to write to the appropriate
ministers of the Crown, to explore with them whether any flexibility might
be applied to prosecutions if any fishermen should change their habits
of the past three years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

It was necessary to arrive at a line that established who had exclusive
jurisdiction over Scottish fisheries and who was going to control what

it means that all the water closest to Scotland will be under Scottish
jurisdiction and all the water closest to England will be under the minister
responsible for that fishing area. To me, that seems fair and reasonable.
Oil and gas are reserved matters and are not covered by this legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I urge members to support the motion. The
Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 defines the policy-making

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome Mr Finnie's remarks about the
importance of the fishing industry to Scotland. It is appropriate that
the first one-hour political debate in this Parliament is devoted to the
fishing industry, which is a perfect example of an industry that is looking
to the Scottish Parliament to echo its concerns and give it the voice it
has been lacking for a long time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Only days before the first meeting of this
Parliament, an obscure piece of legislation was passed by an obscure committee
in what is, of course, an obscure Parliament in Westminster delivering
yet another blow to the Scottish fishing industry. The industry is now
campaigning for that order, which is of course the Scottish Adjacent Waters
Boundaries Order 1999, to be reversed. I am delighted to see the leaders
of the fishing industry in the public gallery to hear the Parliament speak
out on their behalf.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The fishermen's case is simple: they want
to retain the boundary that we all know. There is already a fishing boundary,
which is known by every fisherman and mariner and Scotland. No one can
find any reason why anyone anywhere should try to change it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The boundary, which goes straight out east
from Berwick, has been established by custom and practice. Generations
of Scottish fishermen have fished those waters, the vast majority of fishing
vessels to be found in those waters are from Scotland, the area is patrolled
by the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency and the area currently falls
within Scottish jurisdiction.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is also legal precedent. The latitude
of 55&deg; 50' marks the line used by the Scottish Fisheries Protection
Agency and is on the map it uses. Scotland has a jurisdiction and the waters
currently fall within it. The Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities)
Order 1987 follows a similar line and deals with offshore activities.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Government's
move at Westminster flies in the face of custom and practice. It throws
up various anomalies. I, too, would like to quote the example that Hamish
Morrison, the chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, is
using in favour of the fishermen's case and which Dennis Canavan brought
to our attention. If a fishing vessel in these waters collides with an
oil vessel, they will now come under different jurisdictions-the fishing
vessel will fall under English jurisdiction and the oil vessel will fall
under Scottish jurisdiction. What sense does that make? How many boundaries
do we need?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The outgoing fisheries minister-old Blackbeard
himself, Lord Sewel-defends the theft of Scottish waters by asking what
all the panic is about. The fishing industry's response is to ask why it
is necessary to change the boundary if it is not going to make any difference.
The reality is that the new boundary does make a difference: it means that
Scottish fishermen would have to appear in English courts if they were
pulled up for an infringement in that area of the sea. That would lead
to massive inconvenience and massive additional expense because the fishermen
would have to hire an English barrister to defend their case in an English
court.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The order reduces the territory over which
this Parliament will have a remit. With regard to implementing European
Union fisheries policy, what happens if the Scottish Parliament decides
to introduce square mesh? Will that decision apply to fishing in those
waters? The common fisheries policy is currently being renegotiated by
the European Union. Zonal management is a key idea arising from the negotiations.
What will happen to that zone? Will it be a Scottish zone? Probably not.
If this order is approved, the Scottish Parliament will have no say over
what happens in that zone and we will have lost an area in which we could
have implemented our zonal management policies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Government's case is riddled with confusion
and contradictions. Lord Sewel's pathetic defence of the Government's decision
has fallen apart and, as we have seen today, the Scottish Executive's defence
of Westminster's decision is also falling apart. First, Lord Sewel told
us that there was no fisheries boundary. That led to an outcry in the fishing
industry. Then he retreated and said that there was a boundary and that
the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency used it, but it was only an administrative
boundary. His last line of defence is that the Government has relied on
international conventions to draw up the new boundary. That claim has now
been destroyed, because the SNP has commissioned a legal opinion, which
was published this morning, from Dr Iain Scobbie, senior lecturer in international

(Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD): </strong>I hope that the amendment provides
an appropriate way forward that will assist fishermen and their organisations.
It has been a cause of some frustration to a number of us that it has not
been possible for this Parliament to change the boundary order and that
we can only seek to persuade Westminster to do so. The intention of my
amendment is to back the fishermen's case. I welcome the fact that it is
now generally recognised that the consultation that took place before the
order was laid and debated at Westminster was completely inadequate. That
is a clear lesson for us to bear in mind in our proceedings over the coming
months.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is particularly unfortunate that the
lack of consultation affected the fishing industry, which feels that it
has been badly neglected-almost ignored-for the past 20 years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>I cannot quite understand why there was a difficulty at Westminster.
There were elected representatives from Scotland-Liberal Democrats and
members of the Labour party-on the relevant committee, and there was no
time limit on its deliberations. Why was the order so badly debated?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>If I may take a charitable
view of what occurred, the answer is that the committee concentrated on
how the line should be drawn, not why there should be a line. I have found
no reference anywhere to lines of custom and practice, or to the line that
is clearly set out-as Richard Lochhead explained-in the Scottish Fisheries
Protection Agency's annual report.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With great respect to the minister, I believe
that the practical implications of the new boundary are more serious than
he has, perhaps, realised. I tend to prefer the view of the practitioners
on the high seas to that of lawyers or civil servants. We have rehearsed
quite fully the question of legal jurisdiction. That affects not only oil
supply vessels, but ordinary vessels that are in transit through the area;
it is my understanding that jurisdiction has been transferred for fishing
vessels, but not for other forms of vessel.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Fishermen are understandably concerned
that, once they have been transferred from the Scottish fisheries protection
regime to another regime, there will be subtle differences in the interpretation
of even common regulations. I am pleased that the minister has said that
he will seek help in this area, listen to the views of the industry and
discuss with other ministers of the Crown how those differences can be
minimised. Frankly, they could be minimised by redrawing the line where
it was in custom and practice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Company Ltd that there may be some difficulty with the lifting of wrecks,
but that is a minor point. Another area of concern, particularly for my
constituents, is the fact that in recent years it has been the custom and
practice among the UK fishermen's federations that vessels out of Eyemouth
carry out patrol or guard duty on oil installations. It is useful additional
income for fishermen as it helps them to spread out quota across the year,
but it could well be lost as a result of this order. I seek some assurances
from the minister that he will address that issue with fishermen in Eyemouth.
It would be difficult for them if they were to lose that income.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are serious problems-which Richard
Lochhead clearly identified-not with the present regulations, but with
future regulations. If a division is made along the boundary line that
is described in the new order, a line is pushed straight through the middle
of the Berwick bank fishing ground. There is clear concern that, in future-not
at the moment-different types of regulation may apply on the two sides
of this notable fishery, which is fished predominantly by Scottish vessels.
I have not yet had an answer to the question on dredging for marine aggregates-there
may be consequences for that too, although I stand to be corrected if that
is not so. I have great difficulty understanding why international law
is used to draw a boundary line in this context.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Anyone who goes to Eyemouth will not find
anybody who is in any doubt about where the boundary was, and I find it
difficult that that was not appreciated and presented to the committee
at Westminster.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

on behalf of the people in the fishing industry, whom many of us represent.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The fishing industry wants to be regarded
not as a few thousand fishermen or a matter for a few coastal constituencies,
but as a major industry of Scotland that employs 20,000 people plus in
terms of its total economic effect in our country.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The onshore and offshore fishing industry
is 15 times more important to the Scottish economy than it is to the United
Kingdom economy and it wants that level of importance to be reflected in
our debates and proceedings. That has not happened at Westminster and it
most certainly did not happen in the debate in the Third Standing Committee
on Delegated Legislation on 23 March. I have read through the report of
the debate and the kindest thing I can say about Mr McLeish's speech as
the minister who introduced the order is that he was reading his brief.
As soon as he was asked questions about it he sailed into trouble. He had
the honesty to say:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I realise that the order is just a mass
of co-ordinates and that the boundary may be less specific than possible
in relation to the size of the map".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In other words, the map provided for the
members of the committee was too small for them to recognise where the
boundary was about to be drawn. That was reflected in the debate. Mr Russell
Brown, the member for Dumfries, was honest and disarming enough to say:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"When I picked up a copy of the order and
looked at the co-ordinates . . . I was totally confused by some of it."-[<i>Official
Report</i>, <i>House of Commons, Third Standing Committee on Delegated
Legislation</i>, 23 March 1999; c 4,11.]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The nature of the debate in the committee
did not reflect the seriousness of the subject or give due attention to
it. Everyone who reads the account of that standing committee meeting will
recognise that a blunder was made in terms of the scrutiny it should have
given Mr McLeish's proposal.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not think that we should compound
that felony today or try to cover up for the mistakes that were made at
Westminster. We should make a clear parliamentary declaration to do something
about it. Mr Finnie has tried to give the impression that none of this
really matters. Some of the questions he was asked, particularly the one
from Mr Canavan, indicated that it might well matter. Mr Robson's contribution
indicated why it might well matter. It is not enough to wave it away and
say that we will work out later whose jurisdiction any offences that take
place might come under. An offence could take place tomorrow in that 6,000
square miles of Scottish water and the de minimis position is that somebody
who is accused of an offence should at least know in which court they are
going to have to defend themselves.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I represent the
biggest fishing constituency in Scotland; my colleague Margaret Ewing represents
the second biggest; and Mr Wallace represents a major fishing constituency,
although in the Scottish Parliament he represents less than half of the
fishing interests that he represents at Westminster. Some of our constituents
are occasionally accused of infringements-these things happen from time
to time. Many succeed in proving their case in court. There are some solicitors
in Scotland who are well versed in fishing law and who often succeed in
proving our constituents innocent, and justice takes its course. It would
be very difficult for my constituents and those of other members if they
had to defend themselves in an English court-there would be substantial
expense, inconvenience and uncertainty, but the minister seems prepared
to tolerate that. I think we should give short shrift to that this afternoon.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a further matter of importance,
beyond the immediate issue of legal jurisdiction, that lies in the nature
of&nbsp;<a NAME="OLE_LINK1"></a>fisheries policy. Not too many members
will be well versed in this matter, but I will take a minute to explain
why it could be of substantial, practical importance. It is simply not
true, as the Executive claims in its motion, that the order will in no
way restrict the freedom of Scottish fishermen in terms of the common fisheries
policy. That policy is itself in a process of evolution. Many good ideas
have emerged in the debates on fishing policy over the past few years.
One, which came from the industry, was to ban discards-small dead fish
thrown over the side of the boat-which is a waste and an obscenity in conservation
terms.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scottish industry has been strongly
in favour of an absolute ban on discards and argues that all fish caught
should be landed so that they can be properly assessed. That is an attractive
policy and it may well be an option that this Parliament will want to consider.
As things stand, we could legislate for that option with effect on Scottish
boats anywhere, but we could not legislate for other boats that are fishing
in Scottish waters. Nothing undermines conservation policy in the fishing
industry more than the feeling that regulations can be imposed on our fishermen
but not on other boats that are fishing in our waters. The common fisheries
policy is moving towards coastal state management-zonal management. That
is how the policy has evolved and it has great support throughout the community.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 6,000 square miles form a significant
fishing ground that we do not want to slip out of Scottish jurisdiction
and policy measures that we might want to impose. Mr Finnie should think
very carefully before he says that the order is not relevant to practical
fishing concerns. It is also untrue that there are no lines of jurisdiction

Shelf (Jurisdiction) Order (UK) 1968 set a legal boundary for the purpose

interest is concerned, there is a custom and practice line, as Mr Robson's
excellent speech exemplified.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Probably the worst aspect of all this is
that the practice that was followed in that Westminster committee did not
follow international legal precedents. The opinion that my colleague Mr
Richard Lochhead quoted from Dr Iain Scobbie-who is an acknowledged expert
in such areas-makes that very clear. Dr Scobbie said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Equidistance is an accepted method in
opposite delimitations, but not in those involving lateral adjacency."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In other words, if the boundary were between
Scotland and Norway it would be correct to use the method of equidistance,
but between states that are in lateral adjacency that method is not the
common practice under international law. Dr Scobbie stated that two thirds
of the cases under international law have not been settled using the method
of equidistance. What prevails in those cases tends to be custom and practice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Scottish members at Westminster surely have a duty to protect the rights
and interests of their constituents and, above all in this case, the members
of the Scottish fishing industry. The statutory instrument that has caused
all this bother was approved without the knowledge of, or consultation
with, Scottish fishermen or their representatives or, for that matter,
any English ones.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why was there no consultation and what
were the Westminster parliamentarians thinking about? Did they honestly
think that the removal of 6,000 square miles of traditional Scottish fishings
amounted simply to what Donald Dewar called the tidying-up of boundaries
in accordance with international law? Is that an example of open government
by the party that champions that slogan? Is it an example of consensual
process? On a scale of one to 10, how would members rate that? A resounding
vote of nul points is echoing around the chamber. If that is open government,
what is the alternative like?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know that the Scottish Labour party,
the SNP and the Liberal Democrats were campaigning in the Scottish election-perhaps
that is an excuse-but the Executive's motion is a smokescreen to hide the
fact that it has sold Scottish fisheries and the fishermen down the river.
Members of the Executive could not even manage to leak the information,
which is odd for a party that is famous for its faulty plumbing. Is there
some sinister reason why Labour is introducing a boundary that is based
on international legal conventions when all that was needed was a clarification
of the existing boundary?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although there is clearly a need for a
geographical boundary to define the Scottish Parliament's area of legislative
and administrative competence, it should have been based on existing custom,
practice and precedent, after consultation with the fishermen. The current
boundary, which has been recognised for centuries, is used by the Scottish
Fisheries Protection Agency in its annual report. It is also used, as has

Scotland and the opportunity that this Parliament will give the industry

to many other constituencies. It offers a chance for fisheries to get their

a positive contribution to the future of a crucial Shetland and Scottish

to my colleague Jim Wallace, I sat on the researchers' bench in the public
gallery and watched that same Tuesday night debate at half-past 10, when
only 20 members were present. It was not edifying stuff, and it did not
do much for the way in which fisheries was presented. There were fishermen
there from all over Scotland on that night, and they werenae very impressed
by it either. We need to do a heck of a lot better than that, and I welcome
the fact that so many members are still here.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation on "Good Morning Scotland" today.
He raised the important point that the UK Government proposals establish
a position where a Scottish fishing boat on oil contract work is under
Scottish jurisdiction, but as soon as it shoots its nets it is under English
jurisdiction. The suggestion was also made that if a Scottish boat were
prosecuted while it was south of the new line but north of the old, it
would be under a Scottish court's jurisdiction. That drives a proverbial
trawler through a square mesh panel. Why bother with the line at all? I
do not see the need for it in that context.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

is a principle of Liberal Democrat fishing policy and that includes inshore

follow the good example of Shetland, where fishermen are working with conservation
groups, environmental organisations and the local authority to build an

waters shows that a preponderance of Scottish vessels operate in the area,
which demonstrates Scotland's historic right to the fishing grounds in
question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As we have heard, there is also a legal
precedent that establishes Scottish jurisdiction over the area in question.
That has been fully demonstrated in that, although there have been few
criminal prosecutions, they have been brought before Scottish courts and
enacted under Scottish law. The line has been and must continue to be recognised.
When challenged, the Government has advanced no good reason and has satisfied
no one with its explanation about why the line has been moved 60 miles.
The decision remains unjustified and unjustifiable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The minister has claimed that, rather than
lamenting the loss of 6,000 square miles, we should be celebrating the
fact that 140,000 square miles have been transferred to Scottish jurisdiction.
We may yet celebrate, because the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency
has confirmed in writing that those 140,000 square miles include the 6,000
square miles in question. That could be confusing-perhaps Lord Sewel got
his figures wrong. It could be that the order is the cruel joke all of
Scotland hopes that it is, and that the 6,000 square miles were never transferred
from Scottish to English jurisdiction.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Others have noted the future requirement
for consultation with relevant bodies in the preparation of legislation
relating to fishing in the Scottish zone. It would have been vastly preferable
to have undertaken such a consultation exercise prior to formulating the
order, when all the salient facts could have been clearly articulated,
but there was no opportunity for that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The people of Scotland recognise that this
is an unfair order. They would want the Scottish Parliament to confirm
that the 6,000 square miles of sea should remain as Scottish waters, and
that the boundary line should be reinstated where it was for hundreds of
years. Scotland's democratically elected Parliament has not been re-established
to condone, or implement by proxy, legislation that is unnecessarily confusing,
detrimental to the interests of Scotland, and which is contrary to established
practice and precedent.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</strong>Thank you, deputy leader-[<i>Laughter.</i>] An excellent start.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I support some of the sentiments that have
been expressed, especially those of Mr Lochhead. Last weekend I attended
the Clyde fishermen's association lunch. It was long and it was liquid,
but I can tell the Parliament that this issue is very important to the
fishing industry. We must send a strong message not only to the fishing
industry, but to rural Scotland and to the rural industries that have felt
neglected, or in many cases ignored, by Westminster. Alex Salmond's classic
example-that there is only one debate a year on the fishing industry-sums
up the importance that Westminster attaches to fishing and agricultural
interests. It is essential that we send a strong signal to rural Scotland
and its industries, saying that their agenda is one of the Parliament's
top priorities. That is the nub of the argument today. What makes the fishermen
angry is the lack of consultation on the implications of moving the line.
That is the issue that must be discussed with the fisheries representatives
and I am glad that the minister recognised that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The situation must change. The Scottish
Parliament must today make it clear to the fisheries organisations that
we will put their agenda at the top of our list of priorities. The new

fishing, agriculture and all rural interests are indeed important.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

amendment, which calls on the minister to meet the fishing leaders to discuss
the issue in detail. Clearly, there are many differences of opinion on
the implications of the new line. The minister must discuss the matter
with the fishing leaders and listen to their concerns. Most important,
if those leaders have genuine concerns, he must act as an advocate for
the fishing industries and take the issue to the Secretary of State for
Scotland, who, in turn, should take it to Westminster for a debate on whether
the line should be altered. If the line needs to be altered, the minister

Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order. First, there are concerns on
the part of the Scottish boats that fish the Berwick bank, in particular
about the alleged infringements that are being pursued in the English,
rather than in the Scottish, courts and the likely expense that those cases
might involve. Secondly, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation has raised
reasonable issues-which were echoed by Dennis Canavan-about the different
jurisdictions that apply when the oil and fishing industries share the
same waters.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those issues deserve to be addressed. The
fishing industry is entitled to a voice and, when its direct material interests
are involved, it should be consulted and informed. For those reasons, I
welcome the minister's commitment to meet the Scottish Fishermen's Federation,
to pursue these matters with UK ministers and to examine ways of addressing
the concerns-some of which have been raised today-about the jurisdiction
that affects Scottish fishermen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some of the rhetoric about piracy and theft
that we have heard in recent weeks is less welcome. Even in the chamber
today, we have heard that Westminster has stolen Scottish fishing waters
from the Scottish fishing fleet. There is no shortage of serious and important
issues that affect the Scottish fishing industry and there is no need to
portray the important-but limited-issues that arise from this order as
a matter of life and death for the industry. Of course, some people get
excited about boundaries-regardless of whether those boundaries are on
land or at sea or whether they affect the legislative competence of the
Parliament-but to pretend that the whole matter is a gigantic conspiracy
to run away with Scotland's fish does no favours to the Scottish fishing
industry. There is something pretty bizarre about a nationalist party that
objects to the use of an international convention, even if that party has
the benefit of a last-minute legal opinion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

grievance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As a South of Scotland member, I had the
privilege some weeks ago of meeting a number of representatives of the
Scottish fishermen. They put to us the practical points that have been
ventilated by many members this afternoon on legal jurisdiction and on
the lack of consultation of fishermen's organisations by the gas and oil
industries and the various utilities that lay cables. They also told us
that, in the 6,000 square miles, they may lose the subcontracting work
with the oil and gas industries that is currently restricted to them because
of a non-poaching agreement with their English counterparts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those were not party political points.
They were the concerns and indignation of men who felt that their interests
had been neglected and that they needed better representation. I submit
that this Parliament should be treating those concerns with considerable
respect.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The essential question is that the Scottish
fishermen were not consulted. They were not even given the information
properly once the decision had been made; they found out almost by accident.
That shows gross contempt. Whether it was deliberate or accidental, the
Westminster members are responsible for that humiliating failure to consult.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Scotland. That is not good enough. How will we treat the complaints, petitions

that. We and the Executive have to respond. If the Executive is not prepared

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"the use of median lines mean that every
point on the boundary is equidistant to Scotland and to England".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That will fascinate members. Those who
have doctorates in geography can explain to the others what this means:
the line is a loxodromic line that is drawn on a Mercator projection. In
a case between the UK and France on the continental shelf delimitation
in 1977, the UK Government objected to those criteria being used to delineate
territory between the French and the British, yet now it is using them
in the UK.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Lord Sewel also made it clear to the Scottish
Fishermen's Federation and to Richard Lochhead that the boundaries were
set by use of median lines. He stated unequivocally that the use of the
median line is the normal international convention. That is not the case.
I will pr&eacute;cis our seven pages of legal opinion for those who will
not read it. Charney and Alexander's "International Maritime Boundaries
(1993)" establishes the fact that only 40 per cent of maritime boundaries
follow the equidistance method.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a 1982 continental shelf dispute between

for all purposes-for example, for oil exploration and for fisheries. The
UK signed and is bound by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea, yet it has departed from the convention's provisions in making
this boundary change.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If one were into conspiracy theories-of
course, being as innocent and pure as all other members in the chamber,
I am not-one might suspect that, if the boundary change stands, its existence

Fishermen's Federation tomorrow, when we will get down to the serious business
that must be addressed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One or two points need to be nailed down
fairly hard. On 8 March, our colleagues in the Scottish Office gave proper
public notification about the background and the meaning of the new boundary
line, and 57 copies of a news release were circulated to different organisations
and to the press. I fully recognise that official press statements are
not always the best way to get information into the public domain. It is
often more effective to mark the information "confidential", and to leave
it in a plain brown envelope in a pub. However, we understand that there
is a serious point, and I agree with Mr Robson. We must have open and clear
lines of communication and consultation with the industry. That will be
the order of the day in future, and that is a specific undertaking.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The industry had an excuse for not noticing
what was going on, and we will put that right. The SNP did not have that
excuse. It has that &pound;130,000 of Short money and researchers in Westminster.
Why did SNP members not take the opportunity to turn up and to debate this
matter on 23 March?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This matter is of particular interest to
fishermen in Dunbar and Port Seton in my own constituency. If their interests
were being undermined in any way, I can assure members that I would be
taking a close interest in the matter. The order does not amend an existing
boundary. All that we have had until now is an ad hoc arrangement between
two United Kingdom fishery patrol agencies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond </strong><i>rose-</i></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Home Robertson: </strong>I am sorry; I
do not have time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This new Parliament has distinct responsibilities,
and that is why we now have a proper boundary line, set in accordance with
fair and objective principles. The new line has no sinister implications
and it does not impinge in any way on the rights of Scottish fishermen
to fish in waters on either side of it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I refer now to the Opposition. It was always
going to be entertaining to see the new coalition&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">between the nationalists
and the Tories, and we have seen it today. We have heard some dramatic
stuff about the wicked English stealing Scottish waters and lurid speculation
about blameless fishermen from Carnoustie being dragged off to alien courts
by the English navy. Frankly, such speculation is irresponsible nonsense.
Fishermen are entitled to expect serious consideration, and they will get
that from this Administration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The most depressing feature of the debate
has been the chorus of whingeing from nationalists who seem to want to
use Scotland's Parliament as a platform for ritual girning about our neighbours
south of the border. For goodness' sake, after 300 years we have at last
achieved a Parliament with responsibility for the whole Scottish fishing
industry and 140,000 square miles of our adjacent waters. We have access
to all our fleet's traditional fishing grounds elsewhere and two thirds
of the catch of the UK fishing fleet. We should be working together to
set a positive agenda for this great industry, and that is what we propose
to do.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What we have from Mr Salmond-[<i>Interruption.</i>]
I see that he is digging, and we are all familiar with that. What we have
from Mr Salmond is the parliamentary equivalent of a letter to <i>The Scotsman</i>
complete with ludicrous conspiracy theories, signed by "Disgusted of Banff
and Buchan" and endorsed by his new friends in the Conservative party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our fishermen deserve much, much better
than that. This Administration will take the interests of our fishing communities
very seriously indeed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>On a point of order,
Madam Deputy Presiding Officer. Today, we have heard time and again requests
for moderate, temperate language in the debate; what we are getting from
the minister is anything but.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I
am always grateful to members who support the position of the Presiding
Officer and his deputies, but we can usually cope on our own.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Home Robertson: </strong>I never thought
that I would be accused of intemperate language by Mr Gallie, of all people.
The Opposition is trying to crank up a non-existent debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I give an undertaking to the industry and
to fishing communities around Scotland that this Administration will take
their concerns seriously. We will begin that job with them tomorrow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our fishermen deserve much better than
they have had in this debate. This Administration will take the interests
of our fishing communities very seriously indeed. I commend the Government
motion to the chamber. I urge members to accept the amendment moved by
Mr Robson and to reject the nationalists' whingeing amendment.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That the Parliament notes that - the Scottish
Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order (S.I.1999/1126) in no way alters or restricts
the freedom of the Scottish fleet to fish consistently with the Common
Fisheries Policy of the European Union; from 1 July the Parliament will
be charged with the responsibility of regulating fishing in the newly created
Scottish zone of British Fishery Limits and fishing by all Scottish vessels
no matter where they fish; consultation will be required with relevant
bodies in the preparation of legislation relating to fishing in the Scottish
zone and the Scottish fishing organisations have considerable concerns
about the said Order; and calls upon the relevant Minister to (a) meet
representatives of the Scottish fishing industry to discuss their concern
and in particular their desire to re-establish the custom and practice
of former years in regard to the east coast boundary and (b) convey such
concerns to the Secretary of State for Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

(Con): </strong>Madam Deputy Presiding Officer, I pressed my button very early
on because I wanted to participate in the vital debate in support of our
fishermen. I failed to be called; my button and light are still doing all
sorts of wonderful things. I wonder whether I will appear on the record
as having attempted to speak.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</strong>He will now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

a rule, we do not publish the names of those who wanted to speak but did
not. However, Mr Davidson has now spoken in the debate, so his name will
be recorded.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Thank you very much.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
