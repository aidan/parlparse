<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):
</strong>The final item of business for today is the motion from the Parliamentary
Bureau on the establishment of parliamentary committees. I remind members
that the motion has to be taken without debate, so I ask the mover of the
motion and the movers of the amendments to take a couple of minutes each-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

sorry about that. I repeat: this motion is taken without debate and therefore

</strong>We cannot hear either.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I am willing
to shout if necessary. I said that Parliament had already agreed that the
motion would be passed without debate and therefore the mover and the movers
of amendments must be extremely brief.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">16:48</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Parliament (Mr Tom
McCabe): </strong>I am delighted to move this motion. Since the opening day,
there has been much talk in the Parliament of a new politics. People have
placed different interpretations on that, but there is a wide desire to
achieve a new way of going about our business.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I move the motion with a sense of contentment;
it reflects consensus and cross-party support. However, I also move it
with a sense of outrage caused by the front-page article that appeared
in <i>The Herald</i> today, which totally misrepresents and distorts the
work of the four parties involved in the Parliamentary Bureau.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Parliamentary Bureau asked the four
party business managers if they could reach agreement on this potentially
difficult issue and they undertook to discuss the matter. In the background
of those discussions was the desire that Messrs Harper, Sheridan and Canavan
could be accommodated on a committee within the Parliament. Clearly, in
determining the size of the committees, we had to strike a balance between
the need to manage MSPs' time for their chamber and constituency commitments
and the time that they would spend in committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We agreed to use the d'Hondt formula for
the allocation of committee places. That formula would not provide any
places for Messrs Canavan, Harper or Sheridan, but the parties were determined
to resist that. In a spirit of fairness, they were determined to find some
formula that would allocate a place to each of those three&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">members.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The d'Hondt formula would have allocated
six places on an 11-member committee to the Labour party. To Labour's credit,
it immediately recognised that, as it does not have a majority in this
chamber, it would not be fair for it to have six places. We therefore agreed
to reduce our representation on committees to five places. To their credit,
other parties responded by reducing their representation. That ensured
that places would be available for Messrs Canavan, Sheridan and Harper.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The allocation of places on committees
has been difficult for all parties. Of Labour members, 22 indicated an
interest in the Social Inclusion, Housing and Voluntary Sector Committee,
21 in the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, 15 in the European Committee,
16 in the Equal Opportunities Committee and 13 in the Transport and the
Environment Committee. Similar figures apply to the other parties, so some
members will clearly be disappointed that they did not get on the committee
of their first choice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The proposed allocation is based on a consensual
approach and-more important-on the best principles of the consultative
steering group report. The front-page article to which I referred earlier
not only contained a headline that was offensive to my party, but badly
misrepresented the commendable work that all the parties have done over
the past few weeks to find an acceptable solution. Far more important in
my view, that article misrepresents how politics and this Parliament can
work if we all have the will.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The principle that Robin Harper, Tommy
Sheridan and Dennis Canavan should each secure a committee place is sound;
it is supported by all parties on the Parliamentary Bureau. If the places
are not on the committees of their first choice, that applies equally-as
I have demonstrated-to members of every other party in the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I stress that the rules for committees
in this Parliament are somewhat different from those in other places. MSPs
can attend meetings of committees of which they are not members; they can
speak at the discretion of the chair and can move amendments. They cannot
vote, but they have considerable powers, even though they are not formally
members of the committee. I stress on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau
that, although a number of amendments have been lodged today, there is
no intention to support or agree to any amendment that seeks to replace
the names in the motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I appeal to Messrs Canavan and Sheridan
to realise that, if they do not accept the need for compromise to achieve
consensus, they will find&nbsp;</font></td>

own action, they do not have committee places. It is not the wish of the
Parliamentary Bureau or of any party that is represented on the bureau
for Messrs Canavan, Harper or Sheridan not to have committee places, but
the amendments would have the practical effect of leaving those members
without committee places.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians)
(Con): </strong>Will the minister confirm that every party offered to give up
a place and that the Scottish Conservatives offered to give up a place
on the Equal Opportunities Committee?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>I thought that I had
confirmed that, but I am more than happy to do so again. I stress as strongly
as I can that the level of co-operation from all the parties on the bureau
was commendable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>Will the minister confirm an important additional point? Now
that the principle has been established that individual members or members
of parties that have only one member should have committee places, we hope
that it will last not just for this session, but for all time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>I am more than happy
to confirm what Mr Russell has said. This is an important debate on an
important motion. That is why I have stressed to Messrs Canavan and Sheridan
that their amendments are very serious and go against the fine principles
that the Parliamentary Bureau wants to establish. As I said, we sincerely
want people to be represented on the committees and I therefore urgently
request Messrs Canavan and Sheridan to reconsider their position.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I believe that the commendable work of
the four parties on the Parliamentary Bureau is an indication of the good
way in which this Parliament can operate. I sincerely hope that the authors
of the article in <i>The Herald</i> today take note of my words and have
the good grace to correct the misinformation that appeared.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

here, right enough.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although Tom talks about consensual politics,

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McCabe:</strong> I received a number of

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">themselves. It
seems that there has been no consensual discussion with two out of the
three members who are not represented on the Parliamentary Bureau. The
member who Mr McCabe has had discussions with had to ask to be on three
or four committees before getting the one that he wanted, whereas the two
members who did not ask for anything did not get the ones that they wanted.
That seems to be very arcane.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The problem is that the two members requested
places on the Social Inclusion, Housing and Voluntary Sector Committee
and the Education, Culture and Sport Committee. The problem that Mr McCabe
mentioned about the great number of members seeking places on the committees
should surely be addressed by increasing the size of the committees, rather
than by refusing membership to people who want to serve on a particular
committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In respect of the idea that we are creating
a consensual atmosphere in this Parliament, the difficulty is that we would
not have had any places under the d'Hondt system. To that I would say that
if the formula disnae work, do not use it. We are all grown-ups in this
chamber-surely we can decide to speak to one another, even if we do not
agree. I do not think that it is too much to ask that two members who have
requested a place on only one committee each are given those places-it
is not as if we have requested a place on many committees or sought any
special service. Under my amendments, the members whom we are asking to
be deleted from the membership lists of the committees would still be members
of two other committees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>To clarify Tommy Sheridan's
point, I inform the chamber that there are five members of the Labour party
who sit on only one committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>There

a new era of inclusive democracy. It would be a great pity if members were

or, like me, a member of no party at all.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I remember when he was a Tory MP in another place, although he has changed
his colours a bit since then-or has he? If my two amendments were passed,
Keith would still be a member of two committees, the Finance Committee
and the Equal Opportunities Committee, and Tommy Sheridan would have membership
of only one, the Social Inclusion, Housing and Voluntary Sector Committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In support of my amendments, I must remind
members that Tommy represents Glasgow, which has a high incidence of social
inclusion-[<i>Laughter</i>] rather, social exclusion as well as social
inclusion-and housing problems. The role of the voluntary sector in the
city of Glasgow is very important indeed. Therefore, it would be appropriate
for Tommy Sheridan to be a member of that committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to hear that there was no knowledge of individuals going on to committees,
because discussions about that have been taking place for some time. I

the proposal should be discussed amongst the three members. That does not
seem to have been done and I regret that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

It is important for the future of the Parliament and for the future of
other people from small parties-after the next election I hope to have
a few more of my colleagues with me-that we revisit the size of committees
