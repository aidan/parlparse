Officer (Sir David Steel):</strong> This afternoon's business will be devoted
to the selection of the nominee for appointment as First Minister. Business
is scheduled to be completed by 5.30 pm. If it is not completed by then,
the standing orders allow the meeting to continue so that we can complete
the selection process<i>.</i> However, if business is completed before
5.30 pm, I shall close the meeting.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scotland Act 1998 requires the Parliament
to nominate one of its members for appointment by Her Majesty as First
Minister. The selection of a nominee will be conducted in accordance with
the provisions of rule 11.10 of the standing orders.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Before we begin the selection process,
you may find it helpful if I outline the voting process and explain how
the electronic voting system works, as this will be the first time that
you have used the system for parliamentary business.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To register a vote, you should insert your
card in the console at the desk with the picture facing you, so that you
can gaze at it with admiration all afternoon. Inserting the card will activate
the voting and microphone systems. The red light on the console should
go out when you insert the card. You are nothing without that piece of
plastic-I cannot stress that enough. You can neither vote nor speak without
it, so it is important that you have it. If any technical problems arise,
rather than raising a point of order, please tell the clerks at the back
of the chamber, who will be able to help you.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you want to speak, you must press the
white microphone button once. That indicates a request to speak on the
screen on my desk. However, you cannot speak until called to do so-the
white button does not activate the microphone. When you speak, you should
stand. If members want to make a point of order, they should activate the
white button and stand to call for a point of order. They can then speak
when I call them to speak.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

for this afternoon's selection of a nominee for appointment as First Minister.
I have received four valid nominations for appointment as First Minister.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I shall shortly ask those members who wish
to cast their vote for Dennis Canavan to do so. You should remember that
there will be four rounds of voting. Members will have 30 seconds in which
to cast their vote. Before the voting period, I shall invite each member
to speak in support of his candidacy for up to two minutes. Once voting
for all candidates has taken place, I will ask those members who have not
voted, but who wish to record an abstention, to do so.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Members should vote only once, and should
use only the yes button. If any member casts more than one yes vote, the
votes will be treated as spoilt, and none of them will be counted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Once the voting has been completed and
the result verified, I shall announce the number of votes cast, the number
of votes for each of the candidates and the number of abstentions. Any
candidate who receives more votes than the total number of votes for all
the other candidates in that round shall be selected as the Parliament's
nominee. If no candidate receives a majority of votes, I shall announce
that the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated from the process
and that a further round of voting will be held for the remaining candidates.
Members will again be able to vote yes for one of the candidates or to
abstain.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I should remind members that, for the result
to be valid, more than a quarter of all members-that is, at least 33 members-must
have voted. That includes members who abstain. Members should also be aware
that, if all the candidates in any round of voting receive the same number
of votes, the rules provide that no candidate is selected. In that case,
it would be necessary for me to adjourn the meeting to allow the timing
for a new selection period to be determined.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

your discretion to allow 10 minutes for each of the candidates to speak.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> I considered
that matter this morning. I have to inform the Parliament that there was
no agreement among the candidates as to what should happen. The standing

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Frankly, we are not engaged in a political
debate this afternoon; we are engaged in an election. I do not have to
allow any speeches at all. However, I have decided to allow each of the
candidates to make a two-minute address. That seems to be a reasonable
compromise in the circumstances. Some of the candidates were happier that
we should proceed straight to the ballot, as we did yesterday.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that my decision to allow a two-minute address was not fully conveyed to
you; I am sorry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I accept your apology for the fact that we were not informed earlier and
I accept that you cannot be held responsible for everything. However, I
have to object to the idea that this is not a political discussion. We
are about to appoint the First Minister for Scotland. That is a very political
appointment and surely all the candidates should have the right to present
their cases to win the support of each and every MSP in this chamber. If
possible, I would like to put it to the vote that each of the properly
nominated candidates has 10 minutes in which to present his case. I do
not know whether we can formally put it to the vote; I think that that

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> One of the
worst habits of the House of Commons in the past decade has been the bogus
use of points of order. I propose to be very strict; points of argument
are not points of order. Points of order are for the occupant of the chair;
if we degenerate into the habit of using them as points of argument, we
shall develop some of the worst habits of a place that some of us have

Canavan (Falkirk West):</strong> First, I thank Tommy Sheridan and Robin Harper
for proposing and seconding me. I also thank my constituents in Falkirk
West and the voters throughout Central Scotland who supported me in the
second ballot and helped to reinforce the message from the voters of Falkirk
West. I find myself in the unique situation of having won a seat in the
Parliament on both ballots, but it may come as some consolation to other
members that I intend to take only one seat and register only one vote.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am also unique in being the only member
of the Parliament who is not a member of any party. In view of that fact,
and in view of the fact that no party has an overall majority in the Parliament,
there may be some advantage in our having a leader of the Administration
who is a member with no vested interest in any party. [<i>Laughter.</i>]
Members may laugh, but I could have brokered a better agreement than the
shabby deal that the leader of the Scottish Labour party and the Liberal
Democrats seem to have cobbled up behind closed doors. Part of the problem
seems to be that somebody was pulling the strings down in London.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Take tuition fees, for example. The majority
of members of this Parliament were elected on a clear commitment to abolish
tuition fees; that commitment was given to the people of Scotland. Now
there is to be a review-a review is just Westminster-speak for a fudge.
We have just had a review-it was called an election. We, the people who
want to abolish tuition fees, won the election. I would like to see the
abolition of tuition fees combined with the restoration of student grants,
particularly for students from low-income families.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

system throughout Scotland. We need to improve our national health service

the people and responds to the needs of the people. Above all, we need
a First Minister for Scotland who will speak for Scotland instead of someone
who will act as Tony Blair's puppet.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

is that, under the standing orders, each election is a separate one. The
election is for Mr Canavan or against him. That is the way it is set out.

instruct us to proceed. It is not a competitive election among four candidates.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I shall do my best, within the standing orders, to meet the wishes of members.

am well aware that, unless there is a sudden, widespread and highly unlikely
outbreak of common sense, my candidacy for First Minister will not succeed
this afternoon. However, I will lay down two important and symbolic markers
for this Parliament and for my party.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First, my candidacy will symbolise our
determination to be a constructive Opposition in the Parliament, working
to make it a success for Scotland in the context of the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Conservatives are the unionist alternative to the Lib-Lab
Government that has been stitched up behind the backs of the voters, just
as, time and again during the election campaign, we predicted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With respect to the singular achievements
of three individual members of the Parliament, as from today Scotland no
longer has a four-party system; rather, it has a three-party system. The
fortunes of Labour and of the Liberal Democrats are inextricably linked,
and are on the wane. We should thank Mr Dewar and Mr Wallace for this simplification,
but it comes with a hefty price tag: the second deception and betrayal
of our young people and their families-this time by the Liberal Democrats-and
the continuation of Labour's &pound;3,000 tax on learning. Others may bend
out of self-interest, but we are resolute in our determination to bring
the matter of tuition fees to this chamber at the earliest opportunity
and to see them abolished in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second principle that I wish to affirm
by standing for this office is the determination of the Scottish Conservatives
to be not just a parliamentary party in Scotland, but a party which aspires
to government in Scotland again. Today, our ambition will almost certainly
not be fulfilled, but it is a goal which I am determined we will one day
achieve. It is with great pride that, as the first in my party to do so,
I submit my candidacy for this office to this Parliament. [<i>Applause.</i>]</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):
</strong>I am making the fourth speech, and that rather makes the point that
this is a Parliament of minorities-some are bigger than others, but none
the less it is a Parliament of minorities. After last week's vote, it was
said to me that seven out of 10 people had not voted for the Scottish National
party. That is true, but six out of 10 people did not vote for the Labour
party. In the second vote the figure was two out of three. Incidentally,
that was the lowest Labour vote in Scotland since 1931.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are majority positions in the platform
that we put forward. There is a majority in this Parliament, on a free
vote, to abolish tuition fees and to restore support to students from low-income
families. It would be a dreadful start for this new Parliament if that
majority was somehow frustrated by some deal that has been done behind
the scenes. Mr Canavan said that we should all know about the deal. What
concerns me even more is that some Liberal members may not know the full
extent of the deal. For the Parliament's sake, it would be a bad start
if that majority position, for which people voted last week, was frustrated
this week. We should vote to allow the majority will to prevail, and, to
me, tuition fees are non-negotiable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a degree of concern about the
threat that the private finance initiative poses to vital public services
such as health and education. That concern extends outwith the SNP and
into the ranks of other parties in this Parliament. That concern, and the
support in this Parliament for the proper funding of public services, should
be reflected. As a candidate for First Minister, I would like to reflect
it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After last week's local elections, there
is mounting concern-perhaps majority concern in this Parliament-about why
there is not proportional representation for local government in Scotland.
I would like to see that reflected in the way in which an Administration
pursues its policies in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On some minority issues, such as giving
people in Scotland the right to vote for national freedom and independence,
we hope to build a majority. However, over and above those individual issues
there is an overriding one that should be part and parcel of the hopes
of every member of this chamber; that whoever is elected should be Scotland's
First Minister and not play second fiddle to forces in London, whether
that be the Prime Minister or his press secretary, who seemed to take such
an interest in the negotiations that were going on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

I have no doubt about that. The people of Scotland look to us to use the

have common aims.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the benefit of the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

This must be a Parliament of Scotland's people. We must look beyond the
walls of this place to the people of Scotland. I pledge that I will lead
a Government that will listen and respond to what the people of Scotland
tell us. Co-operation is always possible where there are common aims and
values, even though there may be great and dividing differences in other
areas. I want to harness that potential good will, not just on behalf of
this Parliament and those who have the privilege of serving in it, but
on behalf of the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Scotland in its first Administration for 300 years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have known Donald for a considerable
time, usually on opposing ends of debates and arguments in television studios.
One thing I can say is that although I know and hope that Donald will speak
for Scotland, he will certainly eat for Scotland at every opportunity.
At this juncture, I wish him well. He should not look so surprised-this
is well meant. I wish the Administration well in terms of the policies
it wants to pursue; as yet, I do not know what the full terms of the Administration
are, and I suspect that a number of people are waiting to ask the same
question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would like to say a few words about the
nature of opposition. There has been some debate about how we can have
the new consensus politics and still have vigorous debate. I suggest that
we can have both. Those of us who have served in Westminster know full
well what people mean&nbsp;</font></td>

that in this new chamber. Therefore, as Leader of the Opposition, let me
say that when the Administration proposes things that we think are in the
interests of the Scottish people, we will not criticise for the sake of
it. However, there will still be substantial issues-some of which Mr Canavan
and I outlined a little earlier-that will provoke real political debate.
That is necessary and part and parcel of any democratic chamber.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

such an Opposition is every bit as important to a new democracy as the

Conservative party, I offer my congratulations to Donald Dewar on being
the Parliament's nominee to Her Majesty the Queen for appointment as Scotland's
First Minister. It is a great personal achievement on Donald's part and
a great culmination to his career. On a personal level, I wish him fulfilment,
added short-term lustre to a distinguished political career and, of course,
a very happy retirement in 2003.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Dewar said that he looked forward to
working closely with colleagues. Depending on what my colleagues and his
colleagues decide-perhaps later today-that working relationship may be
very close indeed. I hope that it will be, because I believe that many
of the aims that Mr Dewar has set out are shared not only by his party
and by my party, but by many others in the Parliament. I hope that, together,
we will show that the Parliament can make a difference to the people of
Scotland-a difference for the better. We will be judged on that over the
coming four years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to and will reflect on some of the things that I said earlier, as well
as consider what other members will say in the important months and years
that lie ahead. Above all, I hope that, as the First Minister for Scotland,
Donald will show that he is a firm believer in open democracy, rather than
in doing deals with certain people at dead of night or early in the morning.
I hope that he will treat all members of the Parliament as equals. He is
primus in paribus. I hope that he will act as the spokesperson for Scotland,
rather than as somebody else's spokesperson in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Once upon a time, Donald said that I was
not good enough to sit in the Scottish Parliament. In the years that lie
ahead, I only hope that he proves himself good enough to be Scotland's
First Minister. Despite the fact that we have had profound political disagreements
in the past and, no doubt, will have more in the future, to show that I
bear him no personal malice I would like to shake his hand. [<i>Applause</i>.]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> Your gesture
was appreciated, Dennis, but if you do it again I will rule you out of
order, as it is out of order to cross the well of the chamber. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>I rise in the spirit
of the consensual nature of the Parliament. Robin and I are representatives
of small political parties, and it is only proper that I remind David McLetchie
that, regardless of what he or members of the other three parties think
of the Lib-Lab pact, a further two political parties are represented in
this chamber. I hope that they will remember that in the future.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the representative of a small party,
I think that it is important to congratulate Mr Dewar on his nomination
as First Minister. I hope that the consensus on raising the living standards
of ordinary working men and women across Scotland that was expressed during
the campaign will become the priority of this Parliament. As long as bills
are introduced with that in mind, the Scottish Socialist party will be
willing to support Donald. [<i>Applause.</i>]</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green): </strong>As
the very last member to be elected to this Parliament, and as the first
Green ever to be elected to any Parliament in Britain, I wish to offer
my unqualified congratulations to Donald Dewar on his nomination to this
post, which he so richly deserves.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie: </strong>I wish to raise a point
of order.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> I hope that
it is a real one this time, Mr Gallie.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Mr Gallie. That was a genuine point of order. Under our standing orders,
