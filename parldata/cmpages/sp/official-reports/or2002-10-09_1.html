Assembly.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Very Rev Dr 
James L Weatherhead (Former Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of 
Scotland): </strong>Thank you. Forty years ago, in May 1962, I was for the first time 
a member of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland meeting in this hall 
and I spoke in support of a proposal for a Scottish parliament. I do not claim 
that my persuasion moved the general assembly, which was minded to support such 
a proposal anyway. My proposal was only one of many irrelevant or superfluous 
speeches made in this hall before and since.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before 
the Scottish Parliament was established, people used to say that the general assembly 
was the nearest thing that Scotland had to a parliament. If that was true, it 
meant that Scotland was a long way in those days from having a real parliament. 
That is not to denigrate the general assembly, but to say just that it is different.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
explicit basis of Church of Scotland government is the sovereignty of God, not 
the sovereignty of the Queen in Parliament or the sovereignty of the people. That 
is made explicit in the constitution of the Church of Scotland, as recognised, 
but not imposed or granted, by the Church of Scotland Act 1921. That constitution 
states:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This Church 
as part of the Universal Church wherein the Lord Jesus Christ has appointed a 
government in the hands of Church office-bearers, receives from Him, its Divine 
King and Head, and From Him alone, the right and power subject to no civil authority 
to legislate, and to adjudicate finally, in all matters of doctrine, worship, 
government, and discipline in the Church.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
constitution, however, also says:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This 
Church acknowledges the divine appointment and authority of the civil magistrate 
within his own sphere, and maintains its historic testimony to the duty of the 
nation acting in its corporate capacity to render homage to God, to acknowledge 
the Lord Jesus Christ to be King over the nations, to obey His laws, to reverence 
His ordinances, to honour His Church, and to promote in all appropriate ways the 
Kingdom of God.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14480">14480</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is clearly derived from what 
St Paul wrote in his Epistle to the Romans:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Let 
every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: 
the powers that be are ordained of God ... he&#151;&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">that

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David 
Steel): </strong>We come now to the first item of business, which is the statement 
by the Minister for Education and Young People, Cathy Jamieson, on the national 
debate on education. I ask those who want to ask questions after the statement 
to indicate that on the screen.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14:34</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Minister for Education and Young People (Cathy Jamieson): </strong>In March, when I 
launched the national debate on education, I set out the following aims: to have 
a once-in-a-decade opportunity for everyone to think about what sort of education 
we want for young people in Scotland; to consider how education will offer the 
right opportunities for our children and young people to meet their aspirations, 
achieve their potential and build the future that is right for them; to examine 
the place of education in building Scotland's future; and to share views with 
each other, the Parliament and the Executive.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have been delighted at the level of involvement in the debate from individuals 
and organisations across the country. I have been particularly pleased that young 
people have wanted to be involved and make their views known. Today, I want to 
share with you some of what was said during the debate and the pointers that we 
have been given.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am pleased 
that young people and parents who were involved in the debate are in the gallery 
today and I welcome them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
effort and enthusiasm of the people who participated in the debate was overwhelming. 
More than 800 events took place across Scotland and we estimate that more than 
20,000 people took part in the debate. For any consultation, that is a tremendous 
response. It means that we can draw conclusions and identify the areas where consensus 
is clear, the areas that are working well and those areas in which we must modernise 
our approach. A wide range of organisations and people&#151;employers, parents' 
groups, local authorities, groups from many faiths, children's organisations, 
young people with experience of the care system and homelessness, prisoners and 
equality groups&#151;took part in many different ways, from big national conferences 
to groups in local halls and in people's homes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Out 
of around 1,500 responses received, some 400 cover pupils' views. I believe that 
the views of pupils are central to the future of Scotland's education. Education 
should not be something that we do to our young people. Today's pupils are the 
future citizens of Scotland. They are our future </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14482">14482</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">parents, teachers, employers, health 
workers, lawyers and farmers. They have a real stake in the future.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
important feature of the debate is the partnership with the Education, Culture 
and Sport Committee. All the responses that were received in the debate are being 
shared with the committee, and I welcome its enthusiastic support for the debate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
not everyone was enthusiastic. Some people&#151;including a few teachers&#151;were 
sceptical about the process. One teacher said in his response:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I 
firmly believe that no one pays any heed to what I write in these consultation 
documents so when you read this get in touch".</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
did so. I have a message for that teacher, and for everyone else who took part: 
we have listened; your views count; and by taking part you have made a difference. 
We will show that our response is based on your views.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
commissioned an independent team at the University of Edinburgh, led by Professor 
Pamela Munn, to analyse the responses on our behalf. We are treating the debate 
seriously. With the volume of responses received, producing the full analysis 
and the fully considered response will take some time. However, to give an early 
indication of the views received we are publishing an initial report today. It 
is not the final word, but gives an overview of what has been said and what matters 
to people. Some of the messages are hard ones for me as a minister, but we are 
publishing the University of Edinburgh's report, including all the concerns, because 
those who took part in the debate deserve to hear an honest and full report of 
what was said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do 
the responses tell us so far? Education matters to Scotland. There is clear evidence 
of that from the numbers who took part in the debate. There is a pride in Scottish 
education. People do not want to lose comprehensive schools and a broadly based 
curriculum. This is not a faceless system. To pupils and parents, teachers are 
essential, and they are doing a good job.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
was pleased, but not surprised to see such positive messages. Every day, I see 
creative and innovative work in our schools. There is a fundamental strength to 
the education system in Scotland that we should bear in mind as we look to the 
future. We should not be afraid to change, where change is needed to improve the 
quality and relevance of the education service that our children receive. We must 
make it our business to improve where we must and ensure that we make continuous 
improvements within a stable framework.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
also heard that people were worried about </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14483">14483</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the pace of change&#151;parents and 
pupils as well as teachers. They see a school system that is suffering from too 
many initiatives. They desperately want some stability, but they recognise the 
need to change some things.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
people were concerned about the level of resources for schools and the standards 
of buildings and equipment and want there to be more and better-skilled teachers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
were concerns about class sizes. People want pupils to get the attention and support 
that they need from teachers. There were also concerns about discipline. People 
want discipline problems to be taken seriously and dealt with effectively.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People 
were proud of the broad and balanced Scottish curriculum but saw problems with 
a curriculum that appears to be becoming overloaded. There was, therefore, strong 
support for the development of a core curriculum that would allow flexibility 
for schools to meet individual needs and talents&#151;for example, by providing 
more time for art, drama, music and sport&#151;and for pupils to have the chance 
to take short courses. There was also support for learning opportunities that 
would challenge our more able pupils.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
were concerns about the amount of assessment in schools and worries that there 
is now too much grading and sorting of children during their school careers. Those 
concerns point to real tensions. How do we balance the strength of Scottish education&#151;which, 
for years, has offered us the opportunity to become rounded, informed citizens&#151;with 
the need to meet the potential of each child and equip her or him with the skills 
and experience that are needed to find a job and achieve economic independence?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People 
wanted a stable framework&#151;but with flexibility for more school-level control 
of resources and decisions. Where is the right balance to be struck? How do we 
provide equality of opportunity and provision throughout the country, but leave 
room for local decisions to be made when that is the best way to meet needs?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parents 
and pupils rightly want to be well-informed about education and involved in school 
decisions. I know that that is happening already in lots of ways&#151;through 
school boards, parent-teacher associations and pupil councils, for instance&#151;but 
it could be more effective. We need to do more. We should take a hard look at 
how we make that happen. How could we make better use of information technology 
for parents as well as pupils? How can we make sure that there is on-going contact 
rather than just occasional involvement? How can we get parents into schools&#151;as 
well as getting information out&#151;to ensure an active, dynamic relationship 
that places </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14484">14484</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">schools at the heart of the community?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
address those tensions and search out the right balance is not an impossible task, 
but it demands reflection and thought and requires us to work together. Over the 
next few months we will develop our full response to the views and questions, 
but some key aspects are already clear, particularly the need for stability and 
flexibility. We need to build a clear national framework that lets schools and 
authorities concentrate on meeting individual pupils' needs and enables local 
delivery, rather than burden schools with unnecessary bureaucracy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
national debate on Scotland's education has taken place at a time of great awareness 
of the need to ensure that pupils leave school and higher and further education 
with the range of skills that will enable them to compete for jobs and to contribute 
to building a competitive Scotland. The Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring 
that our education system is of high quality and a global leader and that it plays 
a full role in helping to secure that competitive Scotland. Our challenge is to 
ensure that we build on existing strengths while modernising the education system 
to face the new challenges. By modernisation, we mean taking account of new thinking, 
new technology, new knowledge and new skills.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
need the right framework in place to do that and we have made a solid start. One 
of the first acts of this Parliament was to recognise the right of every child 
in Scotland to an education that fulfils his or her potential. Most important, 
the McCrone agreement that modernised teachers' conditions and introduced professional 
pay levels means that we can now recruit, train and reward the right teachers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those 
first steps and the conclusions from the education debate reveal the need for 
a closer and more productive relationship between those who manage, deliver and 
receive education and the Executive. I have already begun to build that relationship. 
I have today announced the repeal of the outdated Schools (Scotland) Code 1956 
and we are investing more than £1 billion in school buildings, using the public-private 
partnership mechanism.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
are committed to doing even more to ensure that we have the right environment 
for learning. Through the Scottish budget for the next three years, we have provided 
for record levels of resources for schools. Those resources will enable us to 
build a modern education environment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
our education is to be fit for purpose in future, then teachers need the highest 
quality of training. I am determined to deliver just that. I announced today the 
next stage of our review of initial teacher education. The first-stage report 
was received last </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14485">14485</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">year and is now being implemented. 
I have commissioned Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education to carry out a scoping 
review of initial teacher education and to report to me in early 2003. That will 
give us up-to-date evidence on current practice to inform the second-stage review.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those 
developments have cleared the ground. They pave the way and put key elements of 
the new education framework in place. It is the right framework to allow schools 
to deliver, but we must go further and examine how we might build on the guiding 
principles of our truly comprehensive system to build a system that meets the 
needs of all the children in our schools. That must not mean limiting the ambitions 
of any group.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A smart, 
successful Scotland will be secured only if we get beyond narrow, subject-based 
knowledge. We want to encourage and support young people to become creative, enterprising 
citizens. In order to secure that we need high-quality vocational education as 
one of the options available, not just for those staying on in the fifth year 
of secondary school because of when their 16<SUP>th</SUP> birthday falls, but 
right through school.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Schools 
need to work more closely with further and higher education, developing lasting 
partnerships. More involvement is needed with the real world of work in order 
to develop young people's ability to put knowledge into practice, to try out their 
skills and for them to be prepared for the world after school.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
need to secure better transitions from primary school to secondary school, and 
from the pre-five stage to primary, while recognising the needs of individual 
children and their development. We need to ensure that schools of the future have 
access to staff with the right skills and knowledge&#151;teachers, specialists 
and support staff&#151;who are best placed to provide pupils with the knowledge 
and skills that they need. We must not limit ourselves to arithmetical solutions 
to class sizes, but should bring more adults into the classroom to support teachers. 
We must find new ways to work in smaller groups, using other professional skills 
to support young people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
strongest message from the debate is that people do not want more and more initiatives. 
I have heard that time and again when I have visited schools. I agree with that, 
but I intend to challenge everyone to aim for excellence and to deliver it. I 
will drive forward an agenda of continuous improvement in education. Just as we 
must avoid change for its own sake, stability must not mean stagnation. I want 
teachers, parents and other education professionals to work with us to create 
the stable framework that people want and to find ways of increasing flexibility 
in organising learning and teaching at a local level, while keeping pupils at 
the centre of schools and </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14486">14486</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">schools at the heart of their communities. 
I want us to have a shared vision for the future that ensures that every school 
is a centre of excellence. That means that teachers, parents, pupils and policy 
makers&#151;all of us who care about education&#151;must keep working together 
to make the changes that will deliver for young people. Those changes will ensure 
that Scotland is a world leader in education, and they will build on our strengths, 
modernise and move us forward together.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
is about building on strengths and tackling weaknesses; it is about building an 
education system that is fit for purpose; and it is about building an education 
system that is fit for the future. Most important, it is about building an education 
service that is worthy of our young people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>I have received a large number of requests to ask questions. 
It will not be possible to fit everybody in, but the shorter everybody's questions 
and answers, the more questions we will get in.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Fiona 
Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>I thank the Minister for Education and Young People 
for her statement, and ask that she accepts Michael Russell's apologies. He is 
on a previously arranged parliamentary delegation to Quebec. I am not sure whether 
his remit includes repairing relationships, but that is a different matter.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let 
me turn to the heart of the issue. Does the minister agree that there is a difference 
between consultation with a blank piece of paper and the role of Government in 
leading the country and implementing action? I acknowledge that this is a long-term 
project, but point out that babies who were born within weeks of Labour coming 
to power in 1997 are now in primary 1. Can we ensure that the children of today 
do not miss out on vital Government action?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
note the press release that was issued before the minister made her statement, 
about the fact that the Schools (Scotland) Code 1956 is being phased out. How 
can that happen when so many references and terms are subject to continuing negotiation?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is crystal clear from the University of Edinburgh's report that there is a strong 
desire for smaller class sizes, something which the minister apparently wearies 
of hearing about from the Scottish National Party, although that desire carries 
a weight of popular support. What exactly will the Government do for today's pupils 
that will involve investment in additional teachers, rather than just moves towards 
composite classes or having additional classroom assistants? In recent years the 
Government's favourite method of reducing class sizes to 30 in primaries 1 to 
3 has </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14487">14487</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">been to have composite classes. That 
method is not based on any sound, substantial research&#151;something that the 
Government has itself acknowledged. Is the Government going to bring more teachers 
into the classroom, or will it be a case of trying to do arithmetic with an adult 
to pupil ratio instead of a teacher to pupil ratio, bearing in mind the fact that 
there were 95 fewer primary school teachers last year than in 2000, according 
to the most recent schools census?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let 
me turn to the consultation responses concerning an over-emphasis on external 
assessment, an issue that was also raised by the SNP. What action does the minister 
anticipate to reverse the growing trend, so that children can acquire basic skills 
without the straitjacket of external assessment? The report refers to choice in 
the curriculum. How can one have choice in the curriculum if one is in a straitjacket 
of external assessment? What does the minister know now that she did not know 
before the extensive exercise started?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>I did not think that I would miss Mike Russell, but he might have 
asked a question more quickly. I do not have the time to respond in detail to 
the many points that Fiona Hyslop raised. If I did respond to all her points, 
the Presiding Officer would not have time to fit in any more questions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
are taking action. It is not a case of the Executive sitting back and not taking 
action on education. We have increased the number of adults who are working in 
classrooms. If the member went into classrooms as often as I do, she would know 
that the classroom assistants programme has been welcomed by teachers. It has 
removed the administrative burden from teachers and is providing opportunities 
for young people to have the support that they need.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Schools (Scotland) Code 1956 was mentioned. A parliamentary question was answered 
this morning. The repeal of the part of the schools code that refers to early 
years education was signalled some time ago in guidance. Anyone who has been following 
the education debate would know that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fiona 
Hyslop has asked about whether it is the role of Government to consult. In a truly 
democratic society, it is the role of Government to lead. Although we will not 
shirk from leading, we will also work with communities, who are often not consulted, 
with young people, who are at the centre of education, and with teachers. We will 
work with everyone to come to a consensus and we will move forward. I make no 
apologies for that. The national debate has gone to places to which other consultations 
would not have dreamed of going.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14488">14488</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

of my colleague Brian Monteith, who usually fills this seat. He is widening his 
waistline in Bournemouth.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
am not surprised that the minister is pleased with the support that is shown for 
the comprehensive system. When the full responses are published, I suspect that 
many will prove to be from the usual suspects, who have a vested interest in the 
continuance of the current system, which benefits some, but fails too many&#151;especially 
the least well off. All too often, the comprehensive system condemns pupils living 
in deprived areas to a sub-standard education from a failing school. If we wanted 
to design a school system that had the express aim of perpetuating social divisions, 
it would be hard to see how the Scottish Executive could improve on the present 
arrangements.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members should

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fraser seemed to imply. That is simply 
not the case. The consultation exercise has produced positive comments from parents 
and others&#151;some of whom are sitting in the gallery&#151;who are involved 
and who want to be involved in their schools and who want their schools to be 
at the heart of the local community. That is fundamental to the way in which we 
will proceed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will make 
the changes that are needed to ensure that every child has the opportunity to 
realise their ambitions and to build on their talents. That will not mean a fundamental 
dismantling of the present system. The vast majority of respondents to the debate 
were clear about that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>For the Liberal Democrats, I call Ian Jenkins.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ian 
Jenkins (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD): </strong>The minister will know that 
I welcome the education debate. I look forward to reflecting on the submissions 
more fully, but in the meantime I welcome the way in which the consultation has 
endorsed the comprehensive system and the comprehensive nature of Scottish education. 
I welcome the way in which it has expressed positive confidence in the quality 
and effectiveness of the teaching that is offered to our youngsters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
want to ask the minister two questions. First, will she assure the Parliament 
that the period of reflection that she mentioned will not stand in the way of 
on-going action, such as her commitment to cut the amount of bureaucracy and paperwork, 
which is a blight on the current arrangements in schools?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, 
and more broadly, what way forward does the minister see for reconciling the quite 
difficult dilemmas that are inherent in the submissions? For example, on the one 
hand there is a clear perception that the curriculum is overcrowded; on the other 
hand, there is a clear wish to expand provision in certain areas, such as physical 
education, sport, music, art, drama and citizenship. Similarly, there is a perceived 
need for a core element in the curriculum, but a strong wish for choice, pluralism 
and flexibility within the system. There is a clear wish for stability, yet there 
is recognition that development is needed. What mechanisms can we adopt to move 
forward in those regards?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>Those are important points that go to the heart of what we are attempting 
to achieve. First, I want to give reassurance that a period of reflection is not 
about disappearing behind closed doors never to come out again, but about engaging 
in the process, looking at the information that we received from the debate and 
taking action on that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">already. For example, Ian Jenkins 
asked about bureaucracy. We have streamlined what was formerly the excellence 
fund to become the new national priorities action fund to give local authorities 
more flexibility over how they use those resources. Crucially, we have lifted 
some of the difficulties around the way in which local authorities are required 
to account for and report on the use of those resources. We have done that to 
give local authorities flexibility.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
recognise that there are dilemmas, but that is why it is important that we realise 
that this stage of the debate is part of a process. We want to continue to engage 
with the education professionals and with others. We also want to consider in 
some detail some of the quite creative ideas that the debate has thrown up, such 
as how we might reorganise the school day or the school week to allow for some 
of the additional opportunities that young people clearly want. We would want 
to do that while at the same time ensuring that every young person gets the core 
curriculum that will serve them well in later life.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The

Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab): </strong>I welcome the minister's statement and the co-operation 
that has existed between the minister and the Education, Culture and Sport Committee. 
Some key themes have emerged from both inquiries into education, which have been 
very much welcomed. The committee received responses that were not just from the 
usual suspects or vested interests, and that has been positive.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
first question concerns curriculum flexibility and physical activity, about which 
several issues have emerged. Will the minister give us a flavour of what came 
through the consultation on that and how she aims to respond? My second question 
is about rural schools. In the gallery today are pupils from Crawford Primary. 
Will the minister indicate how the national debate is helping to shape the education 
that children in such rural schools receive?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy

in which the Education, Culture and Sport Committee has worked with the Executive 
on this exercise. That has been valuable for us all.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
curriculum flexibility, some of the issues that were raised about physical activity 
concerned the resources that are available to schools. Some issues were about 
people wanting greater access to specialists&#151;which was not necessarily always 
a call for additional PE teachers&#151;and to people who are active and excelling 
in sports. We need to look at how we can build in some of those issues.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14491">14491</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On rural schools, what came through 
strongly was that, because of their very geography, many communities rely on small 
local schools and want those schools to remain. Interestingly, and crucially, 
education authorities are prepared to consider how those resources can be managed 
and utilised in a different way, such as by allowing teachers, head teachers and 
others to work in groups and in clusters. That is the kind of creative thinking 
that we want to continue. We have to consider how best we can get the flexibility 
that allows decisions to be made at local level. We will continue to work with 
the committee on developing such ideas.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Marilyn 
Livingstone (Kirkcaldy) (Lab): </strong>Education in Scotland should address the needs 
of all pupils, as the minister proposes. The service should be fit for purpose

of disabled and special needs pupils been addressed in the review, to ensure that 
they are able to play a full and equal role?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>That is an important issue; I was not able to develop it in my statement 
so I am pleased to answer that question now.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
have to take the issue of young people with special needs and disabilities very 
seriously. As part of the consultation process, we engaged with Children in Scotland 
and other organisations to ensure that some events directly involved children 
and young people who had disabilities or special needs. I was pleased to attend 
events and to hear directly from those children and young people. They gave a 
powerful message that they want this process to be about not only changes to buildings 
and all the physical issues around education, but changes in attitude. They want 
us all to be genuinely committed to working with them so that they can get the 
best out of life&#151;not only in school but when they move into adulthood. We 
will continue to develop that theme alongside the work that we are doing on developing 
a new special educational needs strategy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dennis 
Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>Murdo Fraser spoke about the comprehensive system. 
Will the minister confirm that comprehensive education received widespread support 
from the 20,000 people across Scotland who took part in the national debate? Will 
she make it absolutely clear that the Scottish Executive will reject Tony Blair's 
clarion call to the Labour party conference last week that we must now move to

parents, teachers and&#151;most important&#151;young people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How 
does the minister intend to reduce class sizes? As important, how will she secure 
an approach that values learning in small groups?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>Cathy Peattie has hit the nail on the head. When we talk to young 
people, parents and teachers, they talk about the importance of being able to 
work in small groups. Some of the creative responses that we received considered 
how schools or classes could be reorganised to allow much more of that kind of 
teaching where necessary or appropriate. There are other opportunities for bringing 
together larger groups of young people to deal with certain issues. I was at an 
event a couple of weeks ago that brought together a couple of hundred young people 
from schools right across a local authority area to do work on citizenship education. 
Those are the kind of things that people are beginning to say can be done. We 
do not need to limit ourselves into boxes; we can get additional people and additional 
specialists into schools to work with young people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
give the reassurance that we will continue to work with the people and groups 
that have contributed to the debate so far. We have generated a huge amount of 
interest. The issues that people are talking about might not be the issues that 
we would have thought about in the early stages, but we now have a responsibility 
to move forward and to continue to work with those groups as we introduce concrete

the minister aware of last week's Audit Scotland report, which said that going 
down the intended PPP route will cost an extra 2 to 3 per cent in additional interest

easily covers the £742,140 that it would cost to employ the 31 secondary school

Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning (Iain Gray): </strong>I am 
pleased to introduce this debate. The debate itself is an introduction, because 
its essential purpose is to allow members to contribute to the consultation process 
on air transport, which was launched by Alistair Darling, the Secretary of State 
for Transport, in July, and which will close at the end of November. The process 
is taking place across the United Kingdom. A suite of consultation documents and 
technical studies provide a variety of detailed growth scenarios and outline the 
likely infrastructure requirements.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
Scotland, the consultation process is being conducted jointly by the Department 
for Transport and the Scottish Executive. Compared with the situation prior to 
devolution, Scotland is in a strong position because many of the key areas are 
devolved. Land-use planning, surface access and the management of publicly owned 
airports are our responsibilities. Licensing, safety, security and environmental 
policy are reserved matters, along with international agreements, economic regulation 
and slot policy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The aviation 
industry is critical to Scotland's future, not only because it is worth £0.6 billion 
a year to the Scottish economy and provides directly 15,000 jobs&#151;and at least 
as many again through multiplier effects&#151;but because it links our nation 
to the rest of the world. Air links bind nations together. Airports and air services 
promote economic growth by increasing access to markets and suppliers, and by 
encouraging inward investment and tourism. Airports themselves act as focuses 
for clusters of businesses.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
aviation sector is growing. The success story in Scotland is one of dramatic growth 
with passenger numbers doubling in the last decade. The Scottish consultation 
document indicates that the current 18 million passengers a year who pass through 
Scottish airports may well increase to somewhere between 26 million and 50 million 
by 2030. The document also outlines the potential for air freight and the role 
it can play. The freight sector is subdivided into different categories, with 
dedicated cargo flights by freight aircraft&#151;either scheduled or chartered&#151;as 
well as belly-hold </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14497">14497</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

forecasts that 1.8 million passengers a year will use Inverness airport by 2030, 
whereas the Department for Transport estimates that that figure will be only 800,000? 
Why does the Department for Transport estimate 1 million fewer passengers than 
HIAL estimates, if those organisations are working together in partnership?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Iain 
Gray: </strong>Predictions for a period as long as that to 2030 are not an exact science. 
That is why the prediction for the number of passengers passing through Scotland 
by 2030 is between 26 and 50 million, which I freely acknowledge is a wide range. 
Perhaps HIAL's estimate shows its ambitiousness to develop its business in Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dynamic 
growth is predicted for all three categories of freight. Scotland could have dramatic 
growth in freight tonnage from 119,000 tonnes in 2000 to more than 570,000 tonnes

centre at Prestwick?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Iain 
Gray: </strong>As the consultation process makes clear, we are in constant discussion

Of course air traffic control is part of that. I agree with Mr Gallie that safety 
is key. One challenge of the consultation, as we consider dramatic growth, is 
to allow and facilitate our industry to grow in a way that in no way compromises 
air travel safety, which is to the forefront of everyone's minds these days.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Glasgow 
Prestwick airport has established itself as a major freight hub for Scotland and 
the UK. Glasgow airport has a healthy belly-hold freight operation. Edinburgh 
airport is the dominant airmail centre for Scotland and its position in the central 
belt, its road links and its proximity to express freight users give it great 
advantages for express parcels and airmail in the future. Aberdeen airport plays 
the same role for north-east Scotland and the northern isles and Inverness airport 
plays a role in the distribution of mail and newspapers throughout the Highlands

must be taken into account, not least environmental factors. The consultation 
document, rightly, assesses the impacts at Scottish airports of the growth scenarios, 
and environmental factors include noise and air quality changes as well as the 
potential impact on ecology and heritage. Like safety, those factors are key elements

airports and something about the timetable that we face. If Mr Butler will bear 
with me, I will do so later in my speech.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
have no preconceived view on the best way of providing extra airport capacity; 
there is no hidden agenda. The consultation document sets out a range of options 
including a number of scenarios for Glasgow and Edinburgh. The document also considers 
the case for an entirely new central Scotland airport by examining an example 
site at Airth.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
a new central Scotland airport would have distinct advantages in terms of route 
development, we have to recognise that it would be extremely expensive and time-consuming 
to develop, even if a site could be found that met all the environmental, safety 
and engineering requirements. Such a development presupposes that Glasgow and 
Edinburgh airports would close. However, that would result in the majority of 
passengers having to travel further to reach the airport, which would lead to 
increases in cost, congestion, and pollution. Given suitable investment, our other 
major airports at Aberdeen and Glasgow Prestwick have the capacity to handle higher 
volumes, as is the case at Edinburgh and Glasgow. All those options must be discussed 
fully.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill 
(Lothians) (SNP): </strong>Does the minister accept that one of the reasons that Scotland 
underperforms in respect of passenger numbers is landing charges? The Office of 
Fair Trading report into charter flight supplements indicated that landing charges 
at Glasgow and Aberdeen were significantly higher than the landing charges at 
Manchester and Newcastle. Will the minister address that point? If so, what will 
he do about it? If not, why not?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Iain 
Gray: </strong>Key to the aviation industry is the fact that it is an industry. As 
such, it is led by the marketplace. The landing charges at Glasgow and Edinburgh 
airports are a matter for the operator of the airports who has to negotiate with 
the airlines in order to create the possibility of new route development. I would 
expect that to happen.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
turn to Mr Butler's point. Glasgow and Edinburgh airports are the two largest 
airports in the United Kingdom without direct rail access. That is why the Executive 
has said that providing rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports is one of 
its top priorities. That commitment pre-dates the air transport consultation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
study to determine the value-for-money case for the links is progressing well.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">consultants are considering in more 
depth four options for each airport and I expect their recommendations on the 
preferred option at each airport in the next few weeks. With the assistance of 
the Strategic Rail Authority, BAA, which owns both airports, and the relevant 
authorities, we will be able to move the projects forward to delivery.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
necessary and unavoidable groundwork has to be done, including ensuring that the 
private bill that comes before the Parliament is robust enough to enable members 
to make informed decisions. All that groundwork suggests that the earliest starting 
date for design and construction of any link is likely to be 2005. I recognise 
that that is an ambitious timetable but, with the will and a fair wind, I believe 
that it is achievable.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like 
many members, I am keen to see an improved network of direct routes to Europe 
and beyond. In the past we have considered new routes on a case-by-case basis. 
Together with the enterprise agencies, we are now working towards a coherent route 
development strategy. However, any financial assistance to air operators must 
comply with European Union regulations on state aid. A framework is required for 
identifying the routes that provide the maximum benefit.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
that context, I am pleased that Scotland has been selected to host the ninth world 
route development forum next September. The forum is the largest gathering of 
airline network planners in the world. Well over 1,000 route development specialists 
are expected to attend one of the most important events in the aviation calendar. 
By bringing that highly prestigious forum to Scotland, we are sending out a global 
message that we want to develop air travel in Scotland to our full potential and 
ensure that we achieve maximum advantage from the benefits of strong air links. 
Securing more direct international air services for Scotland will be top of the 
agenda when the leading players in the aviation industry visit Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Access 
to the London airports is also important for Scotland. Such access gives us entry 
to markets and services in south-east England and to many interlining opportunities. 
We will work closely with the other devolved Administrations on how best to protect 
access to the south-east and on the view that we should take on extra capacity 
at the south-east airports.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
are keenly aware of the particular requirements of remote communities and their 
need to access central Scotland, south-east England and interlining opportunities 
at the big hub airports. The financial support that we have made available to

year, which represents a 207 per cent increase in Government support over a five-year 
period. In the </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14501">14501</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

expenditure will further increase to £22.1 million. That is a substantial commitment 
to HIAL and to lifeline transport links in the Highlands and Islands. The support 
that we provide will allow HIAL to continue to operate 10 airports and will keep 
airport charges at a level that can encourage the continuing development of air 
services. I understand that on Friday there will be an announcement about a new 
route from Inverness. I am sure that more details about that will follow.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Air 
services are shaped by businesses making commercial decisions. Our role in Government 
is to identify failings in the market and to be persuasive about, promote and 
legislate for the provision of public goods. In order to do that, we require a 
broad consensus about our aims for the industry that takes account of economic, 
social and environmental factors and considers the needs of all our communities. 
That is where the current consultation process comes in. We will do our best to 
ensure that everyone has a chance to contribute&#151;that is the purpose of this

I say to the minister that that is as good as I will be about the Government. 
The Government might not be doing us harm, but it is certainly not doing us any 
good. The Government might not be the worst Government in Europe, but it has a 
responsibility to govern. There has been an abdication of responsibility and a 
dereliction of duty. There are serious problems with aviation in Scotland that 
the Government has not addressed or even acknowledged.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let 
us consider the situation. Internally, we have outrageously expensive flights 
in the Highlands and Islands. The cost of those flights is sucking the lifeblood 
out of communities and is an impediment to social and economic progress. No mention 
is made of that, never mind a solution provided. In the central belt and in urban 
airports elsewhere there is a critical shortage of direct air services to Europe 
and beyond. Direct links are essential, both for tourism&#151;from an inbound 
point of view&#151;and for the economy, from an outbound point of view. Comparable 
and even smaller nations have more direct flights and better air connections.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Phil 
Gallie: </strong>Does Kenny MacAskill realise that there is an ever-increasing number 
of flights to Europe from Prestwick airport? Does he agree that that is a great 
credit to the private entrepreneurship that has been shown by the management of 
Prestwick?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr MacAskill: 
</strong>I visit Prestwick regularly, as Mr Gallie will know. I am a great supporter 
of that airport and I wish it well. It has served Scotland well and I agree with 
Mr Gallie and endorse his sentiments.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whether 
in comparison with Iceland or Ireland, Scotland falls short in relation to direct 
air services. After all, there is a direct flight from Reykjavik to Halifax in 
Nova Scotia, the homeland of the Scottish diaspora, but there is no direct flight 
there from Scotland. Our absurd position is that when the second First Minister&#151;the 
one before the current one&#151;went to tartan day last year, he flew by Aer Lingus 
via Dublin. Is not it absurd that at the start of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century 
our country's foremost statesman travels to the capital city of the economic powerhouse 
of the world through the capital city of another nation on an aeroplane that belongs 
to that other nation's national flag carrier?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
the north of Scotland, where tourism is essential to the economy&#151;yet where 
we find that it is in decline&#151;affordable and accessible air links are also 
essential. What do we discover? Inverness airport, in the capital of the Highlands, 
has the highest landing charges in Europe. Ryanair says that the charge is £15 
per passenger. &quot;That's no true&quot;, says the chief </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14503">14503</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Executive of HIAL, &quot;It's only 
£8.&quot; Whether the charge is £8 or £15, it is too high. The First Minister 
says that Ryanair must pay its share. It does; it pays its fair share at 58 airports 
in Europe where it lands, from Kerry in the west to Graz in the east and from 
Oslo in the north to Pescara in the south. What it does not pay are the First 
Minister's unfair charges at his airport.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Iain 
Gray: </strong>To paraphrase Mr MacAskill's last few words, he said yesterday that 
Inverness had the highest landing charges in Europe. That statement was described 
as an ill-informed media stunt aimed at grabbing headlines with no regard to the 
facts. I take it that he now says that it is correct that Inverness does not have 
the highest landing charges in Europe, but that that is of no interest in the 
argument that he is seeking to develop.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
MacAskill: </strong>It is a great pity that the Minister for Enterprise, Transport 
and Lifelong Learning has not read the study by Dr Romano Pagliari at Cranfield 
University, which was published many months ago. It may be that the previous minister 
was dealing with the issue then, but I would have thought that Iain Gray would 
have been up to date and up to speed on that important document.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
is the situation? What does the Executive suggest? It asks us to take note of 
its consultation document. Take note? I know that the First Minister wants to 
do less better, but that is doing nothing whatever. The consultation document 
is really one for south-east England. It is predicated on whether to have Heathrow 
5 or a new airport elsewhere in leafy England. The consultation document recognises 
only two airports in central Scotland when it is clear that there are three. Is 
not Prestwick in central Scotland? Cannot the Department for Transport acknowledge 
that airport's location and appreciate its importance? Scotland is factored in 
only to the extent of how we link to the hub airports down in greater London. 
That, I say to the minister, is the current problem. We need an aviation strategy 
for Scotland. Surely that is what a Scottish Government should provide.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Iain 
Gray: </strong>It is clear to any mature parliamentarian that the &quot;notes&quot;

seven minutes into his speech, but he has contributed no ideas whatever. Given 
the experience of the prison estates review, perhaps we should look to the previous 
leadership of the Scottish National Party for a contribution to this important 
consultation. Does the SNP intend to contribute any ideas?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr

are the solutions? The minister might wish to note that I am coming to the matters 
that he should deal with. We need a route development fund and we need routes 
to Spain, Italy and Scandinavia, among others. The Irish&#151;never mind the Icelandic&#151;take 
such routes for granted. We need to provide a marketing budget that will support 
airlines in providing such routes. Cornwall County Council did so for the Ryanair 
flight to Newquay airport and has reaped the benefit. The Welsh Development Agency 
supported Cardiff airport in attracting bmibaby. Cornwall County Council might 
not be the best council in Europe, and the WDA might not be the best agency in 
Europe, but those bodies have done more than the Executive has done to support 
and promote aviation. If they can, we should and come next May, if Labour will 
not, we will.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I remind 
the minister that his boss owns Inverness airport; Jack McConnell is its sole 
shareholder. It is his airport. He is responsible and accountable, but he has 
grounded flights into Inverness. He must take action to get charges down and to 
get flights flying. It is time for him to say why he has put tourism in the Highlands 
into a nosedive when he is in the cockpit. Tourism will fly high if he gets landing 
charges down. If he does not, we will know whom to blame. Come next May, if he 
will not get landing charges down, we will.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Executive's position is not blue-sky thinking, but pie in the sky. It does not 
involve the development of new routes or the removal of existing impediments to 
flights. Flights into and out of Scotland are delayed or grounded, but not through 
bad weather or mechanical failure and not because of any airline or airport. The 
buck stops with the Executive, which will neither initiate new routes nor remove 
present impediments from airports. That is why I will move the amendment. I want 
to provide a flight path to the improvements that are badly needed the length 
and breadth of our land, throughout all sectors of our economy and in air services. 
The Executive is devoid of vision and it is vacuous when it comes to solutions.

from what he said about Aer Lingus, people from countries other than Scotland

States must be treated with great care, given the hugely different geographic 
distances and population dispersal that are involved.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kenny 
MacAskill's speech showed again his unwillingness to pay any regard to issues 
such as where our centres of population are, where Scotland is relative to the 
rest of Europe and the wider world and the needs of different types of travellers. 
The air industry is extremely complex. For example, we cannot ignore the impact 
that foreign Governments' support of state-owned airlines throughout Europe has 
had on routes and services. I am afraid that there has been a pitifully low level 
of action from the European Union to stamp out such anti-competitive practices.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite 
that, it has been refreshing to see genuine competition emerge in the air travel 
industry in the form of low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and easyJet. The combination 
of Ryanair's innovative fares structure and services and the equally entrepreneurial 
operation of Prestwick airport have led to one of Scotland's real successes in 
air travel, which should be celebrated. My colleague, John Scott, who is the local 
member for Prestwick, will no doubt return to that in his speech.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
I visited Prestwick this week, I was struck by the buzz and vibrancy at the airport. 
The number of international visitors passing through the airport confirmed the 
fact that low-cost flights not only take Scots abroad, but bring international 
visitors to Scotland. There has been significant evidence for that in the Enterprise

David Mundell agree that the airport's success has occurred when it has not been 
owned by BAA? Does he also agree that that success can be replicated elsewhere

the success that Prestwick airport has enjoyed should be replicated at airports 
throughout Scotland. There is tremendous scope for that; we can learn from Manchester

Executive would not do so. We must lobby and ensure that BAA is positively promoting 
the capacity of each of its airports.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let 
us return to Mr MacAskill's speech. One airline flying to one airport will not 
resolve the issues that surround air links to and from Scotland. Low-cost airlines 
are not a panacea for the issues that are faced by Scotland's remote communities, 
nor are they the complete solution to the need to establish business links between 
Scotland and Europe.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
must not repeat the tunnel vision that overwhelmed discussions of air travel in 
Scotland in the 1970s and 1980s, which led to an obsession with transatlantic 
direct flights. Having more low-cost flights in and out of Inverness would be 
welcome&#151;I am sure that Mary Scanlon will speak about the benefits of that&#151;but 
it is not the only way in which to develop the wider range of flight options that 
Scotland needs.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Scottish 
Executive has a significant role to play, not least in relation to the transport 
infrastructure that surrounds our airports. A fundamental development for Glasgow 
airport will be completion of the M74 northern extension, to which the Scottish 
Executive is committed. Let us hope that the wording of the comprehensive spending 
review does not rule out completion of that major project. It is clear that the 
perception of delays and difficulty of access via the Kingston bridge are restricting 
the development of Glasgow airport. The development of the rail link to the airport 
needs to be progressed. As Bill Butler pointed out, decisions need to be made 
as soon as possible.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
same is true of Edinburgh airport, the development of which could be enhanced 
by completion of the A8000 and firm decisions being made on the proposed rail 
link. I am sure that Brian Adam agrees that the construction of the western peripheral 
route would have a significant beneficial impact on developments at Aberdeen airport. 
Airports do not exist in isolation&#151;the infrastructure around them makes them 
more or less attractive to travellers, be they travellers on low-cost airlines 
or those travelling first class on business. If we do not get that right and the 
Scottish Executive does not deliver on the important infrastructure issues that 
I have mentioned, the consultation process and the air links review will have 
been futile.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14508">14508</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

that social factors are given proper weight.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
are a series of interlinked aspects to overall consideration of air transport. 
The starting point in the UK context is the congestion and the pressure on air 
services in and out of London. To what extent is the solution to that problem 
to build more capacity? To what extent would it be it more sensible to release 
capacity by diverting traffic away from the south-east, both by developing regional 
hubs to free capacity directly and by taking measures to move economic development 
out of the south-east? Should not we try to take the heat out of the area and 
to spread some of the glow to other places where there is the infrastructure, 
including housing and a work force, to cope with it?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Spreading 
air traffic to regional hubs would make it easier to ensure air safety, because 
planes would be operating in less crowded skies. A much higher proportion of internal 
business and tourist traffic to and from the south-east and throughout the UK 
should travel on the much more environmentally friendly rail system. The sums 
of money that are needed to build new airports or to extend existing ones would 
buy a really good train set.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Air 
transport is a huge contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Should we direct 
our thoughts towards using air transport only where it is really necessary to 
do so? Should we place a tight definition on the word &quot;necessary&quot;? The 
other environmental aspect of air transport, which is not talked about much, is 
the different taxes on aviation fuel and fuel used by other forms of transport. 
Planes may be airborne, but there is no level playing field.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
much for the arguments for limiting air transport. In considering air transport 
in the Scottish context, I return to a word that I used earlier&#151;&quot;necessary&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Brian

Radcliffe: </strong>I agree absolutely with Brian Adam's point, which shows the importance 
of thinking holistically.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Arguments 
about the links between airports and economic development are a bit over-egged. 
Economic development needs a transport infrastructure, but not necessarily an 
air infrastructure. What is essential is the strategic provision of air services; 
Scotland needs direct transatlantic and European links. Scotland also needs links 
to London, but perhaps not as many as there are.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
decent rail service would offer more comfortable, more convenient and more environmentally 
friendly journeys between Edinburgh or Glasgow and London, probably with journey 
times that compare reasonably overall with the air routes, which would free up 
capacity at both ends. However, when one considers the Aberdeen and Inverness 
routes to London, the time factor begins to tip the balance towards air travel.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
a Scottish context, the so-called lifeline services are vital. To echo Para Handy's

my colleague Tavish Scott&#151;who is in Quebec&#151;were here he would tell you 
about the problems that are posed to remote and island communities by the ferociously 
high cost of air transport when it is priced purely commercially. Those high costs 
impact on individuals and on island service providers. For example, Shetland NHS 
Board has a bill of well over £1 million for flying patients to Aberdeen and a 
Shetland family that goes on a package holiday to Majorca pays the cost of the 
holiday over again to get to the departure airport on the mainland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Careful 
consideration must be given to how essential air services are protected, to where 
public service obligation orders should be used and to what can be done to mitigate 
the high cost of air travel for island dwellers. The Cranfield University study

other European countries, particularly Norway, which is similar in size and topography 
to Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There has

the development of a single, central airport, are carefully thought through.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

Muldoon (Livingston) (Lab): </strong>Like other speakers in the debate, I welcome the 
consultation that has been launched by the United Kingdom Government and the Scottish

but more generally for our wider economy. The continuing debate and consultation 
should be an opportunity for all parties and stakeholders to impact on the future 
shape of air transport in Scotland.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Air 
transport has undoubtedly been growing strongly in Scotland. In the past 10 years, 
the number of passengers using our major airports has grown from about eight million 
in 1991 to about 16 million in 2000. If we include all the minor airports, that 
figure rises to about 18 million. Passenger numbers are projected to increase 
to between 26 and 50 million by 2030, depending on different assumptions. Therefore, 
this is undoubtedly the right time for us to look at the shape of our airports 
and aviation industry for the future. It is also the case that Scots have a higher 
propensity to fly than do people in any other part of the UK outwith London. The 
picture is not one of failure, doom and gloom, as Mr MacAskill suggests.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Air 
travel is essential to Scotland and makes a direct contribution to the economy. 
Iain Gray referred to the 15,000 direct jobs that it provides, of which more than 
500 are in the area of West Lothian that I represent. However, it also provides 
thousands of jobs that result indirectly from the aviation industry in areas such 
as tourism and air freight and in the businesses that prosper because of the good 
links to and from Scottish airports.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We

years. Scotland has direct links to many European cities including Amsterdam, 
Paris and Dublin that we did not have a number of yeas ago. Edinburgh airport 
also has the highest number of low-cost airline departures of any airport in the 
UK outwith the south-east of England. Those are other areas of success that we 
should welcome.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important 
that we take into account the environmental impact of expansion of the industry, 
which has been referred to by other speakers. I draw to the attention of the minister 
the matter of noise pollution from night flights, which affects a number of constituencies 
in Scotland. This is the right time to plan for the future. There is no point 
waiting until capacity has run out.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kenny 
MacAskill's speech was disappointing but not at all surprising. It contained the 
usual mixture of talking Scotland down and making uncosted spending promises. 
It also contained inaccuracies: Mr MacAskill claimed that Inverness airport has 
the highest landing charges in Europe, but the information that I have before 
me states that Norwich airport charges £19.47 per passenger, Bournemouth airport 
charges £17.26 and Teesside airport charges £14.99, which is broadly in line with 
the figures that Mr MacAskill gave for Inverness.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr

make money from air travel. If that is his argument, why is the SNP against allowing 
a private company to make a profit from any degree of public investment in a public-private 
partnership?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick:

a man is tired of London, he is tired of life&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Executive's consultation document is a product of that same metropolitan mindset. 
As we read it, we learn fascinating insights into the state of aviation in Britain. 
We learn that, of the 180 million passengers who pass through UK airports every 
year, no fewer than 100 million&#151;well over half&#151;go through London. We 
know that there is huge potential not only among the members of the SNP, who are 
looking forward to achieving their aims next May, but in the future of air traffic. 
The document tells us that air traffic will double or treble in the next three 
decades. That means that there are massive opportunities. If the United Kingdom 
were truly united, should not more of the benefits of those flights be dispersed 
around the UK? Are Labour members happy that well over 60 per cent of all flights 
from Scotland go through London as the hub?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
agree with much of what Nora Radcliffe said. The situation is not sensible, but 
nothing in the consultation document will change it. Indeed, everything in it 
will perpetuate the congestion that is caused by flying through London. I agree 
that Scotland wants new routes. We want them to be established to other UK destinations 
and to mainland European and American destinations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
the short time that I have, I will address a number of matters that affect the 
city of Inverness. In the Highlands and in the Parliament there was a united approach 
to the submission of an application for a public service obligation for the Inverness 
to Gatwick route. I will remind members why that is so important. I will give 
one concrete example. Inverness Medical, which now employs more than 13,000 people, 
came to Inverness partly because Ron Zwanziger, the head of the company, was, 
as he said, able to travel from Heathrow to Inverness to get there.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Inverness 
Medical would not exist if he had come five years later, because British Airways 
scrapped the Heathrow service without any notice. Only a strong political campaign 
by the Scottish National Party and others secured the Gatwick route as an alternative. 
The precedent exists; the Gatwick route must be protected. The PSO application 
was submitted well over a year ago. What has happened to it? Highland Council, 
Maureen Macmillan, who seems to find this amusing, and the Scottish Executive 
support it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Maureen

need to establish new routes. I was delighted with Kenny MacAskill's proposal 
of a route development fund. That proposal has been supported by many, including 
the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, which made a submission in 
a letter of 1 February. Inverness airport is making progress on a number of fronts. 
I believe that it is working towards establishing new routes, but the main problem 
is high landing charges. Unless that problem is addressed, Inverness airport will 
not be competing on a level playing field. That is abundantly the case. State 
aid is irrelevant. Unless the situation is addressed, Inverness will not achieve 
its potential. The SNP will not allow that to happen. Sadly, the Scottish Executive

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">will include conducting a similar 
consultation process. In Aberdeen, significant consultation and debate surrounded 
the late opening of Dyce airport. However, I understand from constituents in Nairn 
that HIAL carried out no such consultation prior to announcing 24-hour opening. 
There is also concern about increased freight on the Inverness to Aberdeen road. 
I ask the minister to extend the culture of consultation to HIAL.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
compare the lack of growth at airports in the Highlands and Islands with the growth 
at airports in the rest of Scotland is interesting, given the current subsidy 
of £21 million. If we take the eight HIAL airports that were in operation in 1991 
and note their expansion&#151;or otherwise&#151;over the decade to 2001, we find 
that the number of passengers has reduced by 23 per cent. As the minister said 
in his opening speech, that compares with a doubling of passenger numbers at BAA 
airports over the same period. I hope that that figure will be used when HIAL 
is asked whether it is making the best use of its subsidy and whether it is working 
fully with all partners to utilise the potential of its airports to provide cheap 
flights for visitors, residents and business. While there has been a 23 per cent 
reduction in the number of passengers at HIAL airports, passenger numbers at Prestwick 
airport have increased thirty-fivefold in 10 years, from 35,000 to more than 1.25 
million last year.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I appreciate 
the particular local circumstances in Shetland&#151;I am sure that Tavish Scott 
would be jumping up and down on hearing that word were he here&#151;but it is 
interesting to note that, over the same 10-year period, there was a sixteenfold 
increase in the number of passengers at the Shetland Islands Council-owned Scatsta 
airport. However, it is still the case that crossing the Pentland firth is more 
expensive than crossing the Atlantic. This week, I was trying to get back to Inverness 
for a meeting having been to Carstairs hospital on Monday. The flight to Inverness 
from Edinburgh airport cost £182, and was not at a time of day that would favour 
business travel.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis 
Macdonald: </strong>Does Mary Scanlon accept that the figures to which she refers primarily 
reflect the position at Scatsta and Sumburgh airports, and that Inverness airport, 
the hub airport for HIAL's network, has experienced an average annual growth of 
about 6 per cent over the past 10 years?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mary 
Scanlon: </strong>Inverness is one of the few airports where there has been any expansion 
over that period. I do not want to waste my time over this, but other figures,

is much talk about landing charges, but I do not think that they are the only 
factor. However, we do need a financial structure that will give incentives to

cheap flights than no flights.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I

Fergus Ewing said, whenever the future of air services is discussed, people in 
the Highlands and Islands understandably get nervous about the Inverness to London

campaign for the route to be reinstated. What is more, people in the Highlands 
believe that the Inverness to Gatwick link is under threat. We are concerned for 
its future. British Airways has said that it has no plans to withdraw the service, 
but reports that the service might be withdrawn surface continually, which is 
disconcerting.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The former

strong backing to the case for a PSO on the route, and the Highlands and Islands 
strategic transport partnership has stressed in its report the compelling case&#151;on 
social and economic grounds&#151;for introducing PSOs to protect lifeline Scottish

the Highlands. That is a complete misrepresentation of the position&#151;easyJet 
flies in and out of Inverness. Although everyone would like Ryanair to come to 
Inverness, the principle of fairness must underpin the discussions. People in 
the Highlands have been truly appalled by the way in which negotiations have been 
conducted. They have also been appalled by Kenny MacAskill's ranting about the 
situation. I hope that HIAL and Ryanair will continue to discuss how they will 
achieve their mutual aim. That must be the overwhelming priority.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
MacAskill: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Maureen 
Macmillan: </strong>No.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
role of HIAL is not simply to support Inverness; it must support air services 
in the rest of the Highlands and Islands, where there is no competition for routes. 
HIAL continues to develop and upgrade all the Highland airports, but it is not 
responsible for air fares. Lack of competition and a low population density lead 
to the high cost of air travel from Wick and the islands&#151;and, in the case 
of Orkney, between the islands&#151;even though those routes are exempt from air 
passenger duty.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The key 
point is that high fares do not offer those who live in Caithness or on the islands 
a genuine choice of travel options. I am often bemused by the fact that companies 
use low passenger numbers to justify high fares. If airlines thought about the 
issue imaginatively, they would realise that bringing down their fares might attract 
people to travel. Companies such as BA need to think carefully about the social 
and economic implications of their high fares and the lack of concessionary fares 
on some routes. I hope that the minister will continue to enlighten the airlines' 
thinking.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am particularly 
interested in the future development of Wick airport, which suffers from poor 
timetabling and neglect of its second runway. Economic growth in Caithness should 
mean the development of Wick airport and I ask the minister to consider building 
capacity there.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want 
to deal with the importance of the smaller airports in the Highlands and Islands 
and to mention the possibility of building more airports. Skye councillors have 
recently proposed an airport for Skye, which could benefit tourism. The cost might 
compare favourably with the cost of upgrading roads. The development of the airport 
in Oban could provide real alternatives for people on the Argyll islands, whose 
only air services are to Glasgow. For someone on Colonsay, a ferry trip to the 
dentist in Oban is a three-day event.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14517">14517</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

such airports continue to develop by becoming local hubs. We should consider how 
air services could complement the ferry services in Argyll. Oban airport could 
serve the Fort William area. It is obvious that investment is necessary. I urge 
the Executive to think imaginatively about the potential of airports in the west 
Highlands. The issues are complex. When it determines the future configuration 
of air services in the rest of Scotland, the Executive must ensure that it takes

Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>To some extent, the debate has focused on 
low-cost carriers and the competition that they might well bring. A possible concern 
is that low-cost carriers might merely knock out the competition, rather than 
grow the market. They might also provide competition for the railways, which are 
more environmentally friendly. I suggest that the evidence supports the view that 
low-cost carriers grow the market and open up genuinely new opportunities for 
people to travel&#151;whether for pleasure or for business. We must encourage 
that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The people who are

inform the minister that, despite the significant expansion in the air travel 
market, Aberdeen airport's growth has been around 2.3 per cent per annum, which 
is rather pathetic. That is against the background of the benefits of the oil 
and gas industry that Aberdeen has. We are not seeing the kind of growth that 
should happen. There is no real competition between Aberdeen and Edinburgh or 
Glasgow for international air travel. Indeed, the focus of BAA's business is, 
as BAA itself has said, to forecast growth in passenger traffic through Heathrow, 
Gatwick and Stansted. That is in nobody's interest. I hope that one consequence 
of the consultation will be a change in focus, if not ownership, of Aberdeen airport. 
A change in ownership is one option that should be seriously considered.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
has been much debate about access to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports, but there 
are serious problems in Aberdeen. The western peripheral route alone will not 
provide the answer, so we ought to look at how rail links could be improved. There 
is little in the way of proper public transport to the airport&#151;a fact that 
has been recognised in recent BAA publications. Unlike Edinburgh, which has a 
good and successful bus service, Aberdeen airport does not have a bus service. 
The success of Edinburgh's bus service may reflect the fact that the service is 
wholly owned by Edinburgh City Council, which has recognised the city's economic 
needs. That is not the situation in Aberdeen, which has only a deregulated bus 
service.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We need to consider 
seriously how we get people to the airports if the airports are to form part of 
an integrated transport arrangement, which I believe is the desire of the Executive 
and ought to be the desire of everybody. If we had a proper railhead near the 
airport in Aberdeen, we would be able to attract a much wider group of passengers. 
The route development plans, as endorsed by the Scottish Council for Development 
and Industry, are the way to grow the business in a sustainable and environmentally 
friendly way.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We ought

by car. Last week, it took me more than two hours to travel from Dunfermline to 
Edinburgh because of a car crash blocking the A8000. Sadly, such events are not 
uncommon. I was not going for a flight so I did not miss it, but I was late for 
a committee meeting. If I had been going to the airport to catch a flight I would 
have missed it despite having left in plenty of time to get there. Such occurrences

be possible for it to be served by a rail link. It is also within 90 minutes of

with the St Andrew's cross on the side of aircraft that are flown on by First

the strategy of predict and provide is wrong. Too many flights are going through

a regional strategy that takes flights away from London to the north, the midlands

incurs higher charges and generates higher income. If we take the hangover point,

that the future of passenger air travel in Scotland has changed. Low-cost carriers

Scotland airport, plus the road and rail infrastructure costs, are costs that 
we can well do without when we have under-used assets at Prestwick with all the

addition, low-cost freight carriage may follow low-cost passenger flights in an

next step in freight growth. Of Scotland's airports, only Prestwick can accommodate 
a fully laden 747. To further enhance Prestwick as a freight destination, some 
freight must be moved from road to rail. I have discussed that idea with all the

a feasibility study must be undertaken into moving freight from the airport on

the Ayr to Glasgow line to connect with the existing cleared line network that

the SNP and speaking to our amendment, I thought that it would be useful to start 
with the points on which we agree before moving on to set out for the Executive 
the areas on which we disagree. The SNP is not girning or complaining; we are 
trying to make positive suggestions that can be developed. If that is not the 
point of a consultation, I fail to understand exactly what is.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everyone 
in the chamber agrees on the importance of the sector. The consultation document 
mentions that air transport is expected to make up 2 per cent of Scotland's gross 
domestic product by 2030. We all understand the importance to the inward investment 
market&#151;when it recovers&#151;of our direct links with the European Union 
and the United States. We all understand the importance of air transport for Scottish 
exports and tourism, which is a £4.5 billion industry. In other words, we all 
understand that air transport is a key driver for Scotland's economic growth.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Robin 
Harper (Lothians) (Green): </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
Hamilton: </strong>With all due respect, as the member has just arrived, I will not.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
think that members also agree that, because of environmental concerns, it would 
be sensible to divert flights from going through London. The point is made not 
out of constitutional obsession, but because we believe that it would make sound 
environmental and politically sensible policy. Nora Radcliffe made the point that 
travel through London leads to an excessive environmental toll. She said that 
an added environmental impact resulted from planes being stacked up because of 
delays in landing. She also said that we should look ahead to what we could do 
to roll out PSOs in the Highlands and Islands. I am sure that many members would 
agree on all those matters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
are two areas of dispute. The first is how to encourage growth and discourage 
the pressure on the south-east. &quot;The Future Development of Air Transport 
in the United Kingdom&quot; states that growth will be dependent</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;upon 
whether or not additional capacity is provided at airports in the South East of 
England.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That shows 
why there is a need to refocus and for Scotland to have a hub. However, the consultation 
document appears to flirt with us. It sets out the </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14528">14528</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">need for support for more direct 
flights to the European Union and America, but it continues to look through the 
same prism that says that flights have to go through the south-east hub.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
know that the number of passenger flights has doubled in the past decade and that 
that trend is set to continue. Sarah Boyack referred to the possible growth scenarios. 
Under the heading &quot;South East Constrained Scenario&quot;, the document captures 
the effect of one constraint on that growth. If there is no growth in capacity 
down south, that would</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;make 
access to London's principal airports from Scotland more difficult and expensive.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
point that we are making is that there is no need for that to happen; it is entirely 
unnecessary and avoidable. The pressure on the south-east hub is not an SNP obsession, 
nor is it a Liberal Democrat obsession. It is a fact that is recognised in the 
consultation document. We have to ask the question, &quot;What do we have to do 
to get ourselves out of this south-east prism?&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
SCDI made it clear that passengers in Scotland want to be able to fly direct to 
a large number of destinations. The SCDI said that that would provide massive 
cost savings and reduce inconvenience and transfer times at hub airports. That 
is not a political point; it is a factual business point and we should look at 
it in that way</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second 
area of dispute relates to what should be done in the Highlands and Islands, which 
is the subject of the second part of Kenny MacAskill's amendment. Fergus Ewing 
highlighted the disparity between HIAL's estimate of 1.8 million passengers per 
annum and the Department for Transport's estimate of 0.8 million. With a waft 
of his hand, the minister said that there is a wide margin of error. However, 
a margin of error that is bigger than the original estimate is ridiculous&#151;a 
difference of 1 million cannot simply be dismissed as a margin of error.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
answer to the problem lies in the report, which says that HIAL's forecasts</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;depend 
heavily on attracting 'no frills' carriers and international services&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
problem and the answer are in the report, but the minister does not seem to recognise 
that. He should tell us which estimate he and the Executive back. Given that HIAL's 
estimate is 1.8 million passengers and given that it is predicated on no-frills 
carriers and international services, why, in the name of goodness, would the minister 
be against it?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Iain 
Gray: </strong>No member has said that they are against widening the range of available 
direct flights or increasing the number of no-frills, low-cost carrier services

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scotland. The point is that HIAL 
already has such routes operating out of Inverness in a business deal that it 
negotiates with the airlines.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
Hamilton: </strong>It is remarkable that the minister says that no one is preventing 
anything, given that that is exactly what the Executive is doing. Ryanair wants 
to come into those routes. Incidentally, it has been suggested that the SNP is 
somehow in hock to Ryanair and is desperately trying to promote the Ryanair interest. 
I make it clear that it is fine if British Midland, KLM, Lufthansa and Scandinavian 
Airlines want to come into those routes. The issue is structural and the Government 
could do much to aid matters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
has been an argument about why Inverness airport has the highest landing charges 
in the European Union. Bristow Muldoon even disputed that that is the case. In 
a biting piece of oratory, he told us not to worry about the £15 landing charges, 
as he had heard on good authority that Bristol airport's charges are higher. He 
did not give us his source. He is saying, &quot;Don't worry. Inverness airport's 
charges, even using your figures, are not the highest; they are just exorbitant.&quot; 
If that is his best defence, it is not very good. We have cited the Cranfield 
University report&#151;a proper academic study that is much more trustworthy than 
Bristow Muldoon is.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Bristow 
Muldoon: </strong>Will the member give way?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
Hamilton: </strong>I will not, as there is not enough time.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Executive could act on the punitive costs. I am not sure whether Bristow Muldoon 
or another member mentioned the fact that passenger volume at Inverness airport 
has grown by 6 per cent. We should contrast that with what has happened at Prestwick 
airport, which Mr Scott spoke about. The increase in volume at Prestwick has been 
120 per cent. Does not that suggest that there might just perhaps be merit in 
going down the road that I suggest?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
SNP has made a range of constructive proposals that are driven by nothing other 
than the need to ease capacity in the south-east and to give Scotland a competitive 
advantage. The SCDI said:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Responding 
to the consultation document's question on shifting maintenance operations to 
regional airports, SCDI considers that such a change would solve the capacity 
problems in the south-east regarding both excess air traffic and land shortages.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
comes to an important conclusion:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As 
Inverness airport has both air space and land availability, SCDI recommends that 
an aircraft maintenance facility be located there.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scottish national interest.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
amendment contains two concrete proposals that the minister could progress as 
part of the consultation. The route development plan could extend to Spain, Italy 
and Scandinavia, as Mr MacAskill said, and there could be increased emphasis on 
the marketing budget&#151;some members, including Murdo Fraser, mentioned such 
emphasis in other parts of the UK. The fact that the minister will not follow 
our proposals tells us a great deal about the Executive's paucity of vision.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16:49</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning (Lewis Macdonald): 
</strong>The debate has been useful, as a review of air transport is overdue. The previous 
aviation policy white paper was published in 1985. Since then, the industry has 
been subject to considerable change and development. More than ever, air travel 
is an integral part of the way in which countries do business.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 
its nature, aviation is highly interconnected. That is why the consultation process 
sees us bringing forward a consultation document in partnership with the UK Department 
for Transport. The consultation covers reserved and devolved matters and will 
lead to the publication of a UK white paper next year. That will lay out a strategic 
framework within which we will develop our vision for the future of aviation in 
Scotland. We will add detail to that vision by producing a route development strategy 
and by adapting the proposals that come forward through our land-use planning 
system.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clearly, the tragic 
events of September 11 last year led to a major restructuring in the industry, 
both by accelerating existing trends and by creating opportunities. We have seen 
the demise or the realignment of some international flag carriers and the welcome 
rise of low-cost, no-frills airlines. The role of second-force operators has also 
increased. That is why this is a good time to review the focus and direction of 
aviation strategy and why the consultation process is important. The process provides 
the opportunity for a full and thorough debate. I am glad that many members have 
taken that opportunity in the spirit in which we brought it forward.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
general, the issues are complex and do not lend themselves to quick fixes. We 
need to approach them in a mature and considered way. We must shape support for 
the industry and achieve the capacity requirements that are necessary to meet 
Scotland's needs. In doing that, we must strike a balance between economic, environmental 
and social priorities. That balance </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14531">14531</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">must maximise benefits and minimise 
disbenefits.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several members 
have mentioned the disbenefits, which occur locally and nationally. Noise pollution, 
planning blight, additional road congestion and increased generation of greenhouse 
gases are all potential disbenefits of increased airport capacity. That is why 
it is important, as we look to continue growth in air transport, that we consider 
those issues carefully and in good time. Technological improvements, better operational 
practices, provision of rail links and the efficient use of existing facilities 
can all help to reduce the disbenefits. Alternatives must be adequately considered. 
Our aim in the consultation is to generate a broad consensus on the best overall 
strategy for sustainable development.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scottish 
aviation is clearly a fast-moving industry. There has been clear market segmentation 
in recent years and we are looking for ways in which to develop all those potential 
markets. We will do so in a way that strengthens the role of all our existing 
airports for the benefit of Scotland as a whole.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some 
members have emphasised the options for enhancement of capacity. It is important 
to stress that, at this time, we are considering the enhancement of capacity and 
not the construction of new runways. The limiting factors are different for each 
airport. We recognise that, if the demand predictions are correct, we may need 
an additional runway at some point in the future. One of the purposes of the consultation 
exercise is to preserve long-term development options at the pressured airports 
in order to avoid having them sterilised by other uses. In response to Sarah Boyack's 
question, I can say that no decision on extra runways is required at this stage 
and none will be required for at least 10 years. We recognise the long-term pressures 
and the need for incremental additions to terminals, aprons and taxiways to meet 
some of the short to medium-term pressures. We also recognise the possible need 
for runway extensions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
capacity issues in the north of Scotland are of a different sort from those that 
apply in the central belt. At airports such as Inverness and Aberdeen, the ability 
to operate the latest generation of aircraft will be vital for future development. 
This is why the Government, together with the operators of the airports, will 
look at the issues closely.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Brian 
Adam: </strong>Does the minister recognise that a number of low-cost airlines have 
ordered a significant number of new aircraft of the type to which he referred?

that will be flown by those aircraft?</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14532">14532</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I will return 
to that matter. I know that Brian Adam will join me in welcoming the new routes 
that Ryanair and Air France have established in recent weeks from Aberdeen airport. 
We are engaged in the consultation to identify the means that are required to 
develop such routes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An 
important aspect of the improvement of existing facilities relates to surface 
access. A number of members have raised the issue of rail links to Glasgow and 
Edinburgh airports. We are looking to be in a position to announce preferred routes 
for those rail links within the next few weeks. Our ambition is, as Iain Gray 
said, to be able to carry those forward by 2005.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Robert 
Brown: </strong>Will the minister clarify the time scales for the likely developments? 
The dates for the Glasgow airport rail link have recently been the subject of 
controversy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis Macdonald: 
</strong>I confirm Iain Gray's comment that the timetable for work to begin on the 
rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh by 2005 is ambitious but achievable. An agreed 
strategy on surface access to Aberdeen airport, which was devised by local partners, 
including BAA and the local authority, is also in place. I am delighted that the 
Executive kick-started that strategy a few weeks ago by providing funding.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much 
has been said about HIAL, which is the publicly owned operator of lifeline airports 
in the Highlands and Islands. HIAL has a crucial role. Some of the criticism that 
has been made of its charging structures is simply unfounded. The figures that 
I have seen show that Inverness's landing charges are on the median for airports 
of comparable size in the United Kingdom. HIAL is publicly owned precisely because 
it operates in a different environment to that in which Prestwick, Aberdeen, Glasgow 
and Edinburgh operate. Because of that unique operating environment, we have provided 
heavy subsidy, which, as Iain Gray said, has trebled since 1997.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Bristow 
Muldoon: </strong>Does the minister recognise that, apart from the record subsidy that 
the Scottish Executive provides, decisions made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer 
also benefit airports in the Highlands and Islands?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lewis 
Macdonald: </strong>That is certainly the case. Both Governments recognise the particular 
situation of Highlands and Islands airports. Maureen Macmillan and Mary Scanlon 
mentioned the prospects for development of the smaller Highlands and Islands airports, 
which are lifeline services. In that context, we will examine proposals to enhance 
air travel through a continuing programme of investment in terminals and infrastructure. 
The consultation offers an opportunity for such proposals to be introduced. </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14533">14533</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

proposed PSO on the Inverness to Gatwick route has been mentioned. We support 
that proposal because we recognise the importance of routes to London as well 
as elsewhere. It is eminently sensible that the UK Government should respond to 
that proposal in the context of the consultation, which includes consultation 
on access to the south-east hubs and on PSOs. Fergus Ewing's suggestion that the 
UK-wide consultation is a device to postpone the decision is, frankly, bizarre.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Fergus

the Department for Transport and to support the application in the context of

has worked successfully with airlines to encourage and attract new services. For 
example, it has attracted low-cost easyJet flights to Inverness and has recently 
secured a new BMI service linking Stornoway and Edinburgh. As Iain Gray said&#151;although 
one or two members might have missed it&#151;yet another new service that HIAL 
has attracted to the Highlands of Scotland will be announced later this week. 
Given that at least Duncan Hamilton gave a mature response to one or two of the 
points in the debate, I look forward to the SNP's welcoming the establishment 
of that service.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are 
committed to ensuring the development of an expanded network of routes for Scotland. 
We are mindful of the needs of low-cost operators and the freight industry. We

it. This time next year, 1,000 delegates&#151;representing every major airport

Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr Murray Tosh): </strong>The final item of business is a 
members' business debate on motion S1M-3419, in the name of Michael Matheson, 
on the closure of the prison officers' social club at HM Prison Polmont. The debate 
will be concluded without any question being put. I invite members who wish to

who are leaving the chamber to do so quickly and quietly.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Motion 
debated,</I></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That the Parliament 
notes the decision by the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to close the officers' 
social club at HM Prison Polmont and considers that SPS should withdraw this decision 
and honour its commitment to allow the club to purchase the property, recognising 
the important role of the club to both staff and the local community.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:04</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Michael 
Matheson (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I thank Fiona Hyslop for securing the time 
for this debate. It is a pressing issue and I was keen to have a debate on it 
as early as possible. I lodged the motion only two weeks ago, and I am grateful 
for having been able to secure time for the debate so quickly. I welcome the members 
of the social club who are in the public gallery. They have been campaigning for 
months to stop the closure of their local social club.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
am sure that most members have some form of social club in their constituency. 
Often social clubs are closely linked to companies or industries in local communities. 
They are often left behind when industries move on or cease to be located in Scotland. 
Clubs find themselves struggling to cope&#151;struggling for members, struggling 
financially and struggling because of the poor state of their establishment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
story of the Polmont prison officers' club is very different. It is not a story 
of a struggling club. Opened in 1957, the club is well established in the local 
community and is well used. In its 44 years, it has been seen as a key part of 
the community in Polmont. It has 350 members. They include people who currently 
work in the Scottish Prison Service, retired prison officers, officers' families 
and friends, and members of the wider local community. The club is well supported, 
so why close it?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am sure 
that many members present at today's debate will be aware that the Scottish Prison 
Service tends to work in mysterious ways. Back in 1998, the club indicated to 
the Scottish Prison Service that it would like to purchase the property and raised 
the matter with the SPS directly. </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14541">14541</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Naturally, the club was delighted 
when on 21 August 1998 it received a letter from the governor of Polmont prison, 
Dan Gunn, who indicated that at a recent meeting the prison board had decided 
that the club committee should be offered the opportunity to purchase the club 
premises. The governor invited the club to indicate whether it was interested 
in doing that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the past 
two years, because of the governor's offer, the club has invested some £45,000 
in upgrading the building to ensure that its standards are adequate. I am sure 
that members will recognise that, after such investment, this is a very good club. 
The chamber can imagine the shock and dismay that club members felt when, in August 
this year, they found out that the Scottish Prison Service had decided not to 
renew the club's lease on 4 January 2003. That decision came out of the blue. 
It was not preceded by any consultation and is a complete U-turn from the commitment 
that was made in August 1998.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members 
may ask why the Scottish Prison Service decided to make such a U-turn. In its 
corporate plan for 1999 to 2002, the service stated that one of its key objectives 
was to move the Scottish Prison Service college to premises that were better designed 
and serviced to meet the service's needs. The SPS has now decided to knock down 
the social club, which is beside the college, to landscape the site for two years 
and to save up a little capital, which will allow it to build new facilities on 
the college campus.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some 
may say that it is important for the SPS to have adequate facilities for training 
staff. However, I understand that the real reason for the decision is to allow 
the SPS to enhance the college to use it for corporate functions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
August, the officers' club raised concerns about the proposal not to renew its 
lease with the SPS. On 4 October, it received a letter from the SPS confirming 
that it would not renew the lease on 4 January. However, in its generosity the 
service has agreed that the club may purchase a piece of land for a new officers' 
club. A piece of land of around an acre will cost the club about £100,000. That 
figure does not include the capital costs of building a new club. However, because 
the SPS recognises that capital costs may be involved, it has offered to allow 
the club to purchase some properties in Newlands Road. The cost of those properties 
would be £200,000.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am 
sure that members will recognise that purchasing either land or the properties 
that have been offered is well outwith the financial scope of the club. I believe 
that the SPS letter is nothing more than an excuse to allow the SPS to say that 
it is trying to work with the club. In reality, the letter offers the club nothing.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14542">14542</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members will be aware from my comments 
that the club is well used by the local community. I will illustrate how well 
used the club is. Between now and the end of March 2003, the club has bookings 
for functions on every Friday and Saturday night. For the new financial year from 
April 2003, the club already has 27 bookings for various functions and events. 
The club is extensively used by a wide range of organisations within the local 
community and for family functions and parties.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
will give members only a taste of the groups that use the club, but I could mention 
many. One group is the Braveheart project, a voluntary mentoring group that was 
recently established in the local area to work with people with heart problems. 
The project is being piloted and monitored by the Health Education Board for Scotland, 
the British Medical Association and the British Heart Foundation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
Braveheart project chose to use the prison officers' club because it is much cheaper 
than using any community facility within the local area. The club provides an 
important resource for an important and worthy project.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
club has had a letter from Squadron Leader Murray of the Air Cadets, who states:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
am sorry to hear of the impending closure of the Polmont Officers Club. Over the 
years members of the Air Training Corps have used the club for a variety of functions 
... The main reason the Officers Club was used was the friendly, safe environment. 
The Officers Club serves all members of the community.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
is also correspondence from the local football club, which uses the club extensively 
and demands that it remain open. Clearly, the club is an important resource in 
the local community.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have a document called &quot;A New Vision For A New Service&quot;, which was printed 
from the Scottish Prison Service website. The document states under the heading 
of &quot;Respect for our Staff&quot;:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
Scottish Prison Service is proud of our people. We recognise that our staff work 
in difficult circumstances and are dedicated and skilled. But our image is not 
good and often that is a self-inflicted wound. We all have a responsibility to 
make sure that the work we do is recognised, in the wider community.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clive 
Fairweather stated at the Justice 1 Committee recently that there was a need to 
build relations between SPS staff and senior management. How does the SPS's treatment 
of the officers' club fit in with the SPS's new vision? I hope that the minister 
will recognise that the Scottish Prison Service has not given due credit to the 
important resource that the prison officers' social club is for the Polmont area. 
I hope that the minister will intervene personally to ensure that the SPS honours 
its commitment of August 1998 to allow the club to purchase the property. [<I>Applause.</I>]</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14543">14543</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

Peattie (Falkirk East) (Lab): </strong>Polmont is part of my constituency of Falkirk 
East, and I thank Michael Matheson for lodging the motion. We have worked together 
with the social club representatives since closure of the club was announced without 
warning, consultation or negotiation. No hint had been given of the club's fate. 
Just a few days before the announcement, the club spent £2,000 on new equipment. 
As that expenditure suggests, in the 45<SUP>th</SUP> year of the club's existence, 
club finances are healthy because the club fulfils a need.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prison 
officers, their families and friends need somewhere where they can socialise, 
free from the aggressive encounters that they risk elsewhere. However, the club 
offers more than that: it is also a resource for the local community and a good 
place to hold birthday parties, weddings and other functions. The club is frequently 
used by local groups and charities and is the focus for voluntary activity by 
prison officers. The club also employs eight people.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Retired 
officers have written to me and to Michael Matheson. They make comments such as:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The

Last year, the club was refurbished, but now that refurbishment appears to have 
been a waste of money and effort.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
is not the first time that prison officers have sought my help. A steady flow 
of people have attended my surgeries, and other MSPs report that they have also 
dealt with prison officers. The circumstances surrounding this closure are symptomatic 
of a wider malaise. I am frequently told of instances of the SPS adopting bullying 
and dictatorial management styles. I know that the SPS can be slow, obstructive 
and secretive when it responds to inquiries. Until today, when I received hurried 
faxes to my Parliament and constituency offices, there had been no replies to 
my letters on the matter.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14544">14544</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

intimidation and disregard for staff can be addressed unless there is a new broom

are parallels with the situation that arose in relation to the Scottish Qualifications 
Authority. As they did with the SQA, ministers must address the continuing problems 
in the SPS. In the first instance, I would like to hear the minister say that 
he will support my prison officers and use his influence to ensure that the SPS 
either reprieves the club premises or, at the very least, offers the club a realistic 
offer of relocation and ensures that it can continue to provide a valuable service 
to the officers, their families and the community.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:17</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dennis 
Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>I congratulate Michael Matheson on securing this debate 
on an important matter affecting people employed in Polmont young offenders institution 
and other people in the local community.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have had correspondence on the issue from constituents who are employed in Polmont 
and I took the matter up with Tony Cameron, the chief executive of the SPS, who 
replied today. I find the attitude of the SPS unsatisfactory. For a start, there 
seems to have been no meaningful consultation between the SPS and the trustees 
of the club before the closure decision was made. On the contrary, there seems 
to have been considerable secrecy surrounding the original decision and a deliberate 
attempt not to reveal the closure decision until one month before the date of 
the closure.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It appears 
that the SPS has the legal right to terminate the lease with only one month's 
notice, but that is a deplorable way for any employer to treat employees.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr 
Cameron tells me in his letter that the SPS is now willing to extend the lease 
until the end of June next year to allow the club to honour commitments made to 
various groups and organisations. I therefore appeal to the SPS to use the next 
nine months to consult the trustees of the club in order to explore all possible 
alternatives to closure.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
understand that the reason for the closure is to demolish the premises in order 
to develop the SPS college, which is next door. However, some of the club members 
have suggested alternatives that would allow the college's development to go ahead 
without the club being demolished.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14545">14545</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even if the SPS is hellbent on demolishing 
the club premises, it has also been suggested that the SPS could and should provide 
an alternative plot of land nearby to build another social club. I was amazed 
at the price of £100,000 that Michael Matheson mentioned, but am aware that the 
cost of alternative premises could be as high as £200,000.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
his letter, Mr Cameron says that it would not be proper for the SPS to provide 
funds for the purpose of finding alternative land for the club. If the SPS is 
unwilling to provide funds, surely it could give the club the lease of a nearby 
plot of land. Last year, the club spent £30,000 upgrading its facilities. That 
money would not have been spent if the SPS had at that time given any hint of 
closure.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SPS may not 
have any legal obligation to do otherwise, but it certainly has a moral obligation 
to stop treating its own employees with absolute contempt. To be a prison officer 
is a very stressful job, and the club gives prison officers the opportunity to 
unwind and relax after a hard day's work. Some members of the local community 
also use the facilities, and some social events in the club have helped to raise 
funds for numerous good causes such as the Strathcarron hospice and the children's 
ward at Falkirk and District royal infirmary.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
would be a great pity if all that were to cease due to the Scottish Prison Service's 
high-handed attitude. I therefore appeal to the Deputy Minister for Justice to 
tell Tony Cameron to think again and enter into meaningful negotiations with the 
club to ensure its continuation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:21</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I welcome the opportunity to debate 
the subject and congratulate Michael Matheson on the persuasive way in which he 
advanced the case. Cathy Peattie's and Dennis Canavan's points were very well 
made. Cathy Peattie's letters most certainly should have been answered.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
officers' social club provides an essential service to prison officers and the 
local community. I am concerned to hear that the Scottish Prison Service wishes 
to demolish that excellent facility and replace it with a road. Not surprisingly, 
the members of the club find that highly objectionable&#151;all the more so because 
the club committee was under the impression that it could buy the building from 
the SPS and run it independently.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, 
the suggestion from the SPS that the club could buy land near the present site 
for new premises at the overall cost of some £300,000 to £400,000 is totally inappropriate 
</FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14546">14546</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">because there is simply no way that 
the club could afford that scale of expenditure.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is astonishing that the SPS apparently failed to consult the club committee about 
the plans, given their immense importance to those involved. Instead, the SPS 
presented its plans as a fait accompli. I hope indeed that the SPS will listen 
to the club's proposals and will agree to have a meeting with the club to discuss 
the best way forward. As Michael Matheson pointed out, the social club has been 
established for around 44 years. It has built up a strong and proud membership 
of 350 people and has close links with the local community. The club is well known 
for its charity work. Dennis Canavan mentioned its support for Strathcarron hospice. 
The club also gives support to community groups, such as Neighbourhood Watch and 
the Braveheart project, by offering its premises for their meetings.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
club is regarded as a safe haven for prison officers. After a hard day, the club 
provides an environment in which they can unwind and relax after hours of intense 
vigilance. As their job is more stressful and dangerous than most, it is not a 
lot to ask that their efficiently run social club be allowed to remain standing.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
club members are&#151;frankly&#151;appalled to learn that the Scottish Prison 
Service wishes to demolish their building. Michael Matheson said, I think, that 
they were shocked and dismayed. The SPS's approach is certainly bad for morale, 
not least because the club members have invested between £44,000 and £45,000 in 
renovating the interior during the past year or so. To see that investment literally 
reduced to rubble would be a tragic waste.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is time that the SPS agreed to listen to the club committee's reasonable proposals. 
That is no more than an extension of common sense and courtesy. I sincerely hope 
that a good outcome can be found. I urge the Scottish Prison Service and the club 
committee to enter into a dialogue with a view to resolving the matter to everyone's 
satisfaction. I very much hope that the minister will use his good offices to 
try to find a way out of the morass.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:24</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Donald 
Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>Michael Matheson and the two local constituency 
MSPs have covered matters well, but I will emphasise three points. We should consider 
first, the merits or otherwise of the decision as to whether the club should be 
destroyed; secondly, the way in which the matter has been dealt with; and thirdly, 
the wider matter of executive agencies, which was raised by Cathy Peattie.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have visited Polmont, and know a little about it, </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14547">14547</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">although not enough for me to judge 
whether in order properly to expand the SPS college it is necessary to demolish 
the building that houses the social club. It appears that that is not the case. 
The SPS must show that such action is necessary and it must demonstrate that its 
decision stands up, which it has failed signally to do so far. I have criticised 
the Executive for its conduct with regard to jails, but I say that if it is necessary 
to demolish the club to improve and extend the college, we must accept that&#151;as 
long as alternative accommodation is provided.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
second point relates to the way in which this whole thing has been gone about. 
I have been involved in many of the Justice 1 Committee's discussions with representatives 
of the Scottish Prison Service, so it does not surprise me at all. The Prison 
Service's personnel management and personnel relations are abysmal. It is ludicrous 
to drop this bombshell on the club&#151;metaphorically speaking&#151;at a time 
when the club has been spending a lot of money on improvement. If the club had 
not already spent the money, it would at least have been able to start with a 
nest egg for building a replacement, should that prove necessary. The conduct 
of the consultation&#151;or rather the lack of consultation on the part of the 
SPS&#151;has been quite disgraceful and, as other members have said, unacceptable.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
brings me to my third point, which Cathy Peattie covered a bit, and which the 
Justice 1 Committee has considered, which is the issue of executive agencies and 
the lack of control over them. Poor Richard Simpson will have to answer for the 
Prison Service in a straight-bat fashion&#151;if I may use a cricketing analogy 
without being disloyal&#151;despite the fact that his wicket has already been 
demolished. The SPS has conducted itself in a totally indefensible manner. If 
someone in the Scottish Executive justice department conducted themselves in such 
a way, the minister would take the flak and could do something about it, but that 
is not the case with executive agencies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
whole problem, as was first highlighted by the Scottish Qualifications Authority 
and which is now being highlighted by the SPS and other agencies, must be tackled. 
We must determine how we, and ministers, will get a grip on executive agencies. 
The problem at Polmont might appear to be small and parochial, but it raises a 
key national issue. I hope that the minister will take to heart the message that 
we must get a grip on our executive agencies, and that the Executive will start 
doing something about it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:28</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Christine

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">securing the debate, and I congratulate 
the prison officers, their families and colleagues who are here. Some of us met 
the officers recently when they were launching their petition. It seems incredible 
to be talking about having to save a club that is so obviously successful, not 
just from the point of view of prison officers, but from that of the whole community. 
How many assets like the social club at Polmont do communities generally have?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
does not seem so incredible that we are having to discuss the matter, however, 
when we learn that the social club is owned by the Scottish Prison Service, which 
I hold in even less regard than does Donald Gorrie. The Justice 1 Committee has 
had nothing from the management of the SPS but arrogance and inability to consult 
at all levels. As for its recent statement that it intends to change its corporate 
personality and be more consultative, I am waiting for pigs to fly.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
the subject of wildlife, I did not know that one of the organisations that uses 
the Polmont prison officers' social club is the Laurieston and District Racing 
Pigeon Society, whose president stated in a letter of support for the club&#151;and 
I apologise for this dreadful pun&#151;that his</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;members 
were shocked to hear that they would not have the privilege of holding our yearly 
'Doo' in the Polmont Staff Social Club.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
subject is not funny, but I thought that I would throw that in.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
also note that the social club is used by the local fly-fishing club and by the 
San Quentin Country and Western Club. I hope that all those organisations do not 
use the club at the same time. Anyway, that demonstrates the range of activities 
that take place in what is a community club.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members 
have heard about the money that was spent. That money was spent for a reason&#151;it 
was spent because the prison officers thought that they were going to be able 
to buy the property. The meat of the debate lies in the text of the motion. The 
SPS should</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;honour 
its commitment to allow the club to purchase the property&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
is the starting point and the end point of the debate. The offer was made when 
the club needed building up. That has been done&#151;investment has taken place 
and the club is profitable. It has much more money in its bank account than I 
have; it can start running my finances for me. I believe that the club has £12,000 
in savings and has invested about £40,000. The club was built up to the point 
of its being ready to be purchased and to make its way within the community. At 
the last minute, the plug was pulled without a whisper of consultation&#151;the 
club was simply told, &quot;Your lease is not being </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14549">14549</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">renewed.&quot; That is typical of 
the management of the Scottish Prison Service.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
will be interested to hear how the Deputy Minister for Justice can defend the 
management of the SPS. I suggest, with respect, that Tony Cameron has the opportunity 
to show that he has changed his colours and that he is a listening chief executive. 
For years, he has trashed and demoralised prison officers through failure to reorganise 
the prisons. The prison officers run a successful club. Mr Cameron can show that 
he is listening to the people in the Prison Service, so let him make his first 
such gesture by allowing the prison officers to keep their building.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:31</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mrs 
Lyndsay McIntosh (Central Scotland) (Con): </strong>I support Michael Matheson's motion 
and thank him for bringing the matter to members' attention.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like 
other members, I have been contacted by constituents who work at Polmont young 
offenders institution. They expressed their concerns about the SPS's planned closure 
of their social club. The social club is the only place where staff are able to 
relax, to wind down and to have a drink&#151;while still in uniform&#151;when 
their shifts have ended. There is no doubt that looking after some of the challenging 
youngsters can be hectic and stressful; the club can provide a comfortable venue 
for a relaxed debriefing after the day's events.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
club offers social and recreational value to its members and the charitable and 
fundraising ventures that it organises benefit greatly the local community in 
Falkirk. Many members have spoken about the organisations that use the club, which 
I do not propose to rehash. The club is seen as an integral part of the community, 
so for its members and others in the community, the closure of the club will mean 
the substantial loss of a safe and affordable recreational amenity.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
am given to understand that bookings have been taken for functions for more than 
a year in advance. That brings me to my concern about how the news of the planned 
closure of the club was communicated. Although I could be corrected, I understand 
that the news of the closure was supposed to be kept secret until the last minute&#151;4 
December&#151;even though the decision had been taken some considerable time in 
advance. If the social club had had the slightest inkling that its future was 
in doubt, is it likely that it would have spent £40,000 to £50,000 on a programme 
of upgrading and refurbishment of the bar and lounge areas? If my figures are 
different from those of other members, that is possibly the Holyrood effect&#151;we 
cannot get our figures right on that either.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14550">14550</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the SPS had taken more interest 
in its employees and in their club, it might have known of the planned expenditure. 
As things stand, the money has been abused. Has not the SPS been vindictive on 
a scale that members of the Parliament should deplore?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Battle-hardened 
politicians are used to the idea of repairing to one of the local hostelries for 
refreshment or light relief after a day's endeavour. Talking is thirsty work and 
we are happy to take our chances among the voting public, if we are lucky, or 
among colleagues or parliamentary journalists, if we are not so lucky. We will 
not have had to cut down a youngster who has taken, or who has attempted to take, 
his own life. The effects on people who are touched by suicide might never leave 
them. I hope that Michael Matheson will forgive my advert for the motion on suicide 
that I have lodged.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said 
that I would be brief. I am eager to hear the minister's response.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:34</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Stewart 
Stevenson (Banff and Buchan) (SNP): </strong>I am happy to support Michael Matheson's 
motion on his local constituency interest, just as he and many other members have 
so excellently supported the prison officers who are employed in Peterhead in 
my constituency.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I see 
that Richard Simpson has just received a note on SPS notepaper, which I hope carries 
late advice of good news. We should perhaps characterise the relationship between 
the SPS and its staff as one that is based on trust and understanding: the SPS 
does not understand its staff and the staff can no longer trust the SPS.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
view of the amount of time that I have spent in prisons and in the company of 
prison officers over the past year, my friends and colleagues are perhaps beginning 
to wonder about my own bona fides, but the bona fides of the executive of the 
SPS are at the heart of today's debate. Does the SPS regard staff merely as a 
resource to fire off against problems and the duties that it has been given? Does 
the SPS regard prisoners simply as a commodity to be processed through the Prison 
Service? I hope not. The issue is entirely different, but such an attitude would 
be consistent with what often seem to be the commercial ambitions of the chief 
executive of the Scottish Prison Service.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
would rather see the SPS show that it cares, that it is interested in public policy 
and that it wants to deliver on public safety. We can do that by having a Prison 
Service that is well resourced in buildings and programmes, but none of that will 
matter if we cannot deliver staff who are committed and who are able to go the 
extra mile that we get from excellence in public services.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14551">14551</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As in the estates review's proposals 
for Peterhead, we do not know the cost of closing the social club and such a cost 
cannot necessarily be measured in pounds and pence. The cost will be paid in a 
continuing reduction in the morale of the people who are employed in the Prison 
Service.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once again, the 
Prison Service has made an arcane and perverse decision that goes against everything 
that the Executive tells us about partnership. There is no partnership between 
the executive of the Prison Service and the people who are employed at Polmont 
if the SPS closes the facility in the way that has been described. The Prison 
Service and the minister will have noted that, when a community is roused as it 
was in Peterhead, a community can win. I see every sign that the community in 
Polmont is on the point of taking to the barricades; I will join them there if 
it will help.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know that 
the minister had extensive experience of the Prison Service prior to coming to 
the Parliament and that he has a personal understanding of human psychology. If 
we cannot look to the Prison Service for ethical, caring and professional behaviour 
towards staff and their responsibilities to the wider public, I see nothing but 
the bleakest of futures for the Prison Service.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I

he would not be accepted as a member.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The

Deputy Minister for Justice (Dr Richard Simpson): </strong>I congratulate Michael Matheson 
on securing the time for this debate on a matter that is undoubtedly of considerable 
importance to the people in Polmont. That has been evident from all the speeches 
that have been made. I acknowledge the fact that Cathy Peattie, Dennis Canavan 
and Donald Gorrie have received representations on the matter. Indeed, I have 
discussed the issue with Cathy Peattie at some length a number of times, and correspondence 
has passed from my desk to that of the SPS.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First 
let me give a little history. The clubs&#151;there were some 11 of them&#151;were 
set up in the 1950s and shortly thereafter, when all or most of the prison staff 
were required to live in the vicinity of the prison. At that time, the SPS owned 
substantial property in the area of the prison. Today, very few properties are 
owned&#151;a few in </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14552">14552</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Edinburgh and a few in Cornton Vale&#151;and 
there is no longer a requirement to live in the vicinity. The second change is 
that, of the 11 clubs, I think that three are left&#151;although I am not sure 
of the exact figure. Certainly, few are left. There has been a process of divestment 
and clubs have gradually been closed or sold, or returned to operational use. 
There are only a few exceptions to that.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
1998, when the policy was being promoted that the clubs could be sold off and 
that the SPS could divest itself of direct interest in them, all the remaining 
clubs were asked to express an interest if they wished to purchase the club. I 
am advised by the SPS that no such request was received from Polmont, but today's 
debate has shown that members of the Polmont club take a different view. However, 
as far as I am aware, there has been no subsequent pressure by the club to try 
to go through with the sale.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
the intervening period, the SPS&#151;following the Executive's policy&#151;has 
had to consider proper training for officers in the coming years. The SPS must 
ensure that the college at Polmont, or at an alternative site, is developed to 
promote training for new admissions to the service and for continuing professional 
development. I know the college at Polmont well; I have attended it many times. 
It has poor access, inadequate parking and dilapidated buildings, and it requires 
substantial refurbishment. The SPS is therefore totally correct, in its pursuit 
of correctional excellence, to consider this issue seriously before deciding how 
to proceed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An option for 
the SPS was to find a fresh site and, in due course, to build a new college. Another 
option was to retain the existing college and revise, extend and improve it to 
make it fit for the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century&#151;thus retaining some 70 jobs in 
the Polmont area and, appropriately, providing ready access, because it is in 
central Scotland. In August of this year, the latter option was chosen. The SPS 
is developing its plans accordingly.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
consequence of that decision is, I understand, that the site of the current staff 
club will be required to ensure safe access to the new kitchens for lorries. At 
present, access to the site is not wholly satisfactory. As to whether the site 
could be retained in some way within the present college, I do not have sufficient 
knowledge to give an answer. However, I understand that that is not possible and 
that the development is important.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
club is undoubtedly well run and&#151;as we have heard from all members&#151;is 
used extensively by members of the community and by clubs within that community, 
as well as by its 350 members and by its associate members. Clearly, the facility 
is highly regarded in the community. It seems to me that the outcome of discussions 
between the </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14553">14553</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SPS, the college, the community and 
Falkirk Council should be that a resource of some sort should be available in 
the area to meet the needs of the community. Whether that facility will still 
be linked to the SPS is another matter.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
have learned from today's speeches that a substantial amount of money has been 
invested by the club. In meetings that have been held, the figure of £15,000 is 
all that has been mentioned. Today, a figure of between £40,000 and £50,000, and 
a figure of £45,000, have been put on the record. Investment has been made that, 
technically and legally, was made at the risk of the club, because that is the 
form of the lease. Nevertheless, we should consider carefully whether some form 
of recompense or negotiated settlement can be arrived at.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under 
the lease that has been in place since the 1980s, notice must be given in December 
for termination of the lease in January. As far as I know, no attempt has been 
made to renegotiate that lease. Legally, therefore, the SPS did not have to give 
notice to the club until December.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
understand that two meetings have taken place between the club and the SPS at 
which there were discussions about alternative properties and alternative land. 
Again, those meetings were alluded to although I am not quite sure how accurate 
the figures were. Certainly, the figure of £300,000 is not correct. One figure 
referred to land and one to buildings. Those figures were being combined by my 
colleagues; perhaps that was not appropriate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Michael 
Matheson: </strong>I have a letter from the SPS that was sent by e-mail dated 4 October. 
The letter details that it would cost £100,000 per acre, or £200,000, to buy the 
properties at Newlands Road.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dr 
Simpson: </strong>That confirms what I was saying. Those figures should not be combined; 
they are separate figures.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
is important that there should be continuing dialogue between the club and the 
SPS. The SPS should consider carefully whether the site is an absolute requirement 
for the extension. If it is, the SPS must proceed because the college is important 
in terms of both employment and the future of the SPS.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alternative 
sites might be considered and there might be some way in which the local community, 
Falkirk Council and the SPS could come together. At present, the SPS pays the 
rates and charges a peppercorn rent to the club. The club is therefore in a position 
whereby the SPS is giving some subsidy to the local community, and whether that 
should be the role of the SPS is a matter for considerable debate.</FONT></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col14554">14554</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

change its position.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Lord

made by the SPS was not made by ministers? In view of the substantial issues of 
concern that have been raised by members of all parties today, will the minister 
make certain that the SPS is aware of that strong concern and that it pursues 
those matters in dialogue with the club?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dr

further discussion with the SPS and convey personally the strong feelings that 
have been expressed by members of all parties.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
am concerned that we should have a modern prison service in which there is trust 
and understanding&#151;not in the form that was described by Stewart Stevenson,

SPS is a basis on which we can proceed. We have to undo some of the past antagonism 
between the two sides.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
hope that we can have further discussions in that area and that we can try to 
ensure that this worthwhile community effort is considered further in a satisfactory 
way. I hope that each side will at least understand where the other is coming
