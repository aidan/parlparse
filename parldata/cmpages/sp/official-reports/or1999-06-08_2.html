<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Business Manager (Mr Tom McCabe):
</strong>Motion S1M-37 has been lodged following extensive discussion by the
Parliamentary Bureau about the size of the mandatory committees that are
required to be established under the standing orders of this Parliament.
In addition, the bureau has discussed the number and range of subject committees
that it is proposed should be established to scrutinise the work of the
Scottish Executive. It may assist members if I make it clear at this stage
that, if the Parliament accepts the motion, the Parliamentary Bureau will
bring forward a further motion specifying which members should serve on
which committees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As members may be aware, the standing orders
prescribe that committees should have no fewer than five and no more than
15 members. The proposals before the chamber are that the European Committee
and the Equal Opportunities Committee should consist of 13 members, that
the Finance Committee and the Audit Committee should consist of 11 members,
and that the Procedures Committee, the Standards Committee, the Public
Petitions Committee and the Subordinate Legislation Committee should consist
of seven members each. All the subject committees will consist of 11 members
each.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The proposals will ensure that the committees
are of an adequate size to undertake the tasks falling to them and will
enable a proper balance of representation across the parties in the Parliament
to be achieved. For example, it is anticipated that, in a committee of
seven members, the Scottish Labour party would have three members, the
Scottish National party would have two members, and the Conservatives and
Liberal Democrats would have one member each. In committees of 11 members,
the Scottish Labour party would have five members, the SNP would have three
members, and the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats would have either
one or two members. Provision will be made in the motion on membership
to allow each independent member to participate in one committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For all of us, whether our background is
Westminster, local government or somewhere else entirely, the Scottish
Parliament committee structure will be unprecedented. The consultative
steering group, whose recommendations we shall discuss more generally tomorrow,
suggested the all-purpose committee structure, which will combine the roles
of select and standing committees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Committee members can expect to become&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">experts in their
particular subject area as they scrutinise legislation and examine the
Executive's action in that area. Because of that, it is fair to say that
the work of the committees is likely to be both challenging and rewarding.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Members will note that the motion proposes
that the remit of the subject committees should reflect the distribution
of responsibilities among ministers of the Scottish Executive. That is
to ensure that those ministers, their staff and the bodies responsible
to them are readily accountable to the Parliament. The division of responsibility
will facilitate the Parliament's work in scrutinising the activities of
the Executive and in considering the policy proposals brought forward by
individual ministers. It is worth stressing the important role that committees
will play in our work.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Under the terms of our standing orders,
committees are responsible for scrutinising the work of the Executive,
but also for considering any proposals for legislation on matters within
their competence. That includes primary legislation in the form of bills
brought forward by the Executive and subordinate legislation in the form
of orders requiring the Parliament's approval. Individual committees will
also be able to consider any European Community legislation referred to
them by the European Committee. Committees may consider the need for reform
of the law which relates to, or affects, any matter within their competence,
and they may initiate bills on any competent matter.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Certain mandatory committees have particular
roles to play. I have referred to the role of the European Committee in
considering proposals for European Communities legislation and in referring
such matters to the Parliamentary Bureau for consideration by other committees
as appropriate. The Finance Committee will have particular responsibility
for scrutinising the public expenditure proposals put forward by the Scottish
Executive. The Audit Committee will have the important task of considering
any accounts laid before the Parliament and any report concerning public
expenditure laid by the Auditor General for Scotland. Those are important
tasks, which committees will need to develop and take forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Committees will play a key role in engaging
civic society in the work of the Parliament-I will say more about that
later. To assist them in that process, committees may want to appoint reporters.
A reporter will be a member of a committee who is chosen to bring together
a committee report on a particular subject; the reporter is likely to become
the focus of external representations to that committee. Although being
a reporter will involve an additional work load, I trust that the opportunity
will be welcomed enthusiastically.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>I will risk Mr McAllion's disdain by contributing to this afternoon's
debate. I draw the Business Manager's attention to motion S1M-7, in which
a call was made for committees of the Parliament to meet around Scotland
on a roving basis and, where appropriate, to meet permanently at locations
outwith the Edinburgh campus. That motion has been signed by members of
all six parties represented in this chamber and by the one independent
member, so there is clearly a broad consensus in its favour.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It would be to the Parliament's credit,
in bringing a new democracy to Scotland to start the new century, if we
were to assert the fact that the Parliament is not just Edinburgh's, but
Scotland's. Indeed, our work should go around the country, both on a roving
basis and, where possible, on a permanent basis. I hope that the Business
Manager and his deputy will, in their summation, indicate the Government's
support for that principle, so that the Parliamentary Bureau can take it
forward as part of the structure of committees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">14:45</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians)
(Con): </strong>We warmly welcome Mr Tom McCabe's motion. However, perhaps it
was a slip of the tongue when he referred to the Scottish National party
and the Scottish Labour party, but merely to the Conservative party. We
are the Scottish Conservative party; we have a devolved, autonomous structure
and our decisions are made in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For the Parliament to work effectively,
we must establish powerful committees to give it teeth. The mandatory committees
and the subject committees will have key roles to play and will be able
to recommend changes whenever necessary. The Audit Committee, for example,
will be able to play much the same role as the powerful Public Accounts
Committee in the House of Commons. The Procedures Committee could no doubt
consider whether Scotland's First Minister should be subjected to a First
Minister's question time, which at present the standing orders are sparing
him. The Parliament will be entitled to change standing orders if it so
chooses.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

is covered by Andrew Wilson's motion. I believe that, if the committee
system is to work well, it should&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">reflect the interests
of the whole of Scotland and be prepared to move around Scotland. In our
manifesto, we proposed that we should build on the precedent of the Scottish
Grand Committee and move committees around Scotland to seek advice from
relevant bodies. The committees would then be able to hold public meetings,
at which local people could contribute ideas and question their elected
representatives. That would bring government much closer to the people,
and make it easier for individuals to make their representations. We support
the motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">14:47</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):
</strong>I have a few points to which I hope Mr McCabe can reply or give some
thought. My first point concerns the role of civil servants in supporting
and facilitating the committees and making them effective. Traditionally,
at Westminster, civil servants worked for ministers and against MPs, or
so it always appeared to me. They regarded difficult people such as me
as the enemy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will have to create a new climate of
opinion, which may mean that people such as me will have to change as well
as the civil servants. I accept that, but in the committees we should all
be one team. It is important that civil servants should positively support
the committees, because the committees will explore those areas in which
the Government does not yet have a policy and will critically examine those
areas in which it does. Either way, the skill and knowledge of the civil
servants should be fully at the service of the committees. I hope that
work will be done on that, and that a concordat-or whatever the current
phrase is-is drawn up, so that, working together, we can achieve a slightly
better result than our football team does.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, I hope that, in addition to the
committees, we can fairly rapidly set up either sub-committees or working
groups on areas within the remit of a committee or on areas that cover
several committees. For example, there may be other members who, like me,
have a particular interest in youth work, which does not figure in any
of the remits. Youth work relates to a number of areas, including education,
health, law and order, social work and local government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Such sub-committees or working groups could
deal with areas in which members-who might not be serving on the relevant
committee-had a particular interest and to which they could make a real
contribution. Such areas could include the voluntary sector, housing, sport
and the arts. One&nbsp;</font></td>

at urban transport and another could look at rural transport. We could
make a great deal of progress if fairly small groups of interested people
worked on an area. They could sufficiently work up a subject to enable
it to be considered by the official committee system. I am sure that the
official committees will have a long queue of issues to which they will
want to attend. Breaking things down in that way will enable us to make
more progress more quickly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that committees can be flexible,
so that committee A can have a totally different system of working from
that of committee B. Mr McCabe indicated that that might be the case and
I would welcome it. I also hope that the committees will not be strangled
by bureaucracy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some thought must be given to timetabling,
so that we can all play a full part according to our different interests.
There is a difficulty about when groups who come to lobby this Parliament-as
opposed to Westminster, where the working day is much longer-can gain access
and have their say. That point has been raised with me and with other members
who have been to one or two meetings. There should also be an opportunity
for all-party groups to meet.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As a glutton for punishment, I would have
liked larger committees, but obviously that view did not carry the day.
The proposed committee structure is a great start; it represents a great
opportunity and I hope that Mr McCabe can reassure me on the points that
I have raised.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">14:51</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>On behalf of the SNP, I welcome the motion. Mr Gorrie is right
to say that the committees will be the building blocks of the Parliament's
success. The committees have their own dynamic and, as Mr McCabe outlined,
if they work productively and strongly they will inform not just the future
of the Parliament but the future of everything that the Parliament does.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also welcome the role of the Parliamentary
Bureau in drawing up the committee proposals. The bureau's work will be
undertaken, as much as possible, by consensus; this motion shows that it
is possible to produce detailed proposals about how the Parliament should
work. That has been achieved through the work of the business managers,
who have produced a set of proposals that meets all the requirements of
all the parties. In the subject committees, the proposals provide for detailed
scrutiny and innovation across the whole range of work that is to be done.
They also provide for the mandatory committees, which will have an important
role in supervising what takes place in the Parliament, in making recommendations

on the process of examining the standing orders. Clerks and members have

It is important that the Parliament and its committees are seen all over

probably be debated later today. The people of Scotland expect us to start
to debate the issues that really concern them: improving health; investing
in education; caring for the elderly; and developing the economy. In addressing
the key issues, the committees will be vital because of the links that
they can build up across many of the subject areas. In particular, I welcome
the link between health and community care, as it recognises the overlap
that exists in those services. The proposals also give us the opportunity
to push forward our agenda.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The remits of the other subject committees
are also sensible. However, we should strive through the Parliament to
achieve, where necessary, an integrated approach. For example, the committee
that considers social inclusion should examine a range of policy initiatives
other than those within its specific remit. All members of committees should
ensure that they are aware of the relevant work of other parts of the Parliament,
of the UK Government and of the European Union.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Andrew Wilson pointed out, committees
have a vital role in ensuring that the Parliament is regarded as a Parliament
for all of Scotland. Committees have an essential role in encouraging the
participation throughout our democracy that many of us wish to develop,
and they will lead to better decision making. The Executive will have a
responsibility to carry out full consultation on bills that it introduces;
where committees feel that the consultation process has not been full enough,
they have a key role in influencing legislation by conducting further investigations
and inviting interested parties to give evidence. I spoke to many groups
in my constituency of Livingston before and after the election and I know
that they look forward to being involved in the work of committees and
to the opportunity to influence policy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I firmly believe that the committee system
that we will adopt will give members a full role in influencing and initiating
legislation. It will allow an appropriate balance of power to develop between
the Executive and the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Keith Raffan (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(LD):</strong> I welcome this motion, and I very much agree with what Mr Russell
said. Committees are at the heart of this Parliament's work. They will
not be the same as committees at Westminster, where they are a kind of
addendum that was added 20 years ago. We are developing the Westminster
committee structure. In effect, our committees are a hybrid between the
select committees and standing committees at Westminster. They are both
investigative and legislative. Indeed, committees in the Scottish Parliament
go beyond&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">that because they
also have the ability to initiate legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is one of my concerns over the numbers.
Eleven is a fair number for an investigative or select committee; I am
not sure that it is the right number for a standing committee, although
I accept the constraints that are imposed by the total membership of the
Parliament. I understand from the consultative steering group report that
other members, with the permission of the convener, will be able to speak
at a committee, perhaps at the legislative stage, even if they are not
able to vote. It is important that members who are not on particular committees,
but who perhaps have a constituency or specialised interest, can speak
at those committees. That would get round the numbers problem.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I agree with Mr McCabe about the alignment
of the committees with the ministries. They are aligned in every case except
that of Ms Alexander's ministry, which has two committees. I do not want
to undermine the importance of social inclusion, but it might have been
better if social inclusion had been one of the ad hoc, so-called cross-cutting
or cross-departmental committees. I certainly agree with Mr Gorrie that
we must have that flexibility. One of my interests at Westminster was the
issue of drug misuse. With the serious problem of drug misuse in Scotland,
we badly need a cross-departmental-and cross-party-committee in this Parliament
to consider that issue. It would cover health and community care, justice
and home affairs, as well as education, the subject areas of a range of
committees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Committees must have flexibility in undertaking
one-day inquiries. For example, the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee
might want to take evidence in a part of Scotland where there were serious
factory closures. At Westminster, I was responsible for the select committee
of which I was a member going outside Westminster for the first time. That
was to hold a hearing in my constituency on an important factory closure
that had an impact on the entire community. The chairman of the company
had to give oral evidence in front of the work force. That was a salutary
lesson for him, and it led to a very important and helpful package being
given by Courtaulds to my constituency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I agree with what has been said today about
the committees moving around the country. The importance of that was emphasised
in the white paper and the consultative steering group report. It is important
that the committees move around Scotland, both to visit and to take oral
evidence. I am not sure that I would join Mr Wilson in asking for any of
the committees to be permanently based away from the Parliament as I do
not know how practical that would be. I am not averse to the&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not think that the issue of staffing
and resources has been covered so far. If the committees are to be effective,
they must be well resourced in terms of both staffing and funding. At times,
it may not be in the Executive's interest for them to be as well resourced
as I would like, but they are there to hold the Executive to account. If
we are to be an effective democratic institution, the committees must have
the human and financial resources that they require.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

was inspired to speak by James Douglas-Hamilton's intervention. There was
also a slip of the tongue by Tom McCabe in relation to independent members.
As he knows, no member was elected as an independent: Dennis was elected
as the member for Falkirk West, I was elected as a Scottish Socialist party
member and Robin was elected as a Scottish Green party member. I mention
that so that we start off on the right foot and give each other the right
titles, at least at the start of these debates. We might change titles
during the course of the debates, but I am sure that that will be friendly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mike Russell referred to the Parliamentary
Bureau. We have been very grateful for the arrangement that provides informal
briefings for the smaller parties. Would Mr McCabe agree that that should
become a formalised arrangement, in case we ever fall out with anybody
and they become less friendly? It is important that the smaller parties
can be briefed on the Parliamentary Bureau's business.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that we can communicate the briefs
of the committees to civic Scotland. In Stirling this morning, I had the
pleasure of attending the Scottish Pensioners Forum conference, one group
of many that want their views to be heard by this Parliament at an early
stage. However, the remits of some of the committees would not make apparent
whom such organisations should approach. It will be important that the
remit of those committees is clear, as soon as they are established, so
that interest groups, which have a wide range of issues to raise, are able
to contact the right people in order to get us to fulfil the promises that
we have made.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

participation in mind; we talk a lot about consultation, but if the committees
are to work and this is to be a people's Parliament, we need to promote
the idea of participation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important that we look at the way
in which the committees gather information, so that there is an opportunity
for the voluntary sector, at both local and national levels, and the civic
community in Scotland to influence the decision-making process. We must
also consider issues such as social inclusion. There is no point talking
about social inclusion in isolation; we need the opportunity to visit areas
and to allow for other ways of gathering information, such as people's
juries, to ensure that local people have a voice. They must be able to
speak in their own voice and their own tongue to put forward information.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to make a brief speech on the question
of inclusiveness. We have heard from a number of members about the importance
of the Parliament including all Scotland and, in terms of the committees
travelling around, basing their activities throughout Scotland and providing
the maximum opportunity for participation, and I support that. We have
also heard about the importance of civic Scotland, whether it is the pensioners'
groups or other groups, having a focus by making representations to the
committees and having a clearly identifiable method of doing that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, one of the failings of the Parliament
is that, as yet, not one member of the ethnic minority communities in Scotland
was elected, and I would like the Equal Opportunities Committee to consider
that at an early opportunity. A number of members of ethnic minorities
stood for various parties, but none was elected. At an early sitting, the
Equal Opportunities Committee should consider the possibility of co-option.
I had a brief look at our standing orders and people would have to be co-opted
as non-voting members, and I can understand that in terms of election and
parliamentary procedure. In order to re-balance the Parliament and to ensure
that it represents all Scotland, the Equal Opportunities Committee should
consider the co-option of members of Scotland's ethnic minorities. I am
sure that there are many capable people who would be willing to serve if
we could develop such a procedure. At this stage, I would like some indication
that co-option could be looked upon favourably and that the Equal Opportunities

the committees will have a hybrid role. They will hold pre-legislative

and I hope that the committee will take on such issues.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A number of points have been raised during
the debate, and I will address the issue of the location of committees
first. We are all minded to support the principles behind Andrew Wilson's
motion that committees should move around the country. They should not
be static in Edinburgh, expecting everyone to come to Edinburgh to see
them; they should visit the communities in Scotland in order to investigate
the issues.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not think that, at this stage, we
should tie ourselves down to specifying how that should work. The committees
themselves need to consider their programmes, the issues that they intend
to address and how best they can obtain the views of the people who are
affected by those issues. It should then be for the committees to make
proposals about holding meetings around the country. While no one is against
that principle, we need to explore certain practical issues, such as the
situation where there are two committees meeting on the same day in different
parts of the country and one person is a member of both. It could be a
bit of a problem for a member to address both meetings, if one is in Dumfries
and the other is in Inverness. We must consider those practicalities, but
the principle is certainly accepted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Donald Gorrie raised a number of important
issues, including the role of civil servants who support committees. We
must recognise that, under existing terms, civil servants are not directly
answerable to this Parliament, as they remain responsible to the ministers
and to the Executive. However, we all agree that there needs to be a proper
understanding of the relationships between the committees, Parliament,
civil servants and ministers. I hope that civil servants will provide as
much support as is needed to allow the committees to carry out their work,
particularly their investigative work.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

other committees that might consider cross-cutting issues, such as youth
