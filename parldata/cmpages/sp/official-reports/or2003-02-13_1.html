Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </STRONG>Before we start this morning, 
I inform members that there are problems with the automated cameras; therefore, 
I have exceptionally authorised two manned cameras to be situated on the floor.</P><P>The 
first item of business is a debate on motion S1M-3893, in the name of Pauline 
McNeill, on the Justice 2 Committee's report on the Crown Office and Procurator 
Fiscal Service inquiry. I call Pauline McNeill to speak to and move the motion 
on behalf of the Justice 2 Committee.</P><P>09:31</P><P><strong>Pauline McNeill 
(Glasgow Kelvin) (Lab): </strong>The committee's inquiry seems to have been the 
longest inquiry in the history of the Parliament&#151;it probably is. The seven-member 
Justice 2 Committee changed its membership a few times during the course of the 
inquiry, and we even had a change of clerks. I cannot give enough thanks to the 
committee members for their perseverance and sheer hard work in compiling the 
report in between scrutinising legislation, petitions and Scottish statutory instruments. 
I thank Stewart Stevenson, Duncan Hamilton, George Lyon, Alasdair Morrison, Scott 
Barrie and Bill Aitken for the hard work that they have done on the report.</P><P>I 
speak for all committee members when I put on record my utter admiration and thanks 
for the work of our clerks, Gillian Baxendine, Irene Fleming and, formerly, Fiona 
Groves. No task was too big and no member's comment was too garbled for Gillian 
to translate it into English to produce the report, which has, so far, been well 
received.</P><P>One and a half years on from when we first started, it seems that 
there might not be much controversy; nonetheless, I am relying on Bill Aitken 
to introduce some, because I know that he likes to do so. I thank Bill for assisting 
me and for putting in extra time to meet the report's deadline, for which I am 
very grateful.</P><P>The report has been quietly accepted and not widely reported, 
but I am not at all disappointed about that. I truly believe that the report achieved 
its purpose long before it was published and that </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18130">18130</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>much has changed already. Our decision to report on the state of the Crown 
Office and Procurator Fiscal Service was a dynamic decision and it became unstoppable 
when it was matched by the will of the Crown Office team to make changes. Most 
of my comments this morning will be positive, but I shall also highlight some 
concerns that I still have.</P><P>For me, it all began when my local police station 
explained to me how difficult it was to speak to a procurator fiscal. The police 
officers had just completed a local campaign of charging young offenders who were 
committing crimes against the elderly community and committing crimes in Anderston, 
in my constituency. The officers were all concerned that the charges would be 
dropped as a matter of policy, but they had great difficulty in establishing contact 
with a fiscal who could advise them whether the proceedings would go ahead. In 
the view of many policemen and policewomen in the service, the days were long 
gone when they had the kind of relationship with the local procurator fiscal in 
which they could simply phone the fiscal up and find things out. There were not 
enough fiscals, they were overworked and the relationships were not as strong 
as they used to be.</P><P>It was that situation that first made me want to know 
why the system had changed and how it could become more joined up and better resourced. 
Many MSPs have shared that interest and have written to the committee about their 
experiences, including among others Shona Robison, Duncan McNeil, and Cathy Jamieson, 
and we are grateful for their input. The terms of the remit that we announced 
on 8 May 2001 were:</P><P>&quot;To investigate whether the resources available 
to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, including numbers of staff 
and the experience levels of senior prosecutors, are sufficient to meet its stated 
aim of thorough, critical and accurate investigation, preparation and presentation 
of cases, while having sensitivity to the needs of victims and witnesses."</P><P>We 
agreed to examine a range of specific issues. Among those were: trends in the 
number and types of cases, including the increasing complexity of serious crime; 
the effectiveness of liaison between the police; staff morale; and the trends 
in the use of fiscal fines and plea bargaining. We thought that the inquiry would 
give some indication as to whether the system was under-resourced.</P><P>The committee 
suspected that the system was under tremendous pressure because of a lack of resources, 
and we expected to find that there was overuse of the fiscal fines system and 
a tendency for soft pleas to be submitted prior to trials. However, what we found 
was a highly dedicated service that was under severe pressure because of the lack 
of resources and its having too few fiscals, but which rarely complained, so we 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18131">18131</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>believed that the quality of justice was at stake. In addition, the culture 
in the Crown Office was such that its staff did not regard it as their job to 
argue for more resources. However, that has changed.</P><P>Professor Duff presented 
the committee with evidence on the use of fiscal fines. He said that there was 
no evidence that they were being used more than they had been in the past. However, 
he also said that</P><P>&quot;Experienced defence solicitors know that if everything 
is left to the last minute the poor fiscal depute will be so hard pressed that 
the defence solicitor might be able to negotiate a better deal on behalf of their 
client.&quot;</P><P>There might not be hard evidence, but there certainly was 
a view around that the quality of justice could be suffering because of a lack 
of resources.</P><P>In Glasgow sheriff court, fiscals conducting the Monday morning 
custody courts can be there until late into the evening. Sheriffs and clerks also 
work late, but the fiscal is the only person who has no administrative assistance. 
Anthony Campbell, giving evidence on his Chhokar report, remarked that a precognition 
officer in the Hamilton office was starting work at 5 am before going to court 
on a serious child-protection case.</P><P>The committee's view is that the prosecutor's 
role is a special one because in the marking of cases determining crime, decisions 
are constantly being made in an instant. For example, a decision can be taken 
in an instant as to whether a particular offender is to be charged with careless 
driving or with dangerous driving. I know that that matters to people. No case 
is ever straightforward, and I believe strongly that the delivery of high-quality 
justice depends on prosecutors&#151;although not on them alone&#151;and that a 
strong prosecutor can make a real difference in both the marking of cases and 
the prosecution of crime in our courts.</P><P>That is why I am pleased that the 
interview boards for new fiscals have acknowledged that recruiting from a wide 
and varied range of people whose backgrounds include a variety of experiences 
can add something to the system. The morale of the service has been lower than 
in any public sector service in recent times. Dealing with crime has become more 
complex and the introduction of the European convention on human rights has made 
its mark on the service, which is probably more accountable that it has ever been. 
The committee feels strongly that the Crown Office should, in the future, conduct 
another stress audit to ensure that that particular issue in the service has been 
tackled.</P><P>It is arguable that the Crown Office has been the most scrutinised 
department of government. Prior to devolution, the law officers spent a large 
percentage of their time out of Scotland and did </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18132">18132</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>not receive many parliamentary questions. However, figures show that there 
has been about a 63 per cent increase in questions to them. There is certainly 
more work for our Lord Advocate and Solicitor General and times have changed for 
the better. However, I would like to put on record my thanks to the Lord Advocate, 
the Solicitor General and Alistair Brown for their co-operation with, and assistance 
to, the committee during its inquiries.</P><P>Staff numbers were a particular 
concern for the committee. We felt that it was important to consider that issue, 
which would indicate to us whether resources were adequate. We note the increase 
of 95 in the number of legal staff between 1997 and 2002, which is a 33 per cent 
increase. However, I must emphasise that the committee had difficulty in assessing 
the value that that added to the service. We wanted an establishment figure for 
every office, including information on the office's vacancies and any increase&#151;or 
otherwise&#151;in staff, so that we could assess where the additional staff were 
in Scotland, but I am not satisfied that we received the figures that would have 
allowed us to do that.</P><P>We chose to visit the Hamilton office&#151;for obvious 
reasons&#151;and were surprised to find that, 10 months on from the Jandoo report 
on the Chhokar case, there were still staff shortages. My visit with Bill Aitken 
to the Hamilton office yesterday has still to be reported on, but it is fair to 
say that we are beginning to see important changes for the better.</P><P>During 
its work, the committee felt strongly about victims; how victims are treated in 
the system was of major concern to the committee, so we chose to examine two case 
studies to elaborate our views. I am grateful to Ken Macintosh and to the Cawley 
family, who are his constituents. They described their experiences, which can 
only be called horrendous, to the committee. There was no one to greet them at 
the High Court when they arrived and there was no one to advise them why the second 
accused was sitting next to them in the public gallery following his acquittal 
the night before for lack of evidence. I am grateful to the Cawley family for 
highlighting a situation that I believe other families might have gone through. 
I know that, if it is anything to do with the Scottish Parliament, that will not 
be allowed to happen again.</P><P>Alan Kerr is an example of a father trying to 
support his son. He travelled from Ayrshire to Glasgow many times only to see 
the trial cancelled each time and was given no support or explanation for what 
was happening. I am grateful to him for giving the committee evidence. There has 
been a lot of progress in how victims are treated and I do not believe that we 
will go back to such days as Alan Kerr described&#151;there should </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18133">18133</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>certainly be no repeat of that kind of treatment.</P><P>One or two things are 
worth considering in relation to the kind of system that we want to support victims. 
It is important that victims get information at every stage of the process, from 
the starting point at which a charge is made to the point at which the case goes 
to trial. Support during the trial to enable victims and their families to understand 
what is going on is vital, but I would not want that to interfere with the important 
work of the police and the procurators fiscal in the execution of their duties. 
We must ensure that we get that balance right.</P><P>I started by saying that 
my interest in the report relates to liaison with the police; I believe that it 
is essential that we ensure that that relationship does not break down in the 
future. The committee has recommended that the Solicitor General should have specific 
responsibility to ensure, at all levels of relationships between the Crown Office 
and the police, that liaison is functioning properly and that the police can speak 
to a procurator fiscal when they need to.</P><P>We have been careful to point 
out that other agencies expect prosecutions, such as the Scottish Environment 
Protection Agency and local authorities, who commented that they believed that 
the system could be better resourced to ensure that cases are prosecuted in relation 
to the crimes with which they are concerned. The Parliament will know that the 
Pryce-Dyer review, which was the Crown Office's internal inquiry, is a weighty 
report, the vast majority of which represents added value to our inquiry. The 
new management structure is already in place as a result of that review and seems, 
by all accounts, to have been much welcomed.</P><P>I have previously expressed 
some concern about the speed of the management changes. I know from the phone 
calls and correspondence that I receive from procurators fiscal on the front line 
that there is great concern that the resources are attached to the change in the 
management structure, as opposed to ensuring that those front-line fiscals are 
resourced. The committee is adamant that the conditions of service and the working 
conditions of procurators fiscal should be improved. We commented in the report 
about the need to have quiet space in the phenomenon of open-space planning. Procurators 
fiscal have written to us to say that that is an important development.</P><P>I 
am pleased that there is a prospect that the pay issue will be settled. That has 
calmed the fears of many frontline procurators fiscal who perceived that the priority 
was changes in management. I think that a progressive pay structure will attract 
the kind of people that we want to have in our procurator fiscal system, so </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18134">18134</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>there will be positive change in that regard.</P><P>Although I agree with much 
of what the Pryce-Dyer review had to say, I profoundly reject the parts that compare 
the service to the board of ICI. I am pleased that the Lord Advocate has rejected 
some of that and has ensured that the legal board at the top has a balance of 
legally qualified people.</P><P>We have done our best to report on what we have 
seen, on the many changes that have taken place and on what we have been told 
by the many people who have written to us. We have said that the report should 
be regarded as an interim report because it is important that the successor committee 
to the Justice 2 Committee assess the impact of some of the changes at a later 
date.</P><P>I put on record my thanks to everyone&#151;procurators fiscal, agencies 
and others&#151;who wrote to the committee detailing their experiences and encouraging 
us to do the work. I look forward to hearing the debate.</P><P>I move,</P><P>That 
the Parliament notes the 4th Report 2003 of the Justice 2 Committee, <em>Report 
on the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service Inquiry</em> (SP Paper 747), 
and agrees that progress in implementing the committee's recommendations and the 
Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service's programme of change should be kept 
under close review.</P><P>09:45</P><P><strong>The Lord Advocate (Colin Boyd): 
</strong>I begin by thanking the Justice 2 Committee for its report and for the 
constructive and diligent way in which its members have conducted the inquiry.</P><P>The 
report is one of a number that have been done in recent years into aspects of 
the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. The service has never before been 
subjected to the scrutiny that the Scottish Parliament has brought to bear on 
its activities. It has been a healthy experience and a catalyst for much-needed 
change in the service.</P><P>Today, I have the opportunity to acknowledge the 
work of the Justice 2 Committee and its importance in helping to drive and shape 
our programme of modernisation and reform. I also pay tribute to the convener, 
Pauline McNeill, and to Bill Aitken who assisted her in the work on the report.</P><P>As 
the report acknowledges, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service makes 
significant achievements every day. Complex cases are prosecuted successfully, 
sudden deaths are handled appropriately and sensitively, and the proceeds of crime 
are recovered.</P><P>Recently, however, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal 
Service has had to respond to </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18135">18135</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>increasing pressures, which has exposed the lack of investment and demonstrated 
a clear need for reform. That is why, following an internal management review, 
we set about putting in that investment and making those reforms by embarking 
on a comprehensive programme of reform and modernisation. I note the committee's 
concern about the speed of change, but I believe that we owed it to the Scottish 
public to respond quickly and effectively. It is worth noting what has been achieved 
over the past year.</P><P>There has been significant new investment&#151;this 
year's budget was increased from £63 million to £78 million, rising to £92 million 
by 2005-06. Some might say that that is not enough, but when I became Solicitor 
General in 1997, the budget was £46 million. We will have doubled that budget 
in eight years; I do not believe that there is any other agency in the criminal 
justice system that has had that level of investment.</P><P>In 2002, 159 new full-time 
equivalent staff were recruited, 113 of them since March. There has been major 
restructuring of the service, bringing our areas into line with police force boundaries 
and allowing closer co-operation between the police and the prosecution service.</P><P>There 
has been strengthening of corporate support and investment in human resources, 
training, information technology and management information systems. We have reviewed 
the preparation and prosecution of High Court cases and made significant changes 
to the role and appointment of advocate deputes. We have widened the pool of people 
who are eligible to prosecute and we have made changes to the way in which the 
most serious crimes are prosecuted. We have created eight pathfinder offices to 
test new ways of working and we have produced standard task instructions that 
will become the templates for the whole organisation.</P><P>The programme is not 
a programme of short-term fixes; its scope is long term and is aimed at creating 
a Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service that wins the confidence of the people 
of Scotland; that is committed to professional excellence; that pursues cases 
independently, fairly and consistently and in the public interest; that is responsive 
to the public's needs; that provides a full, satisfying and rewarding career for 
staff; and which communicates openly and effectively.</P><P>However, the programme 
means more than that. It means that there will be a prosecution service that is 
efficient, professional, open and accountable. Accountability means being prepared 
to explain how we go about our work and how we manage our service. That accountability 
is fully consistent with the independent status of the Lord Advocate in his prosecution 
role, and with that of </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18136">18136</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the procurators fiscal as my representatives. That independence is fully recognised 
in the Scotland Act 1998 and is founded on the vital need for decision making 
in public prosecutions to be taken without fear, favour or influence. The programme 
is also a vision of a service that respects and promotes the roles of victims 
and witnesses of crime, and which recognises that prosecution is about more than 
just the prosecutor and the accused, and the court and the lawyers. How do we 
achieve that?</P><P><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>I 
know that I am on shaky ground here.</P><P>I go along totally with the Lord Advocate's 
comment that politics should be kept out of the courts, but politicians in a Parliament 
such as this express concerns about, for example, drug dealing and other major 
crimes, and they express the attitude that such crimes should at times be dealt 
with more harshly than perhaps the courts deal with them. How can we get that 
across to sheriffs and judges without being seen to apply political pressure?</P><P><strong>The 
Lord Advocate:</strong> Of course, the sentencing of crime is for the courts, 
and rightly so, and it is done independently. So far as my function is concerned, 
I will listen to the concerns that are expressed about the prosecution policy. 
I did that recently on the prosecution of section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1988.</P><P>How 
do we get the basics right? We value our staff. We have taken steps to relieve 
pressure and stress, we have settled the pay dispute and we have created more 
promoted posts and opportunities to prosecute in the High Court. We have had a 
thorough review of our levels of customer service. We will build on the establishment 
of victim information and advice, which is currently available in seven areas, 
but which is soon to be established in all areas. An office was established in 
Paisley last month. One will open in Airdrie this month and Inverness, Dumfries 
and Stirling will follow.</P><P>We work better with our criminal justice partners, 
such as the police and the Scottish Court Service. That is all part of a programme 
to improve the criminal justice system as a whole, which includes Lord Bonomy's 
report into the High Court, Sheriff Principal McInnes's report on summary justice 
and Andrew Normand's report on criminal justice objectives. That is a comprehensive 
examination of the Scottish criminal justice system. We work with the Association 
of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the courts and others to develop protocols 
on how we work together, so that the kind of problems that Pauline McNeill referred 
to in her speech&#151;which are picked up in the report&#151;about police officers 
not being able to speak to fiscals and vice versa are overcome.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18137">18137</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>We are also making improvements to our processes and systems; those improvements 
will have wider benefits. One example of that is the project to send by post witness 
citations in summary cases. Not only will that make our processes more efficient, 
it will free the police from delivering those citations personally in every case. 
That project should go live from April.</P><P><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness 
East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP): </strong>I agree with a great deal of what the 
Lord Advocate says, but will he come round to addressing the recommendations in 
the report in his remaining two minutes? Does he agree that the report, excellent 
though it is, would have been far better if the Justice 2 Committee's recommendation 
that all staff in the service should have the opportunity to participate by setting 
out their views in an anonymous questionnaire had been implemented? Why was that 
suggestion by the committee rejected by the Lord Advocate? Does not it smack of 
the sort of secrecy of which we want to rid Scotland's justice system?</P><P><strong>The 
Lord Advocate:</strong> The same civil service rules apply to procurators fiscal 
as apply to all other civil servants. So far as questionnaires are concerned, 
the Justice 2 Committee had the opportunity to speak to members of the Procurator 
Fiscal Service, and to take evidence from fiscals' elected representatives from 
the Procurators Fiscal Society. That is the proper way to conduct inquiries into 
any part of the civil service.</P><P>So far as the recommendations are concerned, 
Mr Ewing will be aware that we have submitted, and no doubt he has seen, our detailed 
response to the recommendations of the report. In the 10 minutes that I have for 
my speech, I cannot cover all the recommendations. I wanted to highlight the main 
points.</P><P>I have set out what we have achieved so far and where that is taking 
Scotland's prosecution service. I have also given examples of how we will reach 
our destination. I can safely say that I have faced some challenging times in 
my time as Lord Advocate, but modernisation and reform are the most important 
and enduring of the challenges. I am fortunate to have the support of people who 
are committed to change and who understand the importance of reaching that destination.</P><P>I 
am also fortunate to have in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service highly 
dedicated, hard-working and professional staff who do their duty to prosecute 
in the public interest day in, day out. The Parliament does not often have the 
opportunity to acknowledge and thank them, so I hope that all members join me 
in saluting their work.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18138">18138</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>09:55</P><P><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP): </strong>I am not sure 
whether I am required to say it, but I had better say that I continue to be an 
advocate. That means that, from time to time in the past, I was on the prosecution 
side of the bench, rather than the defence side.</P><P>It cannot be denied that 
the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has been seriously under-resourced 
for years. That has meant that aspects of our justice system have been failing. 
The current shake-up in practices is long overdue and the recommendations in the 
Justice 2 Committee's report are important in that process. I commend the committee 
for its work. At long last, those of us who have called for such changes are starting 
to see progress. I welcome the progress that has been made, but much more could 
and should be done. I am sure that disagreement on that score is unlikely.</P><P>The 
Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has been so under-resourced that it 
has been a factor in the slowing of the whole justice process over the years. 
It is not the only problem, but it is a key difficulty. It is difficult to see 
what other conclusion can be drawn from the figures that the Executive published 
in December. Since 1997, the number of crimes and offences has soared to 945,716, 
yet the number of prosecutions has plummeted to 139,596. The figures are diverging 
markedly, instead of following each other. The Solicitor General shakes her head, 
but those figures were produced by the Executive in response to questions.</P><P>While 
crime is increasing and police clear-up rates increase proportionally, the number 
of prosecutions is falling, which means that the number of convictions falls, 
because that number is bound to follow proportionally the number of prosecutions. 
When our constituents tell us that they do not feel that crime is being taken 
seriously enough, they are almost subconsciously aware of what those statistics 
reveal.</P><P>In January, I revealed an analysis of the statistics that showed 
that, since 1997, prosecutors have prosecuted fewer of the crimes of indecency 
and sexual assault that the police have cleared up and fewer convictions have 
been obtained. That picture prevails for many offences, including vandalism and 
fire raising. The divergence is stark. The police have been doing their job and 
their clear-up rates have increased with the increase in the number of crimes 
and offences, but the prosecution system has failed to keep pace. Why should that 
be? There must be a reason for such a marked divergence in the rate of prosecutions 
as compared with the number of crimes and offences.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18139">18139</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>In a parliamentary answer to me, the Solicitor General admitted that the number 
of court cases that have been dropped because of delays in the justice system 
has doubled in the past four years. According to the figures, the number of cases 
marked &quot;no proceedings&quot; rose from 4,214 in 1998-99 to 8,409 in 2001-02. 
According to newspaper reports, officials said that cases had been dropped because 
of delays by the police or other reporting agencies, delays by the procurator 
fiscal or because the time limit on bringing cases to court had been breached, 
which is basically the same as a delay, although it is a separate category. That 
is the reality of what people are experiencing and complaining about. Our justice 
system is creaking at the seams and the figures show that the situation has been 
worsening. Between 1998-1999 and 2001-2002, the number of cases that were dropped 
because of delays by the police or another reporting agency rose by 112 per cent 
and the number of cases that were dropped by the procurator fiscal went up by 
123 per cent.</P><P>Another major problem with the Crown Office and Procurator 
Fiscal Service is the inability to get any sort of information from it about the 
reasoning behind its decisions. This is not the first time that we have acknowledged 
that in the Parliament. I know that I am not alone in being incredibly frustrated 
by the number of times that I have to pass on to constituents the stock answer 
from the Crown Office, which is in effect that it does not have to explain its 
actions, which equally often means its inactions.</P><P>That leaves members of 
the public who have been victims of crime utterly bemused by the workings of the 
system and its inability, in their eyes, to deliver anything even approaching 
justice. That is a real problem. Both of the law officers know that it is one 
thing to announce from the top that things will change, but quite another thing 
to ensure that a harassed and overworked member of staff at the end of a phone 
call to a victim does not respond to a request for information with, &quot;What 
do you want to know for?&quot; I have had to deal with that experience in my constituency.</P><P>I 
believe that some of the sentiments and detail that are contained in paragraphs 
20, 22 and 23 of the report are key to the problem. Those paragraphs make it clear 
that long-term under-resourcing has been, and continues to be, a major factor 
in inhibiting the staff in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service from 
functioning at their best.</P><P>I was particularly struck&#151;for personal reasons&#151;by 
the report of the committee's visit to Hamilton sheriff court last year. When 
the committee paid its visit, up to four ad hoc fiscals were operating at the 
court each day. In my early years as an advocate, I practised as an ad hoc fiscal&#151;the 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18140">18140</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>practice was very common at that time. Let me tell members what that meant 
in reality: I turned up at 9 am, got handed a stack of cases for trial&#151;easily 
up to 12 or so. By 10 am, I had to be in a position to confront the long line 
of defence agents&#151;referred to by my colleague Fergus Ewing&#151;who were 
offering pleas, giving reasons for not being able to proceed and asking for agreements 
about this, that or the other&#151;all on cases with which I had no familiarity. 
All that I knew was that not all of the cases could go to trial.</P><P>Courts 
operate on the basis that the majority of cases will not, for whatever reason, 
go ahead. As an ad hoc fiscal, I had to make snap judgments about which plea it 
was okay to accept, which case was to be assigned to another day and which trials 
could&#151;perhaps&#151;go ahead that day. All of that had to be decided on cases 
that I had seen for the first time an hour previously.</P><P>Then, and only then, 
could I go about releasing the various witnesses in all of the cases that were 
not going to trial that day. They included police witnesses, some of whom would 
have to wait on the chance that some of the cases that were purportedly going 
to trial would go ahead when, as members also know, that does not always happen.</P><P>I 
have been assured in a separate discussion that the process of ad hoc fiscalling 
has fallen away. I am prepared to accept that it is not as extensive as it once 
was, but in the report, I read that it was being used extensively in Hamilton 
sheriff court only last year. I note in passing, from subsequent assurances that 
are contained in the report, that its routine use was eventually eliminated. However, 
the fact remains that the service is still having to fall back on that practice 
to get itself out of local difficulties.</P><P>The problem that I have with that 
is that I suspect the experience of ad-hoc fiscalling was not much at variance 
with the experience of the regular fiscals then and now&#151;except, of course, 
for the fact that regular fiscals would also have had to undertake all of the 
work that led up to getting the cases to court. The 10 am line-up would certainly 
be the same. Speak to any defence agents and they will tell you that it can be 
difficult to get hold of a fiscal to make a decision in advance of the date of 
trial. Pauline McNeill is absolutely right when she said that defence agents often 
do not even attempt to do that. That is not always for the cynical reason that 
defence agents are trying to operate the system, but because they have been unable 
to get hold of the fiscal in advance of the court date.</P><P>There is cynicism 
about the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. There is a serious culture 
problem within the service that needs to be dealt with, which involves management 
and staff. If we expect staff to change, management's </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18141">18141</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>attitude to them has to change. Given that we expect them to make some of the 
changes that we are demanding of them, it would be unfair to do otherwise.</P><P>I 
commend the report to the Executive. It should not simply be put on a shelf. An 
SNP Government would take the recommendations seriously and I hope that the current 
Executive will also take them seriously.</P><P>10:04</P><P><strong>Lord James 
Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>In speaking to the Justice 2 Committee's 
Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service inquiry report, I have to mention an 
interest as a former interim procurator fiscal depute and as a non-practising 
Queen's counsel.</P><P>I warmly support the Lord Advocate's recognition of the 
selfless service and dedicated devotion to duty shown by Scotland's prosecutors. 
However, it is very much our conviction that for too long Scotland's prosecution 
service has received less than adequate resources to carry out its vital responsibilities.</P><P>As 
the Parliament will recall, the Chhokar inquiry revealed that more support was 
necessary for prosecutors. Indeed, there is little value in having dedicated police 
officers detecting and solving crime and carrying out arrests if it takes an unacceptably 
long time for cases to come to court.</P><P>I am particularly impressed that the 
Justice 2 Committee has had the moral courage to highlight obvious deficiencies 
in the current arrangements. Paragraph 114 of the report states:</P><P>&quot;The 
Committee concluded that, given the importance and responsibility of the procurator 
fiscal's role, it is in the interests of justice for the service to be held in 
high public regard and have high morale. This is not presently the case&quot;.</P><P>The 
Conservative party's view is that Scotland's justice system is cracking at the 
seams. There have been longer delays, which can on occasion help offenders to 
evade justice&#151;Roseanna Cunningham referred to that theme. We believe that 
an overhaul of the whole process is long overdue.</P><P>I am glad that the evidence 
given to the Justice 2 Committee supports our view. At paragraph 115, the assertions 
are strong and forthright. The committee concludes:</P><P>&quot;We heard evidence 
of a service under extraordinary pressure ...We welcome the fact that there is 
no longer complacency about the scale of underfunding that has existed ... Although 
surprisingly few cases have come to light as having gone badly wrong, we consider 
there to be an unacceptable level of risk in the system.&quot;</P><P>That leads 
me to the vital issue of whether </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18142">18142</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>sufficient resources are being provided. In my view, they are not. In this 
year's budget, the increase for the justice department&#151;only 1.3 per cent&#151;is 
significantly lower than that received by other Government spending departments. 
It is clear that law and order, the rule of law and justice issues do not receive 
top priority on the Scottish Government's agenda. That is a matter of fact. It 
is interesting to read what the Justice 2 Committee concluded on that issue. It 
expresses concern that</P><P>&quot;neither the Committee, nor the Department, 
have the necessary information to say whether these increases are enough ... We 
remain concerned about the real impact of the staff increases being made and how 
these translate into staff resource for frontline duties&quot;.</P><P>I welcome 
the recognition that what matters is that those prosecutors in the front line 
should be given the maximum support and back-up and should not be submerged by 
overwork and a terrific backlog of cases.</P><P>The Conservatives have called 
not only for an increase in the number of procurators fiscal, but for help to 
alleviate the backlogs in our courts, especially in the sheriff courts. We have 
therefore also called for weekend and evening sittings in courts. In addition, 
we think that increasing the summary sentencing power to 12 months would ease 
the backlog of cases before hard-pressed sheriff courts.</P><P>Our justice system 
is rightly founded on the principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty. 
An important cornerstone of the system of justice is the 110-day rule. An accused 
person must be brought to trial as quickly as possible, leaving enough time for 
the prosecution and defence to prepare, but no more. For justice to mean what 
it implies, it should be speedy. In this country, it would be unthinkable to have 
an accused person sitting on death row for literally years. We are proud that 
our system of justice has traditionally been fast moving&#151;it is that quality 
that has made Scotland's system of criminal justice the envy of the world. It 
is therefore extremely important that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service 
should receive the necessary resources to ensure that deadlines are not missed. 
Of course, if there is a case of particular complexity, an application can be 
made to the High Court for an extension. I believe that that works well.</P><P>The 
crux of the matter was summed up extremely well, and frankly, in the Lord Advocate's 
evidence to the committee on 6 March. Before I quote his words, I should say that 
I very much hope that the Administration will take great heed of them. He said:</P><P>&quot;The 
service has been almost a cinderella organisation for many years. It has been 
chronically underfunded for a long time ... there is no doubt that the ECHR has 
increased </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18143">18143</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>pressure, while the growth of serious crime continues to be worrying, and there 
has been an increase in the efficiency of the police. Those factors have come 
together and produced severe strains.&quot;</P><P>He concluded:</P><P>&quot;for 
many years, the organisation has not been given the resources that it should have 
been given.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Justice 2 Committee</em>, 
6 March 2002; c 1114.]</P><P>Given that the Lord Advocate said that in committee, 
we can be certain that the Executive needs to do a great deal more on the issue.</P><P>I 
noted with concern paragraph 24 in the report, which contains an important revelation. 
It says:</P><P>&quot;In the course of the inquiry we also received anonymous letters 
and phone calls from fiscals. While we treat these with appropriate caution, they 
reinforced the picture of a service where morale is low and where it is perceived 
that senior management discourage people from drawing attention to difficulties 
arising from lack of resources.&quot;</P><P>In this Parliament, we believe in 
greater transparency, openness and accountability, and I recognise the assertion 
in paragraph 43 that there are issues to be addressed over and above that of resources. 
That paragraph states:</P><P>&quot;Our perception is of a hierarchical system 
which suffers from the fact that most senior managers have been legal experts 
not selected as or trained to be expert managers.&quot;</P><P>I hope that the 
Executive and the Crown Office will consider with great care all the recommendations 
that have been made in that regard and that they will examine the fact that too 
many police officers have been tied up for long periods at court waiting to be 
called as witnesses in cases.</P><P>The Conservatives regard justice and the pursuit 
of justice according to the highest standards and principles as absolute requirements 
and we want the Procurator Fiscal Service to be much more strongly resourced with 
more fiscals. I warmly congratulate the members of the Justice 2 Committee, its 
convener, Pauline McNeill, and the deputy convener, Bill Aitken, on contributing 
a considerable service by focusing our attention on actions that need to be taken 
in the public interest.</P><P>10:12</P><P><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) 
(LD): </strong>Before I begin, I should note that I will not be able to stay until 
the end of the debate. I apologise and seek the Parliament's indulgence to leave 
early.</P><P>I echo Pauline McNeill's sentiments and pay tribute to the committee 
clerks, who have worked so diligently over the past 18 months. This has been the 
longest committee inquiry in the Parliament and we must pay tribute to all committee 
staff, whose work ensured that we delivered the report.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18144">18144</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>In some ways, our inquiry has been overtaken by events. However, it has ensured 
that the coalition Executive has tackled the issues that were revealed in evidence 
to the committee and it has certainly helped to focus attention on real concerns 
about the Procurator Fiscal Service.</P><P>There have been six reviews of the 
criminal justice system in the past few years. As a result of the Chhokar case, 
there were inquiries by Sir Anthony Campbell and Dr Raj Jandoo. We have also had 
inquiries by Lord Bonomy and Sheriff Principal McInnes, as well as the Pryce-Dyer 
review. Last but not least, we have had the Justice 2 Committee's inquiry and 
now its report. The service must be the most reviewed organisation in Scotland 
since devolution, which only goes to show how much of a spotlight is on the justice 
system to ensure that it improves and delivers the service that we all expect. 
The service has moved from being what was, in the Lord Advocate's words, &quot;a 
cinderella organisation&quot; before 1999 to one that is now firmly centre stage 
and in the spotlight.</P><P>During our investigations, we found that the service 
was under extraordinary pressure because of various factors, some of which have 
been mentioned: first, the increase in the number of petition cases from 4,638 
in 1996-97 to 5,217 in 2000-01; secondly, the incorporation of the European convention 
on human rights into Scots law; thirdly, the establishment of the Scottish Parliament 
and the Scottish Executive; and, lastly and just as important, the greater expectation 
among the public of openness, accountability and the better treatment of victims 
and witnesses. All those factors have brought added pressures to bear on the system.</P><P>There 
was a range of evidence on how well the service was coping with the challenges 
that arose because of those factors. The internal pressure audit showed levels 
of stress and dissatisfaction many times higher than in an average, similarly 
sized organisation. It also revealed a hierarchical and rigid culture of blame, 
secrecy and mistrust in the organisation.</P><P>The Pryce-Dyer report identified 
a catalogue of issues that could be put down to poor communication between the 
Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and its main criminal justice partners&#151;the 
police and the courts. In her speech, Pauline McNeill highlighted her experience 
of that issue. The Pryce-Dyer report also identified a catalogue of management 
issues, including poorly focused management information, inconsistencies in budgeting, 
a lack of resilience in the staffing of the organisation and the lack of a corporate 
and united approach to standards and processes in the service. The report also 
found major cultural barriers between the legal and </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18145">18145</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>administrative staff&#151;there seemed to be a genuine division between the 
two sides. Resourcing was identified in a number of key areas as one of the crucial 
problems facing the service, as the Executive has acknowledged.</P><P>In view 
of those findings, one might have expected a big churn rate of staff as well as 
high long-term sickness rates and recruiting difficulties. Surprisingly, however, 
none of those problems was revealed in evidence to the committee. That is a tribute 
to the dedication and commitment of the staff. Despite the pressures that they 
were under and the many problems that were identified in the various reviews, 
staff still turned up and delivered a service. There were no long-term sickness 
problems and the staff seemed to remain dedicated and willing to commit to the 
service. The committee was surprised that there was not a great churn rate of 
staff leaving and new staff being taken on. However, the new chief executive, 
Robert Gordon, said in his evidence to the committee:</P><P>&quot;Even if people 
are not leaving us, it is not a sustainable way to run a business if they are 
staying with us while feeling undervalued and under huge pressure.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official 
Report, Justice 2 Committee</em>, 24 April 2002; c 1226.]</P><P>That is a sentiment 
with which we would all agree.</P><P>I am thankful that action is now being taken 
to address the concerns arising from the various reviews. An extra £24 million 
is being invested this coming year&#151;that is a 10.7 per cent increase in real 
terms. In his speech, the Lord Advocate highlighted the huge increase in resources 
that there has been since he became involved in the service as Solicitor General.</P><P>Ninety-five 
new legal staff have been recruited&#151;that is a 33 per cent increase from 1997. 
However, that in itself brings problems, because it means that a whole cohort 
of new legal staff is coming in. Those people need training and supervision, which 
puts added pressure on the service in the short term.</P><P>From evidence to the 
committee, we learned that an extra 94 administrative staff have been recruited, 
which is a 12 per cent increase. That is important, too. It is all very well having 
front-line legal staff, but, if they are not backed up and properly supported 
by administrative staff, they cannot deliver daily in court. Moreover, a new management 
regime has been put in place to try to address the major failings identified in 
the Pryce-Dyer report.</P><P>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is 
no longer the cinderella organisation that it was before devolution. The Executive 
is investing heavily to improve the service, but it will take time to measure 
whether the changes that have been made are the right ones. Judgment cannot yet 
be </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18146">18146</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>made on whether the new arrangements are working, because they are only just 
being implemented.</P><P>I hope and expect that, as the committee recommended, 
the subject will be revisited by a subsequent justice committee in the new parliamentary 
session. We may have to wait two to three years before the evaluation can be made. 
I hope that, when that evaluation is completed, we will see a dramatically improved 
service that will guarantee to the public the delivery of a service fit for the 
21<SUP>st</SUP> century.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>There 
have been a number of last-minute requests to speak in the open debate. I will 
try to get everybody in, but the last two or three speakers may not get more than 
a couple of minutes each. At this point, we will start with speeches of four minutes.</P><P>10:20</P><P><strong>Scott 
Barrie (Dunfermline West) (Lab): </strong>A number of reasons have been given 
this morning for why the committee chose to investigate the subject. The Lord 
Advocate said that, since devolution, there has been an unprecedented questioning 
of the Scottish criminal justice system. Although the system had trundled along 
relatively satisfactorily for many years, we found that things were not working 
in quite the way that we had anticipated. It was a bit like lifting the proverbial 
stone to see what is going on underneath. The pressures that people were working 
under to keep the system going were certainly too great.</P><P>Like many people 
in Scotland, I was relatively unclear about the complex role of the procurator 
fiscal before I undertook the inquiry. The term is commonly used in Scotland&#151;people 
have heard of procurators fiscal, but most do not know what they actually do. 
I first met the Solicitor General&#151;in her previous role&#151;in the summer 
of 2001, when we undertook our first visit to a fiscal office in Aberdeen. What 
struck Tavish Scott and me on that day was the sheer complexity of what was expected 
of a fiscal working in a busy office. Never mind all the other issues that people 
have highlighted, including the extra work load and staff vacancies&#151;just 
doing the basic job is an incredibly complex task. I do not think that people 
fully understood what the job is about.</P><P>The committee inquiry seems to have 
been a bit of a catalyst for change in the system. The change might have happened 
anyway but, irrespective of why it happened, there has been considerable movement 
in the service over the past few months, which is incredibly welcome. As I have 
visited my local office over the past four years, it has been quite incredible 
to see the changes that have taken place, especially during the inquiry, as </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18147">18147</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>people began to see the evidence that the committee was taking, and now that 
the report has been produced. At the same time, there has been unprecedented change 
in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service itself. Those two things together 
have begun to improve the service that is being offered to people. That should 
not be ignored.</P><P>The committee recommends a number of tests that might be 
applied in the future to determine whether the changes that are currently being 
made have led to improved services. We all want a service in which staff are valued, 
where morale is higher, where there is an end to routine evening working and where 
fiscals have more time to spend on front-line legal duties. The changes that have 
been put in place, which other members have highlighted, may well achieve that.</P><P>As 
the committee's convener said, one of the factors that prompted the inquiry was 
concern from the police. We hope that there will be improved communication and 
access to fiscals and better understanding of the prosecution decisions. It is 
important that all the players in the criminal justice system are signed up and 
joined up. We must all sing from the same song sheet. We should not get into a 
situation in which one part of the criminal justice system blames another part 
for its failings, as has happened too often in the past. If the changes that we 
have seen can get us a more effective system, the committee's inquiry will have 
played its part. We should also acknowledge the changes that the Crown Office 
has made in the intervening time.</P><P>10:24</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson 
(Banff and Buchan) (SNP): </strong>When the convener of the Justice 2 Committee 
said that she had been doing extra time, I was somewhat alarmed, but I think that 
I know what she meant. Members of the committee did indeed do extra time.</P><P>The 
Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is truly at the heart of the Scottish 
criminal justice system. If that system is to reach its full potential&#151;as 
all members and people throughout the country want&#151;that heart must be healthy. 
Our communities need faith that those who commit crime will be brought to book 
soon and in an appropriate way.</P><P>The Lord Advocate described the Procurator 
Fiscal Service as a &quot;cinderalla organisation&quot; that had been</P><P>&quot;chronically 
underfunded for a long time.&quot;&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Justice 
2 Committee</em>, 6 March 2002; c 1114.]</P><P>That is lamentably true. However, 
we must and should praise the dedication of Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal 
Service staff, who are chronically </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18148">18148</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>overloaded with work and use weekends and evenings to keep up with cases. That 
is not good enough for staff, the public or the police.</P><P>The committee heard 
distressing evidence from victims of crimes and their families, who felt let down 
by the system and revictimised. However, I recognise the progress that has been 
made in that area.</P><P>A number of unfortunate cases have been brought to my 
attention and I would like to speak about one of them. A former constituent of 
mine, who now lives near Inverness, was the victim of a brutal assault. The initial 
investigation went well and the perpetrator was caught and charged. However, when 
the case went to court, the accused received a minimal fine rather than the imprisonment 
that had been expected, as vital evidence was not produced on the day. Why? An 
inadequately supervised junior policeman and a fiscal who had never met the victim 
and therefore knew nothing of the severity of the victim's injuries were involved. 
In that case, a lapse in detail impacted on an individual.</P><P>Another constituent 
had a much better experience, but, unfortunately, that was in the Netherlands. 
Her son was involved in a car accident. He had pulled over, as his car had broken 
down, and another car had barrelled up the outside lane and run him over. He spent 
a year in hospital. The Dutch took the victim's mother across to the Netherlands 
and she stayed in hospital with her son at the expense of the Dutch for six months. 
When the case came to court, the mother sat with the prosecutors in the well of 
the court. She was paid to fly over to the Netherlands and the presiding officer 
invited her to give her view of the impact of the accident on her family. She 
could not praise the prosecution service in the Netherlands more highly. That 
is the standard to which we aspire and towards which we are beginning to move.</P><P>On 
another serious note, the committee had only anecdotal evidence about departmental 
performance. Statistics are in short supply. A key management theory nowadays 
is that what cannot be measured cannot be managed. It is not right for members 
to interfere with the administration of justice, but the Lord Advocate must realise 
that we will take a close and continuing interest in the administration of the 
justice system&#151;in other words, in the processes of justice.</P><P>New people 
have been added to the system, but we must not expect too much too soon. In his 
book &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;, Fred P Brookes poses the question:</P><P>&quot;How 
do you make a late project later?&quot;</P><P>The answer is by adding staff, as 
existing staff must train the new staff. All the failings in our </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18149">18149</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>system need to be put right to ensure credibility. Only a system that treats 
victims humanely and with compassion can truly dispense justice. We must deliver.</P><P>10:29</P><P><strong>Phil 
Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>I make no bones about the fact that, 
when I entered the Parliament, I was not seen as a major advocate of the institution&#151;indeed, 
I queried the whole basis on which it was structured and its necessity. However, 
perhaps one of the advantages that has resulted from its creation has been the 
Justice 2 Committee's report. During the election, perhaps all of us had concerns 
about the standard of our justice system.</P><P>I recall that, in committee debates 
on the budget some years ago, I took to task the then Lord Advocate and Solicitor 
General, as well as the Minister for Justice, Jim Wallace, pointing out to them 
the inadequacies that we thought existed in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal 
Service. I have to say that I was particularly disappointed by the responses. 
I pay tribute to the current Lord Advocate and Solicitor General, because they 
seem to have listened. That links into the Justice 2 Committee's inquiry. Masses 
of evidence suggested that the perception that members elected to the Parliament 
had of the justice system was based on a strong foundation.</P><P>George Lyon 
said that, to some extent, events overtook the report. I do not believe that that 
is the case. I believe that changes have taken place because of the evidence that 
the committee took. I pay tribute to all committee members, including my colleague 
Bill Aitken and Pauline McNeill, with whom I served on the Justice and Home Affairs 
Committee. I do not believe that events overtook the report. The Lord Advocate, 
the Solicitor General and the Executive have recognised the shortcomings in the 
system. Having heard the Lord Advocate's comments about the increase in staff 
and the reorganisation, I find it obvious that the issues raised in the inquiry 
have been dealt with as we have gone along. That is what should happen wherever 
possible&#151;when concerns are raised, they should be addressed immediately. 
On that basis, I compliment the individuals to whom I referred.</P><P>However, 
we cannot be complacent. Roseanna Cunningham's comments and the statistics that 
she cited were of great interest to all members. She demonstrated that problems 
still exist and that the general public still have certain perceptions and concerns, 
particularly about the way in which our court procedures operate and about some 
of the findings of the courts.</P><P>I said in an intervention earlier that political 
perceptions and requirements cannot be seen to </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18150">18150</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>be weights around the necks of sheriffs and judges. However, if the courts 
do not somewhere along the line recognise the concerns of ordinary people, the 
justice system will ultimately break down. That must not happen in our society.</P><P>The 
additional funding that has been mentioned is welcome, but the issue is not wholly 
about funding. We have looked across the board. Members have focused on the need 
for an increase in police resources, but it is pointless for the police to increase 
their detection rate, using those additional resources to considerable effect, 
if the courts and the justice system cannot keep up and let them down. Nonetheless, 
I welcome the extra funding and the changes that have been made to date.</P><P>10:33</P><P><strong>Maureen 
Macmillan (Highlands and Islands) (Lab): </strong>I congratulate the Justice 2 
Committee on its report, which is the result of intensive scrutiny of the Crown 
Office and Procurator Fiscal Service over a long 18 months. As George Lyon said, 
the committee's inquiry has played a considerable part in progressing change.</P><P>I 
will talk about the fiscal service in the Highlands and Islands. During the summer 
recess about two years ago, I visited as many of the Highlands and Islands sheriff 
courts as I could, not only in the Highland Council area but in the northern isles, 
the Western Isles, Moray and Argyll. I visited Skye, Lochaber, Wick, Tain and 
Dingwall. I spoke to sheriff clerks and fiscals. I examined arrangements for witness 
support, in particular for child witnesses, and for disabled access.</P><P>I visited 
Inverness sheriff court, which is more like a city sheriff court because of the 
volume of business. There is a tremendous contrast between Inverness and the outlying 
courts. I shadowed a fiscal depute in Inverness sheriff court for a day. I noted 
the intense pressure that she was under in a relentless, time-constrained process 
to mark cases and speak to them before the sheriff in a tiny, overflowing courtroom.</P><P>When 
I was in Stornoway, the sole fiscal had to deal with a serious stabbing incident 
on a foreign ship out in the Atlantic. It was an unusual and time-consuming case. 
Such a case might mean that everyday work had to be set aside, yet he was the 
only fiscal.</P><P>In Shetland, I met the fiscal who is responsible for Lerwick 
and Kirkwall sheriff courts, who spoke about the problems of travelling between 
Orkney and Shetland in the extreme weather conditions that prevail there for a 
considerable part of the year. If the fiscal is stormbound on one island, work 
piles up on the other.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18151">18151</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Fiscals are independent, self-contained and responsible for their work load. 
Some enjoy the independence, but it has its drawbacks, especially in relation 
to holiday cover, illness or work overload. The problems of rural procurators 
fiscal who work alone are different from the problems that fiscals in the city 
experience&#151;the work load issues and the stresses are different.</P><P>Another 
factor was that, for administration purposes, the Highlands and Islands were lumped 
with Grampian, an area that covers two police forces. I will not talk about Argyll, 
which covers another police force and which has never been part of Grampian and 
the Highlands for administration purposes. I do not want to be even more of a 
sook than Phil Gallie, but Elish Angiolini was the regional fiscal at the time 
of my visit and I have no doubt that the new structure that has been put in place 
is a result of her appreciation of the problems on the ground. I remember talking 
to her in Inverness about the situation in Orkney and Shetland.</P><P>The changes 
that were announced last autumn are having an effect already. The Highlands and 
Islands is now an autonomous area and its boundaries are coterminous with those 
of Northern constabulary. The new area fiscal, Graeme Napier, is based in Inverness, 
as is the new area business manager, Gordon Ellis.</P><P>Although the area team 
is new, there have been significant developments in support for fiscals. First, 
a request to the Lord Advocate for a depute fiscal for Orkney and Shetland has 
been granted, which will have a significant impact on the work load and logistical 
problems in the northern isles. Secondly, as a result of the new information technology 
systems that have been in place since November, any fiscal's office can access 
another's work. For example, when the Tain fiscal needs a bit of help, other fiscals 
in the network can provide it. Thirdly, within the past week, approval has been 
given to buy a digital dictation system, the product of which can be downloaded 
to a computer and e-mailed, which will allow clerical staff in offices throughout 
the network to access it. That system will help to smooth out the peaks and troughs 
in individual offices. The first and third of those initiatives came directly 
from the area office.</P><P>Northern constabulary has said that there is now more 
consistency in the fiscal policy in the Highlands, which is to be welcomed. However, 
more work needs to be done, particularly in relation to Inverness sheriff court. 
I would like the Lord Advocate and Solicitor General to keep an eye on the work 
load there.</P><P>10:37</P><P><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and 
Lochaber) (SNP): </strong>In my 20 years of practising as </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18152">18152</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>a solicitor, I found, through the day-to-day experience of working in the courts, 
that Scotland is fortunate in having the highest quality personnel working in 
our justice system. We can rightly be proud of that. Until 1999, Scotland was 
the only country in the world that had her own legal system but lacked a legislature. 
I am delighted that Phil Gallie is now a full convert to the merits of the Parliament.</P><P>Since 
I became an MSP, I have seen matters from constituents' point of view. What happens 
when the system goes wrong? Although I found through working with fiscals and 
others that, in most cases, the system does not go wrong, the Lord Advocate and 
the Solicitor General must focus on the situations in which matters go wrong to 
ensure that victims are dealt with properly.</P><P>Like Stewart Stevenson, I could 
mention constituents who simply have not been given information. For example, 
I know of a case in which the victim of a serious assault was not informed when 
the assailant was let out of jail and went back to live beside the victim. When 
a complaint is made about such matters, the response is often truculent or arrogant, 
which is wholly wrong. However, I get the impression from the written response 
to the report to which the Lord Advocate referred that matters are changing and 
that there is a will to change, which I acknowledge and welcome.</P><P>In intervening 
on the Lord Advocate, I referred to paragraphs 14 and 18 of the report. The committee's 
unanimous request that every member of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal 
Service in Scotland should be given the chance to set out their views&#151;good 
and bad&#151;of how the system operates in an anonymous questionnaire was sensible. 
That is part of a new system of openness and democracy. It is to be regretted 
that the Lord Advocate rejected that approach. Had that approach been followed, 
the experiences of those working at the chalk face could more accurately have 
been taken into account.</P><P>The committee has done a great job.</P><P><strong>Pauline 
McNeill </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></P><P><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>I do 
not have time to give way, as I am in my last minute.</P><P>Of necessity, the 
committee's excellent work only scratches the surface of a huge system that involves 
a great many people. I know, for example, that intermediate diets have not worked 
properly because fiscals do not have time enough to study the papers and discuss 
cases before an intermediate diet. That clogs up the system, takes more time and 
is a waste. A few more fiscals in the busiest sheriff courts would address that 
problem, and action is being taken to deal with that.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18153">18153</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I handled a serious case in which the son of constituents of mine died in a 
road accident and the police approach to the case was called into question. I 
was struck by the constituents' approach to the matter, which was rational and 
sensible despite the trauma of their loss. They paid particular tribute to the 
Solicitor General, who was working in Aberdeen at that time, for her sensitive 
response. I do not want to mention the couple's name, but I think that the Solicitor 
General will know who they were.</P><P>In that case and others where the justice 
system fails, it does not yet respond properly to victims' and others' concerns 
about their dealings with it. However, now that we have our Parliament and perhaps 
a bit more openness, there is a willingness to tackle those concerns. I welcome 
that approach.</P><P>10:42</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_4"></A>Mr Kenneth 
Macintosh (Eastwood) (Lab): </strong>I thank the Justice 2 Committee for its work 
in producing the report on the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. A great 
deal of effort went into the inquiry, and that shows in the substance of the committee's 
findings.</P><P>A picture clearly emerges of a public prosecution service that 
is overworked and understaffed. The service has far too often had to rely on the 
dedication and commitment of individuals who have struggled to cope without the 
necessary support structure in place.</P><P>I also thank the Lord Advocate, Colin 
Boyd, and the Solicitor General, Elish Angiolini, for their reforms, which have 
taken place in parallel with the committee's inquiry. The Lord Advocate and the 
Solicitor General have recognised the problems that face the service and have 
begun to tackle them.</P><P>I will focus not so much on the needs of the Procurator 
Fiscal Service as on those of the victims of crime and their families. There cannot 
be a member present who has not heard of the vicious and unprovoked murder of 
Christopher Cawley in a Glasgow bar some two and a half years ago or who is unaware 
of his family's concern and anger at the failure of the prosecution to convict 
Louis McDonald and Gary Sanders for the crime.</P><P>The lack of information that 
was available to Christopher Cawley's family throughout the case is deeply disturbing. 
That extended to the family even missing the beginning of the trial because no 
one took the time or took on the responsibility to let them know that court proceedings 
were starting. Neither the volunteers from Victim Support Scotland nor the police's 
family liaison officer were able to offer the support that the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18154">18154</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>family needed. A simple explanation of the roles of the police and the Procurator 
Fiscal Service was never forthcoming.</P><P>The lack of transparency of the court 
proceedings and, equally, the prosecution team's decision-making process added 
to the family's frustration and anxiety. There was no attempt to take the family's 
views into account, but neither was there an explanation of why that should be 
so. When charges against one of the accused were dropped, there was no explanation. 
In fact, as Pauline McNeill said, the family found out about it only when the 
former co-accused walked into the court alongside them.</P><P>My outstanding concern 
is the lack of an independent investigation or complaints procedure to handle 
public worries about the prosecution of crime. Following the Jandoo and Campbell 
reports on the Chhokar case, the Lord Advocate has committed himself to an independent 
inspectorate but has also said that it will not consider individual cases.</P><P>Given 
the mechanisms that now exist to tackle miscarriages of justice, we need a satisfactory 
system to address the situation in which the miscarriage is a failure to secure 
a conviction. I am not arguing that verdicts should be challenged. That the prosecution 
of crime, like justice itself, should be impartial is often argued and is, indeed, 
an accepted principle. However, I hope that the Lord Advocate will acknowledge 
that impartiality has sometimes been used as a smokescreen for not answering questions 
at all. Coupled with a lack of transparency in the prosecution service, that has 
given rise to a suspicion of a self-serving system that protects prosecutors from 
scrutiny and that is unaccountable to the public.</P><P>I end with an appeal to 
the Minister for Justice&#151;although he is not here&#151;to meet the Cawley 
family and the Lord Advocate to discuss the family's outstanding concerns. The 
Justice 2 Committee has played a major part in redressing the Cawleys' sense of 
grievance, through listening to their evidence. I hope that the committee's recommendations 
will now be acted on.</P><P>10:45</P><P><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands 
and Islands) (SNP): </strong>Of all the skills that I thought I would have to 
develop as an MSP, cramming a year's study of the Procurator Fiscal Service into 
two and a half or three minutes was not one of them. Nonetheless, if colleagues 
will excuse me, I will not use this limited time to go over the ground that we 
all share on the positive work that the Justice 2 Committee has done and on the 
areas of the report on which we agree. We all accept that the Pryce-Dyer report 
was significant, that there has been an increase in resources and that more work 
remains to be done.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18155">18155</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I will highlight a number of areas of concern, and I hope that this will be 
taken in a constructive spirit. The Lord Advocate mentioned the publication of 
proposals for the appointment of advocate deputes, which will form a part of the 
whole restructuring. I wish to focus on that, because there are some real concerns 
about those proposals. The problem lies in the increase in High Court business, 
with an increase of 29.4 per cent in the number of cases between 1998 and 2002. 
Additionally, there are the problems with getting people to do Crown junioring 
and legal aid. There is a real stress point in the High Court.</P><P>The response 
from the Executive and the Lord Advocate is understandable in a sense&#151;they 
favour a reclassification and seek to allow procurators fiscal, from ad hoc deputes 
all the way to trial deputes, to mark or prosecute cases.</P><P>There are a number 
of real issues to be addressed, the first of which is independence. It is nice 
for an SNP politician to be able to talk about independence and get support for 
it from around the chamber. Its importance cannot be overstressed. The written 
submission of the Faculty of Advocates states that the</P><P>&quot;entitlement 
on the part of the prosecution authorities to bring criminal charges against a 
person before the courts upon their decision alone means that it is important 
that the operation of that entitlement is, and is seen to be, as independent as 
possible.&quot;</P><P>Let us contrast that with the description of fiscals as, 
in the Lord Advocate's own words, career civil servants. That raises the question 
how that independence and the perception of that independence are to be regarded. 
If the Government were to announce a crackdown on crime, would that mean that, 
as career civil servants, fiscals could be seen to be marking on an independent 
basis? The committee received evidence from fiscals themselves that they had come 
under pressure from various Government bodies. Perhaps such pressure is understandable, 
but should we really be trusting individuals to show independence under such circumstances, 
and not have something built into the system?</P><P>What about situations where 
there are obvious conflicts of interest for solicitors who are in partnership? 
What arrangements are going to be made to preserve the independence of the service? 
If people are to have confidence in the system and in the prosecution of crime, 
they have to believe that decisions are made on the basis of what is fair and 
just, and not according to any other priority.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding 
Officer: </strong>We move to winding-up speeches, starting with Donald Gorrie

<P>10:48</P><P><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>The Justice 
2 Committee has carried out a very good inquiry, which has been a good example 
of how Scottish parliamentary committees can do very good work. I welcome the 
investment that the Executive has put into the court system. Starting from a very 
low base as it does, that increase in investment might have to continue for quite 
a few years. We want to ensure that the money is well directed and achieves what 
we want it to achieve.</P><P>We should look at justice as a whole. It is not just 
a question of procurators fiscal. There is a whole team of people involved in 
trying to reduce offending and reoffending, crime and the fear of crime. All sorts 
of people are involved in that&#151;in some ways, every citizen. The police, procurators 
fiscal, the court system, judges, advocates and solicitors are all involved, but 
so are social workers, voluntary organisations that provide arrangements to help 
to turn people in trouble round, community organisations and indeed the whole 
community.</P><P>For example, if we sorted out our football structure so that 
far more boys, girls, young men and young women were playing football, we would 
not only have a decent football team in a few years' time, we would reduce crime 
considerably. We are all involved in that task. The Parliament and the Executive 
must learn to examine the issue of crime as a whole. We are good at having committees 
highlight particular issues, but we must now diffuse our light over a wider area, 
while keeping it as bright. I am not sure how to do that.</P><P>We cannot ignore 
bottlenecks in the system. There is no point in having a very good police system 
if the court system is not good. I return to my analogy of a football team&#151;there 
is no point in investing in better forwards if our defenders continue to let in 
goals. We must invest throughout the system.</P><P>I have not yet heard anyone 
use the clich&eacute; that justice must be seen to be done, so I will. Like most 
clich&eacute;s, that one is extremely true. The public view of justice is very 
important. The public have problems with the system. They see endless delays in 
cases coming to court and view the criminal justice system as a game with very 
obscure rules that they do not understand. The public view politics in the same 
way&#151;that is another problem that we must straighten out.</P><P>We must challenge 
the professionals' innate conservatism and defensiveness. Such conservatism is 
a characteristic of all professions. We must ensure that the professionals are 
not preventing progress from being made in the system as a whole. We have made 
good advances and I have great confidence in the team </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18157">18157</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>that is running the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. However, we 
have much further to go. This inquiry is a good step forward. We can all co-operate

which we can be really proud.</P><P>10:52</P><P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: 
</strong>I have said everything that I wish to say. I am grateful to the Lord 
Advocate for his frank, full and honest contribution.</P><P><strong>The Deputy

Solicitor General for Scotland (Mrs Elish Angiolini):</strong> I welcome this 
morning's debate, which has been extremely constructive.</P><P>As the Lord Advocate 
has acknowledged, the work of the Justice 2 Committee and its report have been 
invaluable in helping to shape the major reforms that we are putting in place. 
The committee's work is also helping to achieve a greater understanding of what 
the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service does. It has helped to engage the 
Parliament's support for an organisation whose work the committee recognises as 
having generally been undervalued and misunderstood. Often the Crown Office and 
Procurator Fiscal Service is seen as isolated from the community that it serves.</P><P>Rightly, 
the Parliament has challenged the way in which the department has worked historically&#151;its 
management, resources and culture, as well as its visibility, responsiveness and 
accountability. The Lord Advocate and I have set about securing fundamental and 
wide-ranging change in each of those areas, so there are few issues in dispute. 
Although we are doing much to ensure that we shape a prosecution service for the 
long term, which can meet the increasing demands of the new millennium, I am grateful 
to the convener and the committee. I am greatly encouraged that they have taken 
the opportunity to recognise the huge asset that the Crown Office and Procurator 
Fiscal Service represents for Scotland.</P><P>The service employs 1,300 or so 
staff throughout Scotland and in Europe. Their skills and commitment to securing 
justice day after day result in high-quality prosecutions and deaths investigations. 
They work under the most disciplined time scales for prosecution in the world 
and the most vigorous evidential requirements of any criminal justice system. 
They are called out night after night to horrific murder scenes, to deal with 
fatalities and post-mortems and to meet distraught and bereaved next of kin, as 
well as </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18158">18158</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>victims and witnesses of crime. They work in the unforgiving environment of 
the court, in the full glare of the public and the media. They are indeed champions 
of justice, and I do not say that in an apple-pie sense.</P><P>I am grateful for 
the Justice 2 Committee's acknowledgement of the front-line but complex nature 
of the work and of the growing pressures that are faced by prosecutors in Scotland 
and worldwide. During the debate, the difficulties that the Crown Office and Procurator 
Fiscal Service faces have been highlighted. The debate has also highlighted the 
modernisation, investment and reform that the Lord Advocate began last March.</P><P>I 
am in the unusual position of being part of a ministerial team that manages a 
department in which I have spent all my working life. The benefit of that is that 
I have a first-hand understanding of the department and the pressures and challenges 
that it faces. I know its strengths and weaknesses. I also know that the programme 
of modernisation and reform on which we have embarked is a promising and exciting 
opportunity to ensure real change in the way in which we set about our business.</P><P>We 
have had record investment and we have a fresh management approach and new staff 
to add to the skilled staff who are already there. We have achieved those things 
over a very short period. I have to say that, 21 years ago, victims were not on 
the agenda for the Procurator Fiscal Service because the concept of independence 
was perceived as requiring a lack of communication with victims and, to some extent, 
a lack of responsiveness. Twenty years ago, there was no recognition of the role 
of victims in the system, but now they have become central to it. We have undertaken 
to ensure that the work that we are doing in establishing the victim information 
and advice system throughout Scotland&#151;which is now being rolled out&#151;will 
change the experience of victims. There is a long road in that process, but it 
is one that has been embarked on with great energy and commitment by the victim 
information officers who are now part and parcel of the prosecution service.</P><P><strong>Phil 
Gallie: </strong>In the future, when a prosecution against an individual is dropped, 
will the victim be given information concerning why the case has been dropped?</P><P><strong>The 
Solicitor General for Scotland: </strong>As the Lord Advocate has indicated, we 
have attempted to engage in a much more open process, which includes giving reasons 
when that is possible. However, it is not always possible to do that. For example, 
when a witness gives confidential information that may place him in a position 
of extreme danger but which alters the nature of the case, it will not always 
be possible to inform </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18159">18159</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>another person why the prosecution has been dropped. In such circumstances, 
the Parliament and the Scottish public will have to trust the integrity and impartiality 
of the prosecution service, which the Lord Advocate and I intend to uphold.</P><P>We 
will ensure that the process is not encroached on by any aspect of political whim 
or media construction regarding what should take place in a case. Cases in Scotland 
are considered on the basis of analysis of the evidence and the public interest. 
That is the formula that all prosecutors will follow, following the publication 
of the prosecution code, and it is not based on any factor other than the public 
interest. I hope that the prosecution will be trusted to get on with that process, 
giving reasons when that is possible but on the understanding that there will 
be circumstances in which reasons cannot be given&#151;not to protect the prosecutor, 
but to uphold the system of justice that we treasure.</P><P><strong>Mr Macintosh: 
</strong>Will the Solicitor General take an intervention?</P><P><strong>The Solicitor 
General for Scotland:</strong> I have limited time and I would like to press on.</P><P>Roseanna 
Cunningham, quite rightly, mentioned delays. However, the cases that are delayed 
make up only 0.1 per cent of the cases in the system, which is otherwise still 
under pressure. Day in, day out, cases are being successfully prosecuted throughout 
Scotland to a high level of quality.</P><P>Reference has also been made to access 
to solicitors and the police. That is exactly what we have been putting in place 
over the past 12 months. We have established protocols of expected standards of 
service to the police, to defence agents and to our other partners in the criminal 
justice system. We also recognise the need for information from victims.</P><P>The 
natural tension between the accountability of the public prosecutor and their 
vital independence, to which Duncan Hamilton referred, is something with which 
we have no difficulty whatever. However, the idea that the procurator fiscal is 
not capable of the same level or quality of independence as members of the Faculty 
of Advocates is simply misplaced.</P><P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick (Strathkelvin

<P>fiscal is the independence of the prosecution process from the police and any 
other factor. The Faculty of Advocates and those who come in as Crown counsel 
enhance the independence and the collegiate approach and are, therefore, a welcome 
and integral part of the prosecution process. However, that is not to suggest 
for a minute that every procurator fiscal around the country does not value greatly 
the quality of independence that is demonstrated in what they do. The ability 
to resist political whim, pressure groups or the transient media construction 
of what should be prosecuted is vital to the system. Prosecution must truly reflect 
the public interest in a considered and independent fashion.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Hamilton: </strong>I make it clear that I am not impugning the integrity of fiscals. 
I am asking whether the Solicitor General sees a difference between the institutional 
independence of the Faculty of Advocates and the position of the people specifically 
described by the Lord Advocate as career civil servants, who are not independent 
institutionally. Does the Solicitor General see that that might create in the 
public mind a perception that the prosecution service's independence is diluted?</P><P><strong>The 
Solicitor General for Scotland: </strong>The perception that procurators fiscal 
and civil servants, who are subject to the civil service code, are not capable 
of institutional independence is not accurate. However, the role of the Faculty 
of Advocates enhances and strengthens the role of Crown counsel and we support 
that.</P><P>Prosecution to please might be a quick fix and might gain superficial 
popularity, but it would surrender the foundations that support a sound system 
of justice. Safeguarding that independence is a duty that we accept without hesitation. 
However, independence is not an excuse for isolation, impenetrability or arrogance. 
We prosecutors have a duty to ensure that those whom we serve understand what 
we do and its nature. They must also understand that a prosecution decision is 
often not one that is unanimously acclaimed.</P><P>I am grateful to the Justice 
2 Committee for the time that it has taken to produce the report for today's constructive 
debate. I trust that the Parliament will acknowledge, respect and support the 
approach that the Lord Advocate and I are taking to the future of the prosecution 
system in Scotland.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_6"></A>The Deputy Presiding

<P>11:02</P><P><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>I congratulate 
the members of the Justice 2 Committee on the report. I am aware that when carrying 
out a committee inquiry over a year and half it is difficult to remain focused 
while having several pieces of heavy legislation on the agenda as well&#151;as 
the Justice 1 Committee also experienced. All credit should go to the Justice 
2 Committee for completing its thorough inquiry.</P><P>One of the constant themes 
of the report is the dedication of the prosecution service staff, who are prepared 
to work late into the evening and over the weekend to fulfil their duties. A heavy 
responsibility is placed on their shoulders because they make crucial decisions 
that affect individuals' lives. Several members have referred to particular constituency 
cases in which such decisions have had an impact on individuals' lives. The service 
is under considerable pressure, but it has many dedicated staff. However, for 
several reasons, they clearly enjoy only limited public esteem.</P><P>We should 
expect the staff of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to be dedicated, 
but we must also be prepared to provide them with the necessary resourcing and 
management to deliver the required service. I cannot help but feel that the report 
highlights the fact that the service has been running on the good will of its 
staff for far too long.</P><P>Resourcing is an important issue. The Lord Advocate 
said that the prosecution service has often been a cinderella public service. 
However, the service not only requires additional financial resources; the way 
in which it operates must be reformed and modernised. Additional financial resources 
are welcome, but the report highlights that there is a need to ensure that staff 
are provided with the training and support that will allow them to do their job 
properly.</P><P>If we provide extra resources to our Crown Office and Procurator 
Fiscal Service, we must be prepared to ensure that there is effective monitoring 
of how the service is operating to ensure that the resources are being targeted 
to the right areas to deliver the necessary change.</P><P>The report highlights 
the management culture that exists in the service. It says that there is a lack 
of trust and support in the current management system, and that there are managers 
who have a great deal of legal expertise but limited management expertise. As 
Roseanna Cunningham said, if we are to create the change that is necessary in 
the service, we must be prepared to tackle the management culture. As Lord James 
Douglas-Hamilton noted, there are elements of secrecy in the system&#151;the Lord 
Advocate will be aware of my particular interest in matters relating to secrecy.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18162">18162</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Paragraph 30 of the report states:</P><P>&quot;We also noted that, although 
there was a category of 'PF staff shortage' as a reason for 'no proceedings' this 
was virtually never used. This appears very odd and it has since been suggested 
to us informally that staff are discouraged from using this category.&quot;</P><P>To 
say that a case cannot be proceeded with because of staff shortage is not to admit 
to a weakness on the part of a member of staff but to draw attention to a weakness 
in the system. The culture must change in order to address the problems that exist.</P><P>We 
have identified a number of problems in the service, but the real challenge is 
to deal with them effectively to ensure that we have a Crown Office and Procurator 
Fiscal Service of which we can be proud. The report is the start of that process. 
I commend it to the Parliament and I urge the Executive to take forward the recommendations 
that it contains.</P><P>11:07</P><P><strong>Bill Aitken (Glasgow) (Con): </strong>I 
am probably the last person who would want to wallow in mutual congratulation, 
but it is appropriate that I pay tribute to my colleagues on the Justice 2 Committee 
for their efforts and commitment, and for the production of a thoroughly worthwhile 
report. I associate myself with the committee convener's comments about the clerking 
service, which has provided immense assistance. Further, I pay tribute to the 
convener for the considerable drive and commitment that she showed in pushing 
through the process. Not at all grudgingly, I say that the law officers deserve 
considerable credit as well. While the Lord Advocate would not have required a 
crystal ball to predict a number of the committee's recommendations, the fact 
that the Crown Office has anticipated and recognised many of the committee's concerns 
has been highly beneficial to the proper administration of the prosecution system 
in Scotland.</P><P>However, there are still problems. George Lyon quite properly 
highlighted some of them. While it seems that the question of salaries payable 
to procurators fiscal, for example, has been largely resolved, there is still 
lingering doubt about the adequacy of the budget. In a classic case of making 
oneself a hostage to fortune, the Lord Advocate defined the prosecution service 
as the cinderella department of the Scottish Government. I might be tempted to 
identify other departments as the ugly sisters, but I will not do so, and will 
say simply that there could be difficulty in implementing many of the committee's 
recommendations if the budget is inadequate.</P><P>If procurators fiscal and Crown 
counsel are overburdened, the impact is felt throughout the criminal justice system. 
The committee inquiry </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18163">18163</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>revealed a number of points of concern and Roseanna Cunningham's illustrations 
of what happens in many summary courts were quite correct.</P><P>We found that 
morale was low. There was little hope of opportunities for advancement or career 
satisfaction, although the Solicitor General pointed out that considerable career 
satisfaction can be derived from service as a procurator fiscal. Staff who are 
already overloaded have less time to liaise effectively with other agencies such 
as the police and to progress the outcome of cases. In particular, staff were 
unable to give adequate time and information to victims or their families, or 
to speak to defence agents to agree evidence or negotiate pleas.</P><P>The Solicitor 
General referred to the fiscals' work load, which routinely spills over into evenings 
and weekends. As such, fiscals' pay should be comparable to that of people working 
at similar levels in other public organisations, such as the police and other 
sections of the civil service. To facilitate the direly needed fiscal recruitment 
drives that are currently being undertaken, fiscals must also receive comparable 
pay to that offered by the private firms that are alternative employers for potential 
and current fiscals.</P><P>There can be no doubt that there are lots more bodies 
in the service, but the committee was concerned that the management structure 
might be top-heavy. The problems identified in the report are at the front end 
of the service. In crude terms, we really must seek to have more people with gowns 
on their backs prosecuting in Scotland's courts than managers number crunching 
in their offices. Although there must always be a professional and hands-on approach 
to management, it cannot be at the expense of the operational side of the prosecution 
service.</P><P>I am extremely pleased that the Lord Advocate has taken the appropriate 
approach to granting fiscals rights of audience in the High Court. That will be 
greatly encouraging to those who seek to reach the top echelon of the profession 
and who are not members of the Faculty of Advocates. I accept Duncan Hamilton's 
caveat about independence, but I am confident that those who have served long 
and hard as fiscals in the prosecution service will maintain the independence 
that is necessary for the public perception of the department to be as it should 
be.</P><P>When Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, the then Lord Advocate, launched a pilot, 
we thought that it would be successful. I have little doubt that, in future, we 
will see other success stories. The Lord Advocate's responses will have to be 
linked to the recommendations contained in Lord Bonomy's recently published report. 
Many of his lordship's recommendations make sound sense and others </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18164">18164</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>might tempt the Lord Advocate down the route of departing from some sound principles 
of Scots law. That issue might have to be left for another day, but I flag up 
that I could not consider any departure from the 110-day rule as being justified. 
Although our report confirmed that the existence of the rule caused pressure, 
that pressure must be managed and lived with.</P><P>I am disappointed that the 
satellite Crown Office at Glasgow High Court is not being further developed. It 
gives me no pleasure to record that the Glasgow area provides the High Court with 
the bulk of its business. That makes it all the more important that the business 
be dealt with in the most efficient and expeditious manner, particularly for the 
victims of crime and for the relatives of those who have died in homicides.</P><P>I 
would prefer more resources to be put into the Glasgow side of the operation. 
I have no wish to increase Edinburgh-Glasgow rivalries, but the system seems to 
be geared towards Edinburgh. Although I fully understand the historical and administrative 
reasons for that, I would like the necessity of having a full-time and well-staffed 
unit at the High Court in Glasgow to be recognised. I do not believe that the 
purpose of such a satellite office has been properly thought through. I accept 
that many advocates depute live in Edinburgh and require frequent access to the 
Crown Office, but my view is that there should be a unit in Glasgow. It would 
save a lot of time and effort and considerable wear and tear on individuals.</P><P>Earlier, 
Kenny Macintosh&#151;quite appropriately&#151;mentioned the situation of the relatives 
of crime victims. During our inquiry, we took evidence about two unfortunate cases. 
Again, it is appropriate to point out that additional resources have been put 
in and that positive steps have been taken in how witnesses are dealt with. That 
has been highly beneficial and indicates that a degree of sensitivity that was 
not present has now been put in place. Again, the Crown Office is to be congratulated 
on taking such radical steps on the basis of the committee's report. Undoubted 
progress has been made.</P><P>The report has achieved things that few of us could 
have expected at the start, but fears remain. Law and order is one of the Executive's 
many priorities, but it is doubtful whether being a priority in such circumstances 
has much merit at all. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is much 
admired throughout the world. The Lockerbie prosecution was a classic example 
of how, when it works effectively, it is probably without peer among modern judicial 
set-ups. The fact that there was such international recognition of the Lockerbie 
exercise indicates the inherent strength of the prosecution service.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18165">18165</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Mention has been made of the dedication of the Crown Office and Procurator 
Fiscal Service staff. For my colleagues on the committee and me, it has been a 
matter of considerable surprise, and of great appreciation, to see the dedication 
on the ground of people who are prepared to work long hours, in some cases for 
scant reward and even less public recognition. If the report does something, it 
puts on record a parliamentary committee's appreciation of the work that is done.</P><P>If 
there is to be continued improvement, and if we are to provide the service that 
we all want and which the people of Scotland need, resources must be adequate, 
and the commitment of Scottish ministers must measure up to the tremendous commitment 
that has been demonstrated by the Lord Advocate and his staff. Arguably, the Crown 
Office&#151;and the justice system in general&#151;might no longer be the Cinderella 
of the Scottish block, but it is still the poor relation. If we are to achieve 
the aim of a safer Scotland, which I know we all share, that needs to change, 
and Jim Wallace needs to fight his corner more effectively.</P><P>That said, I 
believe that the report is a success story. It has been a significant catalyst 
for change. The report and the reaction of the law officers to it reflect well 
on all concerned. I commend the report to the chamber in the strongest possible 
terms.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18166">18166</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Tourism</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The Deputy Presiding 
Officer (Mr George Reid): </STRONG>The next item of business is a debate on motion 
S1M-3869, in the name of Alex Neil, on the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee's 
report on the future of tourism.</P><P>11:18</P><P><strong>Miss Annabel Goldie 
(West of Scotland) (Con): </strong>It is my pleasure to open on behalf of the 
Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee this debate on the committee's report 
on the future of tourism in Scotland. I always feel that debates on committee 
reports are rather curious parliamentary beasts. Much prowling round the jungle 
has gone on, to the accompaniment of roars, grunts and snuffles, and there has 
been some locking of horns, but when the ultimate product is unanimous&#151;as 
this report is&#151;it usually means that no one emerges bloody and bitter.</P><P>I 
see the visible disappointment of members, who are no doubt asking, &quot;Does 
this mean the report is passive or inert&#151;just another committee report?&quot; 
Nothing could be further from the truth, because the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 
Committee has a mind of its own. Indeed, it has been innovatory and, some would 
say, harbours its own idiosyncrasies. It is none the worse for that.</P><P>Before 
we proceed to the report, there are certain courtesies to be observed. First, 
I am not Alex Neil, the convener of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee&#151;we 
are not quite that idiosyncratic&#151;but I thank him for departing from traditional 
practice in allowing me as deputy convener to lead for the committee in this debate. 
That is an act of characteristic gallantry. I think that he took the view that 
as one of only two original committee members&#151;Marilyn Livingstone being the 
other&#151;our dowager status should be acknowledged.</P><P>If the Parliament 
will indulge me briefly, I will say that serving on the Enterprise and Lifelong 
Learning Committee has been challenging but immensely interesting and pleasurable. 
The committee has been positive for the parliamentary process. It is pleasing 
that the media frequently accord the adjective &quot;influential&quot; to the 
committee.</P><P>I thank the clerking support team of Simon Watkins, Judith Evans, 
Jane Sutherland and Michael Govind for their advice and forbearance. Judith Evans 
and Jane Sutherland were the clerks for the case studies in Denmark and California, 
and I thank them for mothering beyond the call of duty. Our clerks have been of 
the highest calibre. The committee is also indebted to our adviser Roger Carter 
for his sage comments; to the many </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18167">18167</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>organisations and individuals who gave the committee oral or written evidence; 
to Stevens and Associates for its immensely helpful and instructive research, 
which was commissioned pre-inquiry; to the Scottish Parliament information centre 
for welcome research support during the inquiry; and to the Parliamentary Bureau 
and the Conveners Group for making time available for the debate. I think that 
I am correct in saying that, with the exception of the Finance Committee, the 
Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee has had more debates in the chamber 
than any other committee.</P><P>Alex Neil would wish me to express a final note 
of appreciation to the committee's members. A heavy volume of work had to be packed 
into a tight schedule. Four cross-party case studies were undertaken in Scotland. 
They covered VisitScotland's e-tourism venture; rural tourism issues and the impact 
of foot-and-mouth disease in Dumfries and Galloway; golf tourism in Fife and business 
tourism in Scotland; and urban tourism and dispersal issues in Edinburgh. Two 
cross-party studies were undertaken abroad, which involved myself and Tavish Scott&#151;very 
agreeable&#151;going to Copenhagen and taking in Malm&ouml; in Sweden, and Alex 
Neil and Gordon Jackson going to California in the USA.</P><P>In short, much was 
asked of members, who responded spiritedly. The committee had a healthy and robust 
debate as it shaped its views, but all was achieved without our eating lumps out 
of one another. That is probably just as well&#151;otherwise, the exercise might 
have been indigestible.</P><P>The report is the sixth full report that the Enterprise 
and Lifelong Learning Committee has produced after holding an inquiry. It is a 
thorough and robust piece of work. I intend not to go through the report ad longum, 
but simply to comment on pivotal processes and aspects of the report. I do not 
intend even to use the full time allocated for my speech, because it is important 
for other members to be given the chance to speak.</P><P>In June last year, the 
committee agreed that the inquiry's remit would be to inquire into the levels 
and effectiveness of Government support for tourism. The committee also agreed 
to pose a set of key questions to stimulate and focus debate. Those questions 
were singularly significant and can be found at paragraph 43 of the report.</P><P>Of 
undoubted assistance in pointing the committee in the right direction was the 
pre-inquiry research from Stevens and Associates to which I have referred. That 
research achieved a status in its own right and focused the committee on matters 
that merited investigation.</P><P>The external research is worth dwelling on.

<P>sample of countries and territories was identified for comparison with Scotland 
on five key tourism markers, which were the scale, nature and growth of tourism; 
the structure and nature of governance in support of tourism; the nature and level 
of direct and indirect support of tourism; marketing strategies and trends, whether 
niche or general promotion; and the perception of the country or region as a tourist 
destination. The report of the findings of those comparisons facilitated the identification 
of practice that was applicable to tourism in Scotland. It did not always produce 
an outcome that was entirely favourable to Scotland.</P><P>The research report 
identified five key lessons for Scotland. The first was that Scotland should create 
a clear and focused national tourism strategy that involves leading private sector 
representatives. The second was that Scotland should encourage different products 
and service providers to establish a strategic alliance that meets market demand. 
I think that I speak for the whole committee when I say that those two lessons 
were material in influencing the committee's approach to the inquiry.</P><P>The 
committee had a mission and a compass, but did not necessarily know what it would 
encounter on the journey. It soon became clear that the tourism territory in Scotland 
was congested and that numerous bodies, organisations and individuals were struggling 
to perform roles, provide advice and represent provider groups in the industry&#151;not 
to mention the prominent roles that some providers play. All of that was set against 
a backdrop of various Scottish Executive strategies and initiatives.</P><P>Interestingly, 
we found that the situation contrasted sharply with that in Denmark and California, 
where the lead position of the industry was not only prominent but unquestioned. 
It is no co-incidence that that situation forms part of our key recommendations: 
members will find them in paragraphs 172 and 173. It is vital that the industry's 
voice be clear, visible and articulate, and that there is not a chorus of collective 
contributions.</P><P>It was also clear that a critical factor in the success of 
competitor destinations was the attraction of new air links&#151;that was an issue 
that weighed heavily with the committee. The committee agrees that the Executive's 
new route development fund is a sensible contribution to meeting that need, but 
further work needs to be undertaken by VisitScotland and the enterprise agencies 
to prosecute actively the case for such development.</P><P><strong>Fergus Ewing 
(Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP): </strong>Listening to Annabel Goldie, 
I miss working with her and colleagues on the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 
Committee.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18169">18169</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Does Annabel Goldie agree that one of the recommendations that the Executive 
should follow is the recommendation that is to be found at paragraph 213? It reads:</P><P>&quot;The 
Committee recommends that the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong 
Learning aids HIAL&quot;&#151;</P><P>Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd&#151;</P><P>&quot;in 
renegotiating its PFI arrangements because of their impact in constraining growth 
at Inverness airport.&quot;</P><P>Could not the route development fund of £5.3 
million be used to assist the situation? Surely the use of that fund could have 
a significant impact on the need to attract more low-cost carriers to Inverness 
airport?</P><P><strong>Miss Goldie: </strong>Mr Ewing touches on an important 
aspect of the inquiry. I do not think that any committee member would dispute 
the fact that we found the issue perplexing. What seemed particularly arcane was 
the structure of the private finance initiative, which had to be unravelled. We 
were given the clear impression that the structure of the PFI package was hostile 
to the improvement and expansion of routes. That seems to me to be something of 
a commercial paradox.</P><P>I say to Mr Ewing that, as the recommendation suggests, 
the situation needs to be actively investigated. The minister might want to comment 
on that. The issue taxed the minds of the committee, hence our recommendation.</P><P>No 
doubt others will wish to address particular aspects of the report, but, in promoting 
Scotland as a world-class destination, it is clear that there needs to be close 
co-ordination with United Kingdom ministers, particularly in respect of the role 
of the British Tourist Authority. I know that Tavish Scott, Gordon Jackson, Alex 
Neil and I were immensely impressed by the role of the BTA abroad, which we saw 
when we undertook our foreign visits.</P><P>All members of the committee recognise 
the potential for partnership between the BTA and VisitScotland. We think that 
the BTA has the potential to be a strategic and significant partner in VisitScotland's 
work overseas. We were struck by the professionalism and obvious willingness of 
the BTA to engage in that partnership. One practical and manageable proposal is 
to place VisitScotland staff in each of the BTA's eight international hub offices. 
It is also important to measure activities under any such initiative. It would 
not be enough to simply put such a structure in place; the committee felt that 
it was important for it to be measured.</P><P><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) 
(SNP): </strong>Is the member aware of the report by the Culture, Media and Sport 
Select Committee, under Gerald Kaufman, on the changes to the BTA and the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18170">18170</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>English Tourism Council? It appears that the Westminster committee went further 
than the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee did in its interesting report 
in indicating its hostility and opposition to the changes that Ms Jowell has announced.</P><P>The 
Westminster committee report calls for a properly federated structure for the 
BTA. In the light of that, does Miss Goldie wish to reconsider whether the Scottish 
Parliament should go further than the committee has done in expressing our distaste 
about being boxed in by having to go through the British Tourist Authority?</P><P><strong>Miss 
Goldie: </strong>I am not acquainted with the detail of the Westminster report, 
but I can say that the committee researched fully the role of the BTA as part 
of its inquiry and took evidence from that organisation.</P><P>In fairness to 
the minister, the committee took evidence from him and subjected him to intensive 
questioning about liaison between the Scottish Executive and the Westminster Government. 
What is important is that we are where we are. We are working with a new devolved 
Parliament within the context of the United Kingdom. The BTA is a significant 
association and operator in the tourism field, and, from committee members' direct 
experience, I believe that the BTA has a positive contribution to make to the 
development of Scottish tourism. Perhaps Mr MacAskill will want to pursue those 
aspects further with either VisitScotland or the minister.</P><P>There were also 
key recommendations in the report on Executive strategies and targets for research, 
business tourism, e-tourism and skills. In relation to area tourist boards, the 
minister may have some comment to make on the review that is being conducted.</P><P>Although 
the committee did not take evidence on the ATB structure&#151;members thought 
that it would have been premature to comment on the structure per se&#151;it was 
clear that in the cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, ATBs have a distinct role in 
acting as gateways to Scotland in business and leisure tourism, and in dispersing 
tourists elsewhere. That compares with the successful Copenhagen model, and the 
committee felt that Edinburgh and Glasgow should be encouraged to maintain that 
drive.</P><P>I am pleased to say that the overall reception of the report from 
the industry has been favourable. However, it is in the public domain that the 
BAA in Scotland had certain concerns about paragraph 190 of the report, which 
refers to BAA ownership of the three main airports in Scotland. The BAA has written 
to the convener and committee members, and that letter is on the agenda for next 
week's meeting and will be considered seriously.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18171">18171</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Miss 
Goldie: </strong>I am in my closing minutes, so I shall continue.</P><P>I hope 
that the minister will feel able to receive the report warmly&#151;I shall stop 
short of asking him to embrace me&#151;in principle; I appreciate that it would 
be unreasonable to expect him to respond in detail. Perhaps he will be able to 
indicate the direction in which he thinks the Executive might go in relation to 
the report.</P><P>I commend the report to the Executive and the Parliament as 
a positive and robust contribution to improving tourism in Scotland. I take pleasure 
in moving motion S1M-3869, in the name of Mr Alex Neil.</P><P>I move,</P><P>That 
the Parliament notes the 1st Report 2003 of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 
Committee, <em>Report on the Future of Tourism in Scotland</em> (SP Paper 740), 
and commends the report to all stakeholders in the tourism sector.</P><P>11:32</P><P><strong>The 
Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Mike Watson): </strong>I should like 
to thank the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee for the opportunity to 
speak on its report. I am glad that the committee chose Scotland's biggest business 
sector as suitable for an in-depth inquiry.</P><P>When the committee began its 
work last year, tourism in Scotland was still suffering from the aftermath of 
foot-and-mouth and the other tragic events of 2001. Although the committee has 
not ignored the past, it has clearly concentrated on the future, which I welcome. 
I am happy to embrace the report, if not to physically embrace Annabel Goldie 
for her introduction&#151;perhaps I could do that another time. The report will 
help the hard work that is going on throughout the tourism sector in Scotland 
to get the sector growing so that it can make a contribution to an expanding Scottish 
economy.</P><P>I shall comment on one or two of the most significant points that 
are raised in the report. Three years ago, the Executive published its &quot;New 
Strategy for Scottish Tourism&quot;. That strategy still holds good with its focus 
on five strategic priorities, and in March last year the Executive set out in 
its &quot;Tourism Framework for Action&quot; an action plan to deliver the strategy. 
That plan has now been taken forward across the sector, and a lot has been achieved. 
Information on what has been achieved will be published next month in the first 
annual report on the action plan. As well as recording what has been done, that 
report will show what remains to be done. Already, the efforts of many people 
across the tourism sector and in the public sector are producing results.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18172">18172</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The figures for 2002 demonstrate that tourism is on the road to recovery. For 
instance, hotel occupancy in Edinburgh and the Lothians last year was at its highest 
level since 1997, despite the fact that the number of beds increased by 15 per 
cent during that period. It is particularly heartening that tourism expenditure 
by overseas visitors increased by 3.6 per cent over the first three quarters of 
2002. We must ensure that that trend continues.</P><P>Those figures show that 
we are on the way to achieving the target that the Executive has set VisitScotland 
of returning tourism numbers to the 2000 level by 2004. In addition, the short 
breaks market is becoming increasingly popular and important. Indeed, I have made 
use of short breaks myself over the past year or so, and the market brings people 
to Scotland at times outwith the typical holiday periods.</P><P>Although that 
progress is encouraging, I am prepared to state clearly that many uncertainties 
face us and that we will press on with the key strategic priorities that we have 
outlined on a number of occasions.</P><P><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland 
and Easter Ross) (LD): </strong>Although we should recognise that the figures 
for 2002 are good news, the minister has hinted that the situation is slightly 
patchy and our interpretation of the report is dependent on what members here 
in the chamber say about it. For example, Annabel Goldie gave us a very elegant 
but rather broad-brush description of the situation. Given that tourism is one 
of the few long-term viable industries in the Highlands, does the minister agree 
that the marketing of particular areas, such as the far north, is key if tourism 
is to be for all, and if the benefits that we have seen in 2002 are to be rolled 
out to those areas of Scotland that could use the money?</P><P><strong>Mike Watson: 
</strong>Indeed. Although it is important to market Scotland as a whole, many 
areas within the country can be marketed on the strength of their unique attractions. 
The far north of Scotland&#151;including Caithness and Sutherland, which I am 
sure Jamie Stone has particularly in mind&#151;is part of that marketing strategy. 
The Highlands of Scotland Tourist Board markets the area very effectively. I am 
sure that its efforts will continue, and I recognise the benefits of such an approach.</P><P>I 
find it encouraging that many of the committee's recommendations in the report 
build on the priorities that the Executive has already established. For example, 
Annabel Goldie mentioned direct air access. The report makes important recommendations 
in that regard and we recognise the issue's strategic importance. That is why, 
in November 2002, the First Minister announced the interim route development fund, 
which amounts to £6.8 million.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18173">18173</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP): </strong>Will the minister give way?</P><P><strong>Mike 
Watson: </strong>Not at the moment.</P><P>The First Minister announced that fund 
specifically because we wish to increase the number of direct routes into Scotland 
and therefore the benefits of tourism. VisitScotland is working closely with the 
Executive on that issue and I expect that some announcements will soon be made 
on important new direct air links to Scotland.</P><P><strong>Mrs Ewing: </strong>I 
have a question on direct air links, which has already been raised in relation 
to Dalcross airport&#151;or Inverness airport, as most of us call it. HIAL is 
fighting with its hands tied behind its back in its attempt to attract low-cost 
budget airlines to the airport. In that respect, will the minister directly address 
paragraphs 213 and 214 of the report?</P><P><strong>Mike Watson: </strong>I notice 
the report's specific comments about the public-private partnership aspects of 
the matter, and I will be having discussions with Lewis Macdonald as the minister 
with responsibility for transport, and other colleagues in the enterprise and 
lifelong learning department, to find out what can be done about the situation. 
However, contracts have already been entered into, which might have implications 
that might or might not meet what the committee has sought on the matter. I recognise 
the importance of Inverness airport to tourism and to other aspects of life in 
the Highlands.</P><P>Business tourism is increasingly important in Scotland; I 
stressed that point when I addressed the Business Tourism Scotland conference 
last month in Glasgow. After all, business tourists spend one and a half times 
more than leisure tourists, and encouraging business tourism is a good way of 
spreading accommodation capacity in Scotland, particularly during the winter months. 
That is why VisitScotland will put more emphasis on business tourism in the coming 
year.</P><P>VisitScotland's marketing strategy&#151;</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_8"></A>Rhona 
Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab): </strong>Will the minister give way?</P><P><strong>Mike 
Watson: </strong>I will take one more intervention, but then I really must move 
on. I have only 12 minutes.</P><P><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Will the minister 
assure us that business tourism will form an important part of the major events 
strategy?</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_11"></A>Mike Watson: </strong>Yes, 
indeed. The major events strategy is about not just big sporting or cultural events, 
but major conferences, some of which are very major indeed. For example, a midwives 
conference that will be held in Glasgow in 2008 </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18174">18174</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>will attract something like 18,000 delegates. Of course, the exhibition market 
is also an important aspect of the strategy.</P><P>On marketing, I acknowledge 
the remarks that the committee, Annabel Goldie and Kenny MacAskill made about 
the BTA. We were consulted about the proposed new arrangements. I gave evidence 
to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee in the House of Commons and have 
seen its report. From our point of view, the most important matter is to ensure 
that the BTA structure works for Scotland and chimes with VisitScotland's marketing 
strategy.</P><P>That is why my officials will keep in close touch with the Department 
for Culture, Media and Sport, and VisitScotland with the BTA, to ensure that the 
new structure works for Scotland as it is put in place. We are determined that 
the new structure will result in stronger marketing of Scotland in key overseas 
markets&#151;it is not as though we can somehow suddenly detach ourselves. The 
BTA spends about £5 million on marketing Scotland abroad. From VisitScotland's 
point of view, that is effective. I visited two of the offices and I saw the effort 
that the staff put into the job. If there is any change in that situation, I will 
be quick to deal with it, as will VisitScotland. People have to be a little more 
confident about the new structure and must wait and see how it settles in.</P><P>There 
is a question of utilising new technology in the tourism sector. I welcome the 
committee's support for the new website, visitscotland.com. I have been impressed 
by the solid start that has been made by the e-tourism booking service. The latest 
figures show that nearly £1 million-worth of new bookings has flowed to Scottish 
tourism businesses and to the new contact centre in Livingston since it was opened 
only last August. The most dramatic increase has been in the Edinburgh and Lothians 
Tourist Board area, where there has been a 20-fold increase. Other parts of the 
country have been good and, in fairness, some have not been so good. These are 
early days, but a considerable, solid foundation exists upon which to build.</P><P>The 
committee emphasised the importance of better product quality and better skills 
and training. I have mentioned that consistently in the period in which I have 
had responsibility for tourism. Just this week, I met Careers Scotland to discuss 
what it is doing and what it can do to ensure that young people in schools in 
Scotland are given every opportunity to pursue tourism and hospitality as a career, 
because there are many worth-while jobs in the sector.</P><P><strong>Mr Andrew 
Welsh (Angus) (SNP): </strong>Will the minister give way?</P><P><strong></strong></P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18175">18175</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Mike Watson: </strong>I am sorry; I must press on, or I will not get 
through all the points in my speech.</P><P>Much has been done by VisitScotland, 
Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and other bodies such as 
Springboard Scotland, to ensure that training takes place and that those who are 
working in the sector keep their skills up to the mark so that they can maximise 
the quality of tourism for our visitors to Scotland. That is an important aspect.</P><P>Another 
of our strategic priorities is restructuring. I welcome the committee's recognition 
of the work done by VisitScotland. It is widely recognised that there is a new 
energy and direction in the work of VisitScotland and that has been an important 
factor in the recovery of tourism in Scotland since 2001.</P><P>I note from the 
report that the committee did not take direct evidence on the area tourist board 
review. However, the views that are expressed by the committee are helpful as 
we seek to finalise our thinking on that important issue.</P><P>The Executive 
received well over 300 responses to the consultation. Needless to say, there were 
many diverse views on the subject of the future of support for tourism. Many respondents 
commented on the important issue of funding, but not so many commented on the 
functions that will be needed in the future as we develop tourism in Scotland. 
Certain common themes emerged from the responses. One such theme was that, if 
tourism is to prosper, there needs to be much better integration between our tourism 
strategy, as developed and delivered nationally by VisitScotland, and the delivery 
of that strategy on the ground. I certainly concur with that.</P><P>In considering 
the responses, we started by examining the functions and not the structures and 
funding, important as those are. I am convinced that local businesses need to 
be involved in developing the overall Scottish tourism brand and the various products 
in it, so a key function of the new structure will be to engage those local tourism 
businesses in the delivery of the national tourism strategy. That links in to 
the response that I gave to Jamie Stone. Individual tourism businesses, wherever 
they are, need to understand what is being marketed nationally for Scotland, what 
the strategy can offer them and how they can build on it locally. That is a key 
method to ensure that Scottish tourism grows again.</P><P>Another key role, which 
was referred to in the committee's report, is that of major gateways&#151;especially, 
although not exclusively, in Edinburgh and Glasgow. We want to maximise the gateway 
effect as well as the dispersal function, which is important to achieving a geographic 
spread of tourism throughout Scotland. For example, 75 per </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18176">18176</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>cent of visitors to the tourist information centre at Waverley station are 
not staying in Edinburgh; instead they are using the city as their base.</P><P>Those 
are the kind of issues that are important as we proceed. I am not saying that 
our tourism support structure must not do anything other than the functions that 
I have described. However, if it cannot achieve them, it will not operate effectively 
in support of the national priorities now and in the future.</P><P>I am aware 
that there is a degree of anticipation in the sector over what the outcome of 
the area tourist board review will be. Naturally, we have taken some time to reach 
conclusions and have given a great deal of thought to the proposed new model. 
We are now close to final decisions on the outcome of the review. However, after 
very careful reflection, including discussions with officials, Cabinet colleagues 
and VisitScotland, I have concluded that it would not be appropriate to announce 
any decision prior to the dissolution of Parliament. Given the vital contribution 
of the tourism sector to the Scottish economy, a new structure for tourism in 
Scotland deserves to be received and evaluated outwith the glare of an election 
campaign, where it could become the subject of political point scoring. So the 
new structure will be finalised, but an announcement will be made as soon as possible 
after the new Parliament has convened. I believe that that is the right time to 
make a statement on such an important matter.</P><P>Our aim is to have a structure 
that is flexible and fit for purpose as international markets change. All the 
indications are that international tourism will continue to expand in the long 
term, and we want to be able to take full advantage of that and get tourism in 
Scotland growing strongly again. The committee's report will be of considerable 
assistance in doing that, and once again I compliment the committee's members 
and its support staff on a thorough job well done.</P><P>11:46</P><P><strong>Mr 
Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP): </strong>There is a lot of good news in the 
Scottish tourism industry, but we should not be fooled by the figures for 2002. 
The 2002 figures simply look good because 2001 was such a disaster, and there 
are long-term structural problems that need to be addressed.</P><P>It is fair 
to say that we welcome the report, particularly because we recognise that tourism 
is our biggest industry and that its wants and needs are often ignored. That is 
perhaps part of a cultural hang-up that afflicts our country in recruiting staff 
and in other aspects of the industry. Scotland and the Scots must recognise that 
service is not </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18177">18177</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>servility and that tourism is not incompatible with a strong manufacturing 
base. Many small and large European nations see that as something that is complementary, 
and perhaps the classic embodiment of that view is the state of California, which 
has a modern, go-ahead manufacturing economy and which also ensures that its tourism 
is a high-quality product.</P><P>The industry must be welcomed for its worth and 
benefit, and its denigration, in all sections of our society, must cease. Collectively&#151;I 
mean nationally, rather than from a specific political position&#151;we must stop 
lecturing and start listening to the industry. We must stop complaining and start 
delivering and we must stop going on about the bad aspects and start praising 
the good aspects. There are problems in tourism in Scotland, but the good sectors 
are far better than those that are failing to deliver, and there is service in 
California that is just as bad as that in some areas of Scotland.</P><P>Fundamentally, 
the debate is about the role of VisitScotland. The fundamental role of VisitScotland 
must be about selling Scotland. If it will not sell Scotland, who else will? At 
the end of the day, VisitScotland's duty is to ensure not that it sells the product 
of an individual hotelier or restaurateur but that it engenders the whole concept 
of coming to Scotland. The individual operator will sell the specific product, 
but the requirement for VisitScotland is to sell an interest in coming to our 
country. VisitScotland must be moved away from being a regulatory body and a tourist 
police force to being a marketing force for Scotland. There are more than enough 
bodies addressing a plethora of regulation. We do not require VisitScotland to 
come in with additional bureaucracy on top of that. It must focus on selling Scotland 
abroad, just as Tourism Ireland is focused on selling Ireland.</P><P><strong>Mike 
Watson: </strong>I find those remarks surprising. Surely the quality of tourism 
in Scotland must be regulated in some way, so that people know when they walk 
through the door what standards they can expect of the hotel, restaurant or whatever. 
Surely that is part of VisitScotland's role, notwithstanding the fact that other 
bodies will do it as well. Regulation is a central part of developing tourism 
in Scotland. It is about quality.</P><P><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>Those matters 
are dealt with by local authorities. We have environmental health departments 
and an array of other bodies to deal with those matters. We should compare how 
Scotland and VisitScotland punch in comparison with Ireland and Tourism Ireland. 
Tourism Ireland sells Ireland rather than running round policing Ireland. It ensures 
that it delivers quality. The quality in Ireland is no better than in Scotland, 
but Tourism Ireland outperforms VisitScotland </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18178">18178</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>considerably. We must move on and accept that.</P><P>There are important matters 
to mention in relation to the report, such as the necessity of the industry playing 
a leading role. That is something that should have been viewed as common sense. 
If it has not been dealt with, it must be. The best folk to advise and deal with 
the industry are clearly those who work in it. We must take on board the benefits 
of such an approach.</P><P>We support direct air services. I want to talk about 
two matters in particular in that respect&#151;BAA and HIAL. My colleague Margaret 
Ewing will speak at length about HIAL&#151;what is happening with the company 
is a scandal and the Executive and the First Minister cannot shirk responsibility. 
We are talking about the First Minister's airport&#151;he is the sole shareholder. 
Everybody now acknowledges the problems with PFIs. There is more than one way 
to address the matter, but it must be addressed.</P><P>On direct routes, we support 
the growth of a route development fund, but we are rather surprised that its purpose 
should be to lower landing charges. That seems to me to go against the interests 
of marketing direct routes. We are in danger of subsidising an airport operator 
that has a monopoly and imposes landing charges that are outrageous in comparison 
with the charges at airports south of the border, never mind competitor airports 
elsewhere. Why should we keep that operator in the standard of living to which 
it has become accustomed? Mr Donald Dowds, who is the chief executive of BAA, 
does not like the committee's report. If that is the case, perhaps he should consider 
whether his position as a VisitScotland board member is compatible with proposals 
to open up and pursue direct services. If he cannot deliver, he should not remain 
on VisitScotland's board. BAA has failed Scotland and that matter requires to 
be addressed.</P><P>The position of the BTA must be addressed, too. We do not 
see a requirement for VisitScotland to have a plethora of offices. We recognise 
that VisitScotland, as the national marketing body for Scotland, has the best 
people to sell Scotland. It is absurd to suggest that Scotland can be sold better 
by the BTA when the BTA is trying to sell an entirely different concept. As others 
have suggested, if that were true, Tourism Ireland would be lining up to be taken 
aboard and brought into the bosom of the BTA. No doubt the Portuguese also would 
seek to be sucked into the benefits that are provided by the Spanish tourism authority. 
Nobody with a different product seeks to hand it over to their competitors.</P><P><strong>Rhona 
Brankin: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>I 
am sorry, but I am approaching my final minute.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18179">18179</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The situation is unacceptable and must be changed&#151;it simply cannot continue. 
VisitScotland should decide where it wishes to market. I do not believe that the 
benefits of using the BTA offices are shown in any statistical information. We 
should also bear in mind who sits on the BTA's board, in the main. The BTA exists 
to fly people in on British Airways to a BAA airport down in London and thereafter 
disperse people north. If people are happy to go beyond York to Edinburgh, we 
may benefit, but the prospect of their going north of Edinburgh&#151;even beyond 
the Trossachs&#151;is rare.</P><P>On the area tourist boards, it is simply unacceptable 
for the minister to say that he has kicked the review into the long grass and 
that a decision will be taken some time after the election. As in other aspects 
of Scottish society, the Executive is compounding study by consultancy and reviewing 
us to death.</P><P>I have a time line. In February 2000, a new strategy for tourism 
was launched by the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning&#151;I think 
that it was Henry McLeish. The decision to launch that strategy was correct. In 
October 2000, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report was published. In November 2001, 
Wendy Alexander announced an area tourist board review at the &quot;Scotland united&quot; 
tourism conference. In May 2002, the ATB review commenced. In September 2002, 
the consultation period for the review closed. In December 2002, Mike Watson announced 
at the &quot;Scotland united&quot; tourism conference in Crieff that he hoped 
to make an announcement on the ATB review early in the new year.</P><P>Today is 
13 February and we have been told that, despite the launch of a new strategy in 
February 2000 and the fact that we have gone through three ministers, no decision 
will be made until after the election. That is simply unacceptable. There is unity 
in the industry on what needs to be done. We need a decision, not a minister who 
is afraid of deciding and is again postponing, studying and consulting us unto 
death. He is presiding over the death throes of businesses because he will not 
decide.</P><P>11:54</P><P><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con): 
</strong>I will start on a warmer note than that on which Kenny MacAskill finished. 
I praise the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee and its members, clerks 
and adviser on the work that they have done. I sympathise tremendously with them 
over the efforts that they made to go to sunny lands, warm lands and cold lands 
to find out what tourism is like abroad. I know that that was a hard part of their 
working year.</P><P>I might as well mention another bit of good </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18180">18180</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>news. I was delighted to hear today that the tourism expo will move to the 
north-east this year. I am sure that the industry will be made welcome there. 
That is a boost for the north-east and the role that it plays in the tourism business.</P><P>The 
key point that I took from the report was the importance of a leading role for 
the industry. I think that we all knew how important it is that the industry play 
a leading role, and it was long overdue for that to be stated firmly in a Parliament 
document. Without the industry's involvement, there will be no future for the 
industry. If we expect businesses to take an entrepreneurial approach, we cannot 
enforce on them a regimen that is set down by the centre. It is important that 
alliances are made. The minister mentioned alliances when he talked about the 
BTA, and I will come back to that point.</P><P>We must ensure that all levels 
of the industry&#151;including support systems, communications and so on&#151;and 
all its varied sectors, whether large or small, are involved in the process. Either 
that involvement must be on a consultative basis or, in particular in VisitScotland, 
all levels and sectors must be represented as part of the management. Without 
that connection, VisitScotland is not the exchange and interchange between the 
industry and the world outside that it must be. I know that work is being done 
on that aspect in the restructuring, but much more must be done.</P><P>Another 
issue is the amount of money that is being spent on tourism around the world. 
We do not spend a lot. I will not use the Irish model as an example, because that 
might cause problems for certain people. However, it is important to recognise 
that in many parts of the world the money that is spent on tourism comes from 
businesses putting their hands in their pockets and looking to the state to provide 
other things. Here, we have an unusual tourism industry, in that a mixture of 
the public and private sector delivers the product and the taxpayer puts in support. 
It is important that the Parliament ensures, on behalf of the taxpayer, that the 
money that is spent is focused meaningfully, in a way that is of use to the industry.</P><P><strong>Andrew 
Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>David Davidson mentioned the democratic 
scrutiny of money that supports the industry. In an alarming development, the 
Government has taken a decision on the future of the ATB structure but does not 
want the election and democratic scrutiny to get in its way. Will Mr Davidson 
comment on that, or at least consult his colleagues on it? What is the Conservatives' 
position on that development? The election and democratic scrutiny are being viewed 
as bad and troubling things, but surely we should hear now the Government's plans 
for the future of the ATB </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18181">18181</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>structure. Will the Conservatives back the SNP in calling for a decision now 
rather than after the election?</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>I was about 
to make exactly that comment about the Parliament's role in the review process. 
I find it insulting that the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport can come 
to the Parliament and say that the Executive has made a decision but is not going 
to tell the Parliament. The minister is talking about a vital industry for Scotland. 
The industry, which is Scotland's largest, has great potential. It has the largest 
employment base&#151;far greater than whisky and oil and gas put together. We 
are not getting an answer. That is a great disappointment to all those who are 
involved in the industry. Many people are waiting to see what direction the Government 
might go in and what decision will be made, because after the decision has been 
made, we will have to reconsider how we structure support for tourism in general.</P><P>My 
colleague, David Mundell, was particularly concerned&#151;I would not say upset&#151;about 
one point. He was pushing for recommendation 361 in the committee report on how 
the enterprise agencies are tuned in to working to the common agenda. On that 
point, I wrote to the minister recently about a problem with the teaching company 
scheme for industry placements for postgraduate students. I found out from a constituent 
that one of the students worked up a programme but was told that tourism is not 
covered by the scheme as it is not business. We must address that lack of joined-up 
thinking.</P><P>I look forward to the minister responding to that point; perhaps 
he has not had time to respond to my letter on the matter. I asked for a meeting, 
and perhaps that will come. We need to sort out the joined-up issues, because 
Government cannot operate in isolation. I hope that the minister will give a better 
response in his winding-up speech on why the decision on the ATBs will not be 
announced today.</P><P>We must get people into the country&#151;that is the job 
of national and international marketing&#151;but we also need a proper dispersal 
programme to get visitors away from the hot spots and gateways. Tourists must 
be dispersed, not only throughout the central belt, but to the Borders, the Highlands 
and the north-east. The Executive has a role in that&#151;it must help to produce 
an integrated transport system with through-ticketing and to tackle the direct 
flight issue. Local government also has a role.</P><P>Credit must go to BAA for 
its £60 million investment through the international route development fund. The 
issue is how the money can be applied to fit the processes that are ahead of us.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18182">18182</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Mr MacAskill: </strong>Is the member aware that BAA proposes to increase 
landing charges, which will mean that people from Scotland who fly to London will 
have the privilege of paying for the construction of Heathrow terminal 5, which 
will cost £3.8 billion? Is the member aware that whatever BAA has put into the 
route development fund will be offset by what we will have to pay and that those 
payments towards Heathrow terminal 5 will help to ensure that we always have to 
fly into Heathrow?</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>That goes back to the point 
that I made about the Executive's role as a facilitator in the discussions that 
must take place with the industry, carriers and other transport operators.</P><P>The 
report does not go far into VisitScotland's role. That body must focus more on 
international marketing and research. I agree with the minister that we must develop 
a national quality assurance standard so that people from abroad can see what 
they will get. I agree with Mr MacAskill that we do not want a police force, but 
we must support and encourage skills training and development.</P><P>Tourist information 
centres&#151;TICs&#151;have not been mentioned. I believe that the report could 
have gone further on the issue of modernising TICs through the use of touch-screens 
and other measures. If touch-screens are set up abroad, will VisitScotland run 
them or, if they are run in Scotland, will the ATBs run them? We will not know 
about that until we have an answer on the ATBs.</P><P>I would like a thrust in 
the direction of making membership of ATBs or quality assurance schemes compulsory 
for those in the industry. Such a measure is long overdue and could be a major 
factor in raising the quality of the product.</P><P>The report shows that we need 
better responses from the minister and better co-ordination. We also need more 
action on the ground between the industry and the support bodies for which the 
minister is responsible. The minister cannot walk away and say that he will be 
in one place making decisions while the industry is out there struggling. There 
must be better co-ordination between the two.</P><P><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>On 
a point of order, Presiding Officer. I gave you brief notice of this point of 
order, which arises from the remarks that Lord Watson made in the closing part 
of his speech. He said that a decision has been made on the future of area tourist 
boards. We have waited for that decision for a long time and it will affect the 
lives of many people who work for the boards. However, the minister said that, 
although the decision has been made, it will not be announced until after the 
impending general election.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18183">18183</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Surely people&#151;not least those who will be affected&#151;are entitled to 
know what the decision is. Under standing order 13, it is up to the Executive 
to initiate a ministerial statement, but are not there circumstances in which 
the Parliament and the public may appropriately expect a ministerial statement 
to be made? Will you invite the minister to reflect on whether that option should 
be pursued as soon as possible?</P><P><strong>Mike Watson: </strong>Further to 
that point, Presiding Officer&#151;</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer 
(Mr Murray Tosh): </strong>I will rule on the point of order, Mr Watson, although 
you may make your own point.</P><P>I am grateful to Mr Ewing for giving me notice 
of his intention to raise the matter. In effect, he answered his point of order 
when he said that it is for ministers to decide when a ministerial statement is 
due. I do not believe that anything in the standing orders entitles me to instruct 
the minister to issue a statement. Whether a statement is merited and whether 
a decision has been made and should be announced are essentially political matters 
and, as such, they are matters for proper political debate, not the subject of 
the standing orders.</P><P>That is my immediate reaction, but I will reflect further 
on the point of order in case I have overlooked anything in the standing order 
in question. Does the minister wish to make a point of order?</P><P><strong>Mike 
Watson: </strong>I do. I will provide some clarification, because, in their anxiety, 
Scottish National Party members have not listened to what I said. I will quote 
two important passages on the issue from my speech:</P><P>&quot;We are now close 
to final decisions on the outcome of the review.&quot;</P><P>All right?</P><P>&quot;So

hope that that is clear.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Further 
to Mr Ewing's point of order, it is clear from rule 13.2 of the standing orders,

to a request from the Executive to make a statement. It is not for the chair to

</strong>Order. The matter is one for political debate, as we can see. Members 
should refer to the issue in their speeches. It is not a matter for a ruling. 
The standing orders are clear. If members wish to make political points about 
the matter, they should do so in their own time. The exchanges have already impacted 
severely on the time that is available for back-bench speeches and I will have 
to express regrets to various individuals later in the day.</P><P>12:06</P><P><strong>Tavish 
Scott (Shetland) (LD): </strong>It is unfortunate that the committee debate will 
now be overshadowed by the spat over the decision. Of course the matter is important, 
but to raise it in such a way is unfortunate. Members can make such points in 
speeches. I wish that they would.</P><P>I am hugely grateful to Annabel Goldie 
for her introduction. I am sure that Gordon Jackson, Alex Neil and I are particularly 
grateful for her recollections of our foreign jaunts. I associate myself particularly 
with her remarks on the work that so many people&#151;our clerks and advisers, 
as well as committee colleagues across the spectrum&#151;put into the inquiry.</P><P>That 
is why Kenny MacAskill's speech was so disappointing&#151;SNP committee members 
engaged constructively in a good report and it is unfortunate that Kenny MacAskill 
did not talk to his party colleagues about the way in which the inquiry was carried 
out. His speech reminded me of days of yore, when Sarah Boyack had to deal elegantly 
with debates on transport and we used to hear rants of the same order.</P><P>The 
committee sought to answer three fundamental questions with the recommendations 
that are in the body of the report. How do we bring more visitors to Scotland? 
How do we help visitors to travel to and around Scotland? How can the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18185">18185</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Government and the other relevant bodies enhance the business environment for 
tourism operators?</P><P>I will deal first with the &quot;more visitors&quot; 
theme, on which the committee sought to examine the BTA's role. I share the view 
of many members that the BTA is a positive force for Scottish tourism. That came 
out clearly not only in the case studies that Annabel Goldie mentioned, but in 
the evidence that the BTA gave to the committee.</P><P>There have been some concerns 
about the way in which changes took place&#151;I know that other members are interested 
in that point. It struck me that Westminster's Culture, Media and Sport Committee 
has been more vigorous on the point than we have.</P><P>The answer to the problem 
lies in paragraph 19 of the committee's report, in which the recommendation is 
to</P><P>&quot;set specific targets for BTA in attracting tourists to Scotland&quot;.</P><P>The 
minister referred to that in his remarks. It is entirely right. Scotland must 
vigorously ensure through the agencies that are under our responsibility that 
the BTA delivers for us, however the service-level agreement is described.</P><P><strong>Brian 
Fitzpatrick (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Lab): </strong>Does Tavish Scott&#151;unlike 
Mr MacAskill&#151;agree that there is a real opportunity for Scotland to be a 
bit mercenary, if nothing else, in our relationship with the BTA? We could piggyback 
on the infrastructure and expertise of the BTA and gain the best advantage from 
it, adding value through its activities.</P><P><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>I 
share Brian Fitzpatrick's view. There is indeed an opportunity&#151;that is how 
we should look at it&#151;to achieve a lot more than was achieved in the past. 
That is the focus that the committee is encouraging the Government to take.</P><P>The 
minister and others have spoken about the fact that more visitors are coming through 
business tourism. That struck the committee, too&#151;I refer in particular to 
the evidence that Rhona Brankin, Adam Ingram and I took. Business tourism presents 
a huge opportunity. The minister mentioned the 18,000 midwives who will come to 
Scotland in 2008&#151;that strikes me as a good year in which to have a baby. 
[<em>Interruption.</em>] I am not going there. Business tourism is an important 
development for Scotland. The sector is growing; it already accounts for 25 per 
cent of Scottish tourism spend. For VisitScotland, the average return on the leisure 
market is about £12 for every £1 of spend; the average return on business tourism 
in Glasgow is £110 for every £1 of spend. There are significant advantages to 
be gained in the business market. The committee report's </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18186">18186</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>recommendations, particularly at paragraph 27, are important in that regard.</P><P>A 
number of bodies are undertaking much proactive work on the subject of travelling 
to and around Scotland. Given what has been said, it is only fair to quote from 
the letter that all members received from BAA Scotland in the past week. I was 
pleased that Annabel Goldie mentioned that the committee would be returning to 
the matter, as there is more work to be done, and not just by us&#151;there are 
also important matters for Westminster. BAA's letter says:</P><P>&quot;BAA's best 
financial interests, and those we believe of the travelling public, are best served 
by promoting more direct international services&quot;.</P><P>That strikes me as 
an important sentence. We should look to the opportunity there. On the next page 
of its letter, BAA points out all the destinations to which Scottish travellers 
can now fly directly and adds:</P><P>&quot;New routes to begin later this year 
include Barcelona, Cologne and Prague&quot;.</P><P>It strikes me that that should 
be encouraged and enhanced, rather than denigrated.</P><P><strong>Mr Gil Paterson 
(Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Does Tavish Scott agree that it would be of 
advantage to the business community and to everyone in Scotland if BAA were out 
the road? BAA has a monopoly, the effect of which is that the landing charges 
at its Scottish airports are on average 50 times higher than those at its London 
airports?</P><P><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>I refer Mr Paterson to what I have 
just read out:</P><P>&quot;BAA's best financial interests, and those we believe 
of the travelling public, are best served by promoting more direct international 
services&quot;.</P><P>Another important recommendation, to be found at paragraph 
189 and thereafter, is on attracting visitors and relates to internal transport. 
We recommend an evaluation of public service obligations, a subject that is close 
to my heart. I acknowledge that the minister has picked up on that point, but 
I draw to his and the Parliament's attention what a travel company told me the 
other week in a letter. The company takes Americans&#151;a very important market&#151;on 
a bonnie Scotland tour, spending 13 days and 12 nights in Scotland at a cost to 
the individual American of $3,645. The tour includes two nights in Stirling, two 
nights in Kyle of Lochalsh, two nights in Inverness, a night in Kirkwall, two 
nights in Lerwick and back home via Edinburgh. The constraint for that travel 
company is the internal cost of flying around Scotland. That is why I commend 
in particular the committee's recommendation on public service obligations, which 
I hope the minister will consider in consultation with his colleagues.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18187">18187</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The minister referred to the foot-and-mouth outbreak and the events in New 
York in 2001. As colleagues have said, contingency planning is vital, especially 
given the international situation and the importance of the American market to 
Scotland. There is a natural tendency to concentrate on the domestic market, given 
that it accounts for 90 per cent of the visitors to Scotland. However, the USA 
spend of £201 million in 2001 is significant. I encourage the minister to be proactive 
with the appropriate agencies on that issue.</P><P>I commend the report to Parliament 
and encourage colleagues to contribute to a lively debate that is important to 
the future of the Scottish economy.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: 
</strong>I advise members that business must end at 1 o'clock, which will restrict 
the number of speakers whom I am able to call.</P><P>12:15</P><P><strong>Brian 
Fitzpatrick (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Lab): </strong>I echo the words of Annabel 
Goldie and Tavish Scott in thanking the clerk to the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 
Committee, the committee's adviser, those who attended meetings of the committee, 
committee staff and those who took the time to give evidence. The committee has 
provided people with a real opportunity to get into the entrails of the tourism 
industry&#151;to find out exactly what is happening and whether the auguries are 
auspicious.</P><P>I thank the committee convener, from whom I hope we will hear 
at some stage. Obviously there are issues on which we could or should split. It 
pains me to say this, but&#151;compared with the rant that we have heard today 
from the nationalist front bench, especially from Mr MacAskill&#151;Alex Neil 
is often a still small voice of calm. Yesterday, we were told that we should be 
prepared to have a national consensus, but when Kenny MacAskill came into the 
chamber today the mask slipped. We might have been more impressed if Mr MacAskill 
had made a submission to the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, of which 
he is no longer a member. There was a problem with his attendance record at committee 
meetings, but we are pleased to see that he is present for today's debate.</P><P>Tourism 
should not be allowed to become the subject of party-political spats. It is one 
of our largest and fastest-growing industries. It generates £4 billion annually 
and employs 8 per cent of the work force&#151;more than the oil, gas and whisky 
industries combined. It is crucial to our economic and cultural well-being and 
will be of growing importance to the economy. We must all bear in mind the labour 
intensiveness of the industry and </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18188">18188</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>its purpose and function as a creator of wealth and jobs. We have great assets&#151;culturally, 
in our cities, in our people, in our scenery, in our history and in our welcome. 
We must ensure that we get best value out of those for the industry throughout 
Scotland.</P><P>As has been mentioned, a companion exercise to our inquiry was 
undertaken by the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which scrutinises 
the work of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Its inquiry, like ours, 
was spurred on by the effects on tourism both of foot-and-mouth disease and of 
the events of 11 September 2001. The committee's report was published on 4 February 
and it is interesting to compare it with the report of the Enterprise and Lifelong 
Learning Committee. Both inquiries were conducted independently, but they have 
reached substantially the same conclusions on a number of key points. I take some 
pleasure from that, as it shows that we are probably travelling along the right 
rail tracks.</P><P>In our report, we probably did not quite capture the diversity 
of businesses in the tourism industry. We need to discuss more broadly what tourism 
is. Is it a discrete, distinct business, or is it an amalgam of businesses? We 
also need to consider the diversity of our visitors&#151;why they come, how they 
come and what they come for&#151;and the diversity of places in Scotland. It is 
hard to distil those issues into the text of a committee report, but members did 
their best to capture the flavour of what is available in Scotland.</P><P>As I 
mentioned, the report covers the impact of foot-and-mouth disease and 11 September. 
We do not have time for victory laps, but we concluded that Government action 
had helped the industry to deal with those crises. Although nothing good could 
have come from either of them, it is clear that they raised the profile of tourism 
in the Government, in the media and across the country. A spotlight was shone 
on structural problems in the support for tourism. The challenges of recovery 
must be met and the report contains some recommendations for doing so.</P><P>In 
the Culture, Media and Sport Committee's report, it is accepted that there was 
unsatisfactory consultation on the merger of the BTA and the English Tourism Council. 
SNP members should read what a number of members of the Westminster committee 
said about the consultation that took place on the issue. They should also read 
what the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport said to the Culture, Media and 
Sport Committee. If, for a moment, we can get out of the trenches and seek solutions, 
we will do the industry the kind of service that it deserves from the Parliament.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18189">18189</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>12:20</P><P><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP): </strong>As a 
member of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, I support the report's 
key recommendations. I acknowledge the need to further develop and strengthen 
the tourism industry. Naturally, the committee tended to focus on tourism matters 
that are within the remit of the Scottish Parliament, but it would be idle to 
pretend that reserved issues are not of vital interest to the future of the Scottish 
tourism industry. Westminster controls the exchange rate policy and a whole swathe 
of fiscal policy from fuel tax to air passenger duty to VAT. At their current 
levels, those all have a major impact in putting up the price of the Scottish 
tourism product and in reducing the competitiveness of our industry in the international 
marketplace.</P><P>Action to cut VAT on hotel accommodation is long overdue. All 
the research shows that, in a highly prized, sensitive industry such as tourism, 
there is a clear negative correlation between high VAT and consumer demand. With 
VAT on hotel accommodation more than double the European Union average of 8 per 
cent, the UK is the odd man out in Europe. If the Scottish Parliament had the 
powers, it could follow the Irish example. Cuts in VAT that were introduced in 
the late 1980s, together with other initiatives, quadrupled tourism revenues in 
Ireland.</P><P>Perhaps the most impressive part of the report is the internal 
research that was conducted by Stevens and Associates, which identifies lessons 
to be learned from comparable competitor countries that are performing much better 
than Scotland. The clear message from that research is that strategic intervention 
and leadership on the part of the Government combined with a fully engaged private 
sector are critical for success. I suggest that we still have a long way to go 
in that respect.</P><P>For example, our Burns heritage is a key part of Scotland's 
brand image. A year or two ago, Allan Wilson suggested that Burns promotion was 
to be a major focus for Executive action. I assume that he was not talking about 
putting up statues. However, I have seen little or no action apart from the setting 
up of a small-scale Burns festival in Ayrshire. In the meantime, the Burns museum 
and visitor centre project in Alloway is being endlessly delayed as funding applications 
grind through the system and the definitive collection of Burns artefacts deteriorates 
for want of appropriate accommodation. There is not much evidence of joined-up 
working within the Executive in that instance.</P><P>Still wearing my Ayrshire 
hat, I emphasise the importance of developing direct air links to provide easy 
access to Scotland for international visitors </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18190">18190</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>and I highlight the continuing success of Prestwick airport in attracting low-cost 
operators to do that. I trust that the Executive and its agencies will not stint 
in offering any support that is required to build on that success.</P><P>12:23</P><P><strong>Mary 
Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con): </strong>I welcome the committee's report. 
As an economist, I was drawn to specific figures in paragraph 58 of the report. 
I was alarmed at the reduction in tourism in Scotland between 1997 and 2001. The 
minister talked about the situation in 2002&#151;perhaps the figures have improved, 
but I can judge only by what is in the report.</P><P>In 1997, there were 23.3 
million trips to Scotland; in 2001, there were only 19.1 million. In 1997, there 
were 97.3 million nights' accommodation in Scotland; in 2001, there were only 
78.2 million. In 1997, tourism expenditure in Scotland was around £5 billion; 
in 2001, it was down to around £4 billion. This week, the Scottish Tourism Forum's 
manifesto confirmed that there was a decline of 24 per cent in the number of overseas 
visitors to Scotland between 1997 and 2001, along with a 21 per cent loss of spend 
in that period. I am, therefore, delighted to speak in the debate, as I think 
that the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee's report has come not a moment 
too soon.</P><P><strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: </strong>The committee acknowledged 
the challenges, but we also have to acknowledge the good things that are going 
on. In the past four years, Greater Glasgow and Clyde Valley Tourist Board has 
increased its annual convention sales by more than 200 per cent. We must acknowledge 
the good things that are going on and consider how we can encourage and support 
them. I hope that Mary Scanlon will agree with me on that.</P><P><strong>Mary 
Scanlon: </strong>Yes, I certainly welcome any increase. However, Mr Fitzpatrick's 
statistic emphasises the problem&#151;if business tourism in Glasgow is going 
up by 200 per cent while the overall decline in Scotland is 24 per cent, we must 
ask what is happening in constituencies such as Jamie Stone's and elsewhere. If 
the average reduction is 24 per cent but there is a 200 per cent increase in Glasgow, 
there are serious problems outwith Glasgow and Edinburgh.</P><P>Paragraph 104 
of the report says of Estonia and Slovenia:</P><P>&quot;Both countries saw an 
increase of around 25% in 2000 compared to the previous year.&quot;</P><P>It continues:</P><P>&quot;Scotland 
on the other hand, experienced the largest decline in ITAs&quot;&#151;</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18191">18191</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>international tourist arrivals&#151;</P><P>&quot;of 11% in 2000&quot;.</P><P>We 
certainly need to work together to do something about that.</P><P>An issue that 
is guaranteed to infuriate people living in the Highlands is extortionate air 
fares, particularly those for going to the Highlands. Things have improved in 
recent years, but when airlines advertise seats at £29, for example, they do not 
always tell people that the price applies only to a few seats, which must be booked 
months in advance. I note that the committee report states that low-cost airlines 
have</P><P>&quot;created a new dynamism within tourism.&quot;</P><P>I acknowledge 
what members have said about PSOs, particularly the PSO that safeguards the air 
link from Inverness to London. Given that tourism contributes to more than 11 
per cent of employment in the Highlands, the recommendation that the Minister 
for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning should aid HIAL is fitting.</P><P>I 
have prepared so much but I do not have enough time.</P><P>There was great enthusiasm 
for doing business with Ryanair because all its seats are cheap and the airline 
would give people in the Highlands the same access to cheap flights as is available 
to people in cities elsewhere in Scotland.</P><P>I will leave the issue of HIAL 
just now by saying that the problem always was that HIAL cried for more subsidies. 
However, I bring to the minister's attention a farmer in Orkney called Andrew 
Banks, who bought a second-hand Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, built two piers, offered 
cheaper trips to and from Orkney and, as a result, increased tourism enormously 
there and gave local people the opportunity to visit the mainland at a reasonable 
price. That example shows the difference between public organisations waiting 
for more subsidies before doing anything and a true entrepreneur working to benefit 
his business and his community of Orkney and the Highlands. The difference could 
not be starker.</P><P>12:28</P><P><strong>Maureen Macmillan (Highlands and Islands) 
(Lab): </strong>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate. I congratulate 
the members and the clerks of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee on 
the report. I am particularly pleased that the committee took the opportunity 
to get out and about. The committee visited Shetland&#151;I hope that that visit 
was as enjoyable as the visit to California was. I am sure that the Shetlanders 
were delighted to host the committee and to make their views known. I have never 
visited California, </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18192">18192</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>but I have often been to Shetland and I am always delighted to be there.</P><P>I 
am pleased that the committee recommended re-examining the PFI contract for Inverness 
airport, which inhibits the development of budget routes. I ask the minister to 
explore that matter seriously, although I realise, as the SNP obviously does not, 
that contracts cannot be changed just by waving a magic wand at them. However, 
attracting new direct air services to the Highlands and Islands is one of the 
keys to the development of tourism. The air industry has experienced turbulence 
lately, but there is still an appetite for flying. However, the downturn in transatlantic 
travel is well documented and the current international situation will not improve 
matters.</P><P><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing: </strong>Maureen Macmillan referred 
to direct links. Does she realise that, since easyJet started its service from 
Inverness to Gatwick on 5 February, it has carried 1,000 passengers? The difficulty 
with the PFI is that other airlines that would be interested in coming to Inverness 
cannot negotiate appropriate terms.</P><P><strong>Maureen Macmillan: </strong>Yes, 
I realise that, which is why I asked the minister to consider seriously whether 
the contract could be changed. However, as I said, a contract cannot be changed 
just by waving a magic wand at it.</P><P>For the Highlands and Islands, the Inverness 
to Gatwick link is key. In our submission to the consultation exercise on air 
transport, Rhoda Grant, Peter Peacock and I made the case for retaining the link 
and asked for the imposition of a PSO. I hope that ministers at Westminster will 
give the matter full consideration. I know that the Scottish Executive backs us. 
Moreover, as Margaret Ewing said, we must be able to persuade budget airlines 
to operate out of Inverness as frequently and on as many routes as possible.</P><P>In 
all the debates on tourism, the same issues seem to crop up. At yesterday's meeting 
of the cross-party group on tourism, the Scottish Tourism Forum expressed concerns 
that there is not enough profit in the industry to fund training, which, in turn, 
affects the quality of service that can be provided&#151;small profit margins 
mean that quality is cut and that refurbishment is put off for later years. The 
Scottish Tourism Forum would like VAT on tourism businesses to be reduced. Perhaps 
the minister could raise that issue with Westminster colleagues.</P><P>Some of 
the most effective marketing is done by word of mouth. The converse of that is 
that, if people have a bad experience, they will pass that information on to friends 
and family. Quality, therefore, has to be improved and I hope that the Executive 
will seriously consider compulsory </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18193">18193</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>registration on licensing. Although education and training is one way of driving 
up standards, we might be getting to the point at which compulsory registration 
is the only way in which to ensure a step change in quality and standards so that 
Scotland does not lag behind other areas. The Scottish Tourism Forum would like 
a common quality standard across Scotland and the UK.</P><P>The report makes important 
recommendations with regard to the Executive's strategy and targets. Evaluating 
the effectiveness of VisitScotland's marketing is important and I know that the 
Highlands of Scotland Tourist Board is keen that there should be greater integration 
of marketing between it and VisitScotland. Marketing makes a difference and I 
am confident that VisitScotland is focusing on the right targets, such as ancestral 
Scotland.</P><P>With the current international climate, there is a critical need 
to encourage the English, Welsh and Irish to holiday in Scotland and Scots to 
holiday at home. I know that VisitScotland has turned its attention to the matter.</P><P>We 
must capitalise on Scotland's assets and recognise the importance of the tourism 
industry to Scotland. Communities that are dependent on the industry for income 
need to view tourism more as a community activity than as something that is of 
interest only to individual businesses. There should be more community-based TICs.</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> I have to hurry you.</P><P><strong>Maureen 
Macmillan:</strong> I have great optimism for the future of tourism in Scotland 
and I am sure that it will be an important factor for many years to come.</P><P>12:33</P><P><strong>John 
Farquhar Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West) (LD): </strong>I am pleased to 
be taking part in a debate on tourism. There is no doubt that tourism in all its 
forms is a major part of the Scottish economy. That was clearly demonstrated by 
the critical decline in visitor numbers into the UK, particularly Scotland, which 
was aggravated by the events of 11 September 2001 and by the restrictions imposed 
throughout much of the country in the attempt to control the spread of foot-and-mouth 
disease. Many tourism businesses and those related to them struggled to survive 
at that time; only by their hard work, determination and willingness to adapt 
to the changing circumstances were they able to continue in business.</P><P><strong>Fergus 
Ewing: </strong>Does John Farquhar Munro agree that one problem for businesses 
in the Highlands, particularly in Inverness, is the burden </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18194">18194</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>that is placed on them by high business rates? The Forum of Private Business 
argues that rateable values of hotel premises are higher in Scotland than they 
are in England. Does the member agree that that serious burden must be addressed?</P><P><strong>John 
Farquhar Munro: </strong>I agree that the rates burden is a significant element 
of the problem. I am glad that the report suggests that the rates burden could 
be reduced considerably. I am sure that that would be good news.</P><P>As I was 
saying, and as others have said this morning, Scotland has a unique experience 
to offer, which could and should be promoted on the world stage. Much has been 
done but more needs to be done to ensure that we have a vibrant and viable tourism 
industry, which is essential&#151;I do not think that anyone would argue with 
that.</P><P>I accept that the BTA continues to promote the UK as a tourist destination. 
However, we have our own agency in VisitScotland, which has been tasked with attracting 
visitors to Scotland. It must be given the support and resources to promote Scotland 
not only in the United Kingdom and Europe, but worldwide. VisitScotland has the 
relevant experience and capability and, in my opinion, is best suited to undertake 
that function on our behalf. It should not be under the direct control of the 
BTA.</P><P>The BTA and travel agents must be made aware that Scotland has its 
own identity on the world map. We have excellent airport facilities, which can 
be accessed from all major international airports. Visitors to Scotland do not 
have to be directed through London Heathrow, as tends to happen currently. I have 
talked before about all the difficulties that that creates for increasing the 
number of visitors to Scotland. Our peripheral airports are capable of accepting 
increased traffic, so let us promote that.</P><P>As we develop all sections of 
our tourism industry, let us make sure that our tourists enjoy their visits and 
that their experience of Scotland is unique. That is how we should promote our 
industry. We should extend an invitation and welcome to the world at large and 
say that Scotland is now the place to visit.</P><P>12:37</P><P><strong>Gordon 
Jackson (Glasgow Govan) (Lab): </strong>Any strategy to improve our tourism industry 
will have to operate on at least two levels. We have to improve the product and 
to take a hard look at, for example, quality control and the proper development 
of skills. I am not entirely sure that the committee got to grips with that properly.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18195">18195</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>We must also be clear about how we market Scotland as the product&#151;it was 
in that context that Alex Neil and I made the much talked about visit to California. 
I say right away that that visit was tough. We learnt a great deal from visiting 
the British Tourist Authority and other marketing agencies that Scotland has out 
there and we were also able to consider some set-ups that market California's 
local facilities in the United States and internationally. We did that in Pasadena, 
we saw the Californian state set-up in Sacramento and we were able to go to the 
San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau. Those operations were all different 
but they were all there to market either a city or the state of California. It 
is fair to say that we were impressed on each occasion. Even making allowances 
for the the-grass-is-always-greener syndrome, we felt that there was something 
to learn from each of the operations that we considered.</P><P>Alex Neil and I 
often disagree, but today Annabel Goldie moved a motion in Alex Neil's name and 
if that is the sort of day we are having, Alex Neil and I can agree about one 
thing that stood out from the trip. We might disagree about the role of the private 
sector in some contexts, but we agreed totally that the main lesson from each 
visit was the pivotal role of the private sector and industry. That has been mentioned 
by David Davidson and other speakers and it appears at the beginning of our key 
recommendations on the first page of the report&#151;that is how important the 
committee thought the issue was.</P><P>The importance of the private sector was 
reflected in the structures of the local organisations, which were designed to 
maximise the ideal of working together; it was interesting to see how that is 
done. The structure of the California state operation in Sacramento is innovative 
and demands a much longer discussion than we have time for now, but the success 
of the operation was not just about its structure, but about attitudes. That applies 
equally to the industry and the Government.</P><P>What we saw was a real sense 
of partnership and shared common interest and purpose. Indeed, the overwhelming 
impression was not only that the private sector is truly and genuinely involved, 
but that it is actually driving the process. We got the impression that that partnership 
and emphasis is vital. I know that that is understood here. Not only is Peter 
Lederer chairman of VisitScotland, he is a major figure in the industry. I looked 
again at his evidence and he understood clearly that the partnership must work 
properly and is committed to that. I also got the clear impression that he accepts 
that there have been weaknesses. I could read what he said. I do not really have 
time&#151;</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> Do not.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18196">18196</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Gordon Jackson: </strong>He said:</P><P>&quot;The industry must speak 
with fewer voices and pull together&quot;.&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Enterprise 
and Lifelong Learning Committee</em>, 11 December 2002; c 3011.]</P><P>He was 
prepared to be critical of his own industry, but there are two sides to that, 
and I would perhaps be more balanced than he was. The industry might not be properly 
engaging with its problems but, on the other hand, it is important that Government 
agencies do not just consult the industry; rather, they must include it properly 
as a main driving force in the process. It is not just about changing the structure&#151;we 
must ensure that expertise and commitment are properly harnessed.</P><P>The industry 
must be involved in marketing not only its own hotels and businesses, but in marketing 
Scotland, because the two are not mutually exclusive. The Government must put 
in place structures&#151;the committee recommended this&#151;that will ensure 
that the industry is brought into the process. Alex Neil and I tried to emphasise 
commonality of interest following our visit.</P><P>12:41</P><P><strong>Mr Andrew 
Welsh (Angus) (SNP): </strong>Tourism is a key contributor to the Scottish economy, 
Deputy Speaker&#151;I am sorry; old habits die hard. I meant to say &quot;Deputy 
Presiding Officer&quot;. Despite an increasing budget for VisitScotland, Scottish 
tourism has declined in terms of visitor numbers and revenue since 1997. Given 
the industry's significance to the Scottish economy, that is clearly a worrying 
trend.</P><P>I congratulate the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee on 
addressing those problems and I welcome the recommendations on setting targets 
for attracting international and domestic tourists, attracting new direct air 
services and improving business tourism. Although those form a basis for progress, 
a great deal more will be needed to develop the cutting-edge tourism policy that 
is required to turn round the fortunes of this sleeping giant of an industry.</P><P>We 
must, in building for the future, fully utilise the latest technology. An estimated 
9.3 per cent of the world's population are currently online, and online travel 
is one of the fastest growing areas of the travel industry. Over the past 12 months, 
nearly 30 per cent of UK internet users have gone online to access travel routes. 
In addition, 94 per cent of Ryanair ticket sales are made on the internet and 
easyJet makes about half of its bookings via the internet. Indeed, online travel 
sales are predicted to reach a total of $29 billion by 2003.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18197">18197</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Scotland must be in there as a major player. How will the Government ensure 
that Scottish small and medium-sized enterprises are not simply squeezed out by 
major conglomerates and tour operators? How will e-tourism allow native Scots 
businesses to build up individual tourism enterprises and locally based projects, 
such as Pictavia in Angus, Seafest in Arbroath and other initiatives? Scotland 
must be in there as a major player.</P><P>I ask the minister to address those 
points today, and also to address the issue of how technology can overcome the 
massive language skills deficit in the Scottish hotel industry. One survey showed 
that 97 per cent of hotel staff could not answer a question in French or German. 
Such basic language skills are an essential part of a welcoming and helpful approach. 
That issue was ducked by the minister in his opening speech, but it must be addressed.</P><P>I 
am happy to note that already, some e-commerce initiatives are solidly coming 
through. This week, through ScottishGolf.com's &quot;tee-time&quot; booking system, 
any golfer anywhere in the world can book a time and pay a deposit through a secure 
internet connection, then all they have to do is turn up on the day and enjoy 
a round of golf. That system will soon incorporate courses all over the country. 
Using the internet to book golf tee times is just one example of how e-tourism 
should be utilised. There is nowhere better to do that than on the tremendous 
range of golf courses in Angus.</P><P>The vsitsotland.com venture is a welcome 
development in Scottish tourism, but we must now ensure that it is developed ahead 
of competitor destination sites. We in Scotland know that we have a product that 
most other countries envy. The key question is about how to market it properly 
and that is the question that the committee's report asks. Marketing the product 
properly is the task of those who will act on the report.</P><P><strong>The Deputy 
Presiding Officer: </strong>I am obliged to two members who have removed their 
names from the list of speakers. We are still running behind time. Iain Smith 
has four minutes; I ask him to keep his speech tight.</P><P>12:45</P><P><strong>Iain 
Smith (North-East Fife) (LD): </strong>No one can dispute the tourism industry's 
importance to Scotland for its economic contribution and the jobs that it creates. 
Furthermore, no one can dispute that the tourism industry has suffered from a 
decline in recent years.</P><P>It is important to bear it in mind that we tend 
to focus greatly on the overseas tourism market and that we sometimes forget that 
domestic tourism </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18198">18198</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>has the biggest share of the market and is its most important part. The domestic 
market supplies 90 per cent of our visitors and 80 per cent of tourism income. 
It is obvious that a 1 per cent increase in the domestic market could be matched 
only by a 5 per cent increase in the overseas market. It is important not to forget 
that.</P><P>Short breaks&#151;particularly those that are taken by older people 
and people who take early retirement&#151;are an important part of the tourism 
business. Some concern must be felt about their future, given the state of the 
pensions industry. Many of our businesses are also concerned about the trend of 
booking later, which causes them great uncertainty about the season ahead.</P><P>I 
come from north-east Fife, so I must refer to the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 
Committee's important visit to St Andrews to study golf and business tourism. 
The tourism businesses in St Andrews greatly welcomed that visit and the useful 
exchange that they had with committee members. Perhaps a little disappointment 
was felt at that study's not being reflected much in the report's recommendations, 
but the visit highlighted important matters.</P><P>I am sorry to say to Andrew 
Welsh that the Old course in St Andrews is the course that attracts visitors to 
Scotland. In places such as Carnoustie and Troon, people say that when the Old 
course is closed for maintenance or before the Open Championship, their businesses 
suffer. We should therefore recognise the Old course's importance to golf tourism 
marketing and the importance of encouraging golf tourists to visit and play on 
many of the hundreds of excellent golf courses throughout Scotland.</P><P>I am 
slightly disappointed that the result of the area tourist boards review is not 
yet known. That is causing uncertainty and concern in the industry. Those boards 
are important parts of the industry and are business led&#151;the majority of 
board members are business people. The boards are not just accommodation agencies. 
As the committee's report says, the boards should reflect the interests of the 
retail, transport and visitor attraction sectors.</P><P>Transport links are vital. 
In the past year, we have welcomed the Rosyth ferry, which has increased tourism. 
Tourism businesses have seen car-based overseas tourists come to Scotland and 
travel not just in Fife, but as far as the Borders and the Highlands, although 
Fife has benefited from the ferry. I am pleased that, as part of its partnership 
with other tourist boards, the Kingdom of Fife Tourist Board has attracted £4.1 
million of European money to help to market tourism in some parts of Scotland. 
That will be used to attract up to an estimated £100 million of new tourism business.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18199">18199</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>The member has one minute.</P><P><strong>Iain 
Smith: </strong>That is an example of tourist boards working well together to 
attract money that might not be available from Government agencies. That is an 
important part of the tourist board network's role.</P><P>We must improve transport 
links and the quality of transport throughout Scotland. The links to Glasgow and 
Edinburgh airports are vital, but why should people have to go through Edinburgh 
to visit Fife? That is nonsense and must be sorted out. We must improve the integration 
of transport through the use of multimodal tickets and we must ensure that visitors 
to Scotland can buy travel passes that allow them to travel on any form of transport 
at a reasonable cost. That is all part of improving the quality of the service.</P><P>If 
we are to attract more visitors to Scotland, we must continuously improve the 
quality of the tourism product that we offer&#151;that means not only accommodation, 
but attractions and packages. We must also examine the industry's competitiveness. 
We should note that many tourism businesses are small and locally based. They 
will benefit from the small business rates relief scheme that is to be introduced, 
but we must consider the fact that VAT on hospitality services in Ireland is only 
5 per cent, which puts our businesses at a competitive disadvantage.</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I must hurry the member.</P><P><strong>Iain 
Smith: </strong>We must also consider the euro. We should be in the euro, which 
would help our tourism businesses. As the report recommends, we must also do all 
that we can to assist Scottish tourism businesses in using the euro.</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I do not know about the principle of introducing 
entirely new material after a member's time is up, but there we go.</P><P>12:50</P><P><strong>David 
Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>I would like to ensure that the <em>Official 
Report</em> records the fact that I had the most glamorous assignment of all of 
the members of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee. I was sent not 
to California or Denmark and I was sent not even to St Andrews&#151;I was sent 
to VisitScotland's headquarters in Ravelston Terrace for a day. However, that 
visit gave us an opportunity to analyse material on visitscotland.com, which has 
been highlighted today as being a very important initiative. I hope that the recommendations 
in the report in that respect will be followed through so that the website is 
monitored to allow us to </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18200">18200</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>discover how much real new business&#151;not displacement business&#151;is 
generated by visitscotland.com. Many people out there have reservations about 
visitscotland.com, particularly small accommodation providers.</P><P>I agree with 
Tavish Scott that it is very disappointing that the minister's announcement&#151;or 
non-announcement&#151;overshadows the debate, because the review of the area tourist 
boards has been under way for a considerable time. We have heard today how important 
business and business leadership is to tourism. One thing about business is that 
it knows that it has to make hard decisions, some of which are unpopular, but 
business does not bottle out of making decisions just because it thinks that the 
decision might attract electoral flak.</P><P>I understand why the deputy minister 
does not want to have to go around defending a decision to abolish Dumfries and 
Galloway Tourist Board and to merge it into a larger board based in Glasgow, if 
that is to be the decision, but why not tell the Parliament the decision and allow 
the tourism industry to debate its future during the election period?</P><P><strong>Fergus 
Ewing: </strong>Will the member give way?</P><P><strong>David Mundell:</strong> 
I am sorry but I am very short of time.</P><P>I was very disappointed by the tone 
of Mr MacAskill's remarks, although they did not surprise me. Most of the things 
that he has said in the chamber on previous occasions could not be substantiated 
by the committee's inquiries. Mr MacAskill has come to the chamber time after 
time to slate the BTA, but the evidence that the committee took did not substantiate 
what he says.</P><P>The committee was, however, prepared to address the issues 
around, and the serious concerns about, the British Airports Authority. Rather 
than engage in a rant against individuals, we put forward the reasoned position 
that the BAA should be inquired into so that we get at the facts, but Mr MacAskill 
does not like the facts and neither does he like the committee system, hence his 
appearance at the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee only as a tourist 
rather than as a substantial member. He does not like inquiring into the facts, 
because they do not back up his rants.</P><P>One of the most important aspects 
of the report, although I am disappointed that it does not appear at the beginning 
as a key recommendation, is that Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands 
Enterprise funding be co-ordinated within our tourism strategy. The reality is 
that funding for tourism from Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise 
is considerably greater than VisitScotland's budget. If those budgets are not 
co-ordinated, we will be missing a trick. I would </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18201">18201</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>like to see that important recommendation followed through.</P><P>At the end 
of the day, we must acknowledge the importance of tourism, as Annabel Goldie did 
in her opening remarks. Everybody says that tourism is important, but it is the 
most important indigenous business in Scotland and we must start proving that 
that is the case. The report is a good opening to that process, but we have to 
follow it through.</P><P>12:54</P><P><strong>Alasdair Morgan (Galloway and Upper 
Nithsdale) (SNP): </strong>First, on a local note, my constituency and Dumfries 
suffered more than other areas from the decline in tourism that resulted from 
foot-and-mouth disease. The local tourist board made excellent use of the money 
that it was given; it ran an excellent campaign to get visitors back to the region.</P><P>Given 
that tourism is a major industry, it is clear that some of the figures in the 
report are not encouraging. The recent figures that Grant Thornton Ltd published 
also show a 143 per cent increase over the past year in insolvencies in tourism-related 
hotels and catering businesses. My friend Fergus Ewing spoke about the rating 
system and the differential burden that we have in Scotland, which might be relevant 
to that issue.</P><P>Mr Mundell referred to the enterprise network. I note the 
committee's recommendation in paragraph 361 of the report that the enterprise 
network's contribution to tourism should be &quot;consistent.&quot; I highlight 
that paragraph because I have been receiving complaints about differences in the 
treatment that is offered by different local enterprise companies, and especially 
about differences between that which is offered by Highlands and Island Enterprise 
and Scottish Enterprise. It is suggested that the former is much more flexible 
in its approach to helping out tourism development, although I do not know why 
that should be the case. It is clear that tourism is not simply a Highlands and 
Islands activity, although some people might think that it is. It is not even 
simply a rural activity because, as we have heard, city tourism is just as important, 
if not more so. We need, therefore, a consistent approach. The relationships between 
area tourist boards are clearly a difficult matter; there are tensions between 
membership organisations&#151;perhaps this applies only to some members of the 
industry&#151;and an organisation that has quasi-public duties. Any mechanism 
must have the industry at its heart.</P><P>Many people find it easy to see what 
is wrong with the current system but, as I am sure the minister is finding out, 
it is much less easy to come </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18202">18202</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>up with a better alternative. Boundary changes would not necessarily be the 
answer, and Mr Mundell made a valid point about the Dumfries and Galloway Tourist 
Board.</P><P>Uncertainty is bad, so we need to conclude the review. It is a bizarre 
argument to say that we should not discuss the review before or during an election 
campaign&#151;such discussion is what democracy is all about. If we were to extend 
that principle to other areas, we would be in for a very quiet election campaign.</P><P>I 
welcome the development of electronic marketing of tourism, because we in Scotland 
are clearly in danger of falling behind. The report refers to some initial difficulties 
in Dumfries and Galloway, which I think are largely down to a lack of communication. 
The vast majority of businesses in my region have now signed up to the idea to 
some extent. However, I am concerned that we still do not have a go-live date 
for the public version of the new website, which is important given that we are 
already into the season in which people make bookings over the internet. I am 
also not convinced that e-tourism will reduce work for tourist information centres&#151;the 
two are complementary, rather than being alternatives to each other.</P><P>On 
the BTA, regardless of what has been said in the chamber, there is a fundamental 
incompatibility in one organisation trying to market two competing products. I 
think that that is unsustainable.</P><P>My final point is on skills. Tourism was 
the cinderella industry, but there have been changes made to increase its professionalism. 
I was worried by David Davidson's point that the teaching placement scheme still 
does not regard tourism as an industry. It is shocking that that attitude should 
still prevail. Tourism is a hugely important industry and I hope that the report 
will contribute to increasing its success.</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: 
</strong>Because of the business motion under which I am operating, I must have 
Alex Neil on his feet by 1 o'clock, so I call him now, and thank those members 
who co-operated in allowing this to happen.</P><P>12:58</P><P><strong>Alex Neil 
(Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>It is an indication of the success of today's 
debate that Brian Fitzpatrick has joined the SNP benches for the final speech.</P><P>I 
begin my reiterating and reinforcing the &quot;thank yous&quot; that Annabel Goldie 
read out at the start of the debate and I supplement them with three of my own. 
First, I thank Annabel Goldie for calling me gallant, which is the first and probably 
the last </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18203">18203</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>time when that will happen. Secondly, I thank Brian Fitzpatrick for saying 
that I am a calming influence. That is certainly the first time, and probably 
the last time when I shall be called that. Thirdly, in relation to the visit to 
Shetland, I thank Tavish Scott and Shetland Islands Council, which provided excellent 
hospitality. I got a feeling for Up Helly Aa.</P><P>I shall concentrate on two 
or three key issues. I say quickly, by way of background, that the inquiry took 
place about a year after the committee was being put under enormous pressure to 
hold the inquiry during a time of crisis&#151;if I can call it that&#151;in the 
Scottish Tourist Board, which was undergoing a change of chief executive and suffered 
the resignation of the new chief executive. The committee took a clear decision 
not to hold an inquiry at that time.</P><P>The purpose of our inquiry was not 
to hammer a nail into the coffin of the Scottish Tourist Board, to run down Scotland, 
to reinforce failure or to get a cheap headline. Instead, the purpose of a parliamentary 
committee is to examine a subject's long-term future. In this case it was the 
tourism industry&#151;we had to find out where we need to be in four, five or 
10 years and we had to consider our position in the international tourism market.</P><P>We 
are all aware of the problems of the past four or five years, such as the reduction 
in tourist numbers, the additional problems that were caused by the events of 
11 September 2001 and other unforeseen circumstances, such as foot-and-mouth disease. 
However, the challenge to us all is not to sit moaning and groaning and wondering 
why all of this has happened; instead, we must look to the future and do something 
about the situation. The tourism industry in Scotland has enormous potential.</P><P>Last 
year, I did a calculation&#151;on my own, believe it or not&#151;based on Ireland's 
overseas visitor numbers, which include visitors from the UK mainland. If Scotland 
had the same overseas visitor numbers as the Irish, that would inject an additional 
£1 billion a year into the Scottish economy. That is the scale of the opportunity 
that is open to us through the tourism sector. So, the key question is: what do 
we need to do to get from where we are to where we want to be?</P><P>The committee 
report addresses three fundamental strategic issues in that respect. First, as 
the independent research that the committee commissioned concluded, it is high 
time that we stopped contemplating our internal navel over the Mason-Dixon lines 
between this area tourist board and that area tourist board. To be quite frank, 
tourists from Germany, Norway, America and Canada could not care less about where 
the boundary lies between this toon and that toon in area tourist board terms&#151;they 
want to visit </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18204">18204</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Scotland. They want to have the experience of coming to this country to see 
the scenery, meet its people, enjoy their ancestry and all the rest of it. The 
first clear message has to be that we should look outward, rather than inward. 
Our future lies in beating the competition in the international marketplace, not 
in examining our internal structures for ever and a day.</P><P>However, the question 
thereafter is how we can best promote Scotland. There has been a lot of discussion 
about the BTA. No doubt there is concern south of the border&#151;as there is 
north of the border&#151;about the way in which the Department for Media, Culture 
and Sport south of the border failed to consult on the recent changes and simply 
implemented them. Indeed, there is much concern about that among MPs in London 
whose report called for the establishment of an English tourism board. I support 
that proposal: England needs its own tourism board, but there must be a consequential 
change to the BTA's role.</P><P>We are simply saying&#151;the BTA agrees&#151;that 
we are not getting the benefits of the resources that have been invested in some 
hub offices to the extent that we could and should. VisitScotland needs urgently 
to piggyback on that resource much more than it is by putting its Scottish focus 
into those offices and promoting Scotland. If Gordon Jackson was able to promote 
to me the benefits of the private sector while we were in California, I at least 
got him to agree that, on the question of a Scottish focus, he was a nationalist. 
Indeed, he agreed with everything that the SNP said on that point. That was a 
real conversion.</P><P>Our proposal is very practical. Of course, it has budgetary 
implications, because there would be staff involved; however, perhaps only one 
person and a secretary is all that is needed. After all, the other resources already 
exist&#151;we simply need a Scottish focus.</P><P>David Mundell and I took evidence 
from Eddie Friel, who used to run the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and now runs 
the Glasgow Tourist Board. Mr Friel was Northern Ireland's man in America at the 
time of the hunger strikes. During the year in which the hunger strike deaths 
happened, tourism to Northern Ireland from north America jumped by about 10 per 
cent. Eddie Friel went into the BTA office in New York as a Northern Ireland representative. 
He piggybacked on the research that had been done, but he put a Northern Ireland 
focus on it, as a result of which he was able to promote Northern Ireland. At 
that time, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board was much more independent than the 
Scottish Tourist Board.</P><P>There is a possible case for VisitScotland to have 
its own representation in some markets where the BTA has no representation&#151;it 
is horses for courses. It is like running any business; one </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18205">18205</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>sends the sales and marketing people to where they can generate the most interest.</P><P>The 
second major point that I want to make before I wind up is on transport links. 
There is no doubt whatever that one of the two fundamental prerequisites to realising 
potential is encouragement of the growth of low-cost airlines. Some 80 per cent 
of the people coming to Scotland from Oslo are Norwegian. I know and others know 
that&#151;we see them in the pubs in Ayr and even in Prestwick every weekend, 
Presiding Officer. They come from Norway for the cheap drink. It is £8 a pint 
in Oslo, but it is £2.50 a pint in Ayr and probably £1.50 in the Labour club in 
Allison Street. It is a lot cheaper for them to spend forty quid getting into 
Ayr for the weekend from Oslo and save a bob or two on drink. We are talking about 
tourists to Scotland spending money in Scotland.</P><P>I will be clear about what 
the committee is saying about BAA. It says that there is on the face of it, based 
on the evidence that we received, a prima facie case&#151;as the Latin people 
used to say&#151;for an inquiry into the monopolistic position of BAA. It does 
not have only one monopoly; it has two monopolies. It has a monopoly in Scotland 
and a monopoly in London. On the basis of the evidence, the combination of those 
monopolies might present the problem. We suggest that there needs to be a thorough 
inquiry, but BAA is coming back to us and saying that it is not true; however, 
if members owned a monopoly company, they would say the same. Unfortunately, monopoly 
and competition are&#151;temporarily, I hope&#151;reserved matters. Therefore, 
it is up to the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee or whatever 
to investigate the matter, but it must be investigated. Our tourism industry is 
too important for the future of Scotland for us to continue to receive only a 
fifth of the number of flights that Dublin receives, for example.</P><P>This has 
been just a sketched conclusion of our report. I hope that the minister will take 
decisions based on our report. I do not care whether that happens before the election 
or whether someone else takes them after the election&#151;as long as our report 
is implemented, the Scottish tourism industry will flourish.</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I should have stopped that speech earlier, 
but I sensed that people were enjoying it.</P><P>The next item of business would 
ordinarily be the business motion, but as members will be aware, this week's business 
motion was taken yesterday. Therefore, there is no more business.</P><P>13:08</P><P><em>Meeting

are required? After all, swimming is one subject on the curriculum that could 
save a life.</P><P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I agree with Kay Ullrich. That 
figure of 25 per cent or more is unacceptable. I will consider the suggestion 
of guidelines or guidance on that area.</P><P>I point out that, through the quality 
of life funding, for example, a number of local authorities&#151;17 in all&#151;have 
improved swimming provision. For example, Renfrewshire Council has used £550,000 
to give swimming lessons and improve access; Aberdeen City Council has used £180,000 
for primary school swimming; Dumfries and Galloway Council has used £130,000 for 
free swimming for under-18s. Other authorities can therefore access funding if 
they wish to use it for that purpose. I encourage them to do so.</P><P><strong>Margo

to extend the number of PE specialists in Scotland's schools. That means examining 
carefully the number of PE specialists we train and the nature of that training. 
I would like there to be much more of a cluster approach in which the secondary 
school PE teams are also able to go into our primary schools and give the quality, 
specialist education that many members would like to see. For that reason, we 
have increased the priority that will be given next year to the recruitment of

&quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, which holds the prospect of a minimum wage for 
non-clinical staff in the NHS. However, I raise concerns about the disparity that 
continues to exist in some other conditions of service, such as sick pay and pensions. 
Some porters and domestics still do not have the occupational sick-pay schemes 
that clinical staff enjoy. That is not justified. Therefore, will the minister 
assure me that there will be a programme in future to eradicate those inequalities 
so that our poorest paid are protected?</P><P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>One 
of the many changes from &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; will be that sick pay will 
start from day 1 of employment, unlike the present situation.</P><P>Pauline McNeill

At the recent staff partnership forum, I said that the new minimum health service

be paid by all employers in the health service, including private contractors.

Smith: </strong>The minister will be aware that, according to the performance 
indicators that were recently published by the Accounts Commission for Scotland, 
Fife generates more waste per head than any other council in Scotland and recycles 
less than most. Does the minister think that Fife's Labour administration is aware 
of the national waste strategy's waste hierarchy, which is to reduce, reuse, recover 
and only then dispose? What bids has Fife Council made to the strategic waste 
fund to address its appalling record?</P><P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>A number 
of councils may be under the illusion that, by simply moving towards a greater 
recycling target, they will solve the problem. The member's general point about 
every council in Scotland having to address the question of waste minimisation 
is crucial to the success of the national waste strategy.</P><P>On Iain Smith's 
question about applications from Fife Council, it is my understanding that the

scheme to help locally based companies access support.</P><P><strong>Donald Gorrie: 
</strong>That is encouraging. What other measures are in place to help people 
to set up companies and develop them, other than money, although money is important? 
Many people have good ideas, but not the technical, legal or planning skills to 
implement them. Is there enough support to help such people to develop their new 
companies?</P><P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The small business gateway has been 
key to streamlining and increasing the effectiveness of the kind of support to 
which Mr Gorrie refers. It ensures that services and support can be provided by 
accredited business advisers or by lawyers and accountants&#151;whichever are 
required for the various aspects of people's plans&#151;and can be accessed through 
one website or one telephone number. We have worked hard with those involved to 
ensure that it is much easier now compared with how it used to be for people who 
have a good idea for starting up a business to access not just grants and money 
but expertise.</P><P><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>As the 
minister said, one of the main measures for helping businesses to grow is regional 
selective assistance. How much of the funding for the current financial year is 
still left in the RSA budget? In other words, what has been neither committed 
nor spent? How will that money be recycled to help local businesses?</P><P><strong>Iain 
Gray: </strong>As Mr Neil will understand, the RSA scheme operates day by day, 
and discussions on potential grants, applications and so on take place every day, 
so I do not have a figure to hand. Mr Neil will also know that one of the changes 
that I have made on RSA has been to publish quarterly reports, so that details 
about the grants that have been offered and accepted are clear and transparent.</P><P>The 
amount of money that we allocate in the budget to RSA is less than it was. That 
is the case simply because it operates in an inward investment market that is 
much smaller. I assure Mr Neil that no project has ever been turned down because 
of a lack of money in the RSA budget. As long as I have anything to do with it,

the need to mitigate the rates burden&#151;which they have done by conceding a 
freeze on business rates&#151;why will they not go the whole hog by restoring 
a uniform business rate to achieve real competitiveness and to give real help 
to locally based companies?</P><P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Miss Goldie knows 
the answer to that question. There is a difference between both the rates poundage 
and rateable values in Scotland and England. For that reason, the burden imposed 
on businesses is the same in Scotland and England. We have said that we will freeze 
business rates. That measure will come into force in the next financial year and 
will help businesses. However, all the other measures that we are taking to improve 
the skills of the work force are also important. If we took money from those programmes 
simply to reduce business rates, we would be cutting off our nose to spite our

light of the recent decision by the Boots Company to close its Airdrie factory, 
does the minister agree that the workers in Airdrie require a two-pronged approach? 
Such an approach will ensure that they receive the maximum redundancy package, 
assistance in retraining and new job opportunities. It will also involve a strategy 
to support and nurture local companies, so that employment opportunities can be 
created locally.</P><P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Karen Whitefield is absolutely 
right. She has already been involved in discussions with the company, local agencies

the potential benefits of additional services on this route. Nora Radcliffe mentioned 
Dyce and other industrial areas around the city. The challenge is to link improved 
rail services to other aspects of the public transport network, such as the evolving 
strategy for public transport access to Aberdeen airport, which is important. 
We will consider the crossrail proposals as they evolve to the next stage and 
encourage work on them to continue. We will examine the proposals with a clear 
view of the important contribution that they may make to the public transport

Environment and Rural Development (Ross Finnie): </strong>Improving Scotland's 
resource use is a key priority in our approach to sustainable development. We 
have allocated £1 million from the aggregates levy to the aggregates programme 
to be run by the Waste and Resources Action Programme, with the objective of reducing 
the demand for primary aggregates through the greater use of aggregates from recycled 
and secondary sources. The programme will provide a comprehensive information 
service to stakeholders in the aggregates supply chain, support research into 
aggregates-related issues and provide capital support to stimulate the development 
of secondary and recycled aggregates infrastructure in Scotland.</P><P><strong>Alex 
Johnstone: </strong>Further to the answer that I received from the Deputy Minister 
for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning two weeks ago, does the minister 
believe that the pursuit of the use of recycled aggregates will in any way offset 
the cost to the Scottish economy of the aggregates tax? Is he in a position to 
calculate what the cost of that tax will be to the Executive's road building programme?</P><P><strong>Ross 
Finnie: </strong>Mr Johnstone is obviously very persistent in pursuing the matter, 
on which Lewis Macdonald gave what I thought was a comprehensive reply.</P><P>I 
remind the member that the whole purpose of our aggregates tax is to increase 
the use of recycled materials, with regard to meeting our environmental objectives. 
The cost to the Scottish economy of not improving our environmental use of finite 
resources is almost incalculable, which the member would do well to remember in 
asking about the cost to local authorities. As Lewis Macdonald pointed out, in 
order to assess the balance between how the UK Government imposes a tax and impost 
and the use of that revenue, we have to look at the budget as a whole. That is

the recycling of glass. Will the minister undertake to work with the glass industry

glass bottles? Will he meet representatives of United Glass and the Convention

Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning (Iain Gray): </strong>Around 
100,000 people are entitled to rises as a result of the October 2002 increase 
in the national minimum wage. The new lifelong learning strategy, which I launched 
on 11 February, shows our determination to create a Scotland in which people have 
the knowledge, creativity and skills to participate fully in economic, social 
and civic life and enhance their earning capacity.</P><P><strong>Tommy Sheridan: 
</strong>That is rather inadequate. Is the minister aware that the number of Scots 
living below the official poverty line is now greater than it was five years ago 
and that the single biggest growth area is among the working poor? Will the Executive 
take the radical action that is required and introduce a proper Low Pay Unit-set 
minimum wage of £7.32 per hour for public sector workers to eradicate the scourge 
of low pay within the public services?</P><P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>In the 
past, Mr Sheridan has shown that he is happy to move between relative and absolute 
measures of poverty as and when it suits his argument. The first step towards 
the eradication of poverty in Scotland is the eradication of mass unemployment. 
We have taken that step. That must be built on by eradicating the lowest pay. 
We have done that by introducing the national minimum wage. The next step is to 
provide support for families in particular </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18214">18214</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>The minister made reference to the eradication 
of mass unemployment. Is he aware of the findings of the Scotecon study at the 
University of Stirling&#151;funded by the Scottish Executive&#151;which reveal 
that Scotland has one of the highest rates in the industrialised world for the 
number of households with no one in employment? Does he acknowledge that although 
many families might be off the Government's unemployment statistics, that is not 
a reason to put them out the Government's mind altogether? When one in four households 
in Strathclyde has no one in employment, how can the minister say that he has 
conquered unemployment? Is it not the case that, for too many families in Scotland, 
Labour is not working?</P><P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Mr Wilson will no doubt 
also be aware of the labour market figures that came out earlier this week, which 
show further falls in unemployment and the claimant count to levels that have 
not been seen for almost 40 years. That gives us the opportunity to focus support 
on those who are furthest from the labour market and have the greatest barriers 
to overcome to access the opportunities that we have created.</P><P>We will continue 
to work with Whitehall colleagues. I met the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions 
earlier this week. We discussed the pathways to work project, which will move 
willing people from relying on inactive benefits into the labour market and will 
provide them with the necessary support that they need to do that, which they 
could not even have dreamed of 15 years ago.</P><P><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow 
Pollok) (Lab): </strong>I am sure that the minister is aware that a significant 
majority of low-paid workers are women. That is partly because of their need to 
be flexible to meet their disproportionate care responsibilities and partly because 
of job segregation, which means that women's jobs are less valued and therefore 
lower paid. What steps are being taken to address the underlying inequality in 
the work force that creates the pay gap? I seek the minister's assurance that 
any strategy to address the problem of low pay will recognise the particular and 
pressing needs of women.</P><P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>We are fully engaged 
in the &quot;Close the Gap&quot; initiative, which is a UK-wide initiative. My 
colleague Margaret Curran and I have been involved in that. When we talk about

to do that. For example, we have provided additional support for child care for 
those who study in further or higher education. As I have said, the enterprise

is pleasing that there has been significant success in that area.</P><P><strong>Phil 
Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>Can the minister confirm that all employers 
in Scotland are meeting the minimum wage requirements? If that is the case, can 
he explain why Jobcentre Plus staff ask every employer whether they are prepared 
to guarantee such payments and register some surprise when people enthusiastically 
embrace the targets? What effect has the minimum wage had on poverty?</P><P><strong>Iain 
Gray: </strong>The Low Pay Commission is in no doubt that although the national 
minimum wage has not been the only contributor to the reduction in poverty that 
has taken place, it has been one of the most significant contributors. The national 
minimum wage is a powerful tool. We have to ensure that employers are aware of 
and are complying with the requirements of national minimum wage legislation because 
we had to wait a very long time for a minimum wage in this country. It is right

Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>Is the minister entirely happy that some out-of-school 
care projects are very dependent on the vagaries of lottery funding? In view of 
the fact that lottery sales have decreased by over 5 per cent since last year, 
would it not be better for such projects to be funded from the education budget, 
so that more lottery funding would be available for sport and the arts?</P><P><strong>Cathy 
Jamieson: </strong>A range of funding provision is available for out-of-school 
care and additional funding has been made available through child care strategy 
moneys over the next three years. Money is also available through the changing 
children's services fund and through a number of other funding streams. The New 
Opportunities Fund has relaxed some of its restrictions so that some out-of-school 
care provisions are now able to secure three-year funding rather than the one-year 
funding that was previously the case. Out-of-school care provision makes a huge 
and welcome contribution to young people's involvement in sports, drama, the arts

Federation agrees, will the minister accept that white-fish quota must be retained

white-fish quota to prevent other European Union member states from buying that 
entitlement to fish?</P><P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Since the measures emerged 
I have always accepted that there were serious issues to be addressed in relation

discussed on Monday evening. He will also agree that it is an extraordinarily 
complex measure and, although I am grateful to him for drawing the potential parallel 
with the beef quota, there is a slight difference between that and a siphoning 
mechanism that deals with a very small percentage.</P><P>We await with interest 
the outcome of the European Commission's investigations into the Shetland Islands 
Council's quota purchase scheme. I expect that that outcome might emerge by the 
end of this month and it would help us to form our view as to how to deal with 
the quotas issue. We will continue to discuss with the industry how we can protect 
quotas.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18218">18218</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP): </strong>Did the minister discuss 
with the Scottish Fishermen's Federation the fishing communities' strong views 
that the Executive's proposed package is balanced far too much in favour of decommissioning 
and that it is not a recovery plan but a redundancy plan? Will he accept that 
there is a need for flexibility in considering how that money is spent to ensure 
that we will have a fleet that can go to sea and bring back the catches that we 
all want?</P><P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>As a starting point, I have set 
out that there are two sides to the equation that have to be addressed. One is 
to deal with the conservation measures and the need for us to address the serious 
issue of conserving stocks in the North sea. The other is to address the need 
to have a sustainable fishing fleet. I believe that the Executive's £50 million 
package of measures is one of the largest that has been directed to an industry 
of that size. It is a real expression of the earnest will of the Executive to 
sustain the fishing industry. We can compare that amount with the cost of the 
last decommissioning scheme, which removed 10 per cent of the fishing effort. 
The target this time is 15 per cent so, by using very simple arithmetic, we can 
see how we have come to the balance.</P><P>We are discussing those matters, but 
I have reminded the member of our two objectives and I repeat that the £50 million 
that is being allocated by the Executive is a real statement of our earnest will 
to protect the industry.</P><P><strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) 
(Con): </strong>The £10 million part of the package that has been allocated to 
transitional funding presumably covers the six months of interim measures that 
will, hopefully, end in July. Bearing in mind the fact that the European Union 
has rejected cod recovery plan proposals on more than one occasion in the past, 
is the minister confident that those draconian interim measures will end in July? 
What provision has he made if they do not?</P><P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I 
am not in a position to speculate as to exactly what is going to happen in the 
new council. Even after the council had ended, I was conscious that there were 
going to be some difficulties. There are a number of options for addressing those 
difficulties and we began discussing those with the fishing industry on Tuesday 
evening. It is imperative that the Executive gets alternative proposals on the 
table and begins those discussions and we gave the industry an undertaking that 
we would.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Caledonian MacBrayne</STRONG></P><P> <strong>11.

<P>when it last met the management of Caledonian MacBrayne and what issues were 
discussed. (S1O-6407)</P><P><strong>The Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport 
and Lifelong Learning (Lewis Macdonald): </strong>Scottish Executive officials 
meet the management of Caledonian MacBrayne whenever necessary, most recently 
on Monday of this week, when the future investment programme for Clyde and Hebrides 
ferry services was discussed.</P><P><strong>Mr Hamilton: </strong>The minister 
will be aware of the European Union regulations that encourage and require bids 
for public service obligation services to be at the lowest possible cost to the 
public purse. The evidence of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report was that the removal 
of the frequency restriction on the Gourock to Dunoon ferry run would allow more 
sailings, more profit and so lower subsidy and greater competition. Given that, 
does the minister recognise that unless he removes the frequency restriction, 
he might be in breach of the EU regulations and might leave the Executive open 
to a legal challenge?</P><P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I am afraid that 
Mr Hamilton is slightly out of date with developments. Some weeks ago, I announced 
that we will issue shortly a draft service specification for the Gourock to Dunoon 
service that will separate it out from the overall network. The requirement that 
the service should be let to the operator that provides the service at the lowest 
possible cost accompanies the requirement that the service should be compliant 
with the terms of the tender. In letting the service specification and the tender, 
it is for the Executive to define the terms of the tender. We will accept the 
bid that is compliant with the requirements of the tender and that comes in at 
the lowest possible cost.</P><P><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD): </strong>When 
will the consultation on the draft specification for the Gourock to Dunoon route 
begin?</P><P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We expect to begin that consultation 
shortly. We will have to ensure that the necessary amendments are made to the 
wider draft service specification, as well as prepare the current draft service 
specification for the Gourock to Dunoon route.</P><P><strong>Maureen Macmillan 
(Highlands and Islands) (Lab): </strong>On the restriction of services, I point 
out that young people who use public transport are particularly disadvantaged 
if the Gourock to Dunoon ferry does not operate into the late evening. I ask him 
to examine whether it is the passenger aspect or the vehicle aspect of the ferry 
service that the European Commission wishes to restrict with the new contract. 
If it is not the passenger aspect, will he consider how he might deliver public 
transport later into the evening for </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18220">18220</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>young people in Dunoon?</P><P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The point on 
restrictions is similar to the one raised by Duncan Hamilton. It was made clear 
in our most recent discussions with the European Commission that a proposal that 
was founded on the existing restrictions on the service would be more likely to 
survive any challenge that might be made by a third party. That advice and the 
discussions that we had drew us to reach our conclusions and to produce the proposals. 
Clearly, we will take into account the need for public transport services on the 
route when we produce the final service specification.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Public 
Transport (Access for Disabled People)</STRONG></P><P> <strong>12. Mr John Home 
Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab): </STRONG>To ask the Scottish Executive what its 
policy is on promoting access for disabled people to public transport. (S1O-6430)</P><P><strong>The 
Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning (Iain Gray): </strong>The 
Executive is committed to an accessible public transport system that allows people 
with disabilities to enjoy the same opportunities to travel in Scotland as other 
members of society. To achieve that, we will work with public transport providers 
and others to improve access to services and facilities across Scotland.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Home Robertson: </strong>Does the minister share my concern that Prestonpans, 
Longniddry, Drem and many other railway stations are still not accessible to passengers 
with physical disabilities? Railtrack Scotland has told me:</P><P>&quot;The funding 
of fully compliant accessible stations is the on going subject of discussion involving 
Network Rail, Train Operating Companies, the Strategic Rail Authority and the 
Rail Regulator Office.&quot;</P><P>Does he agree that those on-going discussions 
must not be allowed to go on indefinitely? How about applying a bit of coercion, 
as well as incentives, to let disabled Scots travel by rail?</P><P><strong>Iain 
Gray: </strong>I agree that we expect the providers to sort out whatever differences 
they have to sort out, and to make the facilities accessible. On coercion, there 
is the ultimate coercion of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. We expect 
providers to understand their obligations under that. On occasion, we have received 
applications to fund such improvements, through the public transport fund for 
example, and we have looked positively on many of them.</P><P><strong>Mr Gil Paterson 
(Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>It goes without saying that there are barriers 
in the way of people with wheelchairs. We need to do something about that soon.

<P>also fully accessible to people with learning disabilities, hearing difficulties 
and sight problems?</P><P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The DDA covers all forms 
of disability, not just wheelchair use. Three sets of regulations have added further 
detail to that, including the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998, and 
other regulations that cover buses and so on. I believe that there is still some 
discussion around the final form of the regulations covering taxis, but in all 
cases those disabilities should be addressed. One support in aid that we have 
is the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland. We look forward to its first 
annual report towards the end of this month, and we will take up its suggestions.</P><P><strong>John 
Young (West of Scotland) (Con):</strong> There are plans to replace existing rolling 
stock over the next few years. Has there been any consultation on the iniquitous 
design of many railway carriages, which makes it difficult for normal pedestrians 
to get on and off the train, irrespective of people who are disabled? Have there 
been any specific discussions with the authorities on the matter of a redesign? 
Most foreign railway carriages, in particular those on the continent, are far 
superior to the ones that we have here.</P><P><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The 
new rolling stock will have to meet the new Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 
1998. If anyone is aware of a continuing difficulty, I am happy to be made aware 
of it. The fact is that the new rolling stock should be as accessible as is rolling 
stock anywhere else in the world.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18222">18222</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

will leave the gallery. I will allow injury time, as we have lost a minute. [<em>Interruption.</em>] 
Let us settle down. I want to hear what is happening on the floor, not upstairs.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Swinney: </strong>Today, the First Minister met chief constables to discuss domestic 
security, and I welcome those discussions. Does he accept the concern in our community 
that a unilateral strike on Iraq might increase the risk of a terrorist attack 
in this country?</P><P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>It would be wrong 
to pre-empt the important discussions that will take place at the United Nations 
in the next few days, which will determine the situation. What is important now 
and has been important since September 2001, which was almost 18 months ago, is 
that we in Scotland are as prepared as people in any other part of the developed 
world should be for the possibility of a terrorist attack somewhere in the United 
Kingdom.</P><P>The chief constables of Scotland are well prepared for that eventuality. 
The meeting this morning was comprehensive and thorough. I am sure that they have 
the resources at hand that will help them to deal with such a situation.</P><P><strong>Mr

week, it was revealed that nine out of 10 people in Scotland oppose a unilateral 
military strike on Iraq. Will the First Minister be true to his pledge to the

<P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>The opinion polls also showed that the 
majority of people in Scotland would back the United Nations if it passed a resolution 
that supported action against Iraq. That is not the Scottish National Party's 
position and Mr Swinney should be consistent. If the United Nations is good enough 
to support, it is good enough to support when it wants to take action. I urge 
Mr Swinney and his party to change their position and to back the United Nations. 
[<em>Interruption.</em>]</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>Order.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Swinney: </strong>If the First Minister had attended the parliamentary debate

National Party, which is not as he misrepresented it.</P><P>This weekend, the 
people of Scotland, the Church of Scotland, the Catholic Church, the Scottish 
Trades Union Congress, four political parties and many other organisations will 
gather to oppose unilateral military action. On this vital question, and given 
that nine out of 10 people in Scotland oppose unilateral military action, does 
the First Minister back the people of Scotland or the Prime Minister in London? 
The Prime Minister is lobbying for war. Will the First Minister join the rest 
of us in arguing for peace?</P><P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>The Prime 
Minister is not lobbying for war. He is lobbying to ensure that the United Nations 
carries out action, if that is required, to implement its previous resolutions, 
which require action by Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi Government. It is simply 
not good enough to play party politics with such a serious issue. [<em>Interruption.</em>] 
I attended the debate. I heard it said that the Scottish National Party would 
not support the United Nations if it decides to take action in Iraq. Mr Swinney 
reserved the right to contradict the United Nations in that situation.</P><P>The 
majority of the people of Scotland support the idea that if the United Nations 
makes the decision, the United Nations should act. If the United Nations does 
act, I hope that Mr Swinney will back it.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Cabinet

that language has become so debased, has been used so manipulatively and has been 
elevated to such a fine art in recent times that the public in many instances 
no longer know what to believe?</P><P>That was exemplified yesterday and this 
morning in the furore over Mr John Reid's statement, which has confused and worried 
the public. Does the First Minister agree that we need clarity of purpose and

he can to ensure that a measured approach is adopted in Scotland to issues of 
public safety?</P><P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>I agree with Mr McLetchie 
on the matter. I believe that it is vital, in Scotland as it is elsewhere, that 
we are clear not only in reassuring the public that there is no specific threat 
to Scotland at this time but in saying that there is a general threat to the United 
Kingdom. In that situation, we have to be well prepared, not only at our airports, 
as was identified this week, but in other parts of our country and in our lives 
here in Scotland. I want to ensure that the arrangements are properly in place. 
I believe that this morning's meeting with the chief constables&#151;[<em>Interruption.</em>]</P><P>I

First Minister: </strong>These are not issues for catcalling in the chamber or 
for abuse of the sort that we have seen today; these are issues that have to be 
taken very seriously indeed. That is why, in the face of public concern about 
a security threat, clarity was as important yesterday as it is today and why we 
will continue to have the clarity that Mr McLetchie has requested. I will ensure, 
as the Deputy First Minister will ensure, that we work closely with the chief 
constables and other services in Scotland. To do so will ensure that Scotland 
is as safe a place as it can be.</P><P><strong>David McLetchie: </strong>On matters

<P>of the National Audit Office report into national health service planning? 
The report, which was published last November, exposed significant shortcomings 
in the preparation for major casualty incidents south of the border. In particular, 
it highlighted concerns about a lack of communication between the NHS and the 
emergency services. Will the First Minister tell me how effective the NHS in Scotland 
has been in putting our equivalent guidelines in place? Is he satisfied that the 
NHS is prepared for contingencies?</P><P>On a wider note, following the meeting 
this morning to which he referred, is the First Minister satisfied that everything 
that can realistically be done to protect the public is being done? Are we striking 
the right balance between giving the public adequate information on the one hand 
and not causing undue alarm or compromising police operations on the other hand?</P><P><strong>The 
First Minister: </strong>On David McLetchie's second point, there is, at times, 
a difficult balance to strike. It is not just a matter of confidentiality of information, 
but of not compromising police operations or the court proceedings that are likely 
to happen in Scotland this year in relation to the terrorist suspects that are 
currently accused and in Scottish jails.</P><P><strong>Tommy Sheridan: </strong>Six 
have been released.</P><P><strong>The First Minister:</strong> If Mr Sheridan

answers.</P><P><strong>The First Minister:</strong> I would not take anybody's 
name in vain, and it is important to use the words &quot;suspects&quot; and &quot;alleged&quot; 
in relation to these matters. The reality is that there are people currently charged 
with terrorist offences here in Scotland. Therefore, we need to be alert and vigilant 
to the overall threat that exists in the United Kingdom, and we are. As part of 
that, we have a proper emergencies committee, which includes the health service, 
that is examining all eventualities. I believe that the state of preparedness 
is significantly better than it was 18 months ago at the time of 11 September 
2001. I have every confidence in our health service, our police forces, our Army 
and anybody else who might need to be involved in ensuring that we have in Scotland 
good co-ordination and preparedness in the event of any terrorist attack on Scotland

First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): </strong>It is imperative that personal data 
are not made available during the lifetime of the children who are named or identified 
in the reports and their families. However, I can confirm that the Lord Advocate 
is actively considering what access can be made available to productions lodged 
with Lord Cullen's inquiry, including police reports, that are closed for 100 
years.</P><P><strong>Dr Jackson: </strong>Obviously, the matter is very sensitive 
and affects a great many of my constituents. Will the First Minister reassure 
them that the public inquiry had unrestricted access to all papers relating to 
the police investigation? Clarity is needed on the matter, but I hope that any 
review would take on board primarily the views of those most affected by the tragedy.</P><P>Will 
the First Minister also reassure Parliament that the confidentiality and privacy 
of those involved will not be breached, because the feelings of those involved 
in the tragedy must be paramount? I hope that those in the chamber will respect 
that.</P><P><strong>The First Minister:</strong> I am happy to give those assurances. 
I know of Sylvia Jackson's interest in the matter, not least because I am an ex-resident 
of Dunblane.</P><P>One of the most important aspects of the situation since 1996 
is the way in which representatives of all parties have done all that they can 
to ensure that no one has made political capital or points out of any events relating 
to the tragedy. Michael Forsyth, the then Secretary of State for Scotland, conducted 
himself impeccably at the time in liaising with other parties. I certainly commit 
myself to doing the same.</P><P>The ultimate interest has to lie with the children 
and their descendants. I want to ensure that anybody who had contact with Thomas 
Hamilton over the years, and who may be mentioned in the reports, is not in any 
way compromised or embarrassed by that in the future. That said, it is also important 
that we make available, if at all possible, any information that relates to people 
who are in the public eye, not just to reassure the public, but to make sure that 
nobody's position on the matter can be distorted in years to come.</P><P><strong>Lord

happy, but keen, to give that assurance. I believe that the decisions made by 
Lord Cullen at the time were made in the interests of the families in Dunblane. 
Any decisions subsequent to that have been made with the same interests firmly 
in mind.</P><P>The tragedy happened only seven years ago, and the memories will 
be very sharp indeed for the families. I urge all members in the Parliament to 
remember that and to respect the fact that it is important to put the interests 
of the children and families of Dunblane first.</P><P><strong>Michael Matheson 
(Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>The First Minister will be aware that the 100-year 
rule has been applied to a number of documents relating to the Dunblane incident, 
some of which make absolutely no reference to children. Will the First Minister 
confirm today that the Lord Advocate's review will include all documents that 
have had the 100-year rule applied to them? Will he also explain to the chamber 
the procedure and tell us who is responsible for deciding whether the 100-year 
rule will be overturned?</P><P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>The rule has 
been sensibly applied, and indeed was applied partly on Lord Cullen's advice. 
I do not think that anyone over the years has criticised Lord Cullen for the way 
in which he handled his inquiry and set out his recommendations, or for the entirely 
appropriate manner in which he dealt with sensitive information not just about 
families in Dunblane but about the many people who had been in contact with Thomas 
Hamilton in the years before. It is important to remember that decisions were 
made on that basis.</P><P>In his review, the Lord Advocate will be happy to take

of Scots? Does he further agree that it is essential that people do not react 
to any provocation that is caused by their presence?</P><P><strong>The First Minister: 
</strong>Yes, that is certainly the case. I think that it would be very easy to 
react to the presence in Scotland of people who are associated with criminal activity, 
sectarian crime or terrorism in Northern Ireland. I hope that people in Scotland 
will not overreact to the situation, but will support the police in their job,

First Minister: </strong>The Scotland Office is certainly of great assistance 
to the Scottish Executive in such matters and regularly represents Scotland's 
interests in the UK Government, even when we are not directly involved. That is 
for the benefit of Scotland.</P><P>There have been recent instances&#151;for example, 
in relation to fire services legislation&#151;where there could have been closer 
liaison in both directions. It is important that we learn from those examples 
and that we improve the situation. I believe that one of the remarkable successes 
of devolution is the fact that relationships between the Parliament and the Executive 
and the Government in London have been cordial and satisfactory during the past 
four years. That is the strength on which this young Parliament can build in its 
second term.</P><P><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong>A few 
months ago, the First Minister announced that there would be an announcement soon 
on initiatives&#151;presumably in relation to reserved and devolved matters&#151;to 
deal with the falling population in Scotland. In the light of the census report 
this morning, will he tell us when those measures will be announced?</P><P><strong>The 
First Minister: </strong>I expect to refer to those matters in the very near future.</P><P><strong>The

is from Bill Butler.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Health Policy</STRONG></P><P>

<P>cutting waiting times, such as staff recruitment. Given the socialist belief 
in a health service that is freely available to all at the point of need, will 
the First Minister assure the chamber today that meeting the Executive's target 
of no one waiting more than nine months for surgery by the end of this year will 
be central to the strategy outlined in the coming white paper?</P><P><strong>The 
First Minister: </strong>Mr Butler raises two issues. The first was in relation 
to the former HCI hospital&#151;now the Golden Jubilee national hospital&#151;in 
Clydebank. I confirm that the new hospital is well on its way to reaching its 
target of 5,000 additional operations in its first year of operation. That is 
of remarkable benefit to the people not just in the west of Scotland but throughout 
Scotland who are undergoing those procedures.</P><P>On the wider issue of waiting 
times and the target of nine months by the end of this year for those with a guarantee, 
I confirm not only that we are well on the way to reaching the target by the end 
of the year, but that if any health boards in Scotland do not reach the target, 
they will pay for people to have their operations carried out elsewhere.</P><P><strong>Nicola 
Sturgeon (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>When finalising the health white paper, will 
the First Minister reflect on the news that the former HCI hospital was forced 
to send hundreds of patients away in December because of a shortage of staff? 
Will he guarantee that the white paper will include a series of practical measures 
to tackle the very serious recruitment crisis that lies at the heart of many of 
the problems facing the NHS today?</P><P><strong>The First Minister: </strong>The 
Golden Jubilee national hospital did not turn away hundreds of staff&#151;that 
is a distortion and one that demeans the staff in the hospital. It is wrong to 
repeat it in the chamber. I met staff from the former HCI hospital in Clydebank 
last night at a reception in Edinburgh Castle to celebrate the work of NHS staff. 
Their commitment to working inside the national health service and to delivering 
a national service was very good to see. It was also good to see their appreciation 
of the wider range of staff available in the hospital, the additional operating 
theatres and the additional operations that are being carried out. They see the 
benefits for patients, not just in the west of Scotland, but throughout Scotland. 
The thousands of patients who will benefit from the purchase in the years to come 
will not be happy with the sort of statements that have been made today.</P><P><strong>The 
Presiding Officer: </strong>That concludes question time. Since we were interrupted 
several times, I assure the chamber that I will discuss the implications with 
our security staff.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18231">18231</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">

is not a matter of standing orders that the information should be available from

<P>During the past three years, we have established a consultative budget process 
that has achieved a genuine degree of engagement from the wider public. It is 
transparent and open, and there have been many opportunities not just for the 
Parliament but for the public to have a say in our deliberations and in the debate 
about the budget. That is due not only to the Executive, but to the diligence 
of the Finance Committee and the other committees of the Parliament. I would genuinely 
like to thank them again, not only for the diligence that they show but for the 
constructive attitude that the Finance Committee has always shown in relation 
to the budget process and how it can be improved.</P><P>I have previously mentioned 
my view that the budget process could be further improved. Indeed, I rehearsed 
many possibilities with the Finance Committee during its stage 2 consideration 
of the bill on Tuesday. I look forward to the committee's work on that in the 
future. The Executive will work closely with the committee to make what could 
be fairly fundamental changes to the procedures as we move into future years, 
without in any way compromising the openness and scrutiny of the process.</P><P>The 
constructive attitude of the Finance Committee was evident on Tuesday. For the 
first time, the Executive proposed a number of amendments to the bill to alter 
the presentation of student loans in the 2001-02 budget and to correct some minor 
errors in this year's budget. I am glad to say that the committee accepted all 
the Executive's amendments and I am grateful to committee members for their assistance 
in that process.</P><P>Members will be delighted to know that I do not intend 
to speak for very long this afternoon. Other members will want to contribute to 
the debate and I have already spoken for a considerable time in the four previous 
debates on this budget and on the spending review. Nevertheless, it is worth summarising 
what the budget will achieve.</P><P>Today's budget is one for growth and opportunity 
for the people of Scotland. We are aware of the need to improve Scotland's economic 
growth rate and we have put in place a series of measures to achieve that, focusing 
on skills and investment, which are closely aligned to the business agenda in 
Scotland. This morning, I took place in a debate organised by the Confederation 
of British Industry, looking at its manifesto for business in the future. Much 
of the Executive's activity is aligned to that agenda.</P><P>Through the budget, 
we will increase the number of people in work and undertaking training. The budget 
will trigger improved access to modern technology through broadband technology 
in urban and rural Scotland, for </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18234">18234</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>example. We will close the gap in employment rates between those in the worst 
10 per cent of areas and the Scottish average and we will assist 150 joint academic 
and industry ventures by 2006&#151;that will be enabled by the budget. As members 
know, we have made a commitment to freeze Scottish business rates, limit future 
rises in rate poundages to the rate of inflation and institute a system of rates 
relief for smaller businesses throughout Scotland.</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson 
(Banff and Buchan) (SNP): </strong>I refer the minister to page 143 of &quot;Scotland's 
Budget Documents 2003-04&quot;, which mentions Highlands and Islands Enterprise 
and digital connectivity. It shows 30 per cent the population in the Highlands 
and Islands having broadband access in the current year and exactly the same proportion 
for 2003-04. That does not seem to square with the minister's suggestion that 
broadband access will be increasingly available in rural areas&#151;at least in 
the Highlands and Islands&#151;and it is somewhat curious, given the programme 
of aggregated public sector demand that we always believed would deliver additional 
broadband access in the Highlands and Islands. When will there be greater availability?</P><P><strong>Peter 
Peacock: </strong>I am happy to reassure Stewart Stevenson that he has no reason 
to be concerned about such matters. The budget and our future spending plans provide 
for a dramatic increase in broadband connectivity. Only a week ago, I saw television 
adverts that were funded by the Executive through Highlands and Islands Enterprise. 
They sought to target businesses and individuals in the Highlands to encourage 
them take up broadband technology and therefore create the demand that will help 
to roll out broadband.</P><P><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP): </strong>Will 
the minister take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>I would 
like to finish what I am saying.</P><P>On the second point that Stewart Stevenson 
made, significant progress is being made more widely in the Highlands and Islands 
in relation to the aggregated procurement exercise. That will see the whole of 
the Highlands and Islands&#151;every school and library in the area and many public 
buildings and public authorities&#151;connected to broadband technology. In fact, 
adverts for expressions of interest have been put out and a great number of expressions 
of interest have been received. Those are being sifted and we will move to the 
next stage of the procurement process very quickly indeed. There is no reason 
to be alarmed, but there is every reason to be encouraged.</P><P><strong>Mrs Ewing: 
</strong>I certainly hope that the legislation will be enabling legislation. The 
linkage into </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18235">18235</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>broadband must be emphasised. There cannot be linkage if there are no links. 
Does the minister realise how irritating it is for constituents in remote parts 
of my constituency who see such television adverts and submit an application? 
They want to be a part of things, but are told, &quot;There is no link and we 
do not see it coming for a long time.&quot; Will that matter be resolved?</P><P><strong>Peter 
Peacock: </strong>I think that it will, as the strategy that HIE is rightly pursuing 
is one of targeting advertising in particular locales, so that expressions of 
interest are generated that allow investments to be made. We have learned about 
such strategies from contact with the telecommunications companies. In addition, 
part of the logic of investing in broadband technology in the Highlands and Islands 
more widely through the aggregated procurement exercise is to allow the private 
sector to make further investments on the back of that, that will give the very 
connections that Margaret Ewing and all members seek.</P><P>Through our budget, 
we will invest heavily in education and transport, which are crucial to our long-term 
economic performance. In education, we will deliver unprecedented investment in 
schools and children's services and continue to spend significantly more per pupil 
than the United Kingdom average. Spending on transport will increase by more than 
15 per cent next year. That means that we can complete four major trunk road schemes, 
meet our targets for increasing local bus passenger journeys in Scotland and provide 
funding that will allow ScotRail and Strathclyde Passenger Transport to improve 
rail services.</P><P>We will also deliver in our other priority areas of health 
and crime. In real terms, health spending will increase by almost 8 per cent next 
year. That investment will help us to invest in modern hospitals and equipment, 
train additional nurses and midwives and achieve our targets for improving the 
health of the Scottish people. On crime, we will maintain the record numbers of 
police officers, work towards further reductions in serious violent crime and 
continue the war on drug dealers.</P><P>The investment in public services meets 
the aspirations of the Scottish people and will help us to ensure that everybody 
in Scotland has access to education and health care in the kind of social environment 
that they need to prosper. By creating the conditions in which everyone in Scotland 
is able to fulfil their potential we can take further steps towards closing the 
opportunity gap.</P><P>Our investment in services is made possible by the outcome 
of the 2002 spending review, which provided for an average increase in public 
spending in real terms of 4.6 per cent over the next three years. The budget is 
delivered through the operation of the Barnett formula, which </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18236">18236</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>ensures that the extra resources are spent wisely within Scotland. The budget 
links resources to the Executive's priorities and it sets targets that demonstrate 
what we will achieve with the spending. We have set in place mechanisms to monitor 
performance against those targets. We expect to be scrutinised on delivery against 
those targets.</P><P>The budget is prudent in its approach, but ambitious in its 
aims. It combines a clear vision for the future with the resources to match that 
and the leadership to deliver. It will improve the quality of life of the people 
of all of Scotland&#151;rural and urban.</P><P>I move,</P><P>That the Parliament 
agrees that the Budget (Scotland) (No.4) Bill be passed.</P><P>15:45</P><P><strong>Alasdair 
Morgan (Galloway and Upper Nithsdale) (SNP): </strong>I know that this is stage 
3, but for some of us it feels like stage 93.</P><P>I have said before that I 
think that the budget documents are becoming much more helpful to members. They 
are a great improvement on what they were some years ago. However, I have one 
little caveat that also applies to most Executive documents and to many parliamentary 
reports; they could do with having a date of publication on them. The documents 
may have the year to which they refer on them but, once there is a series of those 
documents&#151;given that the spin doctors keep changing the titles they give 
them; this one is called &quot;Making it work together&quot;&#151;it is difficult 
in retrospect to discover which of them came first and which is the latest. Publication 
dates would be helpful.</P><P>The minister made a serious point about the repetitious 
nature of many of the finance and budget debates. I welcome the fact that he will 
look, along with the committee, at the number of debates that there are in the 
process. The experiment that we will have later in the year, when we will reduce 
the number of debates because the election will make it necessary for the process 
to be encapsulated in a shorter time scale, will indicate whether it is feasible 
to reduce the number of debates. It is clearly important that we still ensure 
that there is ample time for parliamentary scrutiny. All the indications are that 
we could still have the parliamentary scrutiny, but have fewer set-piece debates.</P><P>In 
the context of scrutiny, I welcome the fact that this year at one of the earlier 
stages we had for the first time a reasoned amendment, which suggested that the 
Executive make a change to the budget.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18237">18237</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>If it does not prove possible to reduce the number of debates, I suggest that 
some of them become more member oriented rather than party oriented. Individual 
members could, on a non-partisan basis, raise issues that are of concern to their 
constituencies and have a financial edge. That used to be the habit in the House 
of Commons many years ago: the consolidated fund debates were occasions for members 
to raise any matter of interest in their constituency. We could perhaps consider 
that approach.</P><P>I will introduce a slight element of controversy. I will 
raise two points about business rates, both of which I raised before but to neither 
of which I received a satisfactory answer.</P><P>First, we know that the business 
rate is higher in Scotland. We are told that because rateable values are lower 
in Scotland, due to the revaluation south of the border the bill for businesses 
north and south of the border is effectively the same. The problem is that for 
some sectors&#151;small hotels and chemical plants are two examples&#151;the valuation 
basis is the same north and south of the border. In the first case that is because 
it is done on the basis of turnover and in the second case valuers north and south 
of the border have agreed a harmonised basis on which to put their valuation. 
In those cases, because our rate is higher, such places north of the border get 
a higher bill than do similar premises south of the border. Will the minister 
at least admit that that is a problem in those sectors, even if he cannot guarantee 
that he will do something about it?</P><P>I have raised my second point several 
times before. We have been given the promise that the uniform business rate will 
not go up more than inflation over the next few years, but the rates bill depends 
on the rateable value. So, when the next revaluation in Scotland takes place shortly, 
some rateable values will go up and some will go down&#151;but I suspect that 
the expectation must be that the total rateable value for the whole of Scotland 
will go up.</P><P>Given those circumstances, does the minister intend to adjust 
the UBR to ensure that the total Scottish business rates bill does not go up by 
more than inflation when the revaluation takes place or is he entertaining the 
notion of putting the total bill up by more than inflation? It should be simple 
for the minister to answer that question without committing himself. He has committed 
to raising the business rate by the level of inflation, so surely he could give 
that extra commitment. I would appreciate answers on those points.</P><P>To allow 
other members to speak, I will restrict my comments. I look forward to the day 
on which we finally discuss a complete budget, not one that concentrates on only 
part of Government expenditure in Scotland.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18238">18238</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>15:50</P><P><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con): </strong>In 
the spirit of the debate, I, too, will refer back to the discussion that the Finance 
Committee had on Tuesday. I have been on the committee since the beginning and 
I have aged remarkably in that time. The budget process seems to be never-ending, 
but we are beginning to see a glimmer of usability in the documentation. Until 
this year, the subject committees found it difficult to participate in the budget 
process, which is why I look forward to the refinements that the minister mentioned 
on Tuesday. The idea is that we will have the statutory document that is required 
for audit purposes, but that something will be attached to it to allow the committees 
easily to access the level 3 information, which is what they need to do their 
work.</P><P>On a political note, I turn to the issue of business rates, which 
has been mentioned. As everybody knows, we would seek to return to the uniform 
business rate. I recently attended a business breakfast in Aberdeen at which Jack 
McConnell spoke. He seemed to realise that there is an element of overkill in 
the present situation, which is why there has been a freeze. That is an acknowledgement 
of the problem, but I want ministers to go further, to consider the matter thoroughly 
and to remove an anti-competitive element of the taxation on Scottish businesses.</P><P>The 
budget is based on tax, but there is an awful lot of waste. I welcome the money 
that has come to Scotland, much of it through the generous Barnett formula, which 
we have supported consistently, unlike the SNP. It is interesting that, at Westminster, 
the SNP supported the increase in national insurance contributions&#151;I wonder 
how Mr Morgan will explain that to the business community. I welcome the extra 
money, but what extra services do we receive for it? As always, Peter Peacock 
was selective in telling us how wonderful the budget is and what will and will 
not happen. More taxes than ever are being taken from Scottish people and businesses 
and Gordon Brown is taking money out of pension funds&#151;the list goes on. One 
would think that we would get much more for that extra money.</P><P>As the Minister 
for Health and Community Care is in the chamber, I ask him why accessible health 
services are not expanding, waiting times are up and staffing positions in the 
health service cannot be filled when extra money is going into the system. People 
are beginning to wonder about the amount of tax that they pay and the statements 
of how much is being spent, because they do not see differences in the street. 
The minister ought to focus more on that in the next budget process, assuming 
of course that he gets back to power and that he has responsibility in that area.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18239">18239</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Council tax rates are being announced today&#151;some of the announcements 
have come through already. In one council there is a 5.3 per cent increase and 
many others have increases of between 4 and 5 per cent. Again, money is going 
into the system, but what do we get for it?</P><P>Collection rates for council 
tax are poor and many law-abiding people who do their best to pay their council 
tax on time are carrying the burden of late payment and late collection by Scottish 
councils. That is unfair. We had a statement the other week about how we all paid 
the uncollected £133 million in the following year. What about the councils' cash 
flow? Councils in my part of the world are screaming about cash flow and the fact 
that they cannot repair the roads on time. The council in Aberdeenshire, where 
I live, and the neighbouring council in Aberdeen have made 37 per cent increases&#151;</P><P><strong>Alasdair 
Morgan: </strong>I listen to what David Davidson says with interest. However, 
presumably, if the collection and late payment rates stay roughly the same, the 
cash flow stays pretty static. It is not affected.</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: 
</strong>Collection rates are assumed. The Minister for Finance and Public Services 
has told us that. Andy Kerr has also said that he is disappointed at the collection 
rate. Ministers agree with me on that point.</P><P>We look at the justice budget 
and see that we are arguing over the priorities. The Executive parties have increased 
the justice budget by only 1.3 per cent when the justice system needs more money.</P><P>We 
have mentioned business rates. I do not know what we will see in the Executive 
parties' manifestos. I have no idea whether the Liberals will propose measures 
such as the dog tax, the caravan tax&#151;perhaps they will return to that&#151;or 
a local tax. Iain Smith even managed to bring the euro into this morning's debate 
on tourism, although he had to struggle to do it.</P><P>The SNP has made many 
pledges. When Mr Adam speaks, will he quantify for us exactly how much the SNP's 
additional spending commitments add up to, where exactly that money will come 
from and how it will be funded? I think that Mr Adam is shaking his head, so perhaps 
the SNP has not worked that out itself. I have no doubt that the Scottish Executive 
can give him a running total.</P><P>The coming election is not about devolution 
and it is most certainly not about the constitution. It is about our economy and 
how we invest in our public services. I hope that others in the debate will take 
it down that route. In the meantime, an awful lot of money is going out and there 
is not a lot of improvement in the services coming back in.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18240">18240</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>15:57</P><P><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD): 
</strong>I am pleased to speak on behalf of the Liberal Democrats in support of 
the bill. The budget delivers strong growth for public services such as health 
and education, sustains the highest ever number of police officers and, I am particularly 
pleased to say, distributes more resources to our hard-pressed local authorities.</P><P>It 
is interesting to follow David Davidson, who spoke for the Conservatives. He talked 
about tax cuts. The Conservatives have promised to cut taxes and put those cuts 
before the delivery of our much-needed public services. We all just heard David 
Davidson talk about the election being about how we invest in our public services. 
I was rather taken aback by that. It is astounding to hear that from the Conservatives.</P><P>David 
Davidson talked about waste and taxation. The Conservatives have not proposed 
to increase investment in public services beyond what the Executive has outlined 
in the bill. That is plain. It is as plain as the nose on David Davidson's face.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Davidson: </strong>I think that Mr Rumbles missed a point that I made on priorities.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Rumbles: </strong>Oh no I did not.</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Our priorities 
are more about spending on infrastructure that the Executive parties' are. We 
have said what the figures are. That is only one example of how Mr Rumbles chooses 
to be different, I suppose.</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>David Davidson 
cons only himself with such comments. I refer to what he said in his speech. I 
wrote it down. He talked about poor council tax collection rates. In fact, excellent 
collection rates exist. For instance, Aberdeenshire Council, the authority that 
covers his and my areas, has a council tax collection rate of over 94 per cent. 
That is a long cry from poor collection rates under the poll tax, which the Tories 
introduced disastrously during their time in government.</P><P>We take no lessons 
from the Conservatives on how to produce a budget bill. It is a bit rich for them 
to criticise the bill and then talk about how they will invest our money in increased 
public services when their whole intention is to reduce taxation and reduce spending 
on public service. That is somewhat dishonest&#151;I am not sure whether I can 
use the word &quot;dishonest&quot; in the Parliament&#151;although perhaps not 
deliberately so. However, anyone listening to the debate would be very surprised 
to hear David Davidson's comments.</P><P>The bill is clearly beneficial to the 
people of Scotland. Overall, investment in public services is </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18241">18241</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>increasing in real terms. I wish in particular to highlight the increased investment 
in health, and I am pleased to see that the Minister for Health and Community 
Care is here to listen. Investment in health is, as the Deputy Minister for Finance 
and Public Services said, up by more than 8 per cent. The local government budget, 
which includes investment in schools, has increased dramatically too. That is 
real investment for improved public services.</P><P>While I very much welcome 
the increase in funds that the Executive has made available in the health budget, 
which means that the national health service in Grampian has more investment than 
ever before, it would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity to press once 
again for an early review of what I consider to be the inequitable Arbuthnott 
formula.</P><P>For the benefit of colleagues who are not aware of the problems 
faced by the NHS in Grampian as a result of the Arbuthnott formula, I will outline 
them in straightforward terms. Although Grampian has 10 per cent of Scotland's 
population and 10 per cent of the work load of the NHS in Scotland as measured 
by the NHS itself, we receive only 9 per cent of health funding&#151;because of 
the Arbuthnott formula. A deficit of 1 per cent may not sound much, but I can 
assure the Parliament that that results in a missing £44 million in the budget 
of the NHS in Grampian.</P><P>The Arbuthnott funding formula is simply not just. 
Health spending should be arranged on an equitable basis throughout Scotland.</P><P><strong>Brian 
Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>Will the member acknowledge that the 
Arbuthnott formula and some of the other financial strictures that have applied 
to the NHS in Grampian in recent years have led to an increase in waiting times 
and to a significant deterioration in the health service in Grampian relative 
to other parts of Scotland?</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>The Arbuthnott 
formula is only just kicking in at the moment. I am more concerned about what 
happens from now on, which is what we should focus on.</P><P><strong>Dr Richard 
Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>Will Mr Rumbles give way?</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: 
</strong>I will in a minute, but I have just taken an intervention.</P><P><strong>Dr 
Simpson: </strong>It is on that point.</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>Later 
on.</P><P>The easy way to end postcode prescribing is to ensure a level playing 
field in NHS funding across the country. It cannot be right that access to NHS 
services depends on where someone lives and is perhaps affected by the fact that 
their local health </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18242">18242</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>authority is underfunded in comparison with others. It is not enough simply 
to say that there is more money for everyone&#151;I accept that there is more 
money for everybody&#151;when some people are effectively more equal than others.</P><P>Apart 
from my obvious disagreement with the Executive over the Arbuthnott formula&#151;and 
I note that the Minister for Health and Community Care is at least listening to 
what I am saying&#151;and over the distribution of funding, I very much welcome 
the record level of investment in the NHS.</P><P><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>Does 
Mr Rumbles agree that life expectancy in Glasgow&#151;which is not of course my 
area&#151;is substantially lower than it is in his constituency, that unemployment 
is substantially higher there and that the extent of multiple deprivation there 
is massive? Does he agree that the Arbuthnott formula does not go far enough in 
tackling areas of multiple deprivation and that there have been real increases 
in funding in his constituency?</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>Here we come 
to the nub of the question. I am glad that Richard Simpson intervened to make 
that point, which illustrates the argument over what the Arbuthnott formula is 
doing. People must regularly appear in Richard Simpson's constituency surgeries, 
as they appear in mine, talking about the lack of funds that holds back access 
to health services and about how the health service in other parts of the country 
can provide access to particular treatments. He and I, and indeed the Minister 
for Health and Community Care, are well aware of that.</P><P>Nobody doubts that 
the extent of social deprivation is higher in Glasgow than it is in West Aberdeenshire 
and Kincardine&#151;I would be the first to accept that. The point, however, is 
that people should have access to NHS services at the same level, wherever they 
live. If we want to tackle social exclusion&#151;and I do&#151;we should tackle 
it on issues of housing, social security and so on, but not through the health 
budget.</P><P><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab): </strong>Will Mr Rumbles 
give way?</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>No&#151;I think that I have given 
way quite well on that point.</P><P><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>It is on another 
issue.</P><P><strong><A NAME="MakeMarkAuto_13"></A>Mr Rumbles: </strong>No. I 
would like to come to a conclusion.</P><P>The Liberal Democrats support the Budget 
(Scotland) (No 4) Bill, as it is good news for Scotland. It underpins the real 
achievements of the Executive, including the abolition of student tuition fees, 
the implementation of free personal care for the elderly, the McCrone deal for 
our teachers and the free central heating initiative for our pensioners to name 
just a few of them. The </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18243">18243</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>budget is delivering for the people of Scotland and deserves the full support 
of the Parliament.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Given 
the time that is available to us and the number of members who have indicated 
that they wish to speak, I expect to be able to call everyone. Members may speak 
for six minutes, if they wish&#151;although that is not compulsory.</P><P>16:05</P><P><strong>Mr 
Tom McCabe (Hamilton South) (Lab): </strong>I will be as brief as possible, to 
assist my colleagues.</P><P>The Finance Committee has examined the budget for 
a number of months and has built up a good, co-operative relationship with the 
Executive. I hope that that relationship will continue in the new session, once 
our successor committee has been established.</P><P>I agree with Alasdair Morgan 
about the quality of the documents that are now provided, which are considerably 
clearer than those that were provided in the past. At our stage 2 meeting with 
the Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services, we discussed that matter. 
Both the minister and his officials acknowledged that we still have some way to 
go in making the budget documents clearer.</P><P>On any objective analysis, this 
is a stunning budget for Scotland. It produces a £1.8 billion increase over the 
year. It provides funding for vital services, such as education, health and local 
government, with increases that were undreamed of just a few years ago. It maintains 
record numbers of police officers on our streets and raises the care of our elderly 
population to levels of excellence that a few years ago we could only dream of. 
In short, the budget provides a basis for significant improvements in the level 
of services and sustainable improvements in the quality of people's lives.</P><P>The 
budget is very welcome; scrutiny of the budget is not only welcome but necessary. 
I acknowledge the comments that have been made by some of my colleagues on the 
Finance Committee, who have suggested that the processes that we employ are occasionally 
repetitive. From the discussion that we had with the minister in committee a few 
days ago, I know that the Parliament and the Executive have a shared commitment 
to the continual review of our budget-setting processes, to ensure that we eliminate 
poor use of time and repetition. It will not do the Parliament, the committee 
system or any of us good if, so soon after the Parliament's creation, we do not 
review continually the processes that we employ.</P><P>I am not saying that significant 
advances have not been made&#151;of course they have. Our </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18244">18244</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>processes for budget scrutiny are far in advance of those of many other parliamentary 
institutions. However, we should never be complacent and we should always be prepared 
to review those processes.</P><P>I am concerned about our processes not just for 
the sake of the Parliament, but because I have genuine concern for our colleagues 
on the SNP and Conservative benches. It must be particularly difficult for them 
to have to discuss week after week a budget that delivers such a success story 
throughout Scotland. If that were not bad enough, we are required to do it again 
today&#151;just a few short weeks before the election.</P><P><strong>Alasdair 
Morgan: </strong>Does it occur to Mr McCabe that, if we have a problem filling 
up the time, we could usefully spend it discussing the entire amount of Government 
expenditure in Scotland and the entire amount of Government income raised in Scotland?</P><P><strong>Mr 
McCabe: </strong>Given the size of the increase in this budget and the very substantial 
increases to the overall Scottish budget, I would be happy to spend all night 
discussing the entirety of expenditure in Scotland. People the length and breadth 
of Scotland are delighted by the extent of that expenditure. They know in a real 
way how their quality of life has improved over the past few years. Alasdair Morgan 
has made a very good suggestion.</P><P>In a spirit of consensus, I suggest that 
the Executive and the Minister for Finance and Public Services accept that they 
have won the battle. It is now starting to look as if they are rubbing salt into 
the wounds of our colleagues on the Opposition benches. We have discussed the 
budget long enough. Let us accept that it is an exceptional budget. People throughout 
Scotland already know that and I am happy to endorse it.</P><P>16:09</P><P><strong>Stewart 
Stevenson (Banff and Buchan) (SNP): </strong>After the humour of McCabe comes 
the harsh reality of the numbers in the bill. In fact, I find numbers desperately 
exciting. The discovery in recent times of the 39<SUP>th</SUP> Mersenne prime&#151;which 
is 2<SUP>13,466,917 </SUP>-1, a number of 4 million digits&#151;is exciting beyond 
belief. I am sure that members share that excitement.</P><P>I am afraid that, 
as members would expect, I will refer to fisheries. I note that in the coming 
year we will see a reduction in expenditure from £67.8 million to £48.2 million, 
according to the budget documents. Perhaps that explains why, in the answer to 
my colleague Richard Lochhead's question S1W-33536 on where the £50 million for 
the fishing industry was coming from, the Executive had to say&#151;and I paraphrase&#151;that 
it is </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18245">18245</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>not possible to tell at this stage what will deliver the resources required. 
The Executive has to examine how it is funding its spending commitments. We will 
have no more talk about uncosted spending commitments from the SNP.</P><P>I will 
make a brief comment about the small business rates relief. One of my constituents 
has a retail outlet that is in two premises on opposite sides of the street. It 
is a small business but, because there are two premises, it does not qualify as 
such.</P><P>I refer to page 16 of the budget documents. I ask the minister whether, 
in calculating the percentage payments that are being made in the agriculture 
budget, the Executive is excluding claims that are being made and rejected because 
of the inefficiencies of the British Cattle Movement Service. It is easy to achieve 
objectives in completing the making of payments if we reject large numbers of 
claims through administrative inefficiencies.</P><P>I have a little question about 
pensions&#151;the minister had better have several pens. One of the first things 
that Gordon Brown did when Labour came to power in 1997 was to change the tax 
position of pension funds. That has taken some £31 billion out of pension funds, 
which is roughly equivalent to the current shortfall in the funds. On page 23 
of the budget documents, we see a sudden uplift in pension outgoings, which more 
than double under a heading on that page. I ask the minister what is going on 
there.</P><P>Rural transport is a matter of considerable interest in my constituency. 
The budget for rural transport measures in the coming year will rise from £5.9 
million to £6.3 million. That is good, but it does not sound like an awful lot 
of money. I see that reflected in my area. When I get the bus from Aberdeen to 
Peterhead, the journey of 34 miles costs me £4. The village of Whitehills, where 
I have stayed since being elected, is but 3 miles from Banff and the return bus 
fare is roughly the same. Therefore, a journey of 6 miles in a very rural part 
of my constituency costs much the same as a journey of 34 miles elsewhere.</P><P>We 
have heard today that Gaelic is on the downturn. On page 110 of the budget documents, 
we see a standstill budget for Gaelic education of £2.8 million. On page 121, 
we see a standstill in grants. On page 112, we see a 5 per cent uplift in the 
number of users of Gaelic education, despite a standstill budget. It would be 
interesting to hear the minister explain that.</P><P><strong>Maureen Macmillan 
(Highlands and Islands) (Lab): </strong>Is the member aware that Gaelic education 
has not taken a downturn? The downturn seems to have come about because of older 
people no longer being with us. In the younger generation, </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18246">18246</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>there is a big increase in the use of Gaelic.</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson: 
</strong>I thank Maureen Macmillan for making my point for me. Given that the 
census shows that the overall number of Gaelic speakers is dropping&#151;a matter 
that I very much regret&#151;it seems perverse that the budget to help to develop 
the next generation of Gaelic speakers is at a standstill, although even within 
that there seem to be conflicts.</P><P>In my intervention on the minister about 
broadband in the Highlands and Islands, I was making the point that availability 
of access will, according to the budget documents, remain at 30 per cent next 
year. Of course advertising will increase the uptake, which is good news. However, 
given that the Welsh Executive has found £115 million to create a level playing 
field for business use of broadband&#151;it is subsidising the use of satellite 
broadband in areas of Wales where cable broadband cannot be provided, so that 
the cost of satellite broadband is the same as the cost of ADSL connections, which 
cable provides&#151;it is disappointing that we are far short of that.</P><P><strong>Rhoda 
Grant (Highlands and Islands) (Lab): </strong>I have a point of information for 
Stewart Stevenson. Highlands and Islands Enterprise provides funding to allow 
businesses to access broadband on satellite. That has been a successful programme 
in the Highlands.</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Indeed it has been. 
The rest of Scotland&#151;in particular, my part of Scotland&#151;has no access 
whatever to broadband. It is interesting that even parts of Edinburgh do not have 
such access. The point is that, in spite of &quot;A Smart, Successful Scotland&quot;, 
there has been no uplift in the Highlands and Islands.</P><P><strong>The Deputy 
Presiding Officer: </strong>You are over time now.</P><P><strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> 
So I am. I must put my glasses on. I was using Tom McCabe's time.</P><P>To close, 
I will latch on to a point that is mentioned on page 180 of the budget documents. 
Earlier today, some observations were made on dental practice. I note that the 
income from charges that are collected by dental practitioners is expected to 
fall in the coming year. Does that mean that national health service dentistry 
will be less prevalent in the coming year?</P><P>16:16</P><P><strong>Lord James 
Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I will speak about the justice element 
of the budget. On 26 September, the First Minister admitted to the Parliament 
that police numbers would simply be maintained and would</P><P>&quot;increase 
and decrease slightly over time&quot;.&#151;[<em>Official Report</em>, 26 September 
2002; c 14199.]</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18247">18247</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>The Conservatives believe that that is simply not acceptable.</P><P>There are 
growing resource pressures on the police and added responsibilities&#151;for example, 
the incorporation of the European convention on human rights has had implications 
on search warrant procedures. Those implications, together with the impending 
introduction of victim statements under the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, 
the monitoring of the sex offenders register, the administration of alternatives 
to custody and other short-term initiatives, will mean that fewer police officers 
will be available at any given time.</P><P>&quot;Narrowing The Gap: Police visibility 
and public reassurance&#151;Managing public expectation and demand&quot; was published 
by HM inspectorate of constabulary last year. It noted that only 22.6 per cent 
of the total number of police officers are available for patrol or to attend incidents 
at any given time and that only 4 per cent of duty time is allocated to foot patrol. 
That means that, throughout Scotland, only 138 police officers are on foot patrol 
at any given time. The report also noted that more than 80 per cent of people 
agree that a more enhanced, targeted and visible police presence would make people 
feel safer and reduce and help to prevent crime.</P><P>In spite of the police 
service's increased responsibilities and the increasing demands from the public, 
the justice budget is set to increase by only 1.3 per cent, according to the Scottish 
Executive's projections in &quot;Building a Better Scotland: Spending Proposals 
2003-2006&quot;. That is simply not good enough, when violent crime is rising. 
The number of crimes involving handguns rose by 40 per cent in 2001. In that year, 
343 people were killed or injured in shootings in Scotland. The block grant has 
increased by some 22.5 per cent since 2000-01, so an increase of only 1.3 per 
cent for the justice budget in the projected period is not enough.</P><P>The police 
are not the only ones who are suffering. There is little point in police officers 
solving crime and arresting criminals if it takes for ever and a day for the cases 
to come to court. As we discussed this morning, our entire justice system is cracking 
at the seams. Lengthening delays help offenders to evade justice. We believe that 
an overhaul of the whole process is long overdue. The resources that are available 
should be given particular attention.</P><P><strong>Alasdair Morgan: </strong>In 
relation to police numbers and expenditure on the police, the member said twice 
that what was on offer was not good enough. I ask him to provide his definition 
of what would be good enough.</P><P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>We 
have given a commitment that we would increase </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18248">18248</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>resources for the police service by some £25 million. If the member wishes 
to know where that money would come from, I can tell him that it would come from 
more streamlined government&#151;we would cut the cost of government&#151;and 
from savings in the social justice budget.</P><P>We believe that our youth justice 
system is facing a crisis. Panel members must often make decisions based not on 
what is best for the young person or on what would achieve the best outcome, but 
on what resources are available. That is not the best way in which to conduct 
justice. In his written evidence to the Justice 1 Committee, Douglas Keil of the 
Scottish Police Federation stated:</P><P>&quot;A properly based decision to send 
someone to prison should not be frustrated through a lack of finance. Similarly, 
an alternative to custody should not be chosen because it is cheaper.&quot;</P><P>Another 
frustration of the system has been the use of initiative policing. One such example 
was part of the Executive's 10-point action plan on youth crime for a safer Scotland&#151;the 
initiative took place in October to December last year. During the campaign, there 
was to be high-visibility policing, which would be supported by a media campaign. 
I am interested to hear from the minister what happened to that campaign. Was 
there any higher-visibility policing? If there was, it was scarcely noticeable.</P><P><strong>Johann 
Lamont: </strong>I must point out that the successful high-visibility policing 
campaign in Pollok has reassured my constituents that those questions are being 
addressed at a local level.</P><P><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>I 
am glad to hear that, because it means that the member's campaign has had an effect. 
I would like to add to that effectiveness by ensuring that much greater resources 
are made available to make certain that the benefits that Johann Lamont's constituents 
have received are applicable to all constituents the length and breadth of Scotland.</P><P>As 
I mentioned, we want to see far more resources allocated to the justice budget, 
to the police force, to the criminal justice service and to children's hearings.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Rumbles: </strong>Will the member take an intervention?</P><P><strong>Lord James 
Douglas-Hamilton: </strong>No, I have already taken two questions and I must sum 
up.</P><P>That is one area where greatly increased funding will make a difference. 
We believe that we must have more police officers and fiscals operating at the 
sharp end. Crime disproportionately affects the poorer and more vulnerable persons 
in the community. We want to create a society that is free from crime and free 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18249">18249</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>from the fear of crime. To do that, more resources need to be put in place.</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I call Richard Simpson. Having done some calculations, 
I am quite happy to compensate for intervention time in addition to the six minutes 
for speeches, as we have a little bit of a margin.</P><P>16:22</P><P><strong>Dr 
Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>For a minute, I thought that the Presiding 
Officer was about to call someone else to speak.</P><P>I welcome this important 
budget, which provides for growth in our public services. In particular, I welcome 
the proposed increases in the health service budget. However, we need to recognise 
that such an investment will bring with it a number of challenges.</P><P>The first 
challenge is, quite correctly, the need to invest in staff. Earlier today, we 
heard about the agreement on the minimum wage for the poorest paid within the 
health service. That is an entirely appropriate measure, which recognises the 
real contribution that has been made to the service by porters, cleaners, auxiliary 
nurses and others who have been badly paid in the past.</P><P>The need for effective 
integrated team working is absolutely crucial. It is vital that we break down 
the boundaries between primary and secondary care if we are to have a modern service. 
However, I must tell the minister that, only the other day, I heard of a secretary 
in my constituency whose job was advertised only in the week on which she was 
due to leave, despite her having given three months' notice. Not only does that 
indicate the value that managers place on secretaries, but it shows that managers 
fail to appreciate how their actions can place patient care in jeopardy. In that 
case, the result was that one of my constituents did not receive the results of 
a 24-hour heart monitor for two months. I ask members to imagine what anxiety 
that must create.</P><P>Alongside the challenge of using the money to make the 
additional necessary investment in our staff, there is the challenge of modernisation. 
Lord James dealt with justice, which I will return to in a minute. In relation 
to health, however, it is vital that, if the massive investment is to be utilised, 
it must go alongside innovation. I strongly commend the creation of the change 
and innovation centre, which I hope will be given the teeth and authority to tackle 
those health boards that fail to respond to best practice and innovation, that 
fail to meet the challenges set by of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland 
and that fail to respond to the Audit Scotland reports that we repeatedly receive. 
Change and innovation are needed and must be monitored in relation to the performance 
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18250">18250</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>assessment framework.</P><P>Let me give some concrete examples. Cardiac surgeons 
in Glasgow continue to insert pacemakers when that is done by physicians in most 
parts of the world. That costs my health board £25,000 an implant, when the same 
service could be provided for £15,000. That is like setting a light under £200,000 
of my local health service's money. However, the local health board cannot get 
out of their contracts with the Glasgow surgeon. We have to cut those Gordian 
knots.</P><P>We have nurse endoscopists in various parts of the country, including 
Fife, which led the way&#151;Margaret Jamieson's constituency now has such nurses, 
too. The use of those nurses reduces endoscopy waiting lists to zero. In my health 
board area, where there are no nurse endoscopists, there are apparently hard-pressed 
gastroenterologists and the waiting lists are massive.</P><P>I say to Mike Rumbles 
that the issue is as much about modernisation and the effective use of money as 
it is about increasing real resources. Health boards across the country are not 
achieving the optimum number of day cases and far too many people are still having 
in-patient procedures. That creates major problems. We allow restrictive practices 
to prevent change. We do not employ one nurse anaesthetist in Scotland and yet, 
in America, nurses account for 25 per cent of anaesthetists. Such restrictive 
practices challenge our budgets even when we are having very real funding increases. 
We should consider that issue closely.</P><P>The change and innovation centre 
must consider the proposals that are coming through and deal with them quickly. 
For example, there is a proposal for day care knee arthroscopy, under a local 
anaesthetic. It has taken two years to consider that innovative practice, the 
use of which would substantially reduce the waiting lists in my area, which are 
the longest in Scotland. That is just one example of many that I could give. We 
need to ensure that innovations are at the top of health boards' agendas, given 
that often it is the health boards that are blocking the innovations.</P><P><strong>Margaret 
Jamieson (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (Lab): </strong>As Dr Simpson says, there is 
a lot of good practice in the health service. However, professional barriers are 
not coming down to allow patients to benefit from the record levels of investment. 
I ask the minister to ensure that there is enough detail in the budget to allow 
us to measure outcomes. Previously, although money has been going in, we have 
not been able to measure the results. Through facilities such as Audit Scotland 
and clinical audit, we should be able to see the health benefits of what we are 
putting in.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18251">18251</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>In the brief time that I have left, I will turn 
to two other issues. Having been off the Finance Committee for a year and then 
returned, I am still disappointed that the Opposition parties are not coming up 
with fundamental proposals to change the budget. They suggest such projects as 
the A9 dualling, which would cost £500 million, but where was the proposal to 
amend the budget?</P><P>David Davidson talked about the changes that the Conservatives 
would make. Why were those changes not proposed earlier? The Parliament gives 
members that opportunity. It is much more democratic than Westminster. However, 
over the past four years, Opposition members have singularly failed to make any 
significant proposals for changes to the budget, so they cannot complain about 
it.</P><P>I will finish by talking about justice. The issue is not just about 
increasing money for the police; it is about the use to which the police are put. 
We have to alter the core functions of the police and remove from them escort 
duties, court custody work, serving of citations, lost property work&#151;my God, 
are they still doing that?&#151;and finding lost dogs. The Government's additional 
investment&#151;in improved communication, among other things&#151;will not just 
increase the number of police, but make those that we have much more visible and 
available in the community.</P><P>I hope that that investment, combined with the 
work of Bonomy and McInnes&#151;who should report this year&#151;will reduce the 
number of police personnel abstractions, which make it difficult for the police 
forces to work. We need to take into account&#151;I say this sincerely to the 
Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services&#151;the working time directive 
in relation to police duties. The way in which the police are required to attend 
court at the moment has a profound, negative effect on our system. We cannot allow 
the police to ignore the working time directive. They have to be brought into 
the proposals, which will cost us a lot of time and money. We need to examine 
that issue carefully.</P><P>16:30</P><P><strong>Tavish Scott (Shetland) (LD): 
</strong>I am not a member of the Finance Committee, and in entering this rarefied 
air of consideration of the budget in such detail I feel somewhat of an interloper, 
but I agree with Richard Simpson's point about the need for the Opposition parties 
to illustrate what they would do differently. My party does that at Westminster, 
and while the Government of the day disagrees with it, at least the debate is 
about alternative proposals. It is an important principle of opposition politics 
in Parliament that Opposition parties produce their own fundamental budget proposals.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18252">18252</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>First, I will concentrate briefly on a small area of the environment budget&#151;the 
Scottish community renewables initiative&#151;which is a new area of expenditure 
funded from that budget block. It is a grant scheme for communities and individuals 
to provide for the installation of green energy supplies for projects such as 
community halls or homes. The days in my part of Scotland, or indeed in many members' 
parts of Scotland, where the condition of old snooker tables in community halls 
gets worse because there is no heat can be done away with under the scheme, because 
it can provide for a clean, renewable energy source that is always on. That ensures 
that heating is available for youth clubs and sports clubs where communities are 
unable to afford the cost of heating such facilities. The initiative is important 
in policy terms and in terms of practical improvements for the people who live 
in our communities.</P><P>For community projects, the green power can come from 
a wind turbine, solar panels, hydro, wave, geothermal or biomass. For such projects 
there is a £10,000 maximum grant for a feasibility study, followed by up to £100,000 
grant aid for the capital cost. The community projects must, of course, be non-profit 
distributing. That is an important area, and it is an important grant scheme that 
is being provided by the Scottish Executive in this Budget Bill. There is a householder 
scheme on top of the community scheme.</P><P>The feedback from Highlands and Islands 
Enterprise's energy office in Kirkwall, which is handling the scheme, is that 
it is generating such high demand that the budget may not meet the demand. I ask 
the minister to work with colleagues in other departments to examine extra funding 
for the scheme, because it is precisely the sort of scheme that can make a big 
difference to community groups and individuals the length and breadth of Scotland. 
Community and domestic renewable energy schemes are welcome and valued in their 
own right, but they are just the tip of the renewables iceberg.</P><P>My second 
point relates to Scotland's ability to target and harness renewable resources. 
There are currently only 13 operational windfarms in Scotland, but as many as 
760 new wind turbines in up to 40 windfarms will be needed over the next 10 years 
if the Executive is to meet its renewables targets. The 40 per cent target that 
is currently being consulted on is even more challenging. That is why tidal and 
wave technologies are so important.</P><P>Renewables offer the chance to do something 
for the environment and future generations; at the same time, they offer enterprise 
opportunities, which must be important in the context of debates </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18253">18253</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>that are happening, and have happened this week in Parliament, on economic 
growth and gross domestic product figures. Scotland has the chance, which must 
not be missed, to take a lead in wave and tidal current power. The Danes in particular 
have already grasped the immense benefits of leading in wind turbine manufacturing.</P><P>Scotland's 
universities can be at the forefront of wave power research. It is particularly 
important that the enterprise budget concentrates on that area, and that the excellent 
work of the research assessment exercise ensures that research is married to engineering 
and construction skills. There is an opportunity to transfer the hard-won skills 
of our offshore oil industry to offshore renewables. In the week when BP made 
it clear that its long-term strategy was to move away from Alaska and the mature 
North sea fields towards investments in Russia, it is vital for the north-east 
not to lose the skills in Aberdeen and the surrounding communities as companies 
take strategic decisions to transfer to other parts of the globe.</P><P>Tidal 
power has great potential and a prototype was tested successfully in my constituency 
in Yell sound last year. The 1993 Department of Trade and Industry survey found 
that 10 per cent of the UK's electricity demand could be met by harnessing the 
tidal currents of the Pentland firth alone, which would provide enough electricity 
for the whole of Scotland.</P><P>I hope that, in future budget bills, the Deputy 
Minister for Finance and Public Services will make proposals that concentrate 
on and harness renewable energy resources. To provide power where it is needed&#151;in 
the population centres in the central belt of Scotland and throughout the United 
Kingdom&#151;the Scottish Executive and the UK Government have an important role 
in providing subsea cables. Investment in such strategic infrastructure will be 
needed from public money, European money and private money to benefit the energy 
policy that the country needs.</P><P>The budget delivers much throughout the public 
services, but it is in the detailed matters, and particularly projects such as 
the Scottish community renewables initiative, that MSPs and Parliament can make 
a difference to people from Shetland to Stranraer and can show that budget bills 
are about not only vast quantities of money, but real differences to people in 
their local communities. On that basis, I have great pleasure in commending the 
bill to Parliament.</P><P>16:36</P><P><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander (Paisley North) 
(Lab): </strong>In the spirit of Richard Simpson's speech, I did not want to miss 
the opportunity to liven proceedings up a little. Harold Wilson once said:</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18254">18254</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>&quot;A week is a long time in politics&quot;,</P><P>and I thought that I might 
review the past week from the Executive's perspective. This week, interest rates 
were cut to their lowest level for almost 50 years and the level of unemployment 
in Scotland fell again. Since 1997, 134,000 more people have found employment, 
and more than 1,000 people per constituency have gone back into work since the 
Parliament was established. This week, a series of public spending announcements 
has been made. All that was delivered in a week that has seen darkening days for 
the world economy. It has been a sound week indeed.</P><P><strong>Alasdair Morgan: 
</strong>The member said that she would review the Executive's week. She is now 
talking about delivery. Did the Executive deliver the interest rates reduction?</P><P><strong>Ms 
Alexander: </strong>As the member knows, the Executive is committed to the current 
constitutional settlement. He timed his intervention beautifully to allow me to 
move on to the fact that a week is a long time in politics for Opposition parties. 
For the next 10 weeks, the case that I imagine Alasdair Morgan will make is for 
the right to govern Scotland, interest rates included.</P><P>What have we learned 
about the SNP's budget proposals in the past week? Members will recall that, in 
the 1970s, the SNP bandwagon stalled because, suddenly, people in Scotland realised 
that the SNP was all things to all people. In the past four years, we have heard 
from the Opposition that all that has changed. We should review that in the light 
of the past week.</P><P>Last Friday, Andrew &quot;Gizza job&quot; Wilson, who 
is not here&#151;perhaps he is looking for a job now&#151;announced that he agrees 
with &quot;A Smart, Successful Scotland&quot;. It is more than two years since 
the document was published, but we welcome all converts, even late ones.</P><P>The 
SNP's only difference on enterprise policy is that it wants to cut £150 million 
from the enterprise budget. No other budgets would face cuts from that pro-enterprise 
party, but £150 million will be slashed from the enterprise budget by amalgamating 
local enterprise companies. Members with long memories will remember that, sometimes, 
the SNP has trouble with its arithmetic&#151;calculators and all that&#151;so 
this morning, I read Scottish Enterprise's operating plan. It has a total administration 
budget of £90 million and the LECs have a total administration budget of £40 million. 
We can assume that if the LECs are amalgamated, half the LEC admin budget will 
be saved&#151;a princely £20 million. That means that the SNP has to find another 
£130 million to fund its promised 1 per cent cut in public spending.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18255">18255</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>I have good news for the SNP&#151;it can manage that. If the SNP were to cut 
Careers Scotland in its entirety, along with every single one of the 25,000 modern 
apprenticeships, and if it were to cancel all the institutes of technology, that 
would get the figure up to £128 million. The SNP would still have to find another 
£2 million, but perhaps Brian Adam will enlighten us in his closing speech. Today's 
debate is a chance for the SNP finance team to tell the chamber where the money 
will come from. Those of us on the coalition benches will hound the SNP at every 
business breakfast up and down the country until we have the answer.</P><P>If 
a week was a long time in politics for Andrew Wilson, what about John Swinney 
on Thursday, parading the fact that the SNP is opposed to public-private partnerships? 
The SNP tells the private sector that it can be involved in building Scotland's 
infrastructure only on a not-for-profit basis; I am sure that that will have the 
shareholders queuing up.</P><P>The SNP finance spokespeople should do their duty 
today and tell the chamber which of the contracts that are currently under negotiation&#151;I 
am thinking of the PPPs for all the schools in Edinburgh or Renfrewshire or the 
PPP for the primary schools in Glasgow&#151;will be cancelled under its plans, 
or whether its convictions of today will be casually discarded in the weeks ahead.</P><P>When 
it comes to a week being a long time in politics, the SNP's third finance proposal 
of the past week was made as recently as Tuesday. Kenny MacAskill announced the 
re-nationalisation of all of the train companies' operating assets on, and I quote, 
a &quot;cost neutral&quot; basis&#151;300 trains and sleepers for free?</P><P>It 
has been a revealing week when it comes to opposition politics. The only budget 
that the SNP proposes to cut is the enterprise budget. The SNP is going to cancel 
PFI schemes up and down the country and re-nationalise ScotRail without compensation. 
Is that a pro-enterprise agenda? The SNP is not pro-enterprise; it is simply pro-promises. 
It is every bit as much all things to all people today as it was 30 years ago. 
The SNP has already proposed one public spending cut to the enterprise budget. 
If it were to tell the truth, how many more cuts would follow?</P><P>The coalition 
will not cut spending to punish the poor. We will not cut public spending to curry 
favour with this or that group in Scotland. The SNP tells us that it wants to 
be a grown-up party and that it wants to show fiscal prudence and financial responsibility. 
I say to the SNP that, in 5 minutes' time, it should take its chance to be a grown-up 
party.</P><P>I would like the SNP to tell me how, with the one cut that it has 
promised to make in public </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18256">18256</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>spending&#151;which happens to be in the enterprise budget&#151;it will pay 
for everything. So far, the SNP has told the chamber how it will pay for £20 million.

(North-East Scotland) (SNP): </strong>We are having yet another debate on the 
budget. Some members have contributed positively and some serious speeches have 
been made. Other speeches were of a more light-hearted nature&#151;I am thinking 
of the Finance Committee convener's contribution&#151;and some members continue 
to pose questions of the Opposition. Wendy Alexander's speech was interesting, 
although this is the lady who suggested that the Labour party had not come up 
with one good idea in the past 100 years. Perhaps posing questions, when the answers 
to those questions are a matter of public record, was the height of the contribution 
she was able to make.</P><P>She set out to peddle a series of lies&#151;[<em>Interruption.</em>]</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>The term &quot;terminological inexactitude&quot; 
springs to mind.</P><P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>Yes, indeed. I take your point,

language might be something with which the member to whom I was referring is familiar, 
particularly in the light of her clear ignorance of how the railway system works.</P><P>There 
were significant problems with the permanent way and the privatised arrangements.

<P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>The SNP has set out precisely what it intends 
to do with regard to PFI/PPP, which is, as several audit reports have clearly 
identified, the most expensive alternative. [M<FONT SIZE="-1">EMBERS</FONT>: &quot;Yes 
or no?&quot;] Do members want the answers or not?</P><P>PPP does not work. We 
heard a great exposition this morning of why the Highlands and Islands Airports 
Ltd arrangements at Inverness airport do not work. The height of ambition in the 
budget documents is that, during the next four years, the Executive hopes to increase 
passenger numbers by 5 per cent, whereas most airports are looking for double-digit 
growth. That is exactly the sort of lack of ambition and failure to deliver that 
PPP represents. Indeed, Labour members were complaining about that.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Davidson: </strong>Does Mr Adam agree that the SNP group on Aberdeenshire Council 
voted overwhelmingly to support PPP for schools?</P><P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>The 
SNP has proposed, and Aberdeenshire Council has accepted, that because the SNP 
will not go down the PPP route, the council will look at a not-for-profit trust. 
Mr Davidson knows that well.</P><P>My colleague Mr Morgan made reference to business 
rates. We have failed to hear sensible answers from ministers on several occasions, 
but the Budget Bill shows that a clear increase is expected from non-domestic 
rate income in the coming year. There has been no sensible explanation of why 
that will be the case. It could be the result of great confidence in growth of 
the economy, which the figures do not support, or it could be that there will 
be an increase in tax levied on business in the coming year as a consequence of 
the forthcoming valuation. Which is it?</P><P><strong>Ms Alexander: </strong>Will 
the member give way?</P><P><strong>Brian Adam: </strong>No, thank you.</P><P>We 
heard some significant contributions today from Mr Rumbles. He spoke eloquently 
about why the budget arrangements do not work, but then said that he supported 
the budget. He made a complaint, rightly, about how the distribution formula does 
not deliver for his constituents, who also happen to be my constituents. In terms 
of how the distribution formula works, we do not have appropriate and robust measures 
to determine whether the additional funds that are given to address deprivation 
and other factors are delivering.</P><P>Dr Simpson was right to suggest that the 
Glasgow area has significantly more problems with health than almost anywhere 
else. However, we do not have evidence to show that additional funding targeted 
at that area is delivering. We do not know the outcomes. It is true to say that 
more money is being allocated to various areas of the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18258">18258</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>budget, but we are not seeing the changes in outcomes that the public are looking 
for. People are looking for changes such as reductions in crime, more convictions, 
and more staff to deliver faster service in the health service. However, we do 
not have any evidence that such things are happening.</P><P>Tom McCabe was certainly 
at great pains to suggest that the budget was fantastic: he tried to create the 
perception of success. The problem is that the public do not have such a perception, 
which is a reflection of the outcomes so far, not of the amounts of money that 
are available.</P><P>It is true to say that we tend to focus a lot on the budget 
process. Dr Simpson suggested that one of the problems with the process is that 
there are no amendments before Parliament today. However, that is because we were 
not allowed to lodge any amendments for today's debate. The Public Finance and 
Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000 does not allow any amendments to be lodged 
at this stage in the process. This year, for the first time ever, a properly reasoned 
amendment to the bill was lodged. It did not attract sufficient support, but at 
least some progress has been made along those lines.</P><P>The Finance Committee 
had an interesting discussion about the future of the budget process. The minister 
indicated that he was willing to review the process and, indeed, to have another 
look at the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) 2000. I suggest that, 
in that regard, the zero-sum budgeting arrangements do not allow adequate debate 
or give an adequate opportunity for individual members, parliamentary committees 
or the political parties to develop alternatives. However, I should point out 
that not everything in the budget has been decided on a party-political basis; 
much of the work that has been done on the budget in the subject committees and 
in the Finance Committee has had a consensual basis&#151;and rightly so. [<em>Interruption.</em>]</P><P>I 
see that you are telling me that it is time for me to wind up, Presiding Officer. 
I am more than happy to do so.</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>On a point of 
order, Presiding Officer. Will you advise me whether it is the case that amendments 
to the budget bill are not allowed? If they are allowed, will you tell us when 
they should be lodged?</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Offhand, 
my opinion is that it is not possible for anyone other than the Executive to amend 
the budget process at this stage.</P><P><strong>Mr Rumbles: </strong>At this stage?</P><P><strong>The

<P><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Yes. However, I think that there 
was an amendment at stage 1. It is possible to lodge amendments at that point.</P><P><strong>Johann 
Lamont: </strong>On a point of order, Presiding Officer. Am I right in thinking 
that there is nothing to preclude any party in the chamber from publishing its 
own document to stand beside the Parliament's budget document?</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>I do not think that that is a point of order. 
Indeed, I think that the member knows the answer to her own question.</P><P>Now 
that Mr Adam has finished, I should thank members for overrunning on their speeches 
for once. Minister, you have eight minutes to respond to the debate.</P><P>16:53</P><P><strong>Peter 
Peacock: </strong>The debate has risen well beyond the expectations that we had 
before it began, particularly with the speeches from Tom McCabe, Wendy Alexander 
and Richard Simpson, to which I will return in a minute.</P><P>I will try to pick 
up as many points as I can. Alasdair Morgan requested that we should put a date 
on future documents. I am sure that we can rise easily to that challenge&#151;it 
is considerably easier than dealing with proper amendments to the budget. Notwithstanding 
what I think Mr Morgan said from a sedentary position a minute ago, it is entirely 
possible for members to lodge amendments to the budget at an earlier stage. Indeed, 
one SNP member did so. Regrettably, we could not agree to the substance of the 
amendment itself, but the example serves to highlight the point that Richard Simpson, 
Johann Lamont and others raised, which is that the SNP and the Tories have made 
not one suggestion about how they would change the budget in any material respect. 
None of the promises that they have made the length and breadth of Scotland over 
the past few weeks has been backed up with any supporting evidence in the chamber 
and there have been no proposals that would affect Scotland's expenditure plans. 
People should see such promises in that light.</P><P>Alasdair Morgan raised the 
issue of business rates yet again. I am happy to confirm that, as part of next 
year's budget, the Executive will freeze business rates. That will further continue 
a process of harmonisation north and south of the border. Mr Morgan also mentioned 
the future non-domestic rates revaluation. He knows as well as I do that revaluations 
per se do not affect the total amount of money in the Executive's yield. Instead, 
they affect distribution between sectors of the economy. The yield difference 
comes from growth in the economy and from new businesses starting and expanding. 
That also answers the point that </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18260">18260</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>David Davidson made on that matter.</P><P>David Davidson for the Tories indicated 
that there was a lot of waste in the budget, but he did not identify a single 
item that he would cut. If he makes such points, he has a responsibility to indicate 
where the cuts would fall. We know full well that the Tory plans to cut public 
services are apparent to everybody who wants to examine them.</P><P><strong>Mr 
Davidson: </strong>Perhaps we might return to some of the points that I raised 
in the earlier parts of the budget process, such as the amount of money that seems 
to be wasted on administration in the Scottish Executive. That is not to mention 
the building project down the bottom of the road, which adds up to several million 
pounds.</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Again, those are sweeping generalisations. 
It is dead easy for the member to say that he would make savings in Government 
administration without pointing to a single way in which he would seek to do that.</P><P>In 
relation to the point David Davidson made about council tax rises, there is comparatively 
good news throughout Scotland today. As he indicated, the council tax increases 
are between 3 per cent and 4 per cent, but at the same time spending on local 
services is growing by over 8 per cent. That seems to be a good deal for the local 
taxpayer. It is exactly the opposite to what used to happen under the Conservative 
Administrations of the past.</P><P><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>While the minister 
is on the subject of improving local services, is he aware that when the City 
of Edinburgh Council's budget was being announced and the Labour group's budget 
was being adopted today, the Conservative and Liberal Democrat opposition members 
voted against a proposal for 36 additional police officers in Edinburgh to focus 
on antisocial behaviour? Sadly, the Scottish National Party member was not present 
for the budget debate.</P><P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>That is extremely 
revealing information, particularly in the light of what Lord James Douglas-Hamilton 
told us earlier about the Conservatives' commitment to justice. Perhaps Angus 
MacKay's point reveals their true intentions in that respect.</P><P>Mike Rumbles 
made a number of good points about the budget providing growth and opportunity 
for Scotland and the good news contained in the budget. He also pointed to the 
good news in relation to local authority budgets and highlighted extremely well 
the Tories' service-cutting intentions.</P><P>Tom McCabe made a scintillating 
contribution to the debate. Not only was he full of praise for the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18261">18261</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>Executive and its co-operation with the Finance Committee and not only did 
he illustrate that the budget process is improving, but he revealed that it is 
a stunning budget for Scotland. It tackles Scotland's priorities and increases 
police numbers, among many other things. He pointed out the significant improvements 
over a sustained period of time that will be brought about by this budget and 
budgets to come. He also pointed out the extreme difficulties of the SNP and the 
Tories in having to discuss the budget eight times in the course of the budget 
process because it contains such good news. Far from me rubbing salt into the 
wounds, Tom McCabe did that extremely effectively himself.</P><P>Stewart Stevenson 
raised so many points that I will have to write to him about them in due course, 
although preparing answers to what were ill-informed questions might come under 
the category of disproportionate cost. If he cares to speak to his colleague Brian 
Adam, he will find that we have already written to him about most of the points 
Stewart Stevenson raised and that we qualified and satisfied those points.</P><P>Richard 
Simpson made a thoughtful contribution about the budget, not only in relation 
to the extra cash for health and police services. He made the point that it is 
not money alone that will improve services, but innovation and modernisation. 
It is about rolling out best practice throughout Scotland and rolling it out much 
faster than we have in the past. It is about ensuring that everybody in the public 
sector is up to the standards of the best.</P><P><strong>Mr Davidson </strong><em>rose&#151;</em></P><P><strong>Peter 
Peacock: </strong>I have already given way and I will not do so now.</P><P>Margaret 
Jamieson also made an extremely important point about the outcomes of health spending 
in the Scottish budget. I tell her that there have been recent discussions between 
the Finance Committee and health department officials to try to ensure that there 
is more visibility in exactly those kinds of areas.</P><P>Wendy Alexander made 
an extremely helpful contribution in pointing out that Scotland has a huge opportunity 
for future prosperity arising from our firm place in the United Kingdom. The consequences 
of our stable place in the United Kingdom are the lowest interest rates on record, 
consistently low inflation and lower unemployment than we have had for generations. 
That is in stark contrast to the risk and uncertainty that would arise from the 
divorce from the UK that the SNP promises and all the cuts in public services 
that would follow that strategy.</P><P>Through the Budget (Scotland) (No 4) Bill,

and Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act 1976, which is currently under review? That 
act ought to be repealed, rather than consolidated, because it criminalises angling 
in many parts of Scotland. Instead of improving access it has, in fact, deprived 
many ordinary people of the right to fish the rivers and lochs of Scotland. Will 
you therefore consider a suspension of standing orders so that we can debate that 
repressive legislation at a later date?</P><P><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>No.

I read this afternoon and which is being used for the first time in this chamber, 
says that a consolidation bill is not open to debate. However, the Salmon and 
Freshwater Fisheries (Consolidation) (Scotland) Bill Committee's report recommended 
that the Procedures Committee should have a look at the standing order, and I 
have no doubt that that will be part of its current review. At the moment, however, 
I am bound by the standing order, and I therefore call on Colin Boyd simply to 
move the motion, although there will be no debate on it.</P><P><em>Motion moved,</em></P><P>That

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Water Supplies (Lead Pipes)</STRONG></P><P> <strong>The 
Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </STRONG>The final item of business 
is a members' business debate on motion S1M-3774, in the name of Robert Brown, 
on lead pipes in drinking water supplies. The debate will be concluded without 
any question being put. Members who wish to contribute to the debate should press 
their request-to-speak buttons now.</P><P><em>Motion debated,</em></P><P>That 
the Parliament notes the continued presence of lead pipes in both parts of the 
Scottish Water infrastructure and many domestic and business water supplies; notes 
the serious health hazards associated with lead in drinking water; notes the implications 
for the treatment of water supplies by Scottish Water and the unreliable nature 
of information as to the location of such lead pipes, and considers that an urgent 
review of the issue is needed and that action should be taken to ensure the removal 
of all lead pipes from drinking water supplies in Scotland as soon as possible 
and, specifically, to tackle the removal of lead pipes in Glasgow's older tenement 
areas.</P><P>17:07</P><P><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD): </strong>For a moment, 
I thought from the number of people in the gallery that a large number of people 
were interested in the debate, but that has turned out not to be the case.</P><P>Nevertheless, 
lead in water supplies is a serious problem, particularly for babies and children. 
It is recognised as a priority for public health action at national and international 
level and is a child development issue, as lead stays in the tissues for long 
periods and has long-term effects.</P><P>In the United States, a recent study 
found that around 4.4 per cent of children between one and five years old have 
blood lead levels above 10 micrograms per decilitre&#151;members should pay attention 
to the figures that I mention. Elevated levels of lead were found significantly 
more often in black children, children from low-income families and children who 
live in urban areas. Lead toxicity was found to be associated with decreases in 
intelligence quotient test scores&#151;a two to three-point decrease in the test 
score for every increase of 10 micrograms per decilitre in the blood lead level.</P><P>Elevated 
blood lead levels are also associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including 
attention deficit disorder, behavioural disturbances, learning disabilities and 
deficits in fine and gross motor development. Toxic effects on the central nervous 
system and resultant long-term neurobehavioural and cognitive deficits occur even 
with mildly elevated blood lead levels.</P><P>The European Union's drinking water 
directive 98/83/EC requires compliance with tighter </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18269">18269</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>standards by 25 December 2003. A maximum level in water of 25 micrograms per 
litre will replace the current level of 50 micrograms per litre. The standard 
will be further reduced to 10 micrograms per litre by the end of 2013.</P><P>In 
Scotland, a report from the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health, 
which was commissioned by the Scottish Executive, is due within the next few weeks. 
However, an earlier SCIEH report in November 2000 found that 15 per cent of new 
homes in Scotland had excess lead levels&#151;in fact, that figure rose to 30 
per cent in the houses most recently built at that time.</P><P>Like most people, 
I was broadly aware that lead in water is bad and that lead pipes in domestic 
water supplies were gradually being removed, but I confess that I had not considered 
or pursued the issue further, but a few weeks ago I was invited to a meeting&#151;organised 
by Hillhead community council&#151;with a representative of Scottish Water, at 
which people from the council and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency were 
present. Pauline McNeill and Sandra White were also there.</P><P>What I heard 
alarmed me greatly. Essentially, Scottish Water does not know where there are 
still lead pipes in its infrastructure, but it thinks that there are probably 
quite a few connections into the water supply in which its bit, as well as the 
house owner's bit, are still made of lead. Just as bad is the unknown extent to 
which non-lead pipes have been joined by lead solder.</P><P>I understand that 
the use of lead solder in domestic water pipes is illegal under 1986 byelaws, 
but that it is cheaper and easier for plumbers to use. To its credit, the Scottish 
Executive tried to tackle the problem after the November 2000 report, but the 
problem is by its nature extremely difficult to stop and remedy. To complicate 
matters more, some people have lead-lined storage containers in their attics.</P><P>The 
lead solder problem showed up specifically in new houses but, as the American 
study implies, it is probable that the worst problems arise in old tenements such 
as those that predominate in many parts of Glasgow, not least in areas such as 
Hillhead. Scottish Water confirmed that it has discovered highish levels of lead 
content in water in areas such as Hillhead, but since it does not know the extent 
or location of lead pipes or lead soldered pipes it has to flush phosphate through 
some parts of the supply to control the extent to which there is lead in the system.</P><P>It 
will probably not be possible to attain the 2013 standard by using phosphate treatment; 
it will be necessary to go further and look for different methods of tackling 
the problem. It seems to me that this serious issue has to be tackled </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18270">18270</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>comprehensively. It is necessary to stop plumbers using lead solder by whatever 
means are necessary. We must bear in mind that lead solder is commonly used&#151;because 
it is cheaper&#151;for central heating systems. It is also necessary to identify 
areas where there is a concentrated problem, such as the old tenements, to establish 
what technical issues there are in replacing the pipes and to declare some areas 
free of lead if possible. Above all, we need to target the specific issue of lead 
in drinking water in tenements. There is a heavier concentration of people in 
tenements and there are more likely to be relics of old pipes either in the supply 
from the street or, more likely, in the main supply pipe going up and down the 
building and in the individual domestic supplies.</P><P>When renovation has been 
done to the building, it may have been difficult to get at the main supply for 
the tenement, which might therefore have been left where it was. I am bound to 
say that the information that I got put me off tap water altogether and I would 
be unenthusiastic about using tap water in old offices where the same problems 
apply&#151;perhaps to an even greater extent.</P><P>I understand that in West 
Lothian there is a joint scheme between Scottish Water and West Lothian Council 
to replace tenement pipes. In Clermiston in Edinburgh, a pilot scheme that links 
replacement of Scottish Water's pipework with encouragement to owners to replace 
their pipes at the same time has had modest success and has thrown up lots of 
specific problems.</P><P>This problem has been with us for many years; it is high 
time that we dealt with it properly. The matter is bedevilled by technical problems, 
illegal activities by plumbers and inadequately completed modernisations. We pride 
ourselves on the purity of water in Scotland; we certainly have plenty of it. 
The reality is that a significant part of the supply to our homes&#151;in new 
houses and more insidiously in old houses&#151;is contaminated by lead. I hope 
that the minister is able to give us some degree of comfort on those issues in 
his reply.</P><P>17:13</P><P><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP): 
</strong>I will make a brief speech. I was not very aware of the issue, so I tried 
to make myself a bit more aware of it before tonight. I found an article on the 
BBC news website about the situation back in 2000 when the &quot;Frontline Scotland&quot; 
programme investigated the problems of lead in new developments. I must admit 
that I was not highly aware of that aspect of the situation. I am shocked by the 
figures. Up to 30 per cent of new homes built in 2000 had drinking water contaminated 
by lead. That was caused, as Robert Brown said, by the illegal use of lead solders 
to join copper pipes. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18271">18271</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>It is a concerning situation, particularly given that even very low levels 
of contamination by lead can have an impact on young children. It is also very 
concerning for pregnant women.</P><P>Some developers and builders must know what 
the plumbers on their sites are doing&#151;I find it hard to believe that plumbers 
are doing such things off their own back. Such people have a blatant disregard 
for human health and the law. We must find out what more can be done.</P><P>The 
BBC article contains a comment from Dr Pauline Upton, who is a consultant in public 
health. She said that although adults are unlikely to be affected by lead poisoning 
unless the levels are very high,</P><P>&quot;Children and babies are particularly 
vulnerable to the effects of lead poisoning, so it is important that parents follow 
... advice.&quot;</P><P>What advice are parents and pregnant women getting about 
lead in water? It is important that such people get advice, as that could reduce 
the risk of their being affected by lead.</P><P>We need answers to our questions. 
Robert Brown mentioned what Scottish Water is doing to discover problems in its 
supply&#151;that issue must be addressed. I appreciate that the Scottish Executive 
tried to tackle the problem after the Scottish new homes lead survey in 2000. 
We are awaiting another report and it will be interesting to see the figures, 
but we must know now what further measures will be taken to address the problem.</P><P>In 
East Ayrshire, 46 per cent of the houses that were sampled failed: in Moray, 66 
per cent failed. The levels in other areas varied and some were fairly low. People 
who live in those areas and who have young children or who are pregnant will be 
concerned about the issue of lead in water. We must reassure the public and I 
hope that the minister's answer will do that.</P><P><strong>The Deputy Presiding 
Officer: </strong>My microphone appears to be down, so if I speak unduly loudly 
that is the reason.</P><P>17:17</P><P><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con): </strong>You 
are coming through loud and clear, Presiding Officer.</P><P>I congratulate Robert 
Brown on securing this debate on lead pipes and the danger of lead in Scotland's 
water supplies. We are all aware that lead in its many forms poses a threat to 
us all and particularly to children. Lead is present not just in water pipes, 
but in paint, exhaust fumes, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food 
we eat and the soil in our garden. As Robert Brown said, medical evidence has 
long shown the need to eliminate or at least keep to a low level our lead </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18272">18272</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>intake. The debate is helpful because it highlights the problem once again.</P><P>The 
Conservative party welcomes all moves to reduce lead in the environment, including 
the Executive's commitment to reduce lead levels in drinking water from 50 to 
25 micrograms per litre by the end of the year. We also welcome the proposed further 
reduction of lead in our water to 10 micrograms per litre by 2013. We will monitor 
the Executive's promise to deliver those levels.</P><P>As Robert Brown and Shona 
Robison mentioned, a particular concern is the excessive level of lead contamination 
found in the water supplies of new houses as a result of the use of lead solder. 
Given that about 20,000 new homes are built in Scotland each year, the illegal 
use of lead solder is a real problem. The Scottish new homes lead survey of 2000 
found that, at a conservative estimate, 15 per cent of new homes might have unacceptably 
high lead levels. We welcome the proposed measures and those that have been introduced 
to make householders aware of that danger, which is a result of bad practice.</P><P>Given 
the well-documented dangers of lead in water supplies, it is outrageous that 3,000 
new-build homes should be affected each year. If we consider the worst-case scenario, 
as we must, it is possible to conclude from the study that, of the 240,000 new 
homes that have been built since 1987, more than 75,000 might have lead solder 
connections in the water supply piping. That puts families and children at risk, 
particularly with larger new-build houses and flats of the type that are preferred 
by families with young children. The practice of using lead solder must be stamped 
out.</P><P>We therefore welcome Scottish Water's convening of a lead strategy 
group. We welcome the recognition of the need to monitor a problem that most people 
thought had been resolved a decade ago. We acknowledge the discretionary grants 
that are available from local authorities for the replacement of lead piping and 
feel that the public should be made more aware that those grants exist.</P><P>We 
must try to make progress. The Executive should perhaps consider issuing guidance 
that local authorities should not issue completion certificates for new buildings 
or alterations until the levels of lead in the water have been checked. If a completion 
certificate were not given when a new house was found to have higher than permitted 
levels of lead in its water, the practice of using lead solder would stop overnight.</P><P>We 
have a surprising window of opportunity to deliver such a move. I intend to lodge 
an amendment at stage 3 of the Building (Scotland) Bill, which is to be debated 
next week. I hope that </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18273">18273</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>the Executive will consider that amendment carefully. I intend it to cut out 
the use of illegal lead solder in house building in Scotland.</P><P>We welcome 
the debate and look forward to the minister's response to it.</P><P>17:21</P><P><strong>Mr 
Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>I will first say how shocked and horrified 
I was that my esteemed colleague Shona Robison did not have the courtesy to welcome 
the debate and congratulate Robert Brown on securing it. I therefore do so on 
behalf of both of us.</P><P>Lead is alleged to have been one of the main causes 
of the fall of the Roman empire. It was alleged that Caligula often ate from lead 
dishes rather than gold, and that that helped to imbalance his mind and led to 
the fall of that lofty institution.</P><P>Lead is a naturally occurring metal 
that is found in air, food, soil and water. One of the problems that we have, 
particularly in the west of Scotland, is that soft water is more likely to pick 
up lead than is hard water, so lead is more likely to be a problem in some parts 
of Scotland than it is in others. As has been mentioned, lead causes behavioural 
problems and can restrict the mental development of young children because it 
builds up in the body.</P><P>Although one must commend successive United Kingdom 
Governments for taking action to reduce lead in petrol, paintwork and pipes, lead&#151;as 
well as lead solder&#151;in pipes remains a problem in several parts of Scotland. 
Houses that were built before 1970 have more of a problem than those that have 
been built since then, but when one considers the number of old houses and the 
problems that still exist, it is hardly surprising that only two years ago the 
City of Edinburgh Council felt the need to send a leaflet to some properties to 
advise people about the risks from lead in their households.</P><P>It is important 
that people are able to identify a lead pipe, but not everyone can. What does 
lead look like? If it is unpainted, it is a dull grey soft metal that is shiny 
and silver underneath if scraped. It is therefore quite different from the much 
darker iron, or the copper that we see in our low-denomination coins. It should 
be easy to find.</P><P>If people have lead pipes in their water systems, one would 
advise them to try to have it removed, either with the assistance of grants or 
through their own resources. Until that happens, if such people are going to use 
tap water, they should let it run for a couple of minutes from the cold tap before 
they use it. Even then, they should still boil it to ensure that the lead is no 
longer present. There is also a lead test adviser who can advise people and whose 
number is 0131 669 8770.</P><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18274">18274</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>In 2000, &quot;Frontline Scotland&quot; covered the issue. The investigation 
highlighted the case of the Fyfe family from Uddingston, whose son took ill through 
lead poisoning. Their home was brand new, but the problem was traced to lead solder 
on the pipes. &quot;Frontline Scotland&quot; carried out a random survey of 95 
new homes and found that 10 were affected by lead solder.</P><P>The issue is clearly 
of considerable concern. I was delighted to hear of the measures that John Scott 
intends to take in the form of an amendment to the Building (Scotland) Bill. I 
assure him that he will have the Scottish National Party's support for that amendment&#151;I 
imagine that he will have the support of all parties.</P><P>Scottish Water is 
doing something about the problem. As has been mentioned, it has formed a lead 
strategy working group, which hopes by 31 December this year to reduce the amount 
of lead in Scottish water to 25 micrograms per litre, which is half the maximum 
level that has been set by the European Union. Although a target of 10 micrograms 
per litre by 2013 is a much more significant and more ambitious target, we can 
at least make some progress in the short term.</P><P>17:25</P><P><strong>Donald 
Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD): </strong>I congratulate Robert Brown on securing 
the debate and on his speech, which left no one else with very much to say. John 
Scott, Kenny Gibson and Shona Robison have all made helpful suggestions.</P><P>I 
will cap Kenny Gibson's useless historical information by adding that everyone 
on a British expedition to find the north-west passage to the north of Canada 
died mysteriously; subsequent research suggested that they died because of lead 
solder on the food tins&#151;tins at that time being a novelty.</P><P>I wish to 
concentrate on one of the points that John Scott made in relation to how to enforce 
people's non-use of lead solder. I pursued, I think in 1999 or early in 2000, 
the issue of lead solder in Uddingston in my constituency. The water authority 
said that although it tried to inspect such matters, it had very few inspectors. 
The council said that the problem was not really its affair, so nobody really 
did anything. The only answer is to bring the matter into building controls. If 
John Scott has a specific suggestion, that is to be welcomed. Building control 
is already staffed, and people already inspect buildings before giving out certificates. 
It would be a small extension of that work to check for lead solder. The ordinary 
citizen has no idea whether lead solder has been used or not.</P><P>I am not a 
skilled plumber but&#151;as I understand it&#151;not only is lead solder cheaper 
than the </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18275">18275</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>alternative, it is much easier to work with. There is an incentive to plumbers 
to use lead solder because it eases their task and they can get through their 
work quicker. There is also an incentive for employers to connive with plumbers 
in using it, because they will get through more work and will be able contract 
for a smaller amount figure. There is considerable incentive to cheat, and we 
need a really good inspection system in order to prevent people from cheating. 
I hope that the minister can pursue the issue with his customary energy.</P><P>17:28</P><P><strong>Tricia 
Marwick (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP): </strong>I, too, congratulate Robert Brown 
on securing the debate. Two out of three SNP members have now congratulated Robert, 
so that is not bad.</P><P>There are two aspects to the debate. First, there is 
the matter of lead piping in domestic water systems; secondly, there is the problem 
with lead solder, particularly in new houses. I will concentrate on domestic water 
supplies and on older houses. I have been concerned about the subject for several 
years, because the effect of lead on the development of children has been known 
about for decades&#151;it is not new.</P><P>Towards the end of last year, I lodged 
a number of questions asking the Executive how many houses in Scotland had water 
supplies that contain lead piping, but the Executive could not tell me. Furthermore, 
there are no plans to collect that information centrally, which is not good enough.</P><P>There 
is a grant system for domestic householders to replace lead piping. The problem 
is that the grants that are available to local authorities, or rather those that 
are available to householders, are extremely limited. The number of grants that 
may be granted each year is constrained by the amount of money that is available. 
It will take many years to make progress on eliminating the existing problem in 
old houses and to get rid of lead piping in domestic water supplies. The Executive 
needs to address that as a matter of urgency.</P><P>I turn now to the issue of 
the lead solder that is used in new homes. I, too, welcome John Scott's announcement 
that at stage 3 of the Building (Scotland) Bill he intends to lodge an amendment 
to address that matter. The SNP will consider that amendment and, if it is as 
John Scott describes, SNP members will support it. The practice of using lead 
solder is clearly detrimental to health, and I wonder whether it is a criminal 
matter. If so, why have there been no prosecutions for using lead solder? As well 
as ensuring that completion certificates are right, so that building warrants 
are not issued if lead solder has been used, we must </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18276">18276</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>use the force of law&#151;if necessary&#151;to ensure that contractors who 
do not comply voluntarily are aware that their actions will be dealt with.</P><P>17:31</P><P><strong>The 
Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development (Allan Wilson): </strong>I 
join two thirds of the SNP members who have spoken, the Conservatives and Robert 
Brown's Liberal colleagues in congratulating the member on securing the debate.</P><P>I 
confirm that Kenny Gibson's historical reference was correct. I am not sure about 
the case of Caligula, but I know that lead poisoning was a problem in ancient 
Rome, in large measure because of the sophisticated system of plumbing, which 
incorporated&#151;guess what&#151;lead pipes. I believe that the ancient Romans 
also lined their wine urns with lead, which caused problems for wine drinkers.</P><P>Since 
Roman times, lead has been well known as a toxin. As Robert Brown pointed out, 
the Scottish drinking water quality regulations recognise that by reducing the 
standard for lead in drinking water from 50 micrograms per litre to 25 micrograms 
per litre at the end of this year. That tighter standard, which applies at the 
customer's tap, is in line with European Union directives and World Health Organisation 
guidelines. Of course, the tightening of the standard for lead in drinking water 
reflects the concern that all members have expressed about the fact that the human 
body absorbs lead from drinking water easily and that children in particular may 
be vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of lead.</P><P>Understandably, we take 
those concerns seriously and have put in place a number of measures to protect 
public health. Before outlining those measures, I remind members that the amount 
of lead in water as it leaves water treatment works is insignificant. Donald Gorrie, 
among others, made that point. There are no lead water mains in Scotland. The 
lead problem is property specific and is generally&#151;although not exclusively&#151;confined 
to properties constructed before the 1970s.</P><P>In preparation for meeting the 
new standard, the Executive asked the three former water authorities to identify 
areas where there was a significant risk that tap samples would fail to meet the 
new standards. That involved the water authorities carrying out a survey in 2001-02, 
during which 20,000 water samples were taken. Failure to meet the standard was 
generally the result of lead communication pipes, which are owned by the water 
authorities and run from the mains in the street up to the property boundaries; 
lead supply pipes, which belong to the property owner and </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18277">18277</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>connect the communication pipe to internal plumbing; and internal lead plumbing.</P><P>Because 
the majority of the pipework that is likely to cause a breach of the new standard 
is not owned by Scottish Water, which has taken over the responsibilities of the 
water authorities, the options open to Scottish Water to ensure compliance with 
the new standard are limited. The principal method of achieving compliance is 
therefore to treat the water, as has been mentioned. That approach has been adopted 
throughout the United Kingdom.</P><P>By treating the water, it is possible to 
limit the amount of lead that dissolves from lead pipework into the water supply. 
Water treatment to prevent lead dissolving from pipes has been routine in parts 
of Scotland for many years. The Glasgow water supply, to which Kenny Gibson referred, 
has been treated since 1989 because of problems with lead pipes, especially in 
the city's older tenement properties, with which both he and I are very familiar.</P><P>Although 
the issue is important, it is not new, as everyone has said. Despite the fact 
that the problem has been known about for some time, I acknowledge that the exact 
number of properties that are connected to the water main with lead plumbing&#151;Tricia 
Marwick referred to the issue&#151;is not known. The 1994 drinking water quality 
report estimated that more than 0.5 million Scottish homes still had lead pipes.</P><P>The 
survey carried out by Scottish Water in 2001-02, to which I referred, should provide 
a more up-to-date estimate of the number of properties with lead pipes. An analysis 
of that data is continuing and it will be published when it is available. The 
survey is designed&#151;I think that this was Tricia Marwick's point&#151;to identify 
which water supply areas require treatment. That is probably the crux of the matter, 
rather than how many individual properties have lead plumbing. Scottish Executive 
statisticians will analyse that data further to provide an estimate of the number 
of properties in Scotland that have lead pipes. With that data, we will go as 
far as we can towards providing the information that members seek.</P><P>Although 
I fully expect the latest survey to reveal that a significant number of properties 
in Scotland still have lead plumbing, it is important to remember that treatment 
is already in place in many of the worst-affected areas. The effectiveness of 
the treatment is backed up by the drinking water quality results for 2002, which 
show that only 45 of 2,800 regulatory samples taken from throughout Scotland failed 
to meet the tighter standards that we have introduced of 25 micrograms per litre.</P><P><strong>Robert 
Brown: </strong>I wonder whether the phosphate </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18278">18278</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>treatment disguises the problem to some extent, because I presume that, when 
the samples are taken, the lead levels are lower than they would be without the 
phosphate.</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The purpose of the phosphate treatment 
is to reduce the incidence of lead in the supply, and it is effective in doing 
that. In samples that are taken from areas where water is treated, we would expect 
there to be a reduction below the new standard. The point that Robert Brown made 
about the levels after treatment&#151;as opposed to with a programme of replacement, 
which I will come on to&#151;is that, in the main, they would fail to meet the 
new standard that will be introduced in 2013 of 10 micrograms per litre. Treatment 
is effective to 0.6 per cent of the new standards that have been introduced, but 
to meet the higher standard that we expect to introduce in 2013 will require a 
programme of lead pipe replacement between now and then. That is what Robert Brown's 
motion gets at, and we want to make progress on that.</P><P>When a sample fails 
to meet the regulatory standard for lead, Scottish Water must advise the occupier 
of measures that they can take to reduce the risk from lead in their drinking 
water. That advice can range from running the tap before use to the replacement 
of the lead pipes. If the occupier is not the owner of the property, from the 
end of this year the new regulations require that Scottish Water must also inform 
the owner of the property. Also, when a failure occurs, Scottish Water examines 
its pipeworks to see whether the communication pipe is made of lead. If it is, 
Scottish Water will replace it.</P><P>In addition to replacing communication pipes 
associated with regulatory failures, Scottish Water replaces lead communication 
pipes as part of its water mains rehabilitation programme. The mains rehabilitation 
programme is a significant part of the £1.8 billion investment programme that 
was agreed with ministers in August 2001. In November 2000, health and environment 
ministers launched a public information initiative designed to alert the public 
to the risks of lead in drinking water, particularly for those who are most at 
risk, such as pregnant women and young children.</P><P>Members of the public who 
are concerned about the risks and who wish to replace their lead pipework might 
be eligible for a housing repair grant from their local authority. In 2001-02, 
nearly 1,400 grants were approved by local authorities for the replacement of 
lead plumbing. That represents something like 11 per cent of all grants.</P><P>Although 
the statutory tolerable standard for the condition of houses does not cover lead 
in drinking water, it has long been recognised that that is a significant problem. 
The issue is about having an adequate and wholesome water supply. That is </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18279">18279</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>why grants for up to 90 per cent of the cost of replacing lead pipes are available. 
The Executive will continue to acknowledge the concern by making available for 
such work a minimum grant of 50 per cent. Beyond the 50 per cent level, grants 
become subject to a test of resources.</P><P><strong>Tricia Marwick: </strong>If 
I heard the figures correctly, 1,400 grants were made to domestic householders 
last year. We estimate that half a million houses have lead piping. It is not 
necessary to be a rocket scientist or a mathematician to work out that it will 
take a long time to eradicate lead from the domestic water supply if we continue 
at the rate of 1,400 grants a year.</P><P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>We give 
significant resources to local authorities. The interesting point is that a great 
deal can be achieved with only a small proportion of resources. Lead pipe replacement 
represents only 2 or 3 per cent of the grant expenditure to which the member referred, 
but it accounts for around 13 per cent of the number of building repair grants 
that are awarded nationally. Expenditure on lead pipe replacement could be increased 
exponentially by increasing the percentage of housing repair grants that are devoted 
to lead pipe replacement. The problem can be addressed within existing resources. 
A modest increase in resources will offer further help.</P><P>The housing improvement 
task force is reviewing the tolerable standard and might recommend including acceptable 
levels in drinking water. The Executive will consider all the task force's proposals 
and will consult on how best to implement them.</P><P>In the water quality regulations, 
the Executive has provided that when someone has taken the initiative by replacing 
their lead pipes, Scottish Water must replace its communication pipe if it is 
also made of lead. That significant provision ensures that consumers get the full 
benefit of their efforts and do not continue to be supplied with water through 
a length of lead pipe that they do not own. If they replace their internal plumbing, 
Scottish Water will replace the communication pipe.</P><P>The measures that the 
Executive has already put in place provide the general public with a high degree 
of protection from lead in drinking water supplies. We are not complacent. Public 
health is paramount in such circumstances. In spite of the high degree of compliance 
in 2002 with the standard that comes into force at the end of 2003, more water 
treatment works will be equipped to provide treatment that will prevent lead from 
dissolving from pipes.</P><P>John Scott knows that I am aware of the suggestion 
that the lead problem could be </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Col&nbsp;<A NAME="Col18280">18280</A></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"> 
<P>addressed through building regulations in the Building (Scotland) Bill. I give 
an assurance to John Scott and Robert Brown that we will assess whether action 
can be taken in that bill. If that is possible, we will certainly be prepared 
to lodge appropriate Executive amendments.</P><P><em>Meeting closed at 17:43.</em></P></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR>
