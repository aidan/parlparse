<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding
Officer (Sir David Steel): </strong>The first item of business this morning
is the consideration of a business motion from the Parliamentary Bureau,
setting out a revised business programme. As there is no amendment to this
motion, the debate will be restricted to 10 minutes, with one speaker for
the motion and one against. Before Tom McCabe moves the motion, will anyone
who wishes to speak against the motion please press the request button
now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>On
a point of order, Mr Presiding Officer. Last Wednesday, the Parliament
decided unanimously to meet today at 2.30 pm. Since then, the Parliamentary
Bureau seems to have changed that decision so that we meet at 9.30 am.
I have no objection in principle to meeting in the morning, provided that
we are given adequate notice. The business bureau seems to keep chopping
and changing the agenda and the timetable, and I wonder if you could use
your good offices to ensure that all of us, including those of us who are
not represented on the mystical business bureau, are informed officially
and punctually about any changes to the agenda and the timetable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_4"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding
Officer: </strong>I remember that you raised the same point of order last week.
In fairness, I must point out that, when the business motion was moved
last week, notice was given that this change would be made-those who were
present in the chamber heard that announcement. We are still trying to
accommodate business; for example, there was a general wish to have a debate
on Holyrood, and it was made clear last week that the Parliament would
meet this morning.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Parliament (Mr Tom
McCabe): </strong>The motion before the Parliament today is in recognition of
the need to allow members the opportunity to express a view on their Parliament.
I explained when I moved the business motion last week that I would come
forward on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau with an amendment to the
business programme proposed for this week.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will say a few words tomorrow on some
of the changes about which Mr Canavan has expressed concern and on some
of the reasons for those changes. I am here on behalf of the Parliamentary&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_6"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McCabe:</strong>
There is nothing mystical about it. You made the point yourself, Mr Presiding
Officer, that the chamber was informed last week of the changes that would
be proposed this morning.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I can confirm that it has been agreed,
subject to the Parliament agreeing to the motion, that the business for
the remainder of this week will be as follows. Today, the First Minister
will make a statement on the Executive's legislative proposals and priorities.
The remainder of today's business will be a debate on that statement. On
conclusion of the debate, there will be a debate on the subject of David
Mundell's motion on employment in Dumfries and Galloway.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tomorrow's business will commence at 10.30
am with a debate on the First Minister's motion on the Holyrood project.
That will be followed, before lunchtime, by the business motion setting
out the business for the next two weeks. The business for tomorrow afternoon
will be as set out in the motion agreed to by the Parliament last week.
At 2.30 pm, we will have oral questions, followed by a debate on the Deputy
First Minister's motion on tuition fees. The Parliament will also be asked
to agree to a motion setting out the membership of committees and the party
from which the convener of each committee should be appointed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
