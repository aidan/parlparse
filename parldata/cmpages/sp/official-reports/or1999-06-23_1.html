question as a written question requiring an urgent response. That was fine,
but my point of order is to seek clarification on when that urgent response

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_15"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding
Officer (Sir David Steel): </strong>The first item of business this afternoon
is a statement by the Deputy First Minister on freedom of information.
He will take questions at the end of the statement and there should, therefore,
be no interventions. This item of business will last for half an hour.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">14:34</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy First Minister and Minister
for Justice (Mr Jim Wallace): </strong>With permission, Sir David, I wish to
outline to members how the Executive intends to take forward the partnership
commitment to the early introduction of an effective freedom of information
regime.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is a subject that I and many other
members of this Parliament feel very strongly about. On my election as
a member of the UK Parliament for Orkney and Shetland in 1983, I was asked
what private member's bill I would like to promote if I were lucky in the
ballot. I said-16 years ago-that I would like to introduce a freedom of
information bill, but I never had any luck in the ballot.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Fortunately, with the establishment of
the Scottish Parliament, an effective Scottish freedom of information regime
no longer depends on luck. Scotland has the opportunity to adopt a distinctive
approach to openness and to create a freedom of information regime that
is appropriate to a modern and open Government as we approach the 21<sup>st</sup>
century. We are committed to creating open government in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The partnership agreement says that the
Scottish Executive intends to put in place an effective freedom of information
regime. Let me make absolutely clear what we mean by that. We mean a Scottish
freedom of information bill that is introduced in this Parliament, scrutinised
by this Parliament, and enacted at the hand of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The bill will enshrine in primary legislation
the people's right to have access to information. It is important that
people recognise that we are serious about this commitment. By introducing
primary legislation to this Parliament we will leave no one in any doubt.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We attach great importance to an open and
inclusive approach to policy development and we shall consult widely as
we develop our policy on freedom of information. We welcome members' views
and I expect that a committee of the Parliament will take a close interest
in the development of policy in this area. We are committed to open and
wide consultation but we&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">also need to ensure
that the process is driven forward. I propose to strike that balance by
initiating consultation in the autumn. Based on the results of that consultation,
we will introduce primary legislation as soon as possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive has moved swiftly on the
commitment to freedom of information in the partnership agreement-today's
commitment to legislation demonstrates that-but we need to ensure that
effective arrangements are in place from 1 July. I therefore announce today
that, for the first time ever, Scotland will be covered by a specifically
Scottish non-statutory code of practice on access to Scottish Executive
information. It will ensure that arrangements for access to information
are in place from 1 July. Without that non-statutory code as an interim
measure, Scotland would be worse off than the rest of the UK, and I will
not allow that to happen. Copies of the code are being made available to
members today and can be collected from the chamber reference point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our commitment to an effective, statutory,
freedom of information regime is not made lightly. We recognise that freedom
of information is a complex area of public policy that has taxed successive
UK Governments. Members will be aware of some of the criticisms that greeted
the publication last month of the draft UK freedom of information bill
for consultation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In developing our approach to freedom of
information, we need to strike a careful balance between the public's right
to know and public authorities' reasonable expectation of confidentiality
for sensitive information. We also need to ensure that the necessary exchange
of information with Westminster and with the devolved administrations in
Northern Ireland and Wales can operate effectively. That arrangement is
necessary to support the continued supply of information from Whitehall
to the Scottish Executive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In formulating our way forward, we will
take account of the draft UK bill and take stock of the comments and criticisms
of it that arise during parliamentary scrutiny at Westminster.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Effective freedom of information and openness
is as much about culture as it is about legislation. We are therefore committed
to fostering and maintaining an appropriate culture of openness throughout
this Administration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The code of practice will preserve existing
rights of access and afford the public and public bodies a degree of continuity.
The code contains a strong presumption of openness. It makes clear that
information should be disclosed unless the harm that is likely to arise
from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in making the&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">information available.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The code is intended to support policy
making and the democratic process by providing access to the information
that is provided to ministers and to the facts and analyses which form
the basis for the consideration of proposed policy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From the outset, the code will be effectively
policed by the Scottish parliamentary commissioner for administration.
The Scottish commissioner will submit reports to Parliament, as will the
Executive, on the operation of the code. Members will refer to the Scottish
commissioner complaints from the public that a Scottish public authority
has failed to operate adequately the provisions of the code.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I intend that the code and the role of
the Scottish commissioner will be well publicised. The code will be made
available widely in printed form and on the internet. I understand that
the commissioner will distribute a leaflet that will set out his role and
the ways in which a member of the public may submit a complaint to him
through a member of the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have written today to the bodies covered
by the code, including the Scottish Prison Service, the Student Awards
Agency for Scotland, Scottish Homes and the Scottish Environment Protection
Agency, to reinforce the presumption of openness and to encourage them
to continue to foster a culture of openness in their dealings with the
public. I shall take a close interest in the operation of the code.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Executive is committed to running an
open Administration, to consulting widely as we develop freedom of information
policy for Scotland, to a non-statutory code from day one, and-most important-to
an effective freedom of information act.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is an effective and ambitious package
of measures that will lead to increased openness in the governing of Scotland.
At the heart of the legislation we bring to the Parliament will be a presumption
of openness. What has to be, and is increasingly being, recognised is that
better scrutiny leads to better government. By making information more
available we empower people-we do not weaken government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I look forward to working with members
of this Parliament and others as the Executive puts into place Scotland's
first ever freedom of information act.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">what the minister
said, but I have some concerns, not least of which are those that relate
to the unnecessary delay. Can he be more open about his time scale for
the introduction of legislation? I fear that we are missing a great opportunity.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Can the minister elaborate on the precise
strength of the code of conduct, because it does not appear to usher in
any change at all? He said that the code will</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"preserve existing rights of access".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That phraseology suggests that the code
will make no real change, which will be a matter of great concern. Will
the minister clarify that aspect of the code? It appears not to contain
any legal rights or responsibilities-unless I have missed something fundamental.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Will the minister expand on the time scale
involved and explain why he feels it necessary effectively to wait until
Westminster's deliberations are over? That is a rather unfortunate precedent
to set. Will he clarify precisely what strength the code of conduct will
have when it comes to implementation? What remedies will people have if
the code is breached? I fear that the minister's statement is sending out
a signal that not much will change.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace:</strong> I am grateful to Ms
Cunningham for her remarks. On timing, she would be one of the first to
criticise the Executive if we said that we are going full steam ahead to
legislate without consultation. It has been widely expected of this Parliament
that we will consult widely. The UK draft bill will be part of that process,
but by no means the sole part. Ms Cunningham is a member of the Justice
and Home Affairs Committee, which I hope-with individual members and other
people who are interested in the issue-will take an active interest in
examining the consultation paper that will be published in the autumn.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I said in my statement, it is a question
of striking a balance between ensuring that there is proper and effective
consultation and ensuring that we make steady progress. I am not committing
myself to a particular time scale, but the fact that we have made a statement
today, that a consultation paper will be published after the summer recess,
that we are inviting consultation and that we will try to maintain progress
and drive this forward, is a sign of good intent and a willingness to consult
properly. If there is any issue that requires openness and consultation,
surely it is freedom of information.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the strength of the code of conduct,
Ms Cunningham is right to say that I said in my statement that this is
a continuity of the existing code for rights of access to information.
We are not making any secret of that. The code has been redrafted to take
account of the fact that we will be&nbsp;</font></td>

1 July. Without it, there would be a gap, and Scotland would be less well
served than the rest of the United Kingdom in terms of access to public
information. I do not think that anyone here wants that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important that, rather than undertaking
the almost impossible task of drafting from scratch in a short time, we
maintain what is in place and look forward to a statutory regime. That
is what is different-we are making a commitment to a statutory freedom
of information regime. That takes things forward. Sometimes I fear that
the current access code is one of the country's best-kept secrets. Perhaps
today's statement and the attendant publicity will mean that people are
better informed of what legislation already exists to enable them to get
access to information.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>I
thank the minister for his courtesy in making an advance copy of his statement
available to us, which facilitates comment on it. I would be grateful for
his response to three points.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First, why do we need a separate freedom
of information act in Scotland, as distinct from a single UK measure based
on a common set of principles? A single UK measure would mean that whatever
agency or Government department our citizens are dealing with, whether
in relation to a reserved or a devolved matter, they have access to information
on the basis of a single statutory and legislative code. I fear that different
regimes north and south of the border will make it difficult to resolve
the access provisions that apply to information in matters where there
is an interface between the UK Government and Scottish Office departments.
Will we work on the principle that access is governed by the most liberal
or the most restrictive regime?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Secondly, I am grateful for the minister's
response to Ms Cunningham's question, confirming that the code to which
he refers is not a novel feature, but simply replicates what was put in
place by the previous UK Government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thirdly, will Mr Wallace and his colleagues
have discussions with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities with
a view to introducing a similar code for local government? That should
happen in advance of the primary legislation to which he referred, which
we will discuss in Parliament. Such a code should build on the existing
local government access to information regime that was established in 1985.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Is the minister aware that there are concerns
about access to information in local government-particularly in relation
to bodies funded by local government-where the information that has been
made available to the public has not been all that is desired? There have
been a number of&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">instances of disastrous
funding arrangements with partnership initiatives here in Lothian that
freer and more accessible information would have avoided.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>A separate freedom of
information regime is part of the devolution settlement. It was first foreshadowed
by the white paper and was implemented by one of the orders that we considered
only a matter of weeks ago. It was considered appropriate-I believe that
it is appropriate-that as a Parliament we devise our own regime to deal
with the range of our devolved responsibilities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Only one regime will apply to a particular
public body. There might have been some problem if cross-border bodies
had tried to operate under two different regimes, but the Westminster regime
will apply to them. Requests from the public will be dealt with under whichever
regime is applicable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr McLetchie pointed out that local government
already operates under a statutory access to information regime and that
there is dissatisfaction about its effectiveness. I am sure that it could
be examined as part of the consultation process. The health service has
different arrangements. Examining the effectiveness of other current statutory
regimes and codes would be a very helpful part of the consultation exercise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr John McAllion (Dundee East) (Lab):
</strong>The minister will be aware of the growing concern across Scotland that
the Crown Office is failing to use the full force of the law in cases where
death is caused by dangerous driving. For example, some of my constituents
have been denied access to police reports into fatal accidents-even when
members of their family have been killed. Can he guarantee that such police
files, along with all other official files and reports on accidents and
accident inquiries, will be available under the freedom of information
legislation?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I want to take the opportunity
to clarify one point: the code of practice that we are discussing does
not apply to the police, because the police are not subject to the jurisdiction
of the parliamentary commissioner for administration. It is fair to say
that it might be very worthwhile to consult on the inclusion of the police
in a freedom of information regime. That is the situation in other countries
that operate statutory regimes. There was a strong recommendation in the
Macpherson report on the Stephen Lawrence case that the police should be
covered by a statutory regime. That will be an important part of the consultation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

1 July. Does he hope to use the concepts of prejudice and harm that are
mentioned in the code-emphasising the tighter test of harm-in the draft
legislation?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>That will be a key part
of the consultation. Mr Robson will note that the harm test features fairly
prominently in the code. It is also important to note that whether the
test of harm or of prejudice is used, the overriding test is one of the
public interest. Members will see that part II of the code, which deals
with reasons for confidentiality, states that</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;"the presumption remains that information
should be disclosed unless the harm likely to arise from disclosure would
outweigh the public interest in making the information available."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Openness is the presumption and the ultimate
test is that of public interest.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West): </strong>Is
the minister aware that the Westminster draft bill on freedom of information
has not received a warm response from people who, over many years, have
campaigned for such a bill? It is hoped that the Scottish Parliament can
do much better than Westminster.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Security and defence are reserved matters,
but there are many incidents in Scotland that arise from defence and security
operations. Does the minister envisage that the freedom of information
bill that will be passed by this Parliament-hopefully-will be able to shed
any light on matters such as the tragic crash of the Chinook helicopter
on the Mull of Kintyre or the operations of the killer Trident submarines
in Scottish territorial waters?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I am sorry to disappoint
Mr Canavan, but there is a clear division between the freedom of information
bill regime that will be passed by this Parliament, which will apply to
matters that are the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament, and the
matters that are reserved. As he knows, defence is not a responsibility
of the Parliament, so it will continue to operate under freedom of information
legislation passed by the Westminster Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>The minister mentioned consultation. I am sure he is aware that
there was extensive consultation on the Westminster bill. Were any organisations
in Scotland that have a keen interest in the subject not included in that
consultation exercise? The danger of such an open-ended consultation process
is that it might delay the introduction of a bill in the Scottish Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I think I am correct
in saying that when I advocated a freedom of information bill in 1983 it
was a criminal offence to tell anyone where the Post Office Tower in London
was, and it was a criminal offence for the head gardener at the Royal Botanic
Gardens in Inverleith to tell anyone in which order he watered the plants.
We have come a considerable way since then in changing the culture in government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I assure Mr Gallie that this will be a
Scottish bill. It will be for this Parliament to pass it, to move amendments
to it, and to consider it. It clearly makes sense to consider the freedom
of information legislation that is now in draft form at Westminster, the
comments that have been made on it and the parliamentary scrutiny that
it has undergone. However, it will be for this Parliament and its committees
to devise the arrangements that we believe are suitable for Scottish circumstances.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD): </strong>I welcome
the minister's speedy statement and would like to ask two questions. First,
are the hospital boards and hospital trusts in Scotland among those to
whom he has written? Secondly, will the freedom of information regime include
not just information, but specific documents that can be recovered from
the various public authorities that have been referred to?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>No, it does not include
the health boards or health trusts, which are covered by a separate code
and, in some cases, by separate arrangements for access to medical records.
I am aware that several members have already raised the question of access
to information in the health service. As I said in my reply to Mr McLetchie,
it would be quite proper to examine the effectiveness of the codes and
the freedom of information regime that applies in that service.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My answer to Mr Brown's second question
is that the supply of specific documents is not required, although there
will undoubtedly be occasions on which specific documents are supplied.

In the interests of freedom of information and of the public whom we serve,
will members of this Parliament be given the same rights of parliamentary
privilege as members at Westminster when they want to raise individual
cases here?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>That might be a question
to which you, Sir David, are better able to supply an answer. I understand
that that is the case, but I would not want to commit myself firmly without
taking advice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>John Young (West of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>My first question to the Deputy First Minister concerns the code of
conduct as a significant advance in public access to information. Will
it apply equally to information on BSE and genetically modified foods,
or are those areas the preserve of the UK Parliament?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My second question is this: if a dispute
were to arise between the UK and Scottish Parliaments over what information
should be released, will some form of arbiter or group be appointed to
adjudicate? I accept that it is unlikely that such a difference will arise,
but it is not impossible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would also like to know whether the Deputy
First Minister believes that what he is proposing is in some ways inferior
to what Mr Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, is proposing. Does he, as a
lawyer, think that if there are differences, people may come from south
of the border to the Scottish courts, and vice versa?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My last point has been raised many times
over the years. I fought the election on 6 May for the constituency in
which Rudolf Hess landed 58 years ago. Some local historians still feel
that there are papers concerning the flight of Rudolf Hess that are being
retained into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Will access to that information
be dealt with by the Scottish Parliament or will the UK Government again
remain supreme?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace:</strong> I will take those questions
in reverse order.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many cases are covered by existing statute.
The Rudolf Hess case almost certainly falls under a reserved power. If
it is any consolation to John Young, I can tell him that I have had cause

sinking off Orkney in 1916 of HMS Hampshire, about which there is still
some concern among relatives of those who lost their lives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Minister for Children and Education
(Mr Sam Galbraith): </strong>I would like to make a statement on the procedures
that will be adopted to ensure that there is full public consultation on
our proposals in the forthcoming education improvement bill. I intend to
launch the consultation during the first week of July.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I should make it clear first that I will
not be giving full details of our proposals at this stage; those will come
later. I am making this statement for two reasons: first, the consultation
document setting out our proposals can be launched only shortly after the
Parliament rises for the summer recess and I felt that, out of courtesy,
I should give Parliament the details of the consultation process that will
follow. Secondly, I want to make clear the nature of the general process,
as this consultation will be the first to launch a bill to be put before
this Parliament. I do not expect that we will follow exactly the same procedure
for every bill put forward by this Administration, but the approach that
we take for the education bill will serve as a general template.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Before that, however, let me say briefly
why we intend to legislate on education. The Scottish Executive is committed
to an agenda of continuous improvement that will progressively raise standards
in education. It will build on the groundwork laid by the United Kingdom
Government since the 1997 election, with the aim of delivering a world-class
system with world-class standards.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This Parliament should not make the mistake

Their commitment to excellence stands out and they tell me that it is an
exciting time to be in education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have already achieved a great deal through
the significant additional resources that are now being made available
to schools. Those resources are targeted on activities that make a difference
to children's and teachers' experience and which directly support improvement.
Pre-school provision for all three and four-year-olds, 5,000 additional
classroom assistants, smaller class sizes, and early intervention to support
better literacy and numeracy in the primary school, add up to a package
that gives children a much better start at school.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The excellence fund is reaching all parts
of the school system in other ways: for example, by supporting alternatives
to exclusion. New community schools, training and staff development and
the delivery of modern information technology to all our schools will make
a major difference. We are delivering better education in better schools.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We also want to support and develop our
teachers, strengthening their skills and professionalism. I want to pay
tribute to their commitment. [M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>: "Hear, hear."]
I recognise very well the pressures on teachers and their feeling that
they are undervalued. However, we all know that a world-class education
system will not happen without them and that their expertise is already
delivering huge improvements. We want those improvements to be continuous
and to extend throughout the school system in Scotland through the sharing
of best practice, using it to raise standards. Her Majesty's inspectors'
reports show how that is already happening; how school after school is
delivering a high and rising quality of education for its pupils.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our aim in legislating is to consolidate
and build on the momentum that is already under way. It is to provide a
framework through which Government, local authorities, teachers, parents
and children can work in partnership to secure improvement and to achieve
and celebrate excellence. That requires an education service that is guided
by shared priorities and is responsive to local circumstances and to the
needs of children. We need to meet the challenge to help those who still
need to achieve the standards of the very best. I believe that we can do
that with a few simple measures that will strengthen the culture of improvement
and make clear the responsibility of all those in the education system
for taking them forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That means that those who support, fund
and direct schools must also be encouraged to continue developing the culture
of excellence. We often speak of the partnership of schools, local authorities

I believe in that partnership and that each of the partners must pull its
weight. That means that we ourselves, the Scottish Ministers and the local
authorities should be provided with a clear statement of our responsibilities
for delivering improvement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The measures that we will bring forward
will create a new partnership between central and local government, and
between authorities and schools, to raise standards and to target and celebrate
excellence. None of us-schools, parents, authorities or this Parliament-should
be prepared to accept second best for our children when we see what the
best can achieve. This bill is about achieving the best. It will be a framework
for partnership. Our approach to the preparation of the bill is designed
to reflect that. The first principle adopted by the cross-party consultative
steering group was that power should be shared between the Parliament,
the Executive and the people of Scotland. We have the chance to make that
a reality in our approach to this legislation. The people of Scotland will,
therefore, have an unprecedented opportunity to express their views on
our proposals before the bill is finally presented to this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Education interests and the general public
have already had a substantial opportunity to comment on the basis of the
proposals that were set out in the UK Government's white paper "Targeting
Excellence", which was published in January. The detailed plans for legislation
will take into account the many comments that were made on the white paper.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The next step is to set out the details
of the proposals for legislation in a consultative document to be published
early in July. That will set out and explain the draft provisions and the
policy behind them. I can assure this Parliament that the document will
be made widely available. We are all stakeholders in the education system
and our approach to consultation will be designed to ensure that our proposals
are considered by as many people as possible. The document, therefore,
will be sent to local authorities, schools, school boards and a wide range
of organisations with an interest in children and schools. A summary of
the main elements will also be published and made available on request.
The consultation document will be made available on the internet. That
will allow many more people to have access to it, to comment and to see
what others have said about the bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am particularly concerned that the consultation
should go beyond the normal range of interests, and that many parents and
pupils are involved. Pupils who have access to the internet through the

to take their views into account. I consider that young people's views
about schools should be listened to. The consultation will also give them
an early opportunity to learn about the processes and procedures of the
new Parliament. The consultation will continue until the end of October
to give plenty people plenty of time to comment after the schools are back.
Peter Peacock and I want to meet as many people as possible to hear their
views, and we will want to take part in a series of meetings throughout
Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that the outcome of the process
will be a bill that the widest spectrum of people agree reflects the best
way forward for Scottish education. It will take account of the knowledge
and experience of those who are directly involved as providers and consumers
of school education. Parliament can then be confident that our proposals
are soundly based and will make a real difference to the education of our
children.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the end of October, the bill will be
revised as necessary to take into account the consultations and to make
any technical changes needed to refine the drafting. Once that has happened
it will be passed to the Parliament, which will, as a first step, put it
to the Education, Culture and Sport Committee. The committee will comment
on the approach taken in the bill, and in particular on how good the consultation
has been. It will report to Parliament on whether the bill should be approved
in principle. If the report is favourable, the bill will go through three
stages: a debate and vote on the key principles, detailed consideration
in committee, and a debate and final vote on the bill with the amendments
accepted by the education committee.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will not deliver a world-class education
system overnight, and we must always remember that it is schools, teachers,
pupils and their parents working together who will achieve the highest
standards. I believe, however, that establishing a clear framework of duties
and responsibilities will allow us to focus more closely on the action
needed to achieve such a system. Our bill, developed with the help and
participation of our partners in the education system and the Scottish
people, is an opportunity to do that. It will also set a new standard in
consultation that I hope this Parliament will welcome. I commend it to
the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">thinking on pre-legislative
consultation, I suggest that the Government should go away and do some
more thinking, this time of the creative variety.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is the minister proposing by way of
consultation that is new? We all recognise that the committee structure
will be a significant improvement in the pre-legislative process, but I
am sure that he will agree that consultation at an even earlier stage is
essential in education. What he suggests in his statement reflects what
already happens-green or white papers are circulated to interested parties,
and comments are invited and more often than not ignored. That is the type
of consultation that the CSG condemned in its report, when it said:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Consultation, in the form of inviting
comments on specific legislative proposals, for example, would not meet
our aspirations for a participative policy development process."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is exactly the type of consultation
that the minister has just proposed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My second question refers to the content
of the proposals; I understand that the minister cannot go into detail
today. As publication is only a few days away, it is fair to ask for some
early indications. As the minister and his deputy travel round Scotland
to take part in their series of meetings, they will detect a fair degree
of unease at the contents of the recent white paper, "Targeting Excellence".
Will the minister give us a guarantee that his proposals will represent
a significant departure from that white paper, which was rejected by people
representing a range of interests in education?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thirdly, is the minister yet able to expand
on the proposals in the partnership agreement to establish an education
forum? Today would seem an ideal opportunity for him to have brought forward
detailed proposals for the early establishment of such a forum, so that
it could facilitate the type of consultation and participation that the
CSG envisaged.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The minister's statement was a missed opportunity,
but I hope that his answers to my questions will go some way towards reassuring
me on those concerns.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>I am grateful to Nicola
Sturgeon for her response if slightly disappointed by its rather ungenerous
nature and tone, which does not augur well for consultation. I hope that
her criticism will improve in tone in the future and that it will be better
than the usual soundbite of "missed opportunity". I would have hoped that
we could move on to more constructive criticism.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

sneered at.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nicola Sturgeon also asked about content.
We have taken the responses to the white paper into consideration. I cannot
say anything more about the forum at this stage, as we are still considering
it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and
Fife) (Con): </strong>I thank the minister for making the text of his statement
available early enough for us to give consideration to it. I welcome a
period of consultation on the forthcoming bill, but I am naturally quite
disappointed that we cannot have the bill prior to the recess. If the document
that is to be released in early July is consultative, I am not sure why
we cannot see it before the recess.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The minister said that the consultation
would be the first to launch a bill. Does that mean that it will be the
first bill or that there will be other bills that will not have any consultation?
I doubt that it is the latter and think that it is likely to be the former.
If that is the case, we are not likely see an amended draft and a bill
until November at the earliest. Does that mean that-this being the first
bill-we will see no bills in this Parliament until November or possibly
even next year? It would be useful if the minister gave more detail of
the likely timetable for consultation and indicated when the chamber and
the committees will have an opportunity to discuss the bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Will the minister tell us why he did not
use the word employer in his statement when he was talking about partnership?
It is important that the education that we give our children is world class
and is tailored to ensure that they can not only go into academia but obtain
employment and contribute to society as a whole.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Will the minister clarify the aspects of
the bill on which he has had consultation? He says that that might not
be possible. A simple example is that when community schools-an idea that
was first taken up by the Conservatives in the mid-1970s-were relaunched
last year, many agencies such as social work and health were involved and
brought into the schools. Does he intend to involve the police in community
schools, as they were left out? Community schools are used to bring those
agencies together for the benefit of the community, so it is important
that the police, who have much to contribute on drug education, should
be involved. I should be grateful if the minister responded to some of
those comments.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

or will its role begin only once the bill is fully published?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>As Malcolm Chisholm

his response to Mr Monteith that we do not want to rush the process. In

as important as our children's education, we must take a careful approach.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the past, glossy documentation has been
thrown at school boards. I have been a member of a school board for some
years and have seen that happen. Teachers have said to me, "Do not rush
this; do not make change for its own sake. Let us see our way through this
issue." They think that things are happening too fast. I would like to

the teachers' commitment and by the high standards. In all the schools
that I have visited, that has been my experience-commitment and high standards
of education. I commend them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our plan is to keep rolling new community
schools forward. I do not see any limit to them. The first batch is out

can be in any area, as long as there is a concept of pulling together.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Change should be introduced only when it is necessary to achieve the objectives

objective is continuous improvement, and we want to achieve that. However,

that young people's views were very important to him. However, the list

councils, nor of the many youth forums that have been established around
the country; perhaps most glaringly, there is no mention of the Scottish

youth, and I am determined to do that. I will take on board her comments
about youth forums, which is a good suggestion. I hope that, when the document
is sent to schools, it will also be sent to the pupil councils. As far
as the Scottish Youth Parliament is concerned, I will be attending the
meeting on 30 June as an MSP in order to discuss the document. I am grateful
to her, and I will take all her points on board.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the minister agree that the pupil-teacher ratio in the state sector is

ratios of private schools?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I recently read a report which said that
Eton College-the most exclusive of British private schools-had a pupil-teacher
ratio of 8:1. That can be compared to Drumchapel High School in the First
Minister's constituency, where the pupil-teacher ratio is 30:1. When class
sizes are in the high 20s or even in the 30s, the issue of teaching is
sometimes surpassed by that of management and control. Will the minister
give us information about lowering secondary school class sizes to a maximum
of 20 pupils per class by the end of the first Parliament?</font></td>

in this chamber is on the issue of food safety. It is a very important
issue with a particular resonance in Scotland, and it is right for this
Parliament to discuss it at an early stage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The motion seeks this Parliament's approval
for the creation of a UK food standards agency, within which are embodied
specific provisions for Scotland. The draft bill currently before the Westminster
Parliament is the product of extensive consultation and pre-legislative
scrutiny. This is our opportunity to endorse its provisions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to outline some of the main elements
of the proposed food standards agency. I also want to set out some of the
guiding principles on food safety that the Executive will follow-now and

public's legitimate concerns about food safety. We are determined to play

the proposals before us today give us the opportunity to make a start on

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">concerned about
food safety for good reason-nowhere is that more true than here in Scotland.
In the 1980s and 1990s, a catalogue of failure produced the BSE crisis
and the appalling tragedy of the Lanarkshire E coli outbreak. It is our
responsibility in the Scottish Parliament to do all that we can to reduce
the chances of such events occurring again. Public confidence has badly
faltered. It is not enough to issue reassuring statements to a sceptical
public; we have to act and be seen to act to improve food standards. We
have to show the public that their interests are genuinely at the heart
of food safety decision making. We also have to help educate and inform
the public on what they can do to ensure that their food is safe to eat.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Creating a new food standards agency is
a bold and innovative step to depoliticise food, to further sensible discussion
of related matters and to move away from the highly charged and emotive
arena of tabloid headlines, of which we have seen so many in recent weeks
and months. The Scottish Executive wants a reasonable, responsible, informed
and open approach to food safety issues in Scotland. We want Scotland's
future food safety policy to be based on the best available expertise and
to be anchored in sound scientific advice-the best available. We also want
to ensure that that policy is transparent and clearly explained, not in
scientific jargon but in terms that are easily understandable to the person
in the street.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is our aim in supporting the creation
of the new food standards agency. We want it to make its assessment from
the standpoint of the best available science; contain people who are skilled
in risk management and risk communication; have an open, transparent approach;
and be headed by a board that is selected through open recruitment, subject
to Nolan committee rules, drawing together experience, knowledge and skills
in what is a complex and important area. We also want it to have increased
powers to undertake monitoring and surveillance and an enhanced enforcement
capability.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It will, of course, still be for us as
politicians and policy makers to decide how to act, but we will be doing
that from an informed position, with access to expert advice and in a spirit
of openness. The agency will publish the advice that it gives to ministers-advice
that we can choose to accept or reject. We will then be expected to explain
publicly why we have reached our decision. That is as it should be. We
are doing all this because the public expect-rightly-that those responsible
for maintaining food safety put the protection of public health first.
The prize to be won is primarily for consumers: the promise of greater
assurance over food safety.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

processors and manufacturers. Scotland produces high-quality food products
and exports to countries throughout the world. If our food industries are
to build, retain or regain markets, they must operate from a position where
consumers have confidence in the safety of their food and where we have
sound food safety policy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For more than a decade, there have been
food scares. All too often we have seen well-intentioned interventions,
from experts and others, result in contradictory advice, perplexity and
confusion. We must break through that. That is why we need a body that
can speak authoritatively and give expert advice to the public, to industry,
to consumers, to enforcers and to us as policy makers. Such a body will
be a crucial component in driving up food standards.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Responsible, informed debate and keeping
consumer interests at heart are our guiding principles for the development
of food safety and standards policy. As the Scottish Executive, that is
what we aim to achieve. We must consider how best to deliver change and
what mechanisms will work best to further the interests of the people of
Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Food is a devolved area. The proposed UK
agency provides flexible arrangements for specific action to be taken in
Scotland should the circumstances require it. The proposals provide the
benefits of flexibility and room for manoeuvre in Scotland, coupled with
the consistency and clarity brought by UK-wide arrangements. Food problems
do not recognise borders. Food emergencies can quickly spill over from
Jedburgh to Carlisle, and in the other direction.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An important European dimension should
be borne in mind. Food law is voluminous, complex and much of it is EU-derived.
One of the key issues for us is to ensure that legal requirements are translated
clearly and consistently to provide the basis for efficient and effective
enforcement by, for example, local authorities and the Meat Hygiene Service.
Again, the consistency of approach that can be provided by a UK-wide body
underpins that principle.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A large task lies ahead. We now have a
significant opportunity to make an impact on this problem and to make a
difference in Scotland. This bill gives us the right arrangements for Scotland:
a separate Scottish arm for the agency and a new independent Scottish food
advisory committee to advise on food safety issues in Scotland. The agency
will be accountable to the Scottish Parliament in the same way as it is
accountable to Westminster. Through a range of joint decision-making powers
and arrangements, that will ensure that Scotland's voice is properly heard.</font></td>

Nithsdale) (SNP): </strong>SNP members welcome the creation of a food standards
agency in Scotland. Others will talk about the effect on consumers, but
I want briefly to mention the effect on the food industry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The food industry is vital, especially
for many rural parts of Scotland. It has many areas of excellence; it is
an industry of which we should rightly be proud. As Susan Deacon said,
it is essential that we increase consumer confidence and remove the suspicion-not
necessarily always justified-that the agriculture department is in the
pockets of the producers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The food industry in Scotland thrives because
of its high reputation and high standards. Production-agriculture and horticulture-is
not the only important area. There are also many downstream jobs-in processing,
packaging and retailing. An independent agency should maintain high standards
and help to reinforce public confidence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the Government's change of heart
on the proposed levy that was to be placed on food outlets. That would

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to spend some time on the constitutional
aspect of this measure. As Susan has said, food standards are a matter
that has been devolved to this Parliament. Many matters are devolved to
this Parliament by default. In other words, they are not mentioned specifically
in the Scotland Act 1998, which lists a great number of matters that are
not devolved-that is what schedule 5, on reserved matters, is all about.

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those are all matters for the Scottish
Parliament-the Parliament that we will open next week with great celebration
and royal and prime ministerial visits. However, before we even assume
our powers in nine days' time, Westminster is embarking on legislation
on an area that is totally devolved. In fact, it has already embarked on
the legislation-the second reading debate on the Food Standards Bill took
place at Westminster on Monday. I must say that far more people are here
today than were present in the chamber at Westminster for that debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is not some spin-off from a piece
of reserved legislation that happens to touch peripherally on a Scottish
devolved matter. It is substantive and deliberative legislation-something
for which, in nine days, we will be responsible. Why has the Government
decided that it wants to keep some of the devolved powers down at Westminster?
Does Westminster not want to let go? Does it want to ram home the idea
that, ultimately, it remains in charge?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The argument will be made-it has already
been made-that there is some administrative convenience in having the same
legislation and the same agency across the UK. Frankly, that argument could
be applied across practically the whole range of devolved powers. If it
is believed that a single policy, a single agency and a single set of regulations
are the best way in which to proceed, why devolve anything? The time to
decide whether food standards should be a devolved matter was when the
Scotland Act 1998 was being considered by the House of Commons. That was
when the decision was taken that the matter should be devolved to this
Parliament. The essence of devolution, surely, is that we may wish to do
things differently from how they are done in other parts of the country,
either substantially or on points of detail.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

If we had our own food standards agency, not only could we could locate

genuinely independent the new food standards agency would be. For example,
could it lift the beef-on-the-bone ban? If ministers routinely overrule
the agency's recommendations, it is difficult to see how the agency could
win full public confidence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is also concern that the proposed
agency would add to the many burdens that are already imposed on small
and medium-size British food producers, because our standards would be
higher than those required of imported food. That leads to the crucial
question whether we can have the same confidence when we buy imported food
in our shops and supermarkets as we have when we buy British food. We must
address that in setting up the agency. Will the regulations apply equally
to food that is produced in other European Union countries to guarantee
British consumers consistent standards and protection?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have raised this point in the chamber
before: the bill makes no provision for the environmental impact of the
way in which foods are grown. There is widespread public concern over GM
foods and crops; the food standards agency could probably help to allay
those concerns if it were given the power to investigate. We believe that
not giving the agency that power is a serious deficiency in the bill.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are constantly faced with conflicting
information and contradictory academic research on environmental and public
health concerns. That does not apply only to GM food. A headline in <i>The
Scotsman</i> today reads: "Consumers 'being sold poisoned vegetables'".
I am pleased that the minister is addressing that. It is time, in her words,

headlines that we see week by week.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Risk assessment and decisions must be open
to public and parliamentary scrutiny. For example, what is the risk assessment
of GM food compared with that of beef on the bone? I believe that the public
need to know. We need to reassure them over their concerns. If the agency
had the power to investigate GM foods, the public could have greater confidence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The food standards agency should not be
used to penalise Scottish producers unfairly. The over-regulation of food
producers, which is not matched by the regulation of EU and other overseas
producers, leads to an overall competitive disadvantage for producers in
this country-for our farmers and for our food industries. In addressing
the food standards agency, ministers should deal with the divergence of
standards and the public health concerns arising from that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>I
want to say how much I welcome this bill and the fact that, in this instance,
legislation is covering the whole of the United Kingdom. It is interesting
that members of the SNP, in opposition, want to delay the protection of
the Scottish community by seeking separate legislation. We already have
a full legislative programme and a full consultation programme on other
bills. To delay this bill would be very foolish.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Susan made the point, very strongly, that
bacteria do not respect boundaries. People also move around and it is important
that we have legislation that covers the whole of these islands rather
than separate legislation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mrs Scanlon's point was good: in the long
term, we require European legislation. However, until we can get our European
partners to consider the problems as seriously as we do, that will be difficult.
We should not wait for European legislation, but go ahead with the present
legislation, which is good not only because it fulfils one of the UK Labour
Government's pledges but because it sets out clearly the devolved role
and powers of this Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Chisholm has already referred to the
fact that the bill does not preclude this Parliament from enacting its
own legislation in future if we feel it necessary. However, we should not
enact separate legislation simply out of the beliefs that are held by the
SNP. Where legislation should cover the whole of the UK, it is appropriate
that it&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">does so. The unity
of one act, in this case, seems beneficial.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will refer to one example in the bill.
Clause 8(2)(b) deals with the powers of the agency to commission specific
research. If that is done on a UK-wide basis, costs will be kept down and
the Scottish institutions-which punch well above their weight in terms
of research-will be able to compete to undertake the research, which would
be beneficial. Roughly 12 per cent of total research takes place in Scotland,
whereas one would suppose it to be 9 per cent on a per capita basis. If
research were separated out, there would be no real benefit.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The bill gives us specific powers. For
example, we will have our own Scottish director. Indeed, I hope that our
ministers will lobby for the agency to be based in Scotland; nothing in
the bill precludes that. We also have a number of other powers to scrutinise
the agency's work. We have to have agreement on the published objectives
of the agency; again, this Parliament will be consulted. Clause 22 of the
bill specifically requires the agency to promote links with the Scottish
Administration. Beyond that, there are even some powers that must be retained
by the Scottish Ministers and that the UK secretary of state is expressly
forbidden from exercising. Again, that is entirely appropriate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we had different legislation now, and
later sought more stringent rules, we could affect our food industry, which-as
the SNP spokesman said-is very important to us. I see no need for different
legislation. Is Mr Morgan suggesting that we should have less stringent
rules? If we did, we would not adequately be protecting the Scottish public.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I submit that the motion is the right one
for this Parliament at this time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">16:03</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD): </strong>On
behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I welcome the minister's statement and
the style in which she made it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The bill is a most important one, which
has been long awaited and long in gestation. It is unfortunate that Alasdair
Morgan contributed a carping diatribe about whether the bill should have
been introduced as Scottish legislation, instead of giving us the benefit
of his extensive constituency and other experience in the field. People
are interested in the end result, not in where the bill came from or how
it came about. Other speakers have dealt, properly, with the limitations
that Alasdair Morgan suggested.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">offence among the
42,000 small businesses in this country. The flat-rate levy was a flat-headed
idea and it will not be missed; it was self-evidently unfair that a small
village shop should be charged the same rate as a large, wealthy supermarket
such as Tesco or Safeway. Although it was hardly necessary to have an expensive
consultation exercise to arrive at that conclusion, at least the Labour
Government at Westminster has listened and done the right thing in the
end. I hope to see the Government pursue that exercise and model on the
issue of tuition fees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Scottish Liberal Democrats can justly
claim to have led the way on that issue. We had a commitment in the partnership
agreement to find a fairer funding system for the food standards agency
in Scotland. We now have that and we must get on with establishing the
agency, aiding public health, aiding the struggling agricultural sector
and increasing public confidence in our quality domestic produce. The implementation
of the bill cannot come a moment too soon.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A number of speakers have dwelt on the
issue of the position of the Scottish food industry. I think that the presence
of higher standards-which have admittedly arisen out of troubles that we
have had in the past-is a major opportunity for British and Scottish food.
In that respect we should be able to pull ahead of the field because of
the high standards that the food standards agency will go some way towards
producing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Lewis Macdonald (Aberdeen Central) (Lab):
</strong>First, I would like to take issue with Mr Morgan's problems about the
essence of devolution. It seems to me that the essence of devolution in
this respect is that we are having this debate today and that we are making
the decision about whether to go ahead. I feel very strongly that we are
right to go ahead with a single United Kingdom food standards agency, and
to encourage the UK Parliament to proceed with this bill and bring it forward
with all possible speed so that the agency is in place by the beginning
of next year.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am only just old enough to remember the
last typhoid epidemic in this country 30 years ago, during which Aberdeen
was placed in a kind of collective quarantine because of a single consignment
of infected imported corned beef. Other nightmares are more recent and
have been referred to. Human-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is perhaps
the most stunning failure of all in food standards. There has been an outbreak
of E coli most recently in the north-east in Mr Salmond's constituency,
but most disastrous was the outbreak of E coli in central Scotland a couple
of years ago.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Morgan asked
if there are exceptional circumstances. Yes, there are and they include
E coli and those other failures of Scottish food standards that should
inspire our debate today. The problem is not just Scottish. It is vital
that British consumers should have confidence in the food that they buy
whether it is British-produced, imported, or from north or south of the
border. I think it is appropriate that the standards should be the same.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is not simply a UK bill in the old-fashioned
sense. It is a bill that reflects the reality of devolution. As little
as a year ago, it could not have been written in the terms in which it
has been written. Not only will two of the board members of the food standards
agency be appointed by ministers of this Parliament, and not only will
there be a separate director for Scotland heading an executive wing of
the agency, but there will be an independent Scottish food advisory committee
in order to reflect the range of expertise and interests in food safety.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that ministers will carry the cause
of devolution further forward by locating the Scottish wing of the agency
not in Edinburgh, but in Aberdeen, which boasts the highest concentration
in Europe of expertise in life sciences, environmental sciences and food
sciences. There are more than 3,000 people working in those fields.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must first get the show on the road.
The food standards bill belongs to the age of devolution in one respect
above all others, and that has been referred to by a couple of my colleagues
already. It recognises that the Scottish Parliament can, whenever it chooses,
amend, repeal or adjust any aspect of the bill once it is enacted. We get
the best of both worlds: quick, decisive action and the power to do otherwise
in the future should we wish that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would draw the minister's attention to
a point in clause 42(3) of the bill. That extends the agency's right of
inspection and enforcement to territorial waters and the continental shelf.
That will have a particular impact on food premises on oil and gas rigs
in the British sector of the North sea. There have been some questions
in this Parliament about jurisdictional matters in the North sea and I
would be very grateful if the minister could answer those.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My constituent Professor Hugh Pennington
is one of the experts in food safety whom I mentioned. I think that his
report on E coli has set the tone for this bill. He has consistently urged
ministers for the past two years to get a move on and not to delay, but
to get the bill passed into law as soon as possible. I think that we should
support the motion and do that.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD):
</strong>I welcome the minister's announcement of the setting up of a food standards
agency in Scotland. It will be one of the most significant new bodies to
be established in many years and it will contribute to the prosperity of
our food industry. In the past 10 to 15 years, the food industry has undergone
one food scare after another, resulting in great crises of confidence in
the products that Scotland produces. BSE is a classic example of such a
scare, but there have been others.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Every time a food scare erupted on the
front pages, a politician would try to calm and reassure the public. Who
could forget Douglas Hogg? Who could forget John Gummer feeding that beefburger
to his children? On every occasion, politicians failed to reassure the
public about the safety of the product; many times, they made the situation
worse. Why? Because the public does not believe what politicians say about
food safety any more.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is the situation that we face and
that is why the setting up of a food standards agency is essential.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):
</strong>Will George Lyon agree that the statements that were made by Douglas
Hogg and other ministers were based on the medical evidence that was available
to them?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>George Lyon: </strong>I do not doubt their
statements. I was suggesting that, although the statements were based on
science, the public was not reassured by them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The key issue in the setting up of the
agency must be to ensure that the public has confidence in the agency.
The agency must be seen to be independent, particularly of the political
process, the food lobby and the consumer lobby. It must clearly be seen
to be an independent agency whose sole concern is food safety and which
judges all the issues that concern food safety on the best scientific advice
that is available.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the agency achieves those objectives,
it will be the greatest boost that the food industry will get in the coming
years. We must all hope that it frees the food industry from the food scare
crises that bedevil our industry year after year. I support the motion
wholeheartedly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the establishment
of the food standards agency and I want to emphasis the important role
that it will have in protecting our families. It is interesting that, because
of the food scares, issues of food safety have become universal. Before
the scares, questions of health and food were often seen as the province
of those with the income and time to move beyond the normal run of food
outlets. As the issues have come into the popular domain, we have a responsibility
to ensure that they remain there. We all have a role to play in ensuring
that we eat safely and healthily.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I welcome the decision not to fund the
agency by an across-the-board levy on retail outlets. That would have had
a significant impact on small outlets as they would have had to make a
hugely disproportionate contribution. The debate around the issue has revealed
the way in which the big retail companies have concentrated their businesses
in a small number of premises, very often to the detriment of local communities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It has been claimed that David McLetchie
should get credit for that change. As I am usually reluctant to give the
Tories credit for anything, I would like to make another claim and declare
an interest. I am supported by the Co-operative party, which is the political
wing of the Co-operative movement. The retail wing of the movement is absolutely
committed to supporting and sustaining local communities and does that
by supporting small shops and establishing outlets, often in remote areas
and poor areas. That strategy would have meant that the Co-operative movement
would have been heavily penalised by a decision to fund the agency by an
across-the-board levy. The role of the Co-operative movement in ensuring
that there is not an across-the-board levy should be recognised, as should
the fact that the Government was willing to make that change.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the broader question of food safety,
I think we should recognise the drive towards uniformity in our shopping
habits. That uniformity often excludes the poor, the elderly and those
who do not own a car and makes those people more likely to suffer from
poor standards of food safety. We should recognise the particular importance
of supporting community and co-operative initiatives that relate to food
and food safety. Those initiatives are able to address the issues and sustain
new developments at a local level, something which will improve the health
and safety of all communities in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should all welcome the importance of
the food standards agency and look forward to the agency doing effective
work on behalf of the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

It is no surprise, then, that we have finally come to an issue on which
we are going to throw ourselves in with the Administration-or the Labour
party-view.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We welcome the terms in which the bill
has been introduced. I acknowledge the contribution made by Mr Sam Galbraith
in the early stages of this discussion. He took his roadshow around Scotland
in the months leading up to the election, and on two occasions I involved
myself in discussion with him. I was impressed by his understanding of
how important it was that this issue was introduced at a UK-wide level
rather than solely at a Scottish level.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My primary concern is that we ensure that
the bill does not damage Scotland's farming and food-producing industry.
The Royal Highland Show, Scotland's showcase for the farming and food-producing
industry, will open at Ingliston this week. We must remember that Scottish
quality products have a reputation worldwide.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scotland's farmers have nothing to fear
from the introduction of a food standards agency, but we must ensure that
they are not penalised by the introduction of the agency. As farmers and
food producers, we operate in a European single market. It is essential,
therefore, that we pursue a single standard wherever possible. We want
food standards to be as high as possible; we must have common standards
and must accept that if we are to impose higher standards in Scotland,
we will naturally disadvantage Scotland's farmers. Worse still, we will
take away their greatest marketing tool.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scotland's farmers have high standards
and Scotland's food production industry has a worldwide reputation. It
is that higher voluntary standard that gives us the marketing edge. We
cannot afford legislation that imposes higher standards in Scotland or
allow that to affect our farmers. Similarly, we cannot afford to have food
imported into the United Kingdom that is produced to a lower standard than
that which is produced here. We see examples of that every day. Scotland's
pig producers are on the verge of bankruptcy as a result of legislation
that disproportionately affected UK and Scottish producers and allowed
cheaper foreign product, produced to a lower standard, to compete directly
with the domestic product.</font></td>
