<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am concerned
about the quality of the materials that will be used, and about the apparent
lack of natural stone. The cost is escalating. Parliamentarians are notorious
for the cost of their buildings. The new members' building at Westminster
is a case in point-the bronze cladding alone will cost &pound;50 million-and
the Sam Rayburn building on Capitol hill in Washington DC came in at something
like 500 per cent over budget. We are not exactly good at keeping buildings
within budget.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are sending out the wrong signal today.
Our priority should be not ourselves, but the people of Scotland. A lot
of passionate speeches were made from the Labour benches during the debate
on the legislative programme yesterday, and I agreed with them. Surely
we should be housing Scotland's pupils first-before we house Scotland's
politicians. Our priority should be to catch up with the enormous backlog
of school building maintenance. Politicians can make do with a flat desk
and a phone. It is not the building that counts, but the people in it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):
</strong>I now call Margo MacDonald to begin the winding-up speeches. I apologise
to the eight members who were still hoping to speak, but I think that we
have done well. You have seven minutes, Ms MacDonald.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">12:31</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald (Lothians) (SNP):
</strong>Can I confirm that I have seven minutes?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>That is correct.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms MacDonald: </strong>I will attempt to
summarise the debate and I will try hard to disregard John McAllion's friendly
advice that we should all just keep quiet in our opposition. I do not mean
to keep quiet, not because-I say this to Mr Watson-I am being opportunist,
but because I was elected by people in this area.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Just like Cathie Craigie, the member for
Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, I feel a sense of civic responsibility and public
responsibility. I have direct contact with the people who meet me going
down the High Street-I do not mind meeting Edinburgh folk going down the
High Street-and who say, "I hope you're going to do something about this.
What are we spending all this money for?" Then they detail all the things
that they would choose to spend money on before spending it on a Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So far, whether we like it or not, we have
not necessarily made the best case for making the Parliament the priority
for public spending. I make no apology for asking for a delay, as I think
that we would use that delay constructively. We need&nbsp;</font></td>

should have the very best building that Scotland can afford, as we have
yet to convince all the people who elected us-and that goes for all of
us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I see Cathie Craigie shaking her head.
She said that people in her constituency voted for the Parliament. The
question that I wanted to ask her was whether her constituents voted for
a &pound;90 million Parliament or for a &pound;50 million Parliament. The
people who voted for me did not vote for a Parliament where the costs appear
to be escalating outwith control.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Cathie Craigie </strong><i>rose-</i></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms MacDonald: </strong>I will certainly give
way; I have better manners.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Cathie Craigie: </strong>Does Ms MacDonald
agree that the figure of &pound;90 million was in the public domain more
than a year ago?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms MacDonald: </strong>I think that that
is true, but it is also true that neither her constituents nor mine make
a habit of reading <i>Hansard</i>. [<i>Laughter.</i>] However, I will move
on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Several factors influenced this amendment.
There is the concern that the Holyrood site is not the most suitable. I
know that we are past the time when the then Scottish secretary was advised
against choosing other than Calton hill. I accept that time has moved on,
that the General Post Office building is not available and that other considerations
will have to be taken into account. The amendment asks for those other
considerations to be taken into account.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the time that has elapsed, we have also
found that the four-acre site at Holyrood, which was judged to be adequate,
is probably not adequate. When any of the local authority people in this
chamber were building big, they would usually have a wee bit of land for
contingency expansion, but no contingency expansion has been built into
this grand design.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, there is a site that has not yet
been built on; I think that it has been procured by Teague Homes (Scotland)
Ltd. If we use the time that the amendment asks for productively, perhaps
we could revisit that decision. Do the builders need all that land? Could
we do a bit of business with them? We need some land for expansion purposes,
as the site has already expanded from 16,000 sq m to 23,000 sq m. I am
not arguing about that-we may well need the extra support staff to cope
with the expansion. However, before the people-who pay for everything-see
how the Parliament benefits the quality of decision making in Scotland,
they will ask "What do you need all those staff for?"</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I appeal directly to the First Minister
for time to sell our idea to the people who elected us. There&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">is no doubt about
the site's shortcomings. I am not talking about the design of the building,
but about how the site is hemmed in and cannot expand without going into
Holyrood park. I think that Patricia Ferguson said that such an expansion
might enhance and bring life to the park. However, we do not want too much
life in the park; we like it as it is. Furthermore, we do not want the
kind of office-block accommodation that we have at the moment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is another important point that members
did not raise, perhaps because Robin Harper has a specialist interest in
these matters. When I first expressed an interest in this issue, I was
contacted-before the election-by many architects, two or three of whom
advised me that no wind-tunnel test had been done. At least, we have not
seen any results of a wind-tunnel test. Perhaps when Mr McLeish sums up,
he can tell us whether such a test has been carried out and, if not, whether
there are plans to have one. We also have to ask what would happen if the
plans were to fail that test.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Frank MacAveety suggested that the Scottish
Parliamentary Corporate Body could do everything that I am asking for.
However, if the site is not big enough and if an independent assessor's
estimate shows that extra land is needed, will the SPCB be entitled to
go ahead with its plans? We have been told that the Executive has full
responsibility for the configuration of roads around the site. Who will
be responsible for the recalibration-which is referred to in documents
that I have-that the site will probably need? The amendment seeks time
for us to find answers to such questions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Traffic is the big concern in Edinburgh.
Too many people are trying to get to work from Newington or by using London
Road. Most members may not be familiar with Edinburgh's traffic problems,
which are becoming intolerable. Those problems are operating against the
city's best interests and the question is too serious to leave to the SPCB
to decide in our interest. The interests are much wider than that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When members come to vote, they should
remember that we are not saying that Holyrood should not go ahead, but
that too many questions remain unanswered. We plead for time to find adequate
answers to those questions and to find a building for this Parliament of
which we can be proud.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

McNulty to respond to the debate on behalf of the SPCB.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">different points
of view on the subject. However, the debate has been conducted in such
a way that Holyrood has become the whipping-boy for different points of
view and different motivations. I am not sure that the debate has been
about the case for or against the building's merits, which should be the
basis for any decision as important and as significant as this.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are a number of very good reasons
why the Parliament's present accommodation is unsuitable and why we need
to make a decision and proceed with the new plan relatively quickly. Members
have mentioned the quality of this debating chamber. I think that this
debating chamber is good for members; people are pleased with it. It has
an atmosphere of its own.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This building is unsatisfactory in terms
of access for disabled people, however. It would be difficult for any member
who was disabled to use this chamber and building. If we want to be inclusive
and build a Parliament for Scotland that everybody can participate in,
we should move the accessibility agenda forward as quickly as possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Parliament is not a matter only for
parliamentarians. As a member of the corporate body, I am aware of the
unsatisfactory working conditions of many of the people who work for the
Parliament. In the switchboard area, in the kitchens and in rooms in the
office building, people are working in unsatisfactory circumstances that
prevent them from doing their jobs as effectively as I-and they-would wish.
Their circumstances should be addressed as well as ours. That is one reason
why we should consider the project rather than the political furore that
surrounds it. If we want an efficient and effective Parliament, which the
people working for it can be proud of, we must proceed to a new building
and new arrangements as soon as possible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was interested in a number of points
that were made in the debate. Some members said that they were in favour
of Holyrood but wanted a delay to get more information. In the past week,
the corporate body has, since it took over responsibility for the Holyrood
project, made a great deal of information available about the proposals
for the Parliament building; it will continue to do so if the motion is
agreed to.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There will be a clear, interactive process
of deliberation and debate about the design of the building. That process
will involve all members of the Parliament and, I hope, a lot of other
people, including Parliament employees. Many details and arrangements within
the footprint of the building have yet to be finalised. Even if the decision
is made today, which I hope it will be, there will be many opportunities
for people to participate in and contribute to the decision-making process.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Salmond:
</strong>On a point of order. It was said that Mr McNulty was speaking on behalf
of the corporate body. Has the corporate body taken a view on the matter?
It seems from Mr McNulty's speech that he has. Is he speaking on behalf
of himself or the corporate body?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>The corporate
body will respond to whatever the decision of this Parliament is at the
end of the debate. Mr McNulty is responding to the points raised in the
debate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>I make it clear that
whatever the Parliament decides today-whether it decides to go ahead with
the project or to support Mr Gorrie's amendment-the corporate body will,
within the terms and remit of its responsibility, carry out the broad wishes
of the Parliament. However, the corporate body has responsibilities to
Parliament; it has responsibilities to the staff and to members. Strong
arguments have emerged in the debate and why we should make a decision
as quickly as possible about the future circumstances of the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we proceed with the proposal, the corporate
body will attempt to consult as broadly as possible. There are problems
associated with our staying in the present circumstances. The office building
has a series of internal problems-for example, there are problems with
asbestos-which will cause difficulties if we are there for any length of
time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Providing accommodation for committees
is a particular problem in the office building. We intend to make a series
of commitments today to establish 16 committees: it is difficult to see
how those committees could be accommodated effectively, given the range
of public access commitments-contained in all the parties' manifestos-that
the Parliament has made.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The corporate body will seek to operate
within the terms of the decisions of the Parliament, but a series of issues
indicate that we have to make a decision on the Parliament building as
quickly as possible. Those issues have arisen as a result of the considerations
that have been presented by the design team, the Executive and others.
If we are obliged to delay, that will cost the corporate body and the Parliament
a significant amount of money. That should not be ignored. The corporate
body is required to look at the financial circumstances and implications
of any delay.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

However, the importance is not for us as parliamentarians, because, as
was pointed out, we are only the custodians for the Scottish people. We
have been asked to make a decision about what will probably be one of the
most important buildings to be constructed in Scotland for 300 years. There
is enormous responsibility on our shoulders to get it right.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Before I wind up, I would like to respond
to Margo MacDonald's question on wind-tunnel tests, as I am sure that the
whole of Scotland is waiting for an answer. I am informed that those tests
are in hand but, with my usual courtesy, I will send Margo a note with
more details.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ms MacDonald: </strong>I am delighted to
hear that the wind-tunnel tests are in hand, although I am surprised that
they were not in hand a bit earlier. What happens if the tests fail?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>I think that Margo
is just being greedy now-I have been generous in outlining the fact that
there will be wind-tunnel tests. Let us hang on for the outcome of those
and a host of other technical tests that are taking place.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This debate has been characterised by a
lot of passion. People complain about the lack of passion among politicians,
but we are passionate. Today, the First Minister gave not only a political
commitment, but a passionate commitment to advance this project. That commitment
was not for Donald Dewar, but for the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I said that we had a big decision to make
today. A lot of sound practical questions have been raised about the Parliament,
to which I will return. However, there has been a slight element of politics
as well. I am sure that people in all parties-some of whom are now being
whipped-will be approaching Mr Gorrie's amendment in one of two ways. Some
people will be attracted to the notion that by having a delay we will be
able to examine some of the practical issues. However, others will support
the amendment because they want us to remove ourselves from Holyrood. Those
people want to return to old shibboleths such as the old Royal High School.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am being constructive: let us cut through
the issues and be crystal clear on what the amendment is about. If this
debate is to be practical, I think that I have some of the answers to the
problems. However, if the exercise-and let us be honest about this-is about
removing ourselves from Holyrood and looking at alternative sites, we are
talking about delaying discussions not for a short time, but for a prolonged
period. At the end of the delay, we will not know whether that delay was
on the grounds of costs and other practicalities or on the grounds of politics.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A number of important practical points
have been made about transport, the environment and special needs. I believe
that the details in the material on all those issues will go some way towards
allaying members' fears.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is obviously critical that there is
wheelchair access on the floor of the new chamber. There are no members
in wheelchairs now, but if we are, as we say, an inclusive Parliament,
we must build for every contingency. That will be done.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Robin Harper is massively wrong about the
environment issues. I will send him all the material that I have. The new
Parliament will rightly be one of the most environmentally sensitive buildings
that we have ever produced in this country. The details will be forthcoming.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

we have been the repository of much expert opinion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Members may want to discuss such issues
and that is the point of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. It
is an all-party body. We will consult the SNP, the Conservatives and, of
course, the Liberals and the other parties. Surely we do not need a committee.
Members are genuinely concerned about the issues, but do they imagine for
a minute that the technicians, the Scottish Office staff and Mr Miralles's
team are sitting twiddling their thumbs day in and day out? From wind-tunnel
tests through to the rest, this is on-going work.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why do we not use the existing machinery
that this Parliament has set up? We vested our interests as a parliamentary
body in a group that is chaired by the Presiding Officer and that includes
Des McNulty and other colleagues. Do not members trust them? Are we really
saying that we want a two-month delay so that we can bypass the existing
procedure? I do not think that we are. Let us have faith in our colleagues,
whom we have charged with looking after matters that are responsibility
of this proud Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

a penny more than is necessary to ensure a quality environment at Holyrood

Do members think that we will go to all this expense just to downgrade
the quality of our chamber when we move to Holyrood? Of course we will
not. The SPCB is the custodian of our collective interest in this area.
Why should not we-from wheelchair access on-ensure that we have the kind
of debating chamber that we 129 members want? We are not talking about
what Mr Miralles wants-he is doing an excellent job but, as the people
who will work in that Parliament, we can have an influence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

do not think about their party. This is not a party issue. This is about
a working Parliament for the people of Scotland-something that they and

paid money to come and look at architecture. We want the best, but I suggest
that we should not set up any other machinery.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Members want to address these real, practical
issues-we can easily let the SPCB look at them. We have access through
those members of our parties who are in the SPCB, but we also have direct
access to the issues. There has been a lot of distortion about the practical
issues. We have the machinery to translate issues of finance, design of
the chamber, transport, environment and access into the Parliament that
we want. The Scottish people elected us to take that decision, and if we
agree to the motion today, we can get on with the job.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
