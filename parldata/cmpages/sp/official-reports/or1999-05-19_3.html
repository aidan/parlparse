<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yesterday we saw a portent of things to
come when Labour tried to bury the prayers debate in a review by a sub-committee.
How much more will Labour try to bury away? Labour wants to bury debate
and decision making in this Parliament and the Liberal Democrats have given
them the shovel.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">15:16</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP): </strong>Johann
Lamont hit the nail squarely on the head when she talked about the ministerial
team as being Labour's team, not a Labour-Liberal Democrat team. Over the
next weeks and months we will hear more and more about Labour's team and
Labour's policies, and less and less about the Liberal Democrats in that
partnership.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The saddest comment this morning came from
Lord Watson, who told this chamber that the issue of tuition fees has now
assumed a ridiculous level of importance. I have no doubt that those insensitive
remarks will reverberate around the campuses of Scotland. This chamber
must oppose any policy that prohibits the participation of individuals
in higher education for purely financial reasons. Among the implications
of such a policy that we have already seen are that applications to institutions
of higher education are down 6 per cent this year, while one fifth of Scottish
students now go without a meal every day because of financial hardship.
Students forced to pay tuition fees without grants often have to take two
or three part-time jobs, thereby displacing the less academically qualified
from the job market and entrenching social exclusion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As we know, the Liberal Democrats are committed
to abolishing tuition fees; unfortunately, not this millennium. I oppose
the appointment of Mr Smith to the ministerial team. His constituency includes
the University of St Andrews. I am sure that students of that worthy institution
and others would like to know the answer to the following question: if
the committee of inquiry opposes abolition, as we expect it will do, will
Mr Smith, as deputy whip, act as enforcer and compel Liberal Democrat members
to vote against their consciences, their manifestos, their activists and
electors, in order to ensure the retention of tuition fees? I am willing
to stand aside for Mr Smith to give a yes or no answer to that question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Iain Smith (North-East Fife) (LD): </strong>Which
words of the agreement do you not understand? The two parties will each
consider the evidence and conclusions of the committee of inquiry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Gibson: </strong>I asked for a yes or
no answer, Mr Smith. Please give that answer.</font></td>

will decide what to say in an intervention. The parties are not bound in
advance. Which words do you not understand? It is clear that the Liberal
Democrats will make up their minds, and I as a whip will deliver what they
want to vote, not what other parties want to vote.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer: </strong>Are
you finished, Mr Gibson?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Gibson: </strong>Yes, I am. I ended by

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab): </strong>I
had a fixed speech with which to address this chamber. However, as a new
member of this parliament-as we all are-I find it difficult that we are
repeating a debate on all the issues with which we dealt this morning,
on which there was a vote and on which the SNP and the Conservatives were
roundly defeated. What we are going through is a complete waste of time.
I do not deny the right of members to speak on the matter, but if this
chamber is going to constantly reiterate the same arguments, we will be
faced with a situation similar to that of the Houses of Parliament, where
the seats are empty. I for one am not going to sit here and listen to repeated
arguments the whole time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson: </strong>Will Dr Simpson give
way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>No, I will not give
way. I welcome this morning's appointment of Susan Deacon as the first
ever woman health minister in Scotland, and now speak to the nomination
of Iain Gray, who has specific responsibility for community care. Health
is an important issue, and the appointment of this team should be welcomed
by the whole chamber.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As a doctor, I welcome the commitment to
a patient-centred health service contained within "Partnership for Scotland".
There has been a protracted period of structural change in the national
health service in Scotland. Although those changes are designed specifically
and uniquely to meet the needs of the Scottish community, in partnership
with all health workers we must turn our attention to making those improved
structures work for the people who matter most: patients.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our patient-centred health programme will
include one-stop clinics to provide same-day tests and diagnosis, and a
new NHS helpline, NHS Direct, which will ensure that health advice is immediately
available around the clock, every day of the year, to everyone in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The programme will also include the
use of the best technology to link every doctor's surgery in Scotland to
the NHS, thus providing an immediate connection among surgeries, pharmacies
and hospitals. Under the previous leadership of Sam&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Galbraith, who
introduced the programme, Scotland already leads Britain in this area.
We have just begun to tap into the improvements in the care process that
the new information technology will create. Unlike the sterile debating
process in which we are engaged today, these are real issues that real
people are facing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will establish walk-in walk-out centres
that will offer same-day treatment by specialist staff.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>Will Dr Simpson give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>No. Perhaps the appointment
of Iain Gray as a junior minister, with a specific remit for care in the
community, will begin to break down the Berlin walls that have grown up
between health and social work since 1969. That is another real issue facing
real patients in hospitals today.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Matheson: </strong>Will Dr Simpson
give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Dr Simpson: </strong>No. Our patients need
a seamless care service and everything that the new department does will
be focused on patients. The partnership's renewed and binding commitment
to patient-centred care will allow the Government to commit to the biggest
ever hospital building programme in Scotland's history. It is a commitment
not only to shorten waiting lists but to speed up treatment and shorten
waiting times, to increase the number of doctors and to increase NHS spending
in real terms over the coming years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am particularly pleased that "Partnership
for Scotland" commits the Government to seek the guidance of the parliamentary
health committee. The real debates, as opposed to today's sterile debate,
will take place in the committees. We need to debate the complex issue
of tuition fees, but the soundbite approach that has been adopted by certain
members today is utterly appalling.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It gives me great pleasure to speak to
the nomination of Iain Gray. The Parliament should support his nomination.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

hollow if their colleagues in the House of Commons were not planning, simultaneously,
to impose a savage cut in incapacity benefit.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will address most of my remarks to the
Scottish Liberal party. I remember when that party had a proud tradition;
I remember the legacy of people such as John Bannerman and Jo Grimond.
It was a radical party and a party of principle. With this new partnership

in Scotland. I&nbsp;</font></td>

people such as Jo Grimond adopting the marshmallow antics of today's Liberal
Democrats in their dealings with the Labour party. I could never imagine
the earlier generation of Scottish Liberals selling out on a basic principle
of free education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What did the Liberal Democrats get, apart
from their ministerial positions? They got a committee of inquiry, but
we do not know whether it will have the power, the remit or the composition
to deal effectively with tuition fees. Who will nominate the committee
members-the eight Labour members of the Scottish Cabinet or the two Liberal
members? If the eight Labour members nominate Labour cronies who they know
will come up with the answer they are looking for, will the two Liberal
members have the right of veto over the nominations?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What will the committee's remit be? Will
it look at the issue of student poverty? [M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>:
"Yes."] Will it be able to address the reintroduction of student grants
and the issue of student loans? [M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>: "Yes."]
Will it meet, and take evidence, in public? [M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>:
"Yes."] If the committee recommends the abolition of tuition fees, do we
have a commitment from the benches opposite that the recommendation will
be accepted?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Swinney: </strong>Amid the tremendously
new-politics behaviour of Labour members, did Mr Neil notice that, when
he asked whether Labour members could give a cast-iron guarantee to support
the abolition of tuition fees if the report recommended it, there was silence?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>I did notice the silence,
but I thank Mr Swinney for the intervention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The actions of the Liberal Democrats reminds
me that Winston Churchill used to say-it is not often that a nationalist
quotes Winston Churchill-that the Liberals sat on the fence so much that
they could be called mugwumps; they sat on the fence with their mugs on
one side and their wumps on the other.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last week the wumps wanted the abolition
of tuition fees; this week the mugs have sold out on that issue. Last week
they were going to demand radical changes in the private finance initiative;
this week they have sold out on the private finance initiative. Last week
they were going to start to use the tax-raising power for investment in
education; this week they have ruled that out for four years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to wind up your speech, Mr Neil.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to put this question to the First Minister, but he is not now here, so

on this exercise? Has anybody considered the cost of the additional member
and all the trappings that go with ministerial positions? If so, could
they put a price on it?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would hazard a guess that the cost would
be about the same as the take from 1p on income tax, but I stand to be
corrected on that. [<i>Laughter.</i>] Before Dr Simpson laughs, he, or
a Labour minister, should come up with the figures. Dr Simpson suggested
that members were wrong to question the honesty of other members. This
debate is all about honesty. It is about pledges that were given to the
electorate. If Dr Simpson thinks that it is right to tell the electorate
one thing but do another he is in the wrong place.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would like to pick out one or two members,

bad start. The First Minister made clear the difference between fudge and
fig leaf. It was intriguing that, after hearing that perfect explanation,
Mr Gallie should plough on-obviously he did not believe that there was
any difference at all.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My leader, James Wallace, made it clear
this morning that we have not changed our position on tuition fees. That
will be perfectly clear to anyone who reads the partnership document.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is a pity that Mr Neil has not read
the document, which makes clear that the terms of reference, the time scale

the approval of Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

me why three of his party's members voted against the document because
of the policy on tuition fees? I walked past Mr Raffan as he was addressing
a camera in a somewhat animated manner; he was saying that he would not
vote for the document for that reason. Do those members misunderstand the
policy?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I regret to say that
Andrew Wilson is wrong. Those three members did not all vote against the
document because of tuition fees. There were other matters on which they
expressed-[<i>Interruption.</i>] The point, as Mr Raffan made clear, is
that they now accept the opinion of the majority of members and they retain-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

time left and I want to make two points.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I would not have recommended the agreement
to my colleagues if it had involved a matter of principle. I want to make
that absolutely clear. Anyone who reads the document will understand that
there is substantial give and take on both sides. Labour did not get a
majority and neither did the Liberal Democrats; that is why the document
reflects substantial changes in both form and substance to the parties'
positions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the appointments of junior ministers,
let us be clear that what is being formed is a Government, not an extension
of a department of the Scottish Office. The numbers that were suggested
by Mr McLetchie are absurd and would have made it almost impossible for
ministers to attend committees. The committees will be powerful and ministers
will have to attend them to ensure proper scrutiny.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to the fact that it is now 19 May and, from consultations with the chamber
office, I understand that parliamentary questions will not be received
for answer before 2 July, after which time the Parliament will go into
recess? Therefore, we will not receive an answer to any deliberative parliamentary
question until August. I think that that is simply unacceptable. Given
the fact that the Government's spending plans published by the Labour Government
eight weeks ago in "Serving Scotland's Needs" have been rendered entirely
useless by 25 words written in the coalition document, surely, as the democratic
legislature, the Parliament has the right to ask questions and to get answers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

will consider that issue very early on, but I am afraid that I am bound

<P><strong>Sitting Days</strong></p>
<P><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel): </strong>The next scheduled business of
the day is a debate on a Parliamentary Bureau motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">15:55</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Tom McCabe (Hamilton South) (Lab):
</strong>Under rule 8.2.6 of the standing orders, I move without notice that
the motion, That this Parliament agrees that the office of the Clerk should
be open on each of the following days: Monday 24 to Thursday 27 May, Tuesday
1 to Friday 4 June, Monday 7 to Friday 11 June and Monday 14 to Friday
18 June, should be taken now.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> I agree that
this motion without notice should be taken. The question is, That the motion
in the name of Mr Tom McCabe should be taken now. Are we all agreed?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Question agreed to.</font></i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> I call Mr
Tom McCabe. The debate will last no more than 30 minutes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>Rule 2.1.3 requires that
the days on which the office of the clerk is to be open shall be agreed
by the Parliament on a motion of the Parliamentary Bureau and that until
the Parliament has so decided, the Presiding Officer should appoint those
days. The Presiding Officer has announced, through the business bulletin,
that Wednesday 12 May to Friday 14 May, and Monday 17 May to Friday 21
May should be days on which the office of the clerk is open. This motion
seeks the Parliament's agreement to the days until mid-June on which the
office of the clerk should be open. I should make it clear that I am speaking
on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It may be helpful if I explain briefly
the significance of the office of the clerk being open. The Parliament
normally meets only on sitting days. The standing orders define sitting
days by reference to the days on which the office of the clerk is open.
That is why weekends are not included in the motion. The omission from
this motion of 28 May and 31 May means that the office of the clerk will
be closed on those public holidays and that those days are not sitting
days.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Parliamentary Bureau will continue
to consider the timing of the parliamentary recess as required under rule
2.3 of the standing orders, and a motion will be brought to the Parliament
in due course. In the meantime, I hope that this motion clarifies the situation
until mid-June.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I move,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That the office of the Clerk should be
open on each of the following days: Monday 24 to Thursday 27 May, Tuesday
1 to Friday 4 June, Monday 7 to Friday 11 June&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP):
</strong>I would like to repeat the point that I made earlier on a point of
order, and I hope that the Government's Business Manager will respond.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My understanding from the chamber office
is that parliamentary questions will not be taken or read until 2 July,
after which we go into recess. That means that legitimate questions will
not be answered until September. Earlier I said August, but a quick calculation
shows that they will not be answered until September. I do not think that
that is acceptable, given that the Government is now in place, its members
are performing their duties, and each minister has a role to fulfil.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the coalition agreement-a piece of research,
although to be polite I should perhaps call it a document-we have had substantial
changes to the Government's expenditure plans. Those plans were, as I said,
previously given in "Serving Scotland's Needs", which was published at
some expense and was rather nicely done. Earlier today, when I asked the
First Minister about those substantial changes, he was-despite a glib attack
on my position-unable to answer the question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Surely we in a Parliament that is supposed
to be a legislator should have the right to an answer to this very legitimate
question: if the Government is making public spending announcements-as
it has done-why are we not being told, in a zero sum budget, where the
money is coming from? There must be an unanswerable case for parliamentary
questions to be lodged at this stage and to be answered within a fortnight.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Furthermore, rule 5.8.1 of the standing
orders provides:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"In proposing the business programme, the
Parliamentary Bureau shall ensure that sufficient time is set aside-</font>
<ol TYPE="a">

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">between the beginning of May and the end of
June each year for the consideration of financial proposals".</font></li>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">What plans does Mr McCabe have to fulfil that
provision in 1999?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">15:58</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Keith Raffan (Mid Scotland and Fife)
(LD): </strong>I share Mr Wilson's concern about questions and the fact that
we will probably not be able to get even written answers until the early
autumn. If the Parliament rises on 2 July, that will certainly be the case
and it will slow up proceedings a great deal. I would be grateful for guidance
on when we will be able to lodge both written and oral questions.</font></td>

some further information. How far in advance does the Business Manager
intend to let us know the Parliament's business?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The earlier the better would be helpful.
I do not know whether there is a plan to have a business question time
such as that in the House of Commons-which I know is sometimes abused when
members ask spurious questions-but it would be useful to have the kind
of question time in which we would be able to put points regarding the
business of the following week to the Business Manager, and for individual
members to raise the concerns they feel should be debated.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Could Mr McCabe also let us know the current
situation with committees and the prospect of their being set up in the
near future? Can he give us any guidance on what is happening regarding
both statutory committees as set out in the consultative steering group
report and subject committees? The subject committees can now be set up

the office of the clerk have been published. What opportunity will there
be-for all opposition parties and not just the Scottish Nationalists as
the main opposition-to have substantive issues debated, such as the removal
from Scottish jurisdiction of 6,000 square miles of fishing waters? This
appears to have been carried out by stealth by Order in Council shortly
before the election in which we were all engaged.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The First Minister remarked that during
the election campaign the SNP promised the sun, the moon and the stars.
I would challenge that, but what is undoubtedly clear is that while we
were all fighting an election campaign, London Labour was stealing Scotland's
sea without any consultation with even members of the Scottish Fishermen's
Federation-who are present here today and met with us at lunch time. They
are anxious to meet with every other party in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a real sense of concern throughout
Scotland that there should be a very early opportunity for every party
to raise issues of substantive concern, such as the plight of Scottish
fishermen and the serious implications that that order passed by stealth
at Westminster will have in relation to prosecution under the English jurisdiction
of Scottish fishermen, such as the impact of regulation of the fisheries
industry and such as the fact that none of the bodies concerned appears
to have been consulted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

ridiculously long Westminster-style recess. Some of us will refuse to have
more holidays than does an average member of the Scottish public. There
is a lot of work to be got on with.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Mr Ewing said, what we have seen here
in this Parliament is a dodgy deal that has been steamrollered through
in England. Mr Blair has contrived what is virtually a one-party state.
We will not permit that in Scotland. We have seen in the alliance between
Labour and the Liberal Democrats what Roy Hattersley has described as an
alliance between a Venus flytrap and a bluebottle. The SNP is not prepared
to cut and run and leave major business unfinished, including the discussion
of student fees. This Parliament should stay here to do the duty that it
was put in place by the public to do.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Mr McCabe be good enough to explain in his summing up the implications
of his motion for our ability to put questions to the newly appointed members
of the Scottish Executive?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I understand from some unconfirmed media
reports that, supposedly, as this Parliament does not as yet have legislative
competence, we should not have the opportunity to ask questions of the
Executive until such time as we officially have legislative competence.
However, I would draw a distinction between the role of this Parliament
as a legislature-making laws-and its role in bringing the Scottish Executive
to account. It is important that the Executive is accountable to the people
of Scotland through us, their elected representatives, right from its creation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Today, the members of the Scottish Executive
have been approved by the Parliament. I understand that the Queen, as head
of state, has also already signified her approval of the First Minister,
so the Executive exists, whether or not we, as a Parliament, have legislative
competence. We ought, therefore, from an early date to have maximum opportunity
to put questions to the Executive. We may have to postpone deliberations

questions on behalf of our constituents and the people of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Perhaps Mr McCabe will be good enough to
address those points as well as the serious point raised by Dorothy-Grace
Elder. Here we are, a newly formed Parliament, and we seem to be cutting
and running already by going into a recess. I believe that the people out
there would prefer to see us getting our sleeves rolled up, getting some
work done and bringing the newly appointed Executive to account, which
is the important and immediate role that we have to play.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer:</strong> Before I
call the next speaker, I should make it clear that we are not discussing
the original motion lodged by Mr McCabe, but the revised motion, which
does not deal with the summer recess. We have not got to that yet.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab):
</strong>It is for this body to decide how best to scrutinise ministers, when
we meet and so on, but I would like to make a point about where the work
is being done. I do not know what Dorothy-Grace Elder thinks she will be
doing when she is not here. If I am not here, I fully intend to work on
behalf of my constituents, the people whom I represent in Glasgow Pollok.
With respect, it is old politics to think that sitting in this chamber
talking to one another makes change. What will make change for Scotland
is us working in our constituencies, representing the people there and,
above all, listening to what they have to say about what we should be doing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We must get away from the idea that to
prove that we are working hard for our constituents, we must sit in this
chamber. That is part of our role, and holding people to account for what
they do is an important part of the democratic process. However, it is
as important to ensure that the people of Scotland can participate actively
in that democratic process through the people whom they chose to elect

bodies. There are members of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation in the
gallery today-[<i>Interruption.</i>]. It is perfectly in order to mention
them. They are here because they expect this Parliament to have something
to say about their immediate concern, to which Fergus Ewing referred. Not
just Opposition members, but every member of this Parliament who is not
a member of the Executive has a responsibility to hold the Executive to
account. I welcome the redrafted motion, because it does not preclude the
possibility of us having the opportunity, before the summer recess, to
question the ministers who have been approved today. That is part of our
democratic responsibility.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Whether it be ministerial Mondeos or not,
there are perks that come with ministerial office, and rightly so. The
First Minister has been sworn in and he is entitled to the perks that allow
him to pursue that office. One of the responsibilities of ministerial office
is to be accountable to Parliament. It would not be correct for this Parliament
not to have the opportunity to question the ministers who have been elected
today and the First Minister before the summer recess. There is an obvious
choice: either we find a method of having substantive questions before
1 July 1999 or, alternatively, we delay the recess until we have had at
least one opportunity to question each minister who has been trusted by
this legislature today. That is not just a point for the Opposition parties,

I certainly would like the opportunity to question ministers on the issue
of the environment before the summer recess. There are many questions.
I accept that ministers may not be able to clarify many of the policies

we should be able to find out as much as possible before the summer recess.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I fully support
and sympathise with many of the points made about the opportunity to ask
substantive questions. So far, the legal advice that has been given to
the Parliamentary Bureau is that that will not be possible until 1 July
1999. At that date, people can lodge questions and then there is a further
requirement for those questions to lie on the table for eight days before
the ministers answer them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not think that that advice has satisfied
any representatives on the Parliamentary Bureau from any party, and the
representatives will be interested in finding ways in which substantive
discussions can take place in the weeks ahead and certainly prior to 1
July. I would stress, however, that the decision is not a whim of either
the Executive or any other party within the Parliament. If the legal advice
is that questions are not competent until such a date, I think it would
be prudent, to say the least, to pay attention to that advice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With regard to the arrangements for finance
in this year, the quotation from the standing orders is correct. However,
in the first year of the Parliament special arrangements are in place and
therefore there is no requirement in the time scale stated to deal with
that issue at this time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With regard to the business motion and
how far in advance Parliament will know exactly what is to be debated,
the intention is that there will be a business motion presented each week-from
memory it will be on a Wednesday-and, in a similar way to today, 30 minutes
will be available to discuss that motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With regard to committees, again, discussion
is on-going in the Parliamentary Bureau. Systems of allocation are under
discussion and the bureau will meet again tomorrow. We would hope, as early
as possible, to be able to come forward to the Parliament and advance the
question of committees both mandatory and subject.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With regard to the comments relating to
the summer recess, I well understand that there may be some confusion,
given that the earlier motion was lodged not on behalf of any party but
mistakenly, I think, by the office. Today the motion deals only with our
business until mid-June. There has been no decision as yet on the starting
date of the summer recess.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There may be an opportunity to discuss
environmental issues between now and July. Of course, that depends upon
how that discussion is framed, and advice will be taken on that. On behalf
of the Executive, I would stress that there is no desire to stifle debate
within the Parliament.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

second is the putting down of questions for written answer. The practice
in the House of Commons is that written answers can be tabled and will
be replied to in the form of letters to the members concerned. As I understand
it, answers are placed in the House of Commons library over the summer
recess. That does not seem to be the case for this chamber. Is there a
facility whereby we can lodge questions on 1 July or 2 July and they will
be answered immediately, even though the Parliament is in recess?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>I made it clear that
there is no will on behalf of the Executive to stifle debate, and if a
mechanism can be found that is legal and complies with the requirements
of the Scotland Act 1998, we will investigate it and try our best to put
it in place. I stress again that there is no desire to stifle debate, but
the advice that has been given is not helpful at the moment. We will do
our best to correct that advice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

that the legal advice is that it would be illegal for members of the Executive

that practice would be illegal until such time as the Executive gets legal
competence?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McCabe: </strong>The advice is that it
would not be competent for that to be done until such time as the powers
pass to the ministers. As I have already said, the advice is that once
those powers pass, eight days must be allowed for questions to lie on the
table before answers can be given. I have already stressed that no party
on the Parliamentary Bureau is happy with that situation and we are investigating
ways by which it can be corrected.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

we will have another tomorrow, and we are looking as sympathetically as
we can, given the advice that we are constrained by, at those points.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, it may be helpful if I tell the
Parliament that we have already decided that whatever meetings there may

elected the three mandatory committees within 21 days of our coming into
being. That is how we know that there will definitely be a meeting on Tuesday
8 June. There may be other meetings before that, but that will be determined
tomorrow. I hope that that is helpful and clear.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It may also be helpful if I tell members
that since I know that there is a meeting that day, I have decided that
that should be the day when, as Presiding Officer, I invite you all to
a reception in the evening in the Old Parliament Hall. It would be helpful
if members put that in their diaries before they receive the invitations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland)
(SNP): </strong>On a point of order, Mr Presiding Officer. It is my recollection
that there was a discussion that the bureau had accepted that under rule
5.6(c) of the standing orders, members' business might be taken after decision
time. I think that I am right in saying that that was discussed; therefore,
there is a procedure by which motions can be lodged and discussed, because
rule 5.6(c) allows a half-hour discussion every day. In my view, that is
an inadequate step forward, but it is a step forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>You are correct.
Members can lodge questions for members' time, which is the half-hour after
the end of the official business. What I cannot tell you-because we have
not decided it yet-is when the next meetings will be, but there will be
a half-hour debate on, for example, 8 June. That is a helpful point.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have now to put the question on the
motion in the name of Mr Tom McCabe:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That the office of the Clerk should be
open on each of the following days: Monday 24 to Thursday 27 May, Tuesday
1 to Friday 4 June, Monday 7 to Friday 11 June and Monday 14 to Friday
18 June.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
