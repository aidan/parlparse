Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con): </strong>At 1 o'clock this morning it did
not seem such a great honour to ask the first question of our newly empowered
legislature, but I am sure that, although I was selected randomly by computer,
it is indeed an honour.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To ask the Scottish Executive what steps
it intends to take to support and fund education of children from rural
communities at schools located within those communities. (S1O-151)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Minister for Children and
Education (Peter Peacock): </strong>I have to say that I was in bed before midnight.

endorsement of that statement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The &pound;322 million in the excellence
fund for schools for the next three years will benefit all communities
in Scotland, rural and urban. The grant distribution mechanisms for local
authority funding take account of factors that affect council services
in rural areas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_6"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>David Mundell:
</strong>Is the deputy minister aware that Dumfries and Galloway Council faces
a bill of &pound;32 million to repair schools, and that one school in particular,
my former school Lockerbie Academy, was the subject of an arson attack,
which will require the primary school to be rebuilt? Does he agree that
neither of those circumstances should be used as a reason to close rural
primary schools in that area?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>We want a strong
network of rural schools in Scotland; they are part of the diversity of
the Scottish education system. The Government has made available a substantial
additional sum of money-some &pound;27 million-through the new deal for
schools, of which Dumfries and Galloway Council has had an allocation of
about &pound;1.5 million, which should help it to tackle its problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In addition, the Government is making available
through the non-housing capital consent the sum of &pound;377 million,

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Monteith: </strong>The Educational Institute
of Scotland dominates elections to the GTC by its effective running of
slates and also dominates the convenerships of that body. Given those facts,
does the minister intend to make any changes to the way in which the GTC
is formed before passing greater powers to it?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Galbraith: </strong>As I said, the report
will be available shortly. One of the issues addressed by the report is
the make-up of the GTC and the number of representatives of the teaching
profession on it. The Government believes that teachers should have a majority
on the council as part of the process of enhancing their professionalism
and encouraging self-regulation. Some specific proposals will be made shortly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy First Minister and Minister
for Justice (Mr Jim Wallace): </strong>It is intended that part V of the Police
Act 1997 is to be self-financing. However, we recognise the concerns of
the voluntary sector and we are willing to keep the matter under review.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Is the minister aware
of the amount that some Scottish organisations will have to pay if there
is to be a series of charges? The Boys Brigade will have to pay &pound;65,000
a year and I believe that the Guide Association will have to pay &pound;23,000.
Does the minister intend to implement a relief scheme for those organisations?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Wallace: </strong>I take this opportunity
to say how much I recognise and value the role of volunteers in our society.
Mr Davidson's point about the burden that will fall on a number of voluntary
organisations is a matter that we would want to take into account when
considering the review of the charging arrangements.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

supported the concept of an independent pay review body for the higher

with the Association of University Teachers?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><a NAME="MakeMarkAuto_8"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish:
</strong>It is important to remember that the Dearing committee considered the
situation and decided to set up an independent review committee to look
at the framework of higher education pay and conditions. That committee-the
Bett committee-has not recommended the establishment of a standing pay
review body but wants a national council with a Scottish committee. The
Government is discussing the Bett committee report; the Parliament will
also consider it and a debate on the issue is scheduled. It would be wise
to wait for the outcome of those deliberations before making any definitive
statements.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

Our target is to have school sports co-ordinators in all Scotland's secondary
schools by 2003.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

welcome the role played by local authorities, such as East Renfrewshire,
in encouraging young people to participate in sport? Does she appreciate
the importance of sport in developing healthy lifestyles and in making
progress on our social inclusion agenda?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Yes, and I welcome
the work that is being done in East Renfrewshire. Sport has an essential
role to play in promoting social inclusion; social inclusion features in
the Scottish Sports Council's corporate plan, "Sport 21". Earlier this
week, I visited Arbroath High School and Arbroath Academy to see school
sports co-ordinators in action. In Arbroath Academy I was particularly
pleased to see the interesting scheme in which able-bodied children worked
with children with special educational needs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

hospital on a suitable site?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I recognise that there
are strongly held local views on various aspects of the issue. I must stress
again that there are currently no firm proposals for change. As and when
any such proposals are put forward, the health board has a statutory obligation
to consult; I would ensure that full and effective public consultation
on any proposals for change took place. I plan to meet the Greater Glasgow
Health Board and a range of other bodies over the recess. I want to be
assured that any proposals for change and the reasoning behind them will
be well explained to the public. We want to achieve high-quality services
that meet local needs and are fit for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. I hope
that we can achieve that in Glasgow and elsewhere.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>That is a very helpful
answer. Is the minister aware of the special circumstances of rural communities
in Scotland, particularly in areas such as Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley?
Will he consider visiting some of the successful projects in that area
and consulting people who want to set up similar projects?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Cathy Jamieson makes
an important point: it is often more difficult to make provision in rural
areas because of the smaller school rolls. We want broad equality of provision

not, they say, but I am afraid so. However, computers are important and

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McNeil: </strong>I welcome the minister's
statement, but does he agree that short-term unemployment is a growing
problem in places such as Greenock and Inverclyde, where the electronics
industry is a major employer? People have been asked to accept either short-term
employment or long-term educational opportunities. We need to create local
flexibility in the new deal to ensure that it works properly. One solution
could be to count together periods of unemployment, which would allow people
to qualify for the new deal if they had been unemployed for six of the
past 12 months and were identified as needing extra support to compete
more effectively in the labour market. That would ensure that Labour's
new deal worked effectively for them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Although the new
deal is a new scheme, everyone will agree that it has had some considerable
successes. However, as with any new scheme, it has to be kept under constant
review; we will examine Duncan McNeil's suggestion about flexibility. Flexibility
is important in many aspects of the new scheme. A Scottish advisory group
is considering all aspects of the new deal; it has been concerned specifically
with how the new deal can more fully support the most disadvantaged individuals
in Scottish society. Many suggestions have been made to the UK Government,
which has ultimate responsibility for the scheme. I am sure that the Scottish
Executive will listen to suggestions such as those from Duncan McNeil and
other MSPs to create flexibility and to improve the scheme.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Bruce Crawford:
</strong>The minister will be aware that Perth College is successful and has
responded well to the Government's new proposals to enable wider access,
college collaboration and social inclusion. It has also been involved in
the University of the Highlands and Islands project and in setting up new
outreach learning centres. Its business has grown by about 34 per cent.
Does the minister agree that it is difficult for an organisation such as
Perth College to square the mantra of education, education, education with
the stark reality of cuts in its expenditure? Spending was &pound;5.7 million
in 1996-97 and &pound;5.1 million in 1999-2000. [M<font size=-1>EMBERS</font>:
"Ask a question."] It is difficult to keep going and to ask a question
when it does not suit the Government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>I acknowledge that
the points that Bruce Crawford has raised are important, but the facts,
too, are often important. The grant allocation for the college in 1999-2000
is to be increased by &pound;0.4 million, a 7 per cent increase on the
previous year. In the comprehensive spending review settlement over the
next three years, we have provided additional funding to stabilise the
financial set-up in a number of colleges. That will be very important.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On an optimistic note, the further education
sector provides a great contribution to the economy of Scotland and Perth
College makes a great contribution to its local community. Last week, the
college and the Scottish Office met to draw up a financial recovery plan.
Every college must look closely at its financial set-up. I want efficiency
and a return for every pound of public sector money that we spend. Perth
College is capable of rising to that challenge and a programme will be
devised to ensure that it and other colleges in Scotland progress positively.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Bruce Crawford: </strong>Will the minister
supply the chamber with information about the financial position of all
the colleges in Scotland from 1996-97 to now?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>This is a commonsense
issue; there is no need for the slight aggression shown. The National Audit
Office report published a few days ago contains an update on the financial
position and on the question of efficiency and value for money for every
college in Scotland. I am sure that it will make good reading.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

we will seek to implement those that do. As I said, we will bring forward
an action plan to deal with issues such as the ones that she raises. In
