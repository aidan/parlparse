I did feel was a point of order, Mr Presiding Officer, was that it would
have been in order for Mr Monteith to declare his interest. He said that
the National Union of Students was not the appropriate body and that there
should be an additional student on the committee of inquiry. To my certain
knowledge, Mr Monteith spent most of his student life opposing the universities
that he mentioned joining the NUS, an organisation to which he is fundamentally
opposed. It was dishonest of him and he should have declared his interest

</strong>On a point of order, yes. Some of us were hoping that Pauline would
raise a point of order about the fact that you seem to have discouraged-twice,
I think-interventions in our proceedings. Many of us feel that we should
encourage more interventions. I know that there are constraints on time,
but we have a recess in which the Procedures Committee, members and you
might reflect on how we can encourage more interventions in debates, rather
than fewer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer: </strong>I have reflected
on the matter and, if I may remind you, I issued guidance on interventions
in the business bulletin some days ago. I encourage interventions, but
not during the closing seconds of a member's speech. I was trying, with
great respect, to get Mr Monteith to wind up; that was why I did not allow
the intervention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Motion debated,</font></i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That the Parliament agrees that the current
expensive implementation proposals for the Urban Waste Water Treatment
Directive (91/271/EEC), in so far as they apply to the Scottish fish processing
industry in North East Scotland, will effectively close many of the companies
engaged in the industry, which provide thousands of skilled jobs; and also
agrees that implementation of these proposals should be delayed to allow
for proper consideration of the technical review currently being undertaken
to produce cost effective solutions for the industry, enabling the industry
to continue as a major employer in Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">12:35</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland)
(Con): </strong>May I first of all<strong> </strong>recognise the privilege it is to have
the first-</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Presiding Officer (Sir David Steel):</strong>
Excuse me, Mr Davidson. Please resume your seat for a second. In fairness
to the member who has the debate, I ask members who are leaving to please
do so quickly and quietly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>I repeat that I appreciate
the privilege and honour of having the first piece of members' business
in the Parliament since we adopted our full powers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This issue is very dear to me and to the
area I represent, North-East Scotland, and I am pleased that there are
representatives of the fish processing industry in the gallery today. For
them, the past year has been one of great anxiety about the implementation
of the waste water directive. The motion is self-explanatory. Because of
the implementation of a piece of legislation from Europe, and perhaps the
manner of that implementation, the industry will suffer tremendously. We
want the Parliament to recognise the need for delay.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Fish processing is a vital industry. In
the north-east, businesses range in size from 50 to 500 employees; in some
villages and communities it is the basis of the local economy. It is of
equal importance to the catching community; the markets of Aberdeen, Peterhead
and Fraserburgh, for example, provide a ready place for the fish to go,
which encourages catchers to the area. That gives vitality to the ports
as well as to the companies that service the industry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the solutions that are being offered
go ahead, many firms will fold. Some will suffer a twentyfold increase
in their waste water charges; many cannot cope with that. As a result,
a great many jobs are at stake. In Aberdeen, around 5,000 people are employed
in the industry and several thousand other employees are scattered along
the north coast. My argument also applies to the fish&nbsp;</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">processing industry
in other parts of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When, a year ago, I went to see Lord Sewel
on behalf of the industry, he said that the polluter must pay. The industry
does not dispute that; its concern is that it has received no help or assistance
in meeting the directive. The only assistance on offer was a four-hour
consultation-two hours on the premises, two hours to write it up and then
the bad news. When I asked for European aid, I was told that it was not
available, even though it appears to have been available in other countries.
Lord Sewel is no longer the minister responsible, so I hope that the current
ministerial team will take up where he left off.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last Saturday, I had the privilege of attending
the launch of an Aberdeen initiative; it is well written up in the Scottish
Parliament information centre sheet on the industry, as are the facts and
figures, and I commend the paper to members. It also gives the statistics,
so I do not need to repeat them. Aberdeen City Council, in partnership
with the industry and others, has come up with an alternative scheme to
that proposed by the North of Scotland Water Authority. It will produce
benefits for the industry by establishing a separate system.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are talking about an organic product.
It came from the sea and it can go back to the sea, because we are blessed
with high flows of water around the coast-unlike Denmark, where any waste
must be treated in a more expensive way.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Aberdeen scheme would benefit the industry-the
projected net costs would be 50p per cubit metre of effluent in 2003. Under
the NOSWA scheme, the cost-approximately &pound;2.50-will be five times
that amount. That is serious money. I congratulate the partnership, but
it is running out of time. Everybody is telling us that we must deal with
the problem now, but I am asking for a full year. The Aberdeen harbour
scheme-a model scheme-will take exactly one year to get through planning
procedures and be put into action.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should also consider Peterhead and Fraserburgh,
where NOSWA wants to build giant machines to mix human effluent with fish
processing waste, which is then unfit to be put out to sea and has to be
commercially treated. That scheme is vastly expensive. We need to consider
constructive, pragmatic and affordable ways in which to deal with something
that everybody recognises to be a problem. The industry must be able to
survive, employ people and continue to offer a base for the catching sector,
which is very important to the north-east of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

to Eyemouth in my constituency and to the East of Scotland Water Authority.
Does he agree not only that the Government does not seem to have properly
consulted, but that the water authorities seem to have been less than forthcoming
in their consultation? For example, it appears that people in my part of
the world got 10 days' notice of new bills that had risen by an amount
similar to the one that he mentioned.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>That was a nice speech
for the south of Scotland. Earlier, I said that, although this item of
members' business was about the north-east, it applied to other areas of
Scotland. I welcome the intervention, which highlights the problem that
the sector faces.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The water authorities have been heavy-handed
in their approach, but it should be borne in mind that they are under constraints
as to how they are funded and how they raise capital costs. It would be
good for the environment if we set up schemes to take effluent straight
out to sea as a natural product. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency
would control such a scheme, and the process would not be covered by the
urban waste water directive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am concerned that the water authorities
are seeking to mix the fish processing effluent with human waste. The fish
processing effluent is then contaminated, which causes unnecessary additional
expense. I am asking for time for NOSWA and others. A wonderful report
by the environmental consultants Cordah will be published in August. The
minister may insist that everything is dealt with by a certain date-there
has been due warning-but evidence will be in the public domain as a result
of on-going scientific reports.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This chamber must insist that an indigenous
industry that is a major part of our economy-it is a way of life in many

to gold-plate European regulations. We need time, clear and unbiased thought
and professional input. I have given permission for many members to speak;

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">matters-one of
our first debates was also on a fishing matter, which shows the priority
that this Parliament has given to the fishing industry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Davidson has eloquently expressed the
concerns of the fish processing industry. I do not want to repeat what
he has said in detail. I want to put on record the fact that, although
the industry agrees with all the aims and objectives of the urban waste
water directive, it is concerned that implementation will threaten many
jobs in the north-east of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The industry seeks a lasting and cost-effective
solution. I can see no reason why NOSWA would oppose a delay in the implementation
of the directive. There is nothing to prevent the minister from negotiating
with Brussels for such a delay; it is a question of political will and
determination. This is a new Parliament, the minister has a new position
and she can decide to stick up for the industry by flying to Brussels to
discuss with the relevant EU officials this important matter, which affects
the livelihoods of many people in the north-east of Scotland.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The industry is asking for a breathing
space. Even in the past few weeks there have been developments on this
issue. Mr Davidson referred to a number of them. Labour-controlled Aberdeen
City Council decided to proceed with its widely supported plans for the
industry in that city. Today, Aberdeenshire Council is also discussing
proposals to help the industry. The area's political representatives are
doing what they can to support the industry's demands and industry leaders,
some of whom we have with us today, are doing what they can for the employees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It would be a great pity if Sarah Boyack
did not do what she could to help. The key to arriving at an agreeable
solution is in the minister's hands. If the minister does not decide today
to bring a fresh approach from the Government, there could be job losses
throughout the north-east of Scotland. NOSWA's bills could rise even higher.
The north-east already pays the highest water bills in the country, but
if the private finance initiative projects go ahead, the people of the
north-east will pay money that is simply profit for the shareholders of
those companies, such as Yorkshire Water, that are proposing to fund the
projects. The people of the north-east will not accept that. If the minister
takes no action, she will be getting off to a very poor start.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I make four requests of the minister. First,
when she winds up the debate, I ask her not to use the dog-eared brief
that was used by her predecessor in Westminster. We want to see a fresh
approach. Secondly, I ask the minister to show determination and political
willingness to negotiate with the EU representatives in Brussels at the

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It proved quite popular with the electorate.
I submit that this European waste water directive is an example of what
we were talking about. It has been landed on the industry without consultation
and its implementation will be disastrously expensive for the Scottish
fish processing sector, whose 230 units provide 43 per cent of the sea
fish processing employment in the UK. The industry is a vital employer
in a region that has been decimated by the downturn in the oil and agriculture
industries.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The directive will obviously affect the
fishing industry as a whole, because the extra costs will push up the price
of fish products in the shops, which will make them less competitive than
other food products. Many processors will go out of business. Not only
will jobs be lost, but some skills, such as the filleting of small fish,
will disappear. Such skills are specific to the north-east; if they are
lost now, they will be difficult to replace.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My friend, David Davidson, has talked about
white fish in the north-east, but I would like to draw attention to Scottish
salmon and trout producers and processors. The industry provides thousands
of jobs in the Highlands and Islands and 38 processing units in Scotland
deal only with salmon and trout. Recently, the hard-pushed salmon industry
has been hit hard by the outbreaks of infectious salmon anaemia. It is
nearly impossible for farms to obtain insurance against the value of their
stocks because of the policy of destroying all fish stocks in an infected
farm. That is not the case in other fish-producing countries such as Norway,
so the Scottish product is already becoming less competitive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

a European directive that damages an enormously important Scottish industry.

</strong>I, too, welcome the opportunity to focus on an industry that is a major
provider of jobs in my constituency and elsewhere. The fish-catching sector
attracts a good deal of public attention but, in providing jobs onshore,
jobs for women and part-time jobs for lone parents who want to work-as
well as in maintaining a range of skills in a traditional industry that
provides a vital link in the food chain-the fish processing sector demands
equal attention and status.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When we talk to industry leaders, such
as those from Aberdeen who are with us today, we must listen to their concerns
about the implementation of the directive. Although I take Mr Robson's
point, I think that there is particular concern in the north of Scotland,
because of the scale and expense of the proposed plant. The population
factor means that fewer people and firms would pay for the plant that we
need. That is why so many of the firms in the Aberdeen area face difficulties.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is clear that my colleagues in Aberdeen
City Council have been listening to the concerns that have been raised.
I would like to congratulate the council and the Aberdeen Fish Curers and

Aberdeen-and for other schemes, both in Aberdeenshire, which would deal
with Fraserburgh and Peterhead, and elsewhere in Scotland. Will she allow

implementation. In future, the Parliament's committees, such as the European
Committee, the Transport and the Environment Committee and other appropriate
committees, will have a crucial role in considering that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need to think a little about the strata
of the industry. It is not just a question of the fish processors-who can
be seen as the middlemen-as it reaches both up and down the line. The control
and power that supermarkets have today mean that the price of the product
in the shop will not change. Down at the bottom level, it is the primary
producer who may ultimately see the price of his or her product fall. In
that context, it affects salmon farmers, pelagic boats and white-fish boats.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Lewis Macdonald made a good point about
waste water treatment plants. In Shetland we have tried to tackle investment
with the local enterprise company and the council. However, the trouble
is that the scale of the increases that NOSWA is looking to put into place
is much more than can be offset by the improvements that the processing
factories in Shetland are trying to implement.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The briefing that came from the library
was useful. The group treatment process that will be established in Aberdeen,
if successful, is important, but there are advantages of economies of scale
there which are not available in many parts of the Highlands and Islands,
where factories may not be geographically close to one another or where
there may be other disadvantages of scale. It is important that we consider
what will have to be done in parts of the Highlands and Islands to implement
the directive. There may not be the opportunity-if that is the right way
of describing it-that exists in Aberdeen to deal with this particular problem.
As Richard Lochhead said, it is important to ask questions and to ensure
that the minister responds to these needs, and that she uses her office
in an imaginative way to tackle these problems.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As regards NOSWA, will the minister also
bear in mind that water and sewage services should be given back to local
control, in the circumstances where they can be administratively and economically

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Davidson for making
the most of this early opportunity to get the issue on our agenda paper.
We are extremely aware of the serious concerns of fish processors in the
north-east and we are concerned about their difficulties. I acknowledge
the point made by several members about the industry's importance to the
local economy and to the thousands of people who work in the industry.
I understand that the figure is around 6,000, although other estimates
have put it higher.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The charges set by NOSWA for dealing with
waste water containing trade effluent will rise very substantially if we
do not take action and resolve the issue. I want to put on record the two
main factors behind the increase in charges. First, NOSWA is now fully
implementing the Mogden approach to setting waste water charges. Secondly,
as several members have said, the implementation of the European directive
on urban waste water treatment requires NOSWA to provide secondary treatment
for significant discharges by the end of 2000. That means that those who
discharge trade effluent into the urban sewerage system will have to pay
for secondary treatment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is where we have to begin this debate.
I appreciate Elaine Thomson's comments about environmental issues. I suspect
that most people would be alarmed by the amount of raw sewage that we pump
into our rivers and seas with all the resulting problems for bathing waters
and public health.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In NOSWA, 65 per cent of sewage is dispersed
into our waters with minimal treatment. I am sure that we would all agree
in principle that we cannot tolerate that in this day and age. Investing
in necessary treatment will mean higher charges for us, but I believe-and
I hope that the whole Parliament will agree-that this is a price that we
have to pay if we really care about looking after our environment.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On setting charges, NOSWA inherited various
approaches from the previous regional authorities. The idea of moving to
the Mogden formula is that it is the fairest approach. It has been endorsed
by the Confederation of British Industry. Under the Mogden formula, the
level of the charge depends on the volume and strength of the liquid that
is discharged. Essentially, the greater the pollution, the higher the charge.
It is now a standard throughout the water industry and in Scotland people
are already paying charges using this formula. The cost of treating waste
water has to be paid either by those who discharge the effluent or through
cross-subsidy from other customers. The Mogden formula ensures that the
polluter pays and there is no cross-subsidy between customers of the water
authorities. We welcome NOSWA's efforts to move towards a proper and fairer
cost recovery system.</font></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the same time
we have to address the issue of the European urban waste water treatment
directive to ensure that specified levels of treatment are provided to
meet specified deadlines. In many coastal areas, this means introducing
sewage treatment for the first time. In Fraserburgh, Peterhead and Aberdeen,
where most of the fish processors are based, there is a requirement for
secondary treatment by the end of 2000. That backdrop means that we do
not have a long time to debate this issue. Conservative members have suggested
that we delay the implementation of this directive to allow consideration
of a technical review now being undertaken. I do not believe that a delay
would be a sensible option for us to pursue. Failure to implement the directive
in time would mean that the UK ran a serious risk of infraction proceedings
from the European Commission in the European Court of Justice. We are aware
that the European Commission is keen to pursue this issue.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the point made by Richard Lochhead about
trying to receive derogation on this issue, the previous Administration
under Lord Sewel attempted to get derogation for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire
to prevent us from having to address this issue. It was given the clear
understanding by other European states that this would not be acceptable,
so we have attempted to get derogation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

give way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>No, I will not take

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we were taken to infraction by the European
Commission, the money would be taken from the Scottish block. There are
already two examples where countries are being taken to the European Court
of Justice on the issue of dealing with waste water treatment-Italy and
Belgium are both being taken to court-so there is an imperative to implement
the directive on time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am sure that members who have talked
to the food processing industry will know of the lengthy history of this
issue. Some firms have begun to address it and NOSWA has attempted to encourage
the fish industry to prepare in advance. There has been an extensive information
programme, advice packs, consultation documents and there have been hundreds
of meetings. NOSWA is sympathetic to the position of the fish processors
and has for some time been advising industrial dischargers to attempt to
reduce their future charge increases by investing in cleaner technology
or minimising the use of water. I understand that some firms have been
able to do that. NOSWA has also agreed to phase in the increased charges
over a number of years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

best practice. NOSWA has contributed &pound;25,000 to a waste minimisation
programme for fish processors, and it continues to offer them advice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some fish processors have been able to
reduce the charges that they will face, but I accept that for many of the
smaller ones it has been extremely difficult to do so. I appreciate the
anxiety that the increases in the estimated charges has caused to fish
processors, and I am concerned about their potential impact on the fish
processing sector as a whole.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A number of suggestions have been made
on practical ways of taking the debate forward. One suggestion was the
development of a separate plant specifically to treat trade effluent. I
understand from NOSWA that Mr Davidson's point about its having developed
a giant scheme under PFI is inaccurate. The scheme has been developed to
deal with the situation in Aberdeen. Storm water, and not just trade effluent,
is the key&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>No, I will not.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>It is his motion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>If traders do not
need to use the plant, the PFI scheme will operate in such a way that the
charges can be accommodated. That is the risk that the PFI bidder takes
on in accepting this project.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Brian Adam made a point about the PFI
project as well. The scheme is one potential way to proceed and it would
be dealt with by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency under its regulation
and control schemes. However, we urge caution. In the immediate future,
I want to have a detailed discussion with people in the fish processing
industry and with my colleague John Home Robertson to find a possible way
forward.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>Will the minister give
way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Yes, Mr Davidson,
if the point has not been made before.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Davidson: </strong>A lot of what we are
hearing from the minister is common knowledge about the waste water directive
for dealing with the disposal of human waste. I hope that she will discuss
ways of dealing, whether through NOSWA or some other agency, with waste
water from the fish processing industry. Such waste is natural and organic;
whenever possible, we do not want to put it into ordinary sewers. I accept
that sometimes it will not be possible to avoid that, but the Seafish Authority
has produced documentation that gives good advice on the subject. In areas
such as Peterhead harbour where there are many small fish processors, there
could be a scheme linking only the fish processors to an outfall system
in which the waste required the minimum of treatment. I do not see that
as part and parcel of what the minister is discussing. The minister is
discussing the global issues of human waste water; we are here to talk
about the fish processing industry.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and
Fife) (Con): </strong>On a point of order. The minister said that she was responding
to members' comments, but it is quite clear that she is reading from a
prepared text. Does that not lead to conflict when people want to intervene?</font></td>

Officer:</strong> That is not a point of order. Carry on, Ms Boyack; and please
bring your contribution to an end as quickly as you can.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>I hope that it is

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr Davidson's motion asks us to delay dealing
with the urban waste water treatment directive. That option is not available
to us: we have to address the directive. It was enacted in 1991, so there
is a long history to this debate. We have to get our treatment schemes
in place by the end of 2000. I am keen to have discussions with the fish
processing industry. There is going to be a consultation paper on the new
criteria for giving financial aid, which will be put in place from next
year. We can examine and discuss a number of issues. However, delaying
is out of the question. We need to work out effective solutions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Mr McGrigor: </strong>Will the minister give
way?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>No, I am winding up.
The strategic review study will offer us a number of opportunities to examine
this issue. Time is short; but in my ministerial position and with my other
ministerial colleagues, I am keen that we talk to people to discover what
we can do. As everybody has made plain, it is a complex issue with no easy
solution. Had there been an easy solution, I am sure that the Conservative
Government would have solved it when in power. We need to comply with European
directives; we cannot ignore them. We have to work out strategies to help
the industries and communities, which will be difficult.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I suggest to Mr Lochhead that, if we are
trying to bring a fresh view to the debate, we have to consider the long-term
strategic implications of any initiatives. We should not ignore the implications
and pretend that they are not going to happen, but we should address them
in Parliament and in our committees to ensure that we meet our obligations
under the European directives, and that we meet them in a way that is sensible
and will benefit our whole community.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>The Deputy Presiding Officer:</strong> That
concludes today's business. I ask members to stand as the mace is removed
from the chamber.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
