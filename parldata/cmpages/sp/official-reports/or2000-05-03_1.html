                Deputy Presiding Officer (Mr George Reid): </strong>The first item 
                of business is time for reflection, which will be led by Reverend

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Reverend 
                Rachel J W Dobie (Minister of the Parishes of Upper Tweeddale):</strong> 
                Once upon a time, so the story goes, when humankind was very new, 
                the custom arose of putting spectacles on all newborn babies. 
                No one knows why it was done, but the effect was to distort colours 
                so that black appeared white and red appeared green. They also 
                distorted shapes, so that fat appeared thin, near became far, 
                and so on. Most alarming was that slight variations were applied 
                to the lenses according to social and cultural origin, so that 
                groups of people began to see one another as horrible or superior, 
                and so quarrelling began, even in public places. However, the 
                custom of wearing the spectacles became universal, and in time, 
                people hardly realised that they were wearing them at all. Sadly, 
                no control was ever introduced regarding the variations that could 
                be made to the lenses, and so in time, the world was filled with 
                the sound of quarrelling, hatred and even warfare.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But then 
                there was born a baby who would not wear the spectacles. He saw 
                people as they really were, and they appeared to him so alike. 
                They had the same needs, fears and desire to be loved, and although 
                they addressed God by different names, they were in one sense 
                all his children. So what he saw as he grew up shocked and distressed 
                him. He tried to teach people, and many listened, moved by what 
                he had to say:</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Love 
                your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse 
                you and pray for those who ill-treat you. Do not judge others 
                and God will not judge you; do not condemn others and God will 
                not condemn you. Forgive others and God will forgive you.&quot;</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of 
                those who heard him found that what he said made sense, and they 
                tried to follow him and put into practice what he taught, but 
                others were infuriated. It challenged their way of life, and they 
                insisted that they were not all the same, and how could everyone 
                be equally loved and equally valued in the eyes of God? So they 
                hated him. </font></P>

                they were united in one single aim to be rid of him and all he 
                stood for, and they crucified him.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
                evil was overcome, sadly the spectacles that are described in 
                this Indian parable are still worn in some measure by all of us. 
                As we look back over two millennia, we can see how intolerance 
                on the grounds of race and gender has been outlawed and attitudes 
                have changed, but we still tend to view matters from the point 
                of view of our own interests and prejudices. Political and religious 
                leaders have recently acknowledged past wrongs, and endeavoured 
                to set new standards nationally and internationally, but still 
                situations are allowed to develop that permit injustice to gain 
                the upper hand. We still have a long way to travel.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My prayer 
                for those who are in a position to exercise leadership, to formulate 
                legislation, is this. That we may always be ready to stand beside 
                the oppressed and the victims of injustice. That we may have the 
                courage to speak out against what seems to fly in the face of 
                truth. That we may learn to act with foresight, rather than react 
                with hindsight. Much has changed since the calls to crucify, but 
                much still calls out for change.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">May God's 
                blessing rest on your work this week and always. Amen.</font></P>

                that the bill be passed. For the first part, members should have 
                to hand SP bill 4A, as amended at stage 2; the marshalled list,

                I wrote to Sir David Steel on this matter, which relates to amendments 
                that are submitted but rejected as inadmissible. I accept the 
                position under the standing orders, but seek your guidance on 
                the procedures for changing the standing orders so that amendments 
                that are put forward and rejected are published, with the reasons 
                for the rejection, and on whether the Procedures Committee might

                time when members will see me on my feet arguing for the retention 
                of anything to do with the Crown. I emphasise that this debate 
                is really about the question of the public interest. We discovered 
                that it would be difficult to have admitted any amendments directed 
                toward the public interest that did not mention the Crown. Therefore, 
                the amendment has to be argued in those terms.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The amendment 
                attempts to ensure that the public's interest in land is provided 
                for explicitly. That aim is supported by many organisations in 
                Scotland, including Land Reform Scotland and the Scottish Land 
                Reform Convention, which is sponsored by, among others, the Convention 
                of Scottish Local Authorities, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, 
                the voluntary sector and the Churches. For example, during a visit 
                to Westminster, the Church of Scotland church and nation committee 
                wished to discuss land reform and its concerns about the introduction 
                of absolute ownership.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those 
                concerns have not gone away. The Scottish National party favours 
                the inclusion of a provision whereby the public's interest will 
                be explicitly protected. We have argued for a number of years 
                for the reform of Scottish land laws, to give all communities 
                a real say in their future, and we have long wanted an end to 
                feudal tenure. However, we also firmly believe in the sovereignty 
                of the people. The danger is that without such an explicit statement

                view of many is that public interest had indeed been part of the 
                Crown's remit. If we accept, as I think that we must, that the 
                present rights of the Crown are vague, we must accept that it 
                is possible that they include the public interest. This may become 
                more important in future. When the Crown legislates through Parliament

                As a Parliament, we can take action and pass legislation to vindicate 
                or assert the public interest in relation to land. It is well 
                known that the Executive will introduce legislation to provide 
                a right of responsible access to land, and to provide a community 
                right to buy in respect of land. The Executive has measures in 
                place for the protection of our natural heritage. Sites of special 
                scientific interest are designated, and legislation is on its 
                way for the designation of national parks. Our local authorities 
                are also democratically elected institutions that can exercise 
                a protection of the public interest in relation to land. They

                having to plead in some way or another to our misty history and

                be made about the Governments of the states in the United States 
                of America? The argument does not stop them being challenged,

                something else entirely, but we have not done so yet. However, 
                if we remove the protection in respect of land ownership, where

                When she thinks about it, she will recall that land in Orkney

                by the Crown, they have never entered the feudal system, and so 
                would be unaffected by abolition. If they have been sold prior

                They could not be abolished by the bill because they were not

                land, they will survive to the extent that they are maritime burdens, 
                which are covered in section 58. There is some authority that 
                the regalia majora are derived from prerogative&#151;if that is

                informed of the purport of amendment 13, has consented to place 
                her prerogative and interests, so far as they are affected by

                there are any other property rights or interests that are held 
                by virtue of the ultimate superiority of the Crown, beyond those 
                that the bill seeks to abolish at the same time as the rights 
                of feudal superiors. It is the Executive's intention to abolish 
                the Crown's ultimate superiority, along with all other superiorities 
                and vestiges of the feudal system. To do anything else could frustrate 
                the introduction of the system of simple ownership of land that 
                will result from the abolition of feudal tenure.</font></P>

                a burden should be abolished on the appointed day. The policy 
                of the bill is to treat the Crown as it treats other superiors. 
                The Crown&#151;in common with all superiors&#151;will be able

                Roseanna Cunningham's amendment, there might be some doubt whether 
                the Crown would be able to enforce such burdens. As the thrust 
                of the amendment seems to be to preserve any right that is held 
                in the public interest, it seems to be illogical to put at risk 
                the necessary burdens that safeguard piers and harbours in the

                preserve any Crown interests that we want to preserve. There is

                the point is that it will revert back to the Crown, not as feudal 
                superior, but because it owned it in the first place. It is important 
                to have the debate and I am tempted to go down that road, but

                to enforce a feudal burden&#151;are abolished for the ultimate 
                superior. However, it continues</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;nothing 
                in this Act shall be taken to supersede or impair any other property 
                rights or interests held by virtue of the ultimate superiority 
                of the Crown&quot;.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The key 
                word is ultimate. The Crown was once like God over land, with 
                all its rights rolled up into one power. When we abolish feudal 
                superiority, we must ensure that we do not abolish the Crown's 
                ability to intervene on behalf of the public interest. I cannot 
                understand why the Executive finds it difficult to accept the 
                amendments, which reserve to the Parliament a right to represent 
                and enforce the public interest.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Gordon 
                Jackson (Glasgow Govan) (Lab): </strong>The difficulty is that the 
                amendments are legal nonsense, and have no substance whatever. 
                The bill is meant to abolish the feudal system, but in my view, 
                the amendments in the name of Roseanna Cunningham have nothing 
                to do with the feudal system. They are intended to make a political 
                point about the absolute ownership of land. That is a legitimate 
                argument for the Parliament, but the amendments cannot sensibly 
                form part of a bill that is intended to abolish the feudal system. 
                Roseanna Cunningham may say that she does not want to do anything 
                other than abolish the feudal system. In that context, what meaning 
                does reserving the ultimate superiority for the public interest 
                have?</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My recollection 
                of our discussion in committee is the same as Phil Gallie's. Professor 
                Rennie said&#151;in much nicer terms than I will&#151;that what 
                was being proposed was legal gobbledegook. I do not remember Roseanna 
                Cunningham or anyone else arguing with him. He said that the idea 
                of the Crown losing its feudal superiorities, but retaining a 
                right in the public interest, had no meaning.</font></P>

                what Jim Wallace said to Roseanna Cunningham: give us an example 
                of what the proposal means. Christine Grahame said that she could 
                not think of one. None of us can think of one. Roseanna Cunningham 
                told us that there are cases in the United States of America. 
                I have no knowledge of the American legal system, but I cannot 
                think of an argument that could be put up in this country to the 
                effect that, as we cannot stop something bad happening, we will 
                use the Crown's superiority in the public interest.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we 
                are to support the amendment, Roseanna Cunningham must answer 
                Jim Wallace's question and supply an example&#151;even a hypothetical 
                one&#151;in which the proposal would apply. If she cannot do that, 
                it is an amendment with no substance in reality, as the minister 
                said. I do not want that sort of thing to be included in any bill.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Roseanna 
                Cunningham: </strong>I refer Gordon Jackson to my comments about potential 
                challenges under ECHR. Article 1 of ECHR talks about people's 
                right to enjoy their property without interference and ensures 
                compensation if that right is interfered with.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My concern 
                is that we are laying ourselves wide open to challenges. Nowhere 
                else will the basis on which the Parliament makes laws about the 
                restrictions be stated explicitly. A challenge under ECHR would 
                be upheld and&#151;let us face it&#151;the Executive's line on 
                ECHR has been that it cannot predict where the challenges will 
                come from.</font></P>

                but my problem is that I cannot see how a challenge under ECHR 
                would be answered by invoking the Crown's right to act in the 
                public interest. The two things do not match.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cannot 
                for the life of me see the meaning of the amendment. I said that 
                in committee; Professor Rennie also said it, and I see that Phil 
                Gallie, too, is nodding, which is worrying. The amendment seems 
                to have no substance in reality. The Executive amendment tidies 
                up what needs to be tidied up, while the political amendments

                and am therefore not qualified to comment on regalia minora or 
                regalia majora. Nor do I have any interest in defending the feudal 
                superiority of the Crown&#151;quite the reverse, in fact. I am 
                interested in the public interest and in the future public ownership 
                of land. I note what Pauline McNeill said about the Crown's other 
                rights, including the right to claim land if there is no heir 
                to the ownership of that land.</font></P>

                interested in the rights of the Parliament. If the Parliament

                purchase to bring them into public ownership, could the private 
                owner, free of the feudal restrictions of the Crown, appeal under 
                ECHR on the grounds that the Parliament was acting beyond its 
                powers in trying to stop them selling the Black Cuillin for 10 
                million? If so, there may be substance to amendment 37. However, 
                if the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;sorry, Deputy First Minister&#151;can

                resolved in this debate. However, I ask all members to keep hold 
                of the comments that I made earlier. Ultimately, the debate is 
                about where the public interest lies, and my answer to John McAllion's 
                question is that once we have done away with an explicit ability 
                to act in the public interest, the legislation will be open to

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everyone 
                refers to planning legislation and so on, but until now, all the 
                legislation that we have dealt with derives from the power of 
                a Parliament that is, in itself, sovereign. However, as the Parliament 
                is not sovereign, which we recognised, we must state explicitly 
                the basis on which the Parliament acts. We need an explicit statement 
                of that position, whether that is given in the Abolition of Feudal 
                Tenure etc (Scotland) Bill or in any of the other land reform 
                bills that are coming up. I would be happy if the minister were 
                to reassure me that such explicit protection of public interest 
                will be in the land reform bill. However, thus far, I have not 
                heard that&#151;I have heard nothing. We may have heard the arguments

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The continuation 
                of instalments after the vassal has ceased to have any connection 
                with his former house seemed to be an unnecessary complication 
                for all parties. The Executive saw the force of that argument 
                and agreed to produce another suggestion at stage 3, which is 
                what amendment 21 does. It is the substantive amendment in this 
                group, and the remaining Executive amendments are consequential. 
                Amendment 21 provides that, if a former vassal sells his or her 
                property after receiving the documentation from the superior offering 
                them the instalment option, he or she will no longer have the 
                option of paying by instalments. This amendment addresses the 
                point that was made by the Justice and Home Affairs Committee, 
                and I ask the Parliament to accept these Executive amendments.</font></P>

                43, 44, 45 and 46 are essentially technical and relate to the 
                explanatory note that is appended to the form of notice that is 
                set out in schedule 2, which requires compensatory payment in 
                ordinary cases of the extinction of feuduty.</font></P>

                to recommend that members accept amendment 48. That amendment 
                is to the notice that will be sent to former vassals, offering 
                them the option of paying compensation by instalments. Although 
                the bill provides for the payment of those instalments on a six-monthly 
                basis, the amendment would point out to vassals that, if they 
                approached their superior, it might be possible to come to a different 
                arrangement. In particular, some former vassals may prefer not 
                to pay six-monthly, as it might be easier for them to budget on 
                a monthly or even weekly basis. Euan Robson's concern about that 
                issue derives from his long experience in the gas industry, which 
                we are eager to learn from. We are happy to recognise that concern,

                amendments fall precisely into line with Tory Government policy 
                going back to 1974, when a Tory Government started off the process 
                of getting rid of the feudal system and the sums due through feudal 
                payments. We very much welcome the instalment option that has 
                been included in this bill, and we recognise that these amendments 
                consolidate the situation in which the feu is cleared at the point 
                of the sale of a premise. We welcome the minister's statements.

                Cunningham: </strong>We, too, welcome this group of amendments. It 
                is important to emphasise that what they avoid is the possibility 
                that people would sell their houses and then traipse off to other 
                parts of the country while still paying instalments that were 
                due under the previous arrangement. Without the amendments, a 
                situation could arise in which folk all over the country might 
                have long-running trails of due instalments behind them. That 
                would be a bizarre situation to get ourselves into if what provoked 
                that was the sale of a house that released the money to pay off 
                the total. Despite Phil Gallie's comment about the amendment's 
                complicated language, it is really a tidy-up provision for the 
                whole system, and I commend the minister for introducing it.</font></P>

                expense if the decree is reduced. Will someone in such a situation

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
                Jim Wallace: </strong>Although I respect the amendments in the spirit 
                in which they have been moved, I ask the Parliament to reject 
                them. Amendment 3 would perpetuate court decrees in relation to 
                feudal burdens beyond the appointed day of abolition, even though 
                the burden itself had been abolished on that day. I should tell 
                both Phil Gallie and Christine Grahame that decrees involving 
                money will not be affected by section 16. Furthermore, the section 
                will not prevent a superior who established his claim for damages 
                on a debt recovering money from the former vassal.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under 
                the general law, an obligation, once extinguished, is extinguished 
                for all purposes, which means that, when feudal burdens are abolished 
                under the bill on the appointed day of abolition, it should therefore 
                no longer be possible to sue in respect of past breaches. By the 
                same token, even if a decree has been issued by the court before 
                the appointed day on a burden that is extinguished on the appointed 
                day, the feudal burden no longer exists and its effect should 
                cease on that day. Mr Gallie asks whether the section sets a precedent; 
                however, the matter is specifically related to our unusual, but 
                very important, policy decision to abolish the feudal system from 
                an appointed day. If the burden is extinguished on that day, its 
                effect should cease on that day.</font></P>

                Wallace: </strong>ECHR is given serious consideration at every point, 
                given our responsibilities as a Parliament and as an Executive 
                of ensuring ECHR compliance. I am sure that if I keep talking 
                long enough in response to the amendment, I might well be able

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would 
                be intolerable if a superior were able to continue to enforce 
                a burden after abolition by means of a court decree, even though 
                that burden had already been extinguished. A decree for interdict 
                preventing a vassal from breaching a feudal burden is meaningless 
                if it relates to a legal obligation that no longer exists. For 
                example, if prior to feudal abolition a superior could prevent 
                his vassal from building on his land and before the appointed 
                day obtains a court order to prevent him from building, there 
                does not appear to be a good reason why the court order should 
                not fall on the appointed day if the former superior cannot save 
                the burden.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As those 
                who have studied the bill know, it includes provisions on the 
                procedures for saving burdens. It would be contrary to the policy 
                of the bill if every superior in Scotland could go to court the 
                day before the appointed day to try to get court orders to save 
                burdens by the back door. There are procedures for saving burdens.</font></P>

                concerned that, somewhere along the line, someone might have abused 
                a feudal requirement and their superior may have taken them to 
                court and got a judgment&#151;perhaps, as Christine Grahame suggested, 
                with considerable outlay and an onward financial commitment. That

                would continue to be enforceable even beyond the appointed day. 
                It would run totally counter to the idea of abolishing the feudal 
                system if an interdict that prohibited a vassal from carrying 
                out a particular operation on his or her land continued when there 
                was no subsisting legal obligation.</font></P>

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
                Wallace: </strong>As Christine Grahame well knows, a decree for expenses 
                is a decree for the payment of money and that is preserved. We 
                are discussing decrees of interdict or decrees ad factum praestandum. 
                Our intention is that those should no longer subsist after the 
                appointed day. However, decrees for the award of expenses, being 
                payments of money, should continue to subsist.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I have 
                said, to allow a superior to continue to benefit from a burden 
                that has ceased to be enforceable would be against the spirit 
                and the policy intention that underlies the bill and to which 
                all parties subscribe. I therefore ask the member to withdraw 
                the amendment. Failing that, I ask Parliament to reject it.</font></P>

                30, as they seek to achieve the same aim in two slightly different 
                ways.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The purpose 
                of my amendments, which have already been the subject of some 
                discussion in committee, is to differentiate between urban and 
                rural land. At committee, the Deputy Minister for Justice accepted 
                that the 100 m rule was arbitrary and that, being so, its application 
                to rural land might not be satisfactory. I would argue that some 
                differentiation is required to satisfy the differences between 
                rural, particularly agricultural, land and urban land.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maintaining 
                some burdens within 100 m of a designated tenement might work 
                in urban areas, although the figure of 100 m is arbitrary for 
                urban conditions as well, but 100 m is no great distance on agricultural 
                farm land or estates. Amendments 25 and 28 seek to achieve differentiation 
                by describing tenements as being within</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;a

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and by 
                allowing for the recording of a different distance. That may be 
                a difficult manner in which to differentiate in legal terms, but 
                it is important that we make some attempt to do so at this stage.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amendment 
                30 is a similar argument dressed up in a different manner. I am 
                grateful to Maureen Macmillan for raising this issue. She will 
                recognise that my amendment contains two of the three paragraphs 
                that she previously proposed at stage 2. The effect of amendment 
                30 would be to preserve burdens affecting areas of agricultural 
                land&#151;or what was once agricultural land&#151;for the benefit 
                of adjoining areas of agricultural land.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within 
                agricultural uses and rural land uses, burdens could take on an 
                entirely different meaning. On urban land, one might find amenities, 
                such as back gardens or buildings of a certain design that have 
                conservation value, being preserved for the benefit of communities. 
                In rural settings, the burdens that we may wish to preserve might 
                affect people's livelihoods and how they go about their business, 
                protecting livestock and ensuring forestry or other rights.</font></P>

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Maureen 
                Macmillan (Highlands and Islands) (Lab): </strong>As Brian Monteith 
                said, I have had concerns about how the bill will affect agricultural 
                communities. It removes a protection from livestock farmers who, 
                in the past, when they granted a feu for a house on the edge of 
                their farm, would perhaps add a feudal burden to forbid the keeping 
                of dogs so that they would not have the worry of livestock being 
                harassed or killed.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the 
                minister admitted, this act attempts to protect buildings, but 
                the land itself may sometimes need to be protected. If the land 
                cannot be protected, farmers may be reluctant to release land 
                in rural areas for badly needed rural housing. However, the minister 
                has written to me about this matter, and I accept that it would 
                be difficult to make special provisions at this point for agricultural 
                burdens, as it would open the door to demands from all sorts of 
                special interests.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I accept 
                that to have differing distances between former superior and former 
                vassals applying in urban and in rural areas could lead to the 
                system collapsing in a confusion of definitions about what is 
                an urban area and what is a rural one. I understand, too, that 
                the Executive is committed to re-examining the matter in the context 
                of the Scottish Law Commission's work on real burdens and the

                Gallie: </strong>I congratulate Brian Monteith on introducing a definition 
                of the difference between the urban scene and the rural one. Such 
                a definition has been lacking in this debate. However, I am disappointed 
                in Fergus Ewing's comments with respect to the kilometre in a 
                rural setting. I would have thought that he, more than most, coming 
                from a north-east rural constituency, would have recognised the 
                differences between rural communities and cities, towns or even 
                villages, where domestic residences tend to be clumped up against 
                one another. In the rural scene, distances between buildings can 
                be quite substantial. It surprises me that Fergus has gone down

                but it would seem to be an amendment that we should support, given 
                that it introduces the agricultural aspect&#151;an important issue. 
                We urge support for Brian Monteith's amendments. Once again, we 
                urge the minister to take benefit from a definition that Brian

                support Brian Monteith's amendments, partly on the basis of the 
                former superior's rights in retention. However, I have sympathy 
                with the arguments put forward at committee about agricultural 
                land. I should take this opportunity to say that I will not move 
                amendment 29. There is a specific reason for that: on rereading 
                the section, I can see that, by the definition of land in that 
                section, it would be referring to the land that is the dominant 
                tenement. That would be increasing the former superior's rights.

                We all tried&#151;including, to be fair, the Executive&#151;to 
                think of a way round this. Fergus Ewing's solution is the one

                Jim Wallace: </strong>This is an interesting group of amendments. They 
                are all concerned with the general subject of neighbourhood burdens; 
                indeed, they were matters that were considered by the committee. 
                I hope that members will bear with me as I go through them carefully, 
                because they raise important issues.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I remind 
                members that the conditions for a neighbour burden, which are 
                set out in the bill, are threefold. First, the dominant tenement, 
                the land that was owned by the superior, must have a permanent 
                building on it. Secondly, that building must be within 100 m of 
                the servient tenement. Thirdly, the building in question must 
                be in use for human habitation or for human resort.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The idea 
                behind neighbour burdens is that amenity, and in particular the 
                amenity of a house or other place of human resort, should be protected. 
                It would have been possible to have called neighbour burdens amenity 
                burdens, but there has been no attempt to define amenity. The 
                thinking behind it is that distance and amenity are interrelated. 
                The distance specified, of 100 m, will generally be sufficient 
                of itself to cover amenity interests.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amendment 
                31 seeks to insert a test of amenity. It is not enough that the 
                building to be protected is 100 m away from the servient tenement&#151;or 
                contiguous with its boundary, as Fergus Ewing would have it; it 
                is also necessary that the burden exists specifically to protect 
                the amenity of the building, but the amendment is silent on what 
                amenity means. What is the test, and who is to carry it out? I 
                simply do not believe that it would be practical to apply this 
                amendment.</font></P>

                25 to 28 strike at the second criterion for a neighbourhood burden, 
                which is the 100 m rule. Amendment 26 would remove the 100 m rule 
                and substitute a requirement that two areas of land&#151;the dominant 
                and servient tenements&#151;must be contiguous. I can see the 
                attraction in that. As the bill stands, there is a bluntness about 
                the 100 m rule and, as my colleague Angus MacKay accepted in committee, 
                there is a degree of arbitrariness about it.</font></P>

                a common boundary, but the difficulty with amendment 26 is that 
                it would be far more arbitrary than the current section 17. The 
                amendment might severely limit the number of burdens that could 
                be saved. For example, if the superior's land were separated from 
                the servient tenement by a road, he would not be able to keep

                own land, others are not. If the amendment were accepted, a superior 
                living in a house with a large garden might be able to save all 
                their burdens on the land that bounds it. If the garden were on 
                an estate, the land in question could be huge. That would be a 
                lairds charter. I cannot think that that is what Fergus Ewing

                are also concerned with distance and are aimed at drawing out 
                the distinction between the operation of the bill in an urban 
                setting and in a rural context. They seek to increase the limit 
                on neighbour burdens from 100 m to 500 m in urban areas, and from 
                100 m to 1 km in rural areas.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In relation 
                to distance criteria, I have said before that any limit&#151;wherever 
                the line is drawn&#151;is in some respects arbitrary. We gave 
                this matter considerable thought and took the view that 100 m 
                was the best figure in the circumstances. I take the view that 
                the figures proposed in the amendments are too high. Stating on 
                the face of the bill that the limit in urban areas should be 500 
                m would give the wrong impression. A burden could relate to properties 
                that are several streets away and a superior might have no interest 
                in enforcing it. Similar arguments could apply to a distance of 
                1 km in rural areas, where the burdened land could be a considerable 
                distance away. The amendments are not credible.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A distinction 
                between town and country is a concept with which I have some sympathy. 
                We all instinctively agree that because distances between dwelling 
                houses are much greater in the country than in the town, a householder 
                in the country could have more interest in a burden that affects 
                land that is a greater distance from his home. My difficulty, 
                as Scott Barrie echoed, is that the amendments do not attempt 
                to define terms. </font></P>

                Maureen Macmillan raised this matter at stage 2 when she moved 
                an amendment. Indeed she explained then, as she has done to Parliament 
                today, that it would be possible for a farmer to feu off a piece 
                of land and put it on a burden that would be aimed at protecting 
                his business. We are dealing with the abolition of feudal burdens. 
                It would still be possible when selling off land in an ordinary

                position and therefore vulnerable to&#151;admittedly only a few&#151;rapacious 
                superiors who demand 500,000 because that would be the cost of 
                going to the Lands Tribunal for Scotland. Is the Minister suggesting 
                that that problem will be revisited in further legislation?</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
                Wallace: </strong>That is the case. The kind of circumstance that many 
                people have criticised is when a superior emerges from nowhere 
                and people have not previously heard of them. By having the 100 
                m rule, the chances are strong that the owner of the servient 
                tenement will know the owner of the dominant tenement. The fact 
                that it is a neighbour burden suggests that a very clear and immediate 
                interest is being protected. Outwith the 100 m it would be possible 
                to apply to the Lands Tribunal, but I accept that doing so could 
                be troublesome. We accept those points.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also relevant 
                are a number of points that have been raised in different circumstances 
                by commercial developers. They have suggested that special circumstances 
                should apply to new commercial developments. They first put their 
                arguments to the Law Commission in the context of its discussion 
                paper on real burdens and have argued that in future they should 
                be allowed to place burdens or title conditions on land that they 
                are developing and, as a corollary, that they should be able to 
                preserve existing feudal burdens of a similar kind. What we call 
                agricultural burdens in the countryside might be thought of as 
                commercial burdens in urban areas.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because 
                the Law Commission saw that those arguments were substantial and 
                needed to be properly assessed, we decided not to commence part 
                4 until we can consider its recommendations on title conditions. 
                I emphasis that part 4 will not be commenced until Parliament 
                has had a proper opportunity to consider the recommendations in 
                the title conditions bill. This is important. The conditions by 
                which land is held is significant; we want to think them through 
                carefully and with due attention. The forthcoming consultation 
                on title conditions will allow us to do that. Many points have 
                arisen as a result of the Law Commission's consultation. The Executive 
                will want to consult further once we have its report.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
                Monteith: </strong>The minister says that the titles bill that will 
                be introduced will take into consideration the possibility of 
                agricultural as well as commercial burdens. Will it also address 
                the possible difficulty of differentiating between urban and rural 
                areas?</font></P>

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amendment 
                32 seeks to clarify that, under section 19, it would not be possible 
                for a superior who applies to the Lands Tribunal for Scotland 
                to argue that there has been a substantial loss or disadvantage, 
                or that that loss or disadvantage has been constituted by the 
                loss of the capacity to receive a payment under the existing system. 
                Payment is frequently made as a matter of custom by feuars, who 
                are often advised by lawyers that it would cost a great deal of

                hassle and doubt and removes the problem of homeowners having 
                to take on often wealthy superiors at the Lands Tribunal.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I can 
                give one example that might make the position clear, although 
                this is a technical debate. There are often conditions of title 
                that prevent a homeowner from selling off a third or half an acre, 
                perhaps to allow another house to be built. Farmers or even suburban 
                homeowners may want to sell off part of their plot. They are often 
                advised by their solicitor that there is a condition that prevents 
                them from doing so without permission of the feudal superior. 
                Not infrequently, the superior asks for payment of a substantial 
                amount of money for that purpose. That is the sort of situation 
                that I think we all wish to discourage.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>David 
                McLetchie (Lothians) (Con): </strong>Does Fergus Ewing acknowledge 
                that some of these rapacious superiors are councils, including 
                councils run by the SNP and the Labour party? As councils are 
                under no obligation to extract payments for permissions for developments 
                that they have already approved as a planning authority, they 
                are extorting money from their citizens. Will he condemn that 
                practice and ask councils to desist voluntarily before this bill 
                becomes law?</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Fergus 
                Ewing: </strong>I am not sure that David McLetchie could find such 
                examples relating to the one that I am talking about. I am bound 
                to reflect, as I did earlier when Mr Gallie said that the Tories 
                started the process of abolishing the feudal system in 1974, that, 
                thereafter, the Tories seemed to be rather slow starters. In the 
                ensuing years, nothing whatever happened. If Mr McLetchie is now 
                arguing that the Tories accept that amendment 32 should be supported, 
                I would of course welcome that support and that change of heart.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With this 
                amendment, I am suggesting that the artificial rights of property 
                that superiors have enjoyed should come to an end. It should be 
                explicit in the bill that the custom that has developed of superiors' 
                being able to extract payments&#151;often substantial payments&#151;should 
                not be used before the Lands Tribunal as an argument that the

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have 
                listened to Fergus Ewing. We are also well aware of the many abuses 
                in the private sector, such as when a solicitor's letter arrives 
                at a group of houses that are under one feudal title holder. The 
                letter suggests that, for payments of 200 or 300, all previous 
                moves away from feu conditions can be excluded from any consideration 
                by the superior. We recognise that Fergus's amendment would cover 
                such cases and ensure that no further abuses occur.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fergus 
                Ewing said that Tories were slow starters in bringing about the 
                end of the feudal system. It is with pride that we note that&#151;without 
                any pain or major aggravation&#151;almost 80 per cent of feudal 
                burdens in Scotland have now disappeared. Some success has come 
                of the moves made in 1974. We also remember that, in 1991, the 
                Law Commission was tasked by the Conservative Government to bring 
                about the ends that are aimed for in this bill. We will talk about 
                that later, no doubt. For the moment, Mr Ewing has our sympathy

                Jim Wallace: </strong>Fergus Ewing will, I think, be pleased to know 
                that I agree with the sentiments behind his amendment; indeed, 
                there is widespread agreement on the amendment. The section that 
                he seeks to amend deals with cases heard by the Lands Tribunal 
                in which the superior seeks to save a burden that, under the bill, 
                would otherwise be lost. The tribunal would be able to find in 
                the superior's favour only if it were satisfied that the superior 
                would suffer substantial loss of disadvantage as owner&#151;not 
                as superior&#151;of the land if the burden were to disappear.</font></P>

                test with which Mr Ewing is familiar&#151;he will know that it

                The loss or disadvantage that is envisaged by section 19 is loss 
                to the superior or former superior as owner of the land, and not 
                merely the loss of any personal income that has been derived from

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe 
                that the amendment is unnecessary, as the bill already provides 
                for what Mr Ewing is seeking and what we support. A strict interpretation 
                of the amendment could lead to difficulties that were not intended. 
                It could have the unfortunate effect that if the superior admitted 
                that, prior to the feudal abolition, he would have been able to 
                charge for the waiver of the burden, he might then be barred from 
                saving the burden under section 19, because the amendment suggests 
                that he cannot, in those circumstances, meet the test of substantial 
                loss or disadvantage that the section requires.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am sure 
                that that is not quite what Fergus Ewing intended. The legitimate 
                and reasonable concern that he raised is met by the scheme. An 
                arrangement has been made for taking such matters to the Lands 
                Tribunal for Scotland, so I hope that he will seek agreement to 
                withdraw the amendment.</font></P>

                care, but I am not sure that he provided a full explanation of 
                the possible interpretation of my amendment. I am not persuaded 
                that the bill meets my concern and I suggest to the minister that 
                former vassals will continue to be in a weak position. They will 
                also continue to have to ask their former superior&#151;as future 
                owner of the dominant tenement&#151;to waive conditions and they 
                will have to deal with tests of substantial loss or disadvantage. 
                I ask Parliament to make it clear that, when that test is being 
                applied to superiors, they should not be able to argue that they 
                were formerly in receipt of 500 or 1,000 but now have lost that 
                advantage. We are trying to remove such advantage. That is what

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
                Jim Wallace: </strong>Following further consideration of the views 
                expressed by the Justice and Home Affairs Committee at stage 2, 
                the Executive has accepted that a reserved claim to compensation 
                is a form of property like any other, so it should be able to 
                be bought and sold freely. Amendment 6 gives effect to that change.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other 
                amendments in this grouping are consequential on that change. 
                Amendment 7 makes it clear that it will not only be the person 
                who registered the notice who can claim compensation, but anyone 
                who subsequently obtains a right to all or part of that claim.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amendments 
                8 and 9 are consequential on amendment 10, which provides that 
                an assignee will not be able to recover any more compensation 
                than the person who assigned the reserved right to him could. 
                Section 36(3) provides that any entitlement of the claimant to 
                recover the development value should be taken into account when 
                working out the amount of compensation that can be claimed. It 
                is designed to avoid double counting; amendment 10 should ensure 
                that that principle will not be avoided by the simple act of an 
                assignation of the right to claim compensation.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amendment 
                11 sets out the manner in which a reserved right to claim compensation 
                can be assigned to the person entitled to it. In terms of the 
                amendment, an assignation is effected by execution and registration 
                of the assignation. The assignation will be effective on registration, 
                because that amounts to intimation of the assignation. An appropriate 
                form of assignation is provided for in schedule 9. The amendment 
                also makes it clear that it should be possible to assign only 
                part of the right to claim. An assignation of a part of a claim 
                must be expressed as a proportion, or a percentage, of each individual 
                claim that must be made under section 34.</font></P>

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Phil 
                Gallie: </strong>In committee, we managed to raise the limit on the 
                maximum length of leases from 125 years to 175 years. The arguments 
                for doing that were well rehearsed at that time. Concerns remain 
                about the maximum length of leases. People may be considering 
                investing a considerable amount of money in an area of land, perhaps 
                with major industry. We must take on board current environmental 
                law about clean-up both before and after such investment. We are 
                looking to maximise job opportunities and the use of land. I note 
                that the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has expressed 
                anxiety about the effect that the time limit on leases could have 
                on the use of brown-field sites. It does not seem too much to 
                suggest that a further 50 years could make the difference when 
                we are dealing with substantial levels of investment. I ask the 
                minister to think again on this issue.</font></P>

                Monteith: </strong>I support the amendment in the name of Phil Gallie. 
                I thought that it would be opportune to ask the minister whether 
                during consultation on the proposed title conditions bill, which 
                would review agricultural and commercial burdens, it might be 
                possible to consider the time limit that is proposed in this amendment. 
                The minister may want to stick with 175 years, but the title conditions 
                bill may give us an opportunity to reconsider that. I would welcome 
                hearing his views on that.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
                Jim Wallace: </strong>As Mr Gallie acknowledged, Angus MacKay dealt 
                with a number of these issues at stage 2, when he responded to 
                amendments on the proposed length of non-residential leases. The 
                Scottish Law Commission believes that when the feudal system is 
                abolished there may be pressure on owners to lease. It has argued&#151;and 
                we accept the argument&#151;that it will be necessary to place 
                a limit on the length of leases, so that perpetual leasehold tenure 
                does not become the norm in Scotland, as it has done in England.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The issue 
                of long leases is relevant mainly to the commercial property sector,

                on the length of commercial leases. The Scottish Law Commission 
                recommended that the length of non-residential leases should be 
                restricted to 125 years, believing that the limit should be set 
                at the lowest level that is not commercially damaging. The Justice 
                and Home Affairs Committee and the Executive received strong representations 
                from commercial interests, which argued that 125 years was too 
                short a period. A number of arguments were advanced. The main 
                one was that 125 years would not reflect the likely lifespan of 
                a commercial development and the number of times that it might 
                be redeveloped during the period of a commercial lease. A consensus 
                arose that a restriction in the region of 175 to 200 years would 
                be acceptable.</font></P>

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I said, 
                at stage 2 the Executive lodged an amendment to increase the limit 
                from 125 years to 175 years. Mr Gallie's amendment seeks to raise 
                the limit by another 50 years. At stage 2, Mr Monteith attempted 
                to amend the bill by increasing the limit to 999 years, which 
                would be wholly unacceptable and would mean, in effect, that there 
                was no limit on the length of leases&#151;I suspect that that 
                is what he really wants. We do not want to replace the feudal 
                system with a system of leasehold tenure that would develop the 
                same kinds of defects over the years.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Phil 
                Gallie: </strong>The Justice and Home Affairs Committee accepted the 
                arguments that the Law Commission and the minister put forward 
                with respect to the undesirability of transferring the onus on 
                to long leases. The minister must accept the assurance that that 
                is not the objective behind the amendment. The amendment is based 
                on our belief that it is important not to lose out on investment 
                and business opportunity. That is the reason why we seek to raise 
                the limit by 50 years.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 
                Wallace: </strong>To be fair, I was talking about an amendment that 
                Mr Monteith lodged in committee. Mr Gallie is right to stress 
                the importance of ensuring that legitimate commercial development 
                is not stifled. In all these matters, judgments must be made. 
                Having listened to representations from many sources, particularly 
                in the commercial sector, we judge that 175 years strikes the 
                right balance between ensuring the opportunity for commercial 
                development and not allowing the feudal system to recreate itself 
                or come in by the back door.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The objective 
                behind Mr Gallie's case is shared by members throughout the Parliament 
                but the question is one of balance. The Executive feels that the 
                limit of 175 years is acceptable and would not place the commercial 
                market at a competitive disadvantage. Mr Monteith asks whether 
                we might return to this issue later, but I do not want to give

                about the Blairgowrie leases? I have raised the matter with him

                Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice (Mr Jim Wallace): 
                </strong>As I indicated during the stage 1 debate last December, I 
                believe that the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Bill 
                is an historic piece of legislation, as it abolishes 800 years 
                of feudal tenure in Scotland. The bill will ensure that the vast 
                majority of householders in Scotland will enjoy simple, outright 
                ownership of their property, without being subjected to the whims 
                of a possibly remote superior, perhaps of whom they have never 
                heard and whose only real interest in imposing conditions on property 
                is financial. Feudal superiorities will disappear, along with 
                all other outdated facets of the feudal system.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This reform 
                of property law is long overdue, but it is the first step in a 
                series of reforms that will modernise and greatly simplify Scottish 
                land law. To address a point made by Pauline McNeill during our 
                debate today on the first group of amendments, I agree that it 
                is important to continue to debate these issues and to make a 
                contribution to much-needed reform of Scotland's land law.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Abolition 
                of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Bill will be followed by a bill 
                on title conditions, which, I hope, will rationalise and modernise 
                the law relating to non-feudal burdens and conditions on property. 
                We also intend to reform the law of the tenement. The Scottish 
                Law Commission is about to embark on work to consider aspects 
                of residential leasehold tenure in Scotland and we hope that, 
                in time, it will be possible to convert properties held under 
                those types of tenure to the simple ownership envisaged in the 
                Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Bill. It is also important 
                that I acknowledge the bill on leasehold casualties that Adam 
                Ingram is to introduce. That bill enjoys the support of the Executive 
                and, I am sure, wider support throughout the Parliament.</font></P>

                in our debate today, to protect areas of law where the Crown has 
                a role to play in protecting the public interest in, for example, 
                navigation, moorings, the foreshore and the sea bed. I believe 
                that the suggestion that anything else is being lost is based

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This reform 
                has been a long time coming. The first proposals were published 
                in the 1960s, although I am sure that demands for the abolition 
                of feudal tenure date from much earlier than that. I remember 
                my parents telling me once that they were about to pay their feuduty, 
                but I did not have a clue what that meant. When they explained, 
                I simply could not understand why, when they thought that they 
                owned their house, it was possible for someone to come along and 
                to demand money from them.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is 
                unfortunate that the first reforms of the feudal system, which 
                were included in the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) 
                Act 1970 and the Land Tenure Reform (Scotland) Act 1974, were 
                not followed up as the Governments of the day had intended, and 
                that no progress was made for nearly 20 years.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are 
                particularly indebted to the Scottish Law Commission, which has 
                tackled an enormous task with great thoroughness, ingenuity and 
                dedication. I also wish to pay tribute to the Justice and Home 
                Affairs Committee, which has worked hard in examining the detail 
                of what Parliament recognises is a complex and technical piece 
                of law reform. I am pleased that a number of the amendments lodged 
                by members of that committee at stage 2 have been given effect 
                by the Executive at stage 3, and I hope that members of the committee 
                believe that the bill has been improved as a result.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many other 
                individuals and bodies have added their comments as part of the 
                consultation exercise, and we are grateful for the contribution 
                that they have made. I thank officials in the justice department 
                for their very detailed examination and consideration of the bill, 
                and for the assistance that they have given while the bill has

                Cunningham (Perth) (SNP): </strong>Now that it is clear to everyone 
                what an exciting time the Justice and Home Affairs Committee has, 
                there will no doubt be a queue of members wanting to join the 
                committee for the delights that are in store for us&#151;which 
                have been ably outlined by the minister.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the 
                committee convener, I record my appreciation of the work of the 
                members of the committee. Only a handful have a legal background, 
                but those of us who have a legal background were not much better 
                off when we came to deal with some of the issues that arose during 
                our scrutiny of the bill. Needless to say, my thanks are also 
                due to the clerks, who shared the burden with us. The clerks had 
                to undertake a great deal of work behind the scenes to get the 
                committee through stage 2, and were up against constant deadlines 
                for the lodging of amendments. Those same clerks had to be involved 
                in all the background work to prepare the amendments for stage 
                3, and our appreciation of that is unqualified. I am sure that 
                all members will join me in thanking the clerks.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The committee 
                expressed concern about the interaction between this bill and 
                other bills that are planned by the Executive, and about the difficulties 
                that that poses for us. This is not a stand-alone bill, although 
                we were obliged to treat it as if it was, which continued to give 
                us some difficulty throughout stage 2. For that reason, when it 
                is enacted, the bill will not immediately come into force. No 
                attempt was made to amend section 1, which is designed to leave 
                open the commencement date. I mention that fact, as it shows that 
                there is nothing novel about such a provision.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I now 
                refer to the principles of the bill. The abolition of feudal tenure 
                will be of great satisfaction to people in Scotland and to the 
                Scottish National party. It was a key commitment of the SNP's 
                land reform policy in the run-up to the elections last May, and 
                it is testament to the widely expressed need for such a reform 
                that the major parties were committed to a similar bill in the 
                run-up to May. From Phil Gallie's earlier comments, I take it 
                that we can now include the Conservatives in that commitment, 
                as they have decided to join the majority in favour of abolition.</font></P>

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bill 
                is integral to any programme of land reform and would always have 
                been required as the first piece of legislation in any package 
                of reform, no matter how it was designed. However, I must reiterate 
                the concerns that I raised this afternoon about the omission of 
                any reference to the public interest in the bill. Effectively, 
                the bill introduces a form of absolute ownership with which a 
                great many people might have problems, and it runs counter to 
                a widely held belief that the people of Scotland should have ultimate 
                ownership of the land. According to that principle, we would be 
                able to run public interest arguments as and when they were necessary.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
                the stage 1 debate, I referred to Andy Wightman's concern that, 
                without some overt recognition of the public interest, we might 
                find ourselves bound more tightly in matters of what we can and 
                cannot do, despite there being a demonstrable social or environmental 
                need. Those concerns continue to be widely held, and I am unsure 
                whether what is being passed today resolves that issue. Time will 
                tell, no doubt, and the minister should not be surprised if we 
                return to that issue in discussion of future land reform legislation.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I remain 
                firmly of the belief that Scotland should not become a series 
                of parcels of land that are in the absolute ownership of individuals, 
                organisations, offshore trusts, charities or whatever. The public 
                interest should be enshrined explicitly somewhere as a principle, 
                so that, in future, recourse can be had to that principle in the 
                courts if necessary.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
                that might sound like an academic argument, recent events have 
                shown that there is nothing academic about land ownership in Scotland. 
                There is a continuing row about the putative ownership of the 
                Cuillin by the MacLeod, and it is a great pity that no one anywhere 
                seems to want to do anything about that. I cannot help but wonder 
                whether that is because it might open a can of worms. Perhaps 
                some of the so-called landowners would turn out to be nothing 
                of the sort&#151;it is surely time that we found out.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I regret 
                that we have not been able to include any requirement in the bill 
                about registering land information. Attempts to do so have been 
                ruled inadmissible, which is unfortunate. We are missing a vital 
                opportunity to begin the process of finding out exactly who owns 
                land in Scotland. It is difficult to see how any system of meaningful 
                land reform can exclude the fundamental point that the first thing 
                we must be able to ascertain is who owns Scotland. That can remain 
                a live issue, as the debate over the ownership of the Cuillin 
                has shown.</font></P>

                of property by individuals and their families states an all-important 
                principle, and the bill is well worthy of support on that basis 
                alone.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roseanna 
                Cunningham and Jim Wallace have thanked various people. I want 
                to add Angus MacKay's name to that list of thanks; he took the 
                bill through the committee stage in a very courteous manner. I 
                also want to thank Lyndsay McIntosh and Brian Monteith, who spent 
                some time on the Justice and Home Affairs Committee while I was 
                in Ayr for some reason or other. I should say that we got a better 
                result in Ayr than we did with some of our amendments to the bill.</font></P>

                the pubs of Ayrshire and the football grounds of Scotland, I have 
                found that the issue of land reform has constantly been brought 
                to my attention. People are always asking, &quot;Are you involved 
                in the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Bill?&quot;,

                Seriously, however, people are probably not fully aware of the 
                implications of the bill. When the bills start to drop through 
                the door and people are asked to meet their feudal buy-outs at 
                20 times the rate set on the stock exchange, they might feel a

                difficulties with that in future, the good that the bill brings

                in 1974&#151;and I do not always talk with much enthusiasm about 
                his involvement in most things. However, I am usually enthusiastic 
                about Mrs Thatcher's activities. I am quite sure that her involvement 
                in 1991, in setting the task of reform for the Scottish Law Commission, 
                which has seen its fulfilment today, will cause her to raise a

                have debated in the first session&#151;because we have swept away 
                300 years of law. We have had a constructive debate, and although 
                we have disagreed on one or two points, it is important that those 
                views have been aired in Parliament. I am particularly pleased 
                that we have had an opportunity to discuss the issue of public 
                interest. I thank Jim Wallace for his reply on that and his comment

                piece of legislation, but some aspects will affect the lives of 
                ordinary people. In some constituencies, there have been situations 
                close to blackmail, when feudal superiors have been able to request 
                vast sums in return for permission to carry out reasonable development.</font></P>

                a power of work.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bill 
                is good and makes progress, but there are problems, as the minister 
                had the courtesy to recognise, especially in relation to part 
                4. Twenty-six years ago, most of Scotland thought that feuduty 
                had been abolished. It was not. Today, people in Scotland will 
                think that the feudal system has been abolished. It has not; it 
                has been renamed. Feudal superiors are dead; long live the owners 
                of the dominant tenement. As that reality percolates through, 
                there will be feelings of disappointment, which will temper the 
                progress that has been made.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
                I was gratified that the minister said that some of the problems 
                that were raised today will be re-examined before part 4 comes 
                into force. It would be churlish of me not to accept that assurance

                problems of those whose long residential leases are coming to

                the difficulty has been caused by the terminology. I echo Fergus 
                Ewing's assertion that feudalism has been not so much abolished 
                as amended. That is why I am particularly happy to support the 
                bill, and it might give the lie to the reason why the Scottish 
                National party is uncomfortable with Tory support for the bill. 
                We might be removing words such as vassal and feudal, but feudal 
                tenure has brought many benefits over the years. When members 
                next enjoy looking up at the fireworks from Princes Street gardens,

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The minister 
                touched on the fact that there is still the ability to maintain 
                some burdens through disposition, and the bill itself maintains 
                some burdens. We believe in free markets and in the ability to 
                enter into contracts. That is much of what feudalism seeks to 
                do. Having sought to amend the bill to remove the parts of feudalism 
                that we all deplore and consider outdated and anachronistic and 
                to preserve those that work, the Conservatives offer our sincere 
                support, and congratulate the minister and his colleagues on successfully

                For example, we have received many representations about sheltered

              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Gordon 
                Jackson (Glasgow Govan) (Lab): </strong>I am grateful for this debate. 
                In such a situation, there are many things that we do not know. 
                For my part, I do not know what is going on behind the scenes 
                and what deals might be done. I have no idea what arrangements, 
                in detail, might be worked out. I therefore have no intention 
                of speculating on the detail of what might happen; my interest 
                is in what I know to be true.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, 
                there is no doubt that Govan has the ability to build the ships. 
                Any suggestion that might be made to the contrary&#151;not by 
                people here, but by anyone elsewhere&#151;is absurd and untrue. 
                Govan has both the capability and the quality; the work that has 
                been produced there recently will bear that out. I invite members 
                to consider the sophisticated vessels for a range of uses that 
                have come from that yard in the past few years.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, 
                the death of shipbuilding at Govan would be a disaster, not just 
                for that area but for Glasgow and for Scotland as a whole. Govan 
                is the largest builder of merchant ships in the United Kingdom. 
                Scotstoun, across the water, is the largest shipbuilder in Scotland. 
                At the moment, about 1,000 people work at Govan and about 2,000 
                at Scotstoun, while Govan supports nearly 5,000 other people through 
                suppliers and subcontractors. I ask members to bear in mind that 
                Govan cannot be considered in isolation. If it goes, inevitably 
                Scotstoun will come under pressure and there will be serious consequences 
                for the whole economy.</font></P>

                would make no sense whatever. When one tries to calculate the 
                cost of benefits and other support for those who would be put 
                out of work, it becomes clear&#151;even on simple arithmetic&#151;that 
                it would be a foolish option. Is the financial support given to 
                that yard by successive Governments over the years simply to be 
                wasted?</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What we 
                are talking about is not short-term support for a dying industry. 
                We should never let anyone tell us that there is no point in keeping 
                this industry alive. The truth is that Govan is a modern, sophisticated 
                facility with a newly installed management, which&#151;I believe&#151;is 
                prepared to invest and to improve.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have 
                ample reason to believe that within the next few years, substantial 
                work will be available, which will allow shipbuilding to grow 
                and to thrive on the Clyde for the foreseeable future. To miss 
                out on that, with all the costs that I have tried to mention, 
                because work is somehow unavailable to get us to that point, would 
                be a colossal economic mistake.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fourthly, 
                what of the human costs? In Glasgow&#151;I am sure that this is 
                true elsewhere&#151;there are more than enough men and women already 
                who are unable to use their considerable skills; people who feel 
                deeply that their talent is wasted. Surely what we want is to 
                reverse that process and to go further. I am arguing not for short-term 
                employment but for a thriving industry, with new apprenticeships 
                and a skill base&#151;not just for now, but for the future. Are 
                we to lose that?</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who can 
                calculate the human cost of the great sense of disappointment 
                that would be felt by the population at large if one of the most 
                famous and respected shipyards in the world were to close? If 
                people did what we have been doing for the past few weekends&#151;asking 
                passers-by to sign a petition&#151;they would realise the strength 
                of feeling for the shipyard not to disappear.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last, 
                but not least, there is the work force. I am glad that its representatives 
                are in the public gallery behind me. For far too long, they have 
                endured a roller coaster of uncertainty. When others might have 
                given in, the work force fought the campaign the length and breadth 
                of the country, and sustained an optimism and a positive attitude 
                that can be described only as remarkable.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am glad 
                that so many members have waited behind today. At the very least, 
                the work force is entitled to our full support, and the assurance 
                that we are doing everything possible to secure its future. My 
                message to the Executive, and to Henry McLeish in particular, 
                is simple: make it happen. I know that a great deal is being done. 
                I know that the Scotland Office and the Scottish Executive are 
                working hard on this. I appreciate that the campaign is supported

                the representatives of the Govan work force who are in the public 
                gallery, and pay tribute to that work force. As Gordon Jackson 
                said, the workers in Govan have been through the mill over the 
                past two years, but throughout they have behaved with dignity 
                and with determination to save not only their jobs, but the industry 
                that they work for in Scotland. It is their commitment to the 
                future of shipbuilding that has ensured that this issue is at 
                the top of the political agenda, and politicians will not be allowed 
                to forget the importance to Scotland of the yard and the industry. 
                It is important that we, in the Scottish Parliament, send a strong 
                message to UK ministers that we expect them to deliver for Govan 
                and Scotstoun.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shipbuilding 
                in Scotland is a high-tech industry, which employs highly skilled 
                workers. By no stretch of the imagination can it be described 
                as mere metal bashing. It is an industry that deserves support. 
                It should have a future, and that future should not be in doubt. 
                As Gordon Jackson said, there is no doubt in the minds of most 
                people in Scotland&#151;especially those who work in the industry&#151;that 
                Govan has the capability to build the ferries; any suggestion 
                that it does not is an insult to the people who work in the shipbuilding 
                industry in Scotland.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have 
                to be clear about the implications of the Sealion consortium not 
                securing the contract. Gordon Jackson outlined the effect that 
                that would have not only on Glasgow and Govan, but on the whole 
                of Scotland. For Govan, it would mean almost certain closure, 
                with the loss of 1,200 jobs; that figure does not include the 
                jobs that depend on the shipyard in Govan. For Scotstoun, across

                term. Neither Gordon Jackson nor I are in any position to confirm 
                whether that is true, but I do not think that that would be sufficient; 
                the contract in its entirety must go to Govan.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would 
                like the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning to confirm 
                that he will press for the whole contract to go to the Sealion 
                consortium. That would ensure that Govan could get through the 
                period until it is supposed to begin work with Scotstoun on the 
                type 45 frigates. I repeat what Gordon Jackson said: ministers 
                must &quot;make it happen&quot;. It is right that the campaign 
                is being fought on a cross-party basis, but this is also a key 
                test for the Government&#151;a test of its commitment to the shipbuilding

                a year&#151;that is almost inconceivable now. Throughout my working

                enjoy the job security that other highly skilled workers have. 
                Increasingly, their jobs depend on a small number of large contracts.

                for manufacturing in Scotland at a time when other areas of traditional 
                manufacturing are declining. In response to my friend Mr McNeil's

                two sides are fully integrated in what they are about. The union 
                officials and men there have behaved with dignity and honour during 
                a difficult 18 months or so. They have been extremely flexible 
                and constructive. One could not ask for any more from the work

                full ministry contract, as we know that it is likely that the

                I think that we can take lessons from no one around the world

                Brown (Glasgow) (LD): </strong>Gordon Jackson is to be applauded for 
                securing this debate, in which some good points have been made. 
                Many members have visited the Govan yard&#151;I went round it 
                most recently with Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence 
                spokesman. I was struck by the massive size of the yard. It requires 
                a skilled, specialist work force, a design capacity, experience 
                and capital equipment. The yard works as a team; once broken up 
                and scattered to the four winds, it cannot readily be re-established.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Clyde 
                itself was once synonymous with the shipbuilding industry. The 
                industry has changed, but the Clyde remains a byword for quality. 
                It is economically imperative that the MOD award of the ferries 
                goes to BAe Systems at Govan.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is 
                crucial to the maintenance of British shipbuilding capability 
                and to shipbuilding on the Clyde that Govan wins the order. Winning 
                the order would secure, in the long term, additional investment 
                from BAe Systems in the yard, and would save the cost of community 
                devastation in Govan and throughout Glasgow. It would bridge the 
                gap until the warship order can be placed. It would also give 
                Govan and the MOD the benefit of savings on the four successive 
                ferries that are required, as any snags on the first order would 
                be compensated by the easier run on the later ones, and effective 
                specialisation between the Govan and Scotstoun yards would be 
                allowed. Those are sustainable, solid, long-term issues for the 
                shipbuilding industry.</font></P>

                securing this debate and, in particular, for the positive tone 
                and content of his speech. Gordon was talking about a make-it-happen, 
                can-do mentality. This is not a funeral for the shipbuilding industry; 
                this is a means for us to direct our collective efforts to help 
                to ensure that the MOD order comes to Govan.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I lived 
                in Govan for 23 years, from the age of one week. My grandfather 
                worked at Fairfield Construction and I have a cousin who works 
                in that yard to this day. Therefore, from a personal perspective, 
                this matter is very important to me.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is

                and&#151;yes&#151;of the wider British shipbuilding industry that 
                the ferries contract is secured. If the order can be secured, 
                Govan has a secure future. We know that the type 45 destroyer 
                orders are not too far off, and that Govan and Yarrow Shipbuilders 
                will work together to ensure that that work is carried out to 
                the excellent standard that the yard can achieve and has demonstrated 
                in previous years.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In case 
                some people think that the Govan yard is on its last legs, I should 
                point out that, as has been said, it is a high-tech yard. In its 
                short tenure, BAe Systems has injected 3 million into the yard. 
                It believes, as does the work force, that the yard has a long-term 
                future. BAe Systems is willing to inject up to 23 million more 
                into the yard. The owners of the yard believe that it has a future; 
                the work force, which has sacrificed a tremendous amount over 
                the years to prove that the yard has a future, also believes in 
                that future.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We cannot 
                allow commercial shipbuilding to die in this country. I do not 
                think that that will happen; I think that the Government will 
                wake up and realise that the order must go to Scotland. The Prime 
                Minister said that he would not sleep until the jobs at the Rover

                bent as much as is necessary. If some of the stories about hidden 
                subsidies and the use of cheap labour in other countries are true, 
                I hope that the Government is prepared to recall the contract 
                if it is not awarded to Govan. This is not just about jobs at 
                the yard; it is about wasting Glasgow as a whole. Call centres 
                alone cannot sustain Glasgow or Scotland. The message to the minister

                a broader comment on the worry about the impending situation? 
                Does he accept that the situation at Govan gives rise to a message 
                that we should listen to and put at the heart of much of the work 
                that we do through the enterprise agencies? We must deliver the

                they can have a long-term future. Can the enterprise agencies 
                embrace that proactively, rather than as the result of a potential 
                crisis situation such as we face at Govan?</font></P>

                Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, the enterprise companies 
                and the Executive are examining all the various industrial sectors. 
                As Tommy Sheridan and others have mentioned, different sectors 
                face different problems. Those problems' origins are often global, 
                but they are, nevertheless, important to the work forces.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is 
                right that&#151;as is happening throughout the UK&#151;there is 
                a debate. The Scottish Trades Union Congress highlighted that 
                a week ago. Manufacturing matters, but we also want to move to 
                a knowledge economy. However, that knowledge and that technology 
                are alive and well in the shipyards of Scotland. It is crucial

                economy and every possible support should be given to help it 
                to succeed. That is why, when there was a campaign to save the 
                Govan shipyard last year, we all participated. The Scotland Office 
                and the Scottish Executive worked together to ensure an excellent 
                victory. What is important is that nobody in the Executive will 
                walk away from the issue or from the need to secure the work that

                all colleagues in Parliament that the Executive, in common cause 
                with the Scotland Office, is supporting every effort to reinforce 
                the arguments that the industry is putting forward. We all&#151;the

                I know that, for the work force, the delay is prolonging the uncertainty,

                base and the work force? That would allow Govan to take on the 
                orders that can clearly be allocated under the existing defence 
                regulations to a British yard.</font></P>

                McLeish: </strong>Westminster appreciates the time scale that is involved. 
                There is a natural synergy in all this, because the Westminster 
                Government, through the MOD, needs capacity that is skilled, committed 
                and will put in competitive bids for the type 45 frigates. In 
                the short term, we need the order for Govan to secure its future. 
                That is a natural synergy, which has not been fully appreciated. 
                In a curious way, the long-term interests of the UK are dependent 
                on the short-term interests of Govan and the case that we are 
                making for it.</font></P>

                workers have proven time and again that they have the strength 
                of will and the skills to endure a process such as this and to 
                win through. I am sure that their expertise will help them to 
                earn the right to build future naval vessels for the MOD, such 
                as the type 45. The Executive, wholly supported by every section 
                of this Parliament, will give them the broadest support to continue 
                that campaign.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have 
                a Parliament that speaks for Scotland. Regardless of our political 
                differences, this issue unites the nation. The strongest message 
                that this Parliament can send is that we are united. We are at 
                different levels of emotion and we are at different levels of 
                wondering who is doing what, why this is not being done and who 
                is speaking to whom.</font></P>
              <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Every 
                possible effort is being made to ensure the short term, so that 
                we can win the long term. Govan's long-term future is bright. 
                It is about technology, skill and&#151;more important&#151;people 
                whose jobs are under threat. Those people are represented here 
                by the convener of the shop stewards and one of his colleagues. 
                Let us fight together and unite, and let us be optimistic until 
                we get the result that we want.</font></P>
