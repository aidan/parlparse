<a name="stpa_0">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;[Gillian Merron.]
</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51011h01_spnew0"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  </b> (in the Chair): I hope that all hon. Members had a restful and peaceful recess, and that you have all come back duly reinvigorated for the constructive debate that will take place in this House in the coming weeks.

</p>



<a name="time_0">
<a name="51011h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51011h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Amess  (Southend, West)</b>  (Con): I am grateful for the opportunity to initiate the debate. Before I get into my speech, I must declare the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) and I visited New York in September, where we jointly addressed a rally of 20,000 people outside the United Nations building in support of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, and that the visit was paid for entirely by that organisation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">I intended to speak for 20 minutes, but I am now slightly worried about doing so because of the large number of colleagues who seek to speak in the debate. I shall do my best to speak quickly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">The Iranian regime&#039;s lethal cocktail of barbaric oppression at home, export of Islamic fundamentalism, sponsorship of terrorism, widespread interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and unwavering pursuit of nuclear weapons is a real and present threat to the Iranian and Iraqi peoples and to peace and stability in the middle east and the wider world.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">As Members will know, for years our Government and those of our European partners favoured rapprochement with Tehran, and told us that their policy toward Iran, which was described as &quot;constructive engagement&quot; or &quot;critical dialogue&quot;, would strengthen those elements in the Iranian regime whom our Government described as moderates or reformers. Regrettably, events have proved them wrong on both counts: not even the mullahs now describe any element of their regime as moderate, and our Government&#039;s policy has resulted only in allowing the most radical elements to cement control over every lever of power in Iran.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">In the Iranian regime&#039;s recent presidential elections, the Guardian Council, a watchdog vetting body of 12 unelected clerics and jurists, approved only eight candidates out of 1,019 to stand for election, including two clerics, four former Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps commanders, a former Minister and a former low-ranking official. Of course, no women or opposition candidates were allowed to stand, as the Guardian Council vetted all prospective candidates to ensure their full allegiance to the supreme leader.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">By any standard, the presidential election was neither free nor fair. After the first and second rounds of the elections, even the losing candidates, including the cleric Mehdi Karoubi, a former Speaker in Parliament, and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 2WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Rafsanjani, the former President of Iran and a pillar of the Iranian regime for the past 25 years, alleged that they had lost due to widespread vote-rigging in favour of the ultimate winner, Ahmadinejad. I apologise to the Chamber for my mispronunciation of those names, which does not come to me easily. Further, most independent observers, and Iran&#039;s main opposition, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, claimed that the election had been widely boycotted by the Iranian people, who sought fundamental change.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">However, despite all its shortcomings, the recent presidential election was very important. By propelling Ahmadinejad to victory, the supreme leader completed his absolute control over the executive, judiciary and legislature. The plan began a few years earlier with the elections of the municipal council for Tehran, which left hard-liners in control. It then moved on to the parliamentary elections in February last year, in which the hard-liners, including 70 Revolutionary Guards commanders, secured an overwhelming majority. Ahmadinejad&#039;s election was the final step. I believe that that strategic decision marks a new era in Iran&#039;s political landscape. Ahmadinejad&#039;s ascension undercut the view in the west that the so-called moderates in Iran were gaining strength; it lifted the veil of moderation, and showed the ruling theocracy&#039;s true colours.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">So who is this new President? In an article in <i>The Scotsman</i>, Mrs. Maryam Rajavi&#151;a wonderful lady&#151;who is president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, described Ahmadinejad as a


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;hostage taker, murderer and terrorist.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">Ahmadinejad was a ringleader of the takeover of the United States embassy in Tehran just after the 1979 revolution. He is accused of plotting to murder Salman Rushdie, of interrogating, torturing and executing Iranian dissidents during his time with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards&#039; internal security brigade, and of terrorist assassinations around the world when he was a key figure in the formation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards&#039; Jerusalem force. Moreover, in early July, Reuters reported that Austrian prosecutors were investigating whether Ahmadinejad was involved in the 1989 assassination of the Iranian Kurdish leader in Vienna.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">Soon after his election, Ahmadinejad appointed a Cabinet filled with hard-liners, composed, on the whole, of former Revolutionary Guards commanders and/or individuals who formerly worked in Iran&#039;s Ministry of Intelligence and Security. The Cabinet is truly the &quot;Who&#039;s Who&quot; of terrorism. Iran&#039;s new Foreign Minister was forced to leave Turkey because of his role in kidnappings and assassinations of Iranian dissidents and secular Turkish intellectuals. Iran&#039;s Defence Minister is directly linked to the suicide bombing of the United States Marines&#039; barracks in Beirut in 1983, which killed 241 United States Marines.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">What should be of most concern to the international community is that, as a consequence of Ahmadinejad&#039;s presidency and the appointment of his Cabinet, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps has emerged as the main pillar of the Iranian regime. The Revolutionary Guards Corps is one of the most repressive pieces of apparatus of the Iranian regime, and it was the main organ involved in the arrest, torture and execution of tens of thousands of the regime&#039;s political opponents.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 3WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">Since Ahmadinejad&#039;s election, the Revolutionary Guards Corps has stepped up its internal repression. Human rights abuses in Iran continue to increase drastically. Summary arrests, tortures, public lashings and hangings, and stoning to death remain everyday occurrences in Iran. It is reported that, in the past few months alone, more than 70 Iranians have been executed in public, a large number of whom were young or minors. Women and religious minorities, including the Jewish, Christian and Baha&#039;i communities, have also borne the brunt of that repression.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">At the same time, the Revolutionary Guards&#039; Jerusalem force, which is responsible for extraterritorial activities, has been much involved in Lebanon with Hezbollah and been very active in Iraq over the past three years, and is now in direct control of Iran&#039;s nuclear weapons programme. Ahmadinejad&#039;s presidency, therefore, has already had major internal and foreign policy implications. After he became President, the French news agency reported him&#151;what a cheek this is&#151;as declaring:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;Thanks to the blood of the martyrs, a new Islamic revolution has arisen and the Islamic revolution of 1384 will, God willing, cut off the roots of injustice in the world.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">He added:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;The wave of the Islamic revolution will soon reach the entire world.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">God help us all.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">Iran&#039;s nuclear programme is a prime example of such implications and is one of the most pressing issues for the international community. The Iranian regime&#039;s claims that its nuclear projects are for civilian purposes are absolute nonsense.
</p>






<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51011h01_spnew2"><b> Bob Spink  (Castle Point)</b>  (Con): I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. I do not know whether he is aware of this, but I visited Iraq a few weeks ago, and senior politicians there are deeply concerned about Iran&#039;s wish to stop democracy and stability developing in Iraq and particularly in Kurdistan, where excellent progress has been made since the war. Senior Iraqi politicians told me that they believe sincerely that Iran&#039;s nuclear programme is continuing and most certainly with a military objective.
</p>






<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51011h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Amess </b> : I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for walking the walk on this issue. I read about his visit in our local newspaper and I thank him for underlining the fact that without doubt Iran has the capability to deploy nuclear weapons and that that is the real target, not Iraq.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">Until August 2002, when the National Council of Resistance of Iran revealed the Iranian regime&#039;s secret uranium-enrichment site in Natanz, the regime was vehemently denying involvement in such projects. The NCRI also revealed a heavy water plant at Arak that is used to produce plutonium. The international community owes the People&#039;s Mojahedin Organisation of Iran an immense debt of gratitude. One can only imagine with horror when the international community might have learned of the Iranian regime&#039;s nuclear weapons programme&#151;which my hon. Friend just mentioned&#151;without the revelations made by that organisation in 2002 and since.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 4WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">There can be no doubt that the Iranian regime is pursuing a nuclear programme for military purposes, as it considers nuclear weapons to be a guarantee of its survival and a tool that, when at its disposal, will give it leverage to hold the world to ransom. The experience of the past two years has shown that Iran has played a devastating role in the members of the European Union being taken for absolute fools. Iran breached agreements with the EU3 in November 2003 and again in November 2004. It did so most recently with the breaking of United Nations seals and the resumption of work at its nuclear facility in Isfahan.
</p>






<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51011h01_spnew4"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis  (New Forest, East)</b>  (Con): Is there not a greater danger than a nuclear Iran, which might be deterred from taking action in its own name, in that it could supply nuclear weapons, once it acquired them, to other forces&#151;to non-state actors that would have no hesitation about using them for terrorist purposes?
</p>






<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51011h01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Amess </b> : My hon. Friend is right and I agree with him, but that will not diminish the point I will make in my peroration that in respect of the conflict with Iraq, we got the wrong target.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">Iran&#039;s then top nuclear negotiator told a leading Iranian newspaper that Tehran had benefited greatly from the talks with the EU3 in advancing its nuclear programme:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;In the past 21 months, the Islamic Republic has achieved brilliant results in technical, legal, political, propaganda and national security spheres. Today, we have started up, tested the facility in Isfahan at the industrial level, and produced several tons of UF6. Today, there are a significant number of manufactured centrifuges ready for use. It may seem on the surface that we have accepted the suspension. But in reality, we have used the time to alleviate many of our shortcomings. We continued building centrifuges until the Paris Accord. After June, we doubled our efforts to make up for the suspension. We have not suspended work in Isfahan, even for a second. Arak has not been suspended at any time.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">That is further evidence of exactly what Iran is up to. For that reason, although I welcome the resolution passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency on 24 September requiring Iran to be reported to the Security Council over a failure to convince the agency that its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, I feel that that step was taken two years later than it ought to have been. Without question, Ahmadinejad&#039;s defiant tone and vigorous defence of Iran&#039;s nuclear weapons programme in his address to the United Nations General Assembly made it amply clear that Tehran was determined to continue its breach of international demands to suspend its nuclear activity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">Hon. Members need not panic. I have been speaking for 15 minutes, but I shall dump half of my speech and I hope that allowing a couple of interventions helps.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">In a thinly veiled threat, Ahmadinejad told the General Assembly that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;we will reconsider our entire approach to the nuclear issue&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">if Iran is not left to its own devices to move forward with its nuclear programme. Ahmadinejad&#039;s diatribe was not as surprising as the push by some countries for more time to be given to Tehran to rethink its hard-line position. After almost two years of futile talks with Tehran, that suggestion, far from being naive, is utterly reckless. Time is what the free world does not have and

what the clerical regime seeks. The ball is now in Tehran&#039;s courtyard. Iran should be under no illusion: it cannot proceed with its game of cat and mouse with the international community. The world is becoming impatient.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">The prospect of an Islamic fundamentalist Iranian regime possessing nuclear weapons is made even more terrifying by its undoubted sponsorship and involvement in terrorism. Even as recently as April this year, the Iranian regime was recognised by the United States annual report on terrorism as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;the most active state sponsoring terrorism.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">Our Prime Minister told the House of Commons Liaison Committee in February that the Iranian regime


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;certainly does sponsor terrorism, there is no doubt about that at all&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">That is why I cannot understand why our Foreign Secretary has graced that country on three or four occasions. I would have thought that that was merely giving credibility to a thoroughly discredited regime.
</p>






<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51011h01_spnew6"><b> Mark Pritchard  (The Wrekin)</b>  (Con): Does my hon. Friend agree that it is about time that the Government made plain their intention in principle and in practice to make clearer the announcements on a replacement for Trident, given the threats from places such as Iran?
</p>






<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51011h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Amess </b> : My hon. Friend is on to a clever point. I know that the Minister is listening carefully to the debate and I am sure that we will give him enough time to reply. By the time that he comes to reply he may wish to comment on my hon. Friend&#039;s point.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">Over the past 25 years, the Iranian regime has been responsible for more than 450 terrorist attacks throughout the world. Terrorism is also closely linked to the Iranian regime&#039;s efforts to spread its brand of Islamic fundamentalism to the rest of the middle east and the wider world. As Ahmadinejad stated after his election victory, he hoped that a wave of Islamic revolution would soon reach the whole world. The clerical rulers use the powers, resources and facilities of a state to achieve their regional and global expansionist ambitions, regardless of differences among fundamentalist groups so long as the Iranian regime remains in power. Tehran continues to act as the heartland of the extremist Islamic fundamentalist movement around the world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">I urge the Government to take immediate steps to deal with the PMOI and remove all restrictions on its activities. By taking such steps, apart from supporting the Iranian people in their quest for freedom and democracy, our Government will be acting in their own interest by defeating the scourge of Islamic fundamentalism and the terrorism emanating from it. At the same time, the Government should abandon their policy of engagement vis-&#224;-vis the Iranian regime. Instead, they should adopt a firm policy towards the mullahs, beginning with an active involvement in referring the Iranian regime&#039;s nuclear file to the United Nations Security Council without delay. In that way, they can show that they stand with the Iranian people in their struggle for freedom and democracy, and not with the mullahs who oppress them.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">I have never pretended to be a foreign affairs or defence expert&#151;I leave such subjects to my colleagues, who know far more about them than I do. Like many other hon. Members, however, I voted for the engagement in Iraq for what I believed were the right reasons. I now regret that decision. As we now know, there were no weapons of mass destruction, and Iraq did not have the capability to deploy nuclear weapons. Even someone such as me, who does not pretend to be a foreign affairs or defence expert, can see, therefore, that we got the wrong target.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">However, now that we understand that we should be dealing with Iran rather than Iraq, the last thing that we want is for the United States of America and Britain to interfere again and make a mess of the situation, with no idea of how to leave the country and no prospect of doing so. I simply hope that once the Minister has had time to reflect on the matter, he will encourage the Foreign Secretary to be not quite as supportive of the Iranian regime as he seems to be, because I, like colleagues in all parts of the House, want peaceful regime change.
</p>






<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51011h01_spnew8"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  </b> (in the Chair): Before I call the next speaker, I should point out that, as the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) said, this is clearly a popular debate and many Members wish to speak. I therefore hope that brevity, self-discipline and courtesy will be the hallmarks of the debate.

</p>



<a name="time_1">
<a name="51011h01_time1"><h5>9.51 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51011h01_spnew9"><b> Chris Bryant  (Rhondda)</b>  (Lab): Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I note that you always say that just before I start to speak.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">I congratulate the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) on securing the debate, not least because it is of significant interest to many people in the Commons and across the nation. I shall restrict myself, however, to a narrow issue of concern.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">On 19 July, two young men were publicly executed in Edalat square in Mashad in north-east Iran. We do not know their full names&#151;as far as we have been able to ascertain, nobody has been able to work them out&#151;but they are known as MA and AM. One was 18 when he was killed; the other was 17. Before their execution, both were held in prison for 14 months, and it is likely that they suffered considerable torture during that time. As we know from the court judgment, they received 228 lashes between them&#151;in most cases, anything beyond 20 lashes leads to somebody collapsing. Their ages at the time that they were arrested, let alone the time of the alleged incident, would have been 16, 17 or perhaps younger.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">Allegations of rape and theft were made in the court. Although we cannot be entirely sure, it is almost certain that those allegations were untrue. If they had been true, the person who was raped would, under sharia law, also have received a penalty of lashing. It is pretty unlikely, therefore, that the allegations were true.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">Many Members might have seen the photographs of the execution, which was filmed by Iranian television. It is distressing to see the boys crying on the back of a lorry on their way to the execution on the gallows in the square. We see the hangmen in their balaclavas checking four times that the nooses are tight before driving away. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 7WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The rudimentary scaffolding is just like that we see outside any building where work is being done. Clearly, it has been thrown up in just half an hour&#151;it is pretty easy to execute people. It all seems a long way from our experience of life in this country, but such things are a fairly regular occurrence in Iran.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para33"><a name="stpa_34">The most distressing moment is when the lorry simply drives away; there were two lads with their feet on the back of the lorry and suddenly there is no support and they are dead. What is most striking is that the word Edalat means justice. Few people in this country or around the world would consider what happened to be a form of justice.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">I raise this matter for two reasons: first, because it is about the treatment of minors. The convention on the rights of the child and the international covenant on civil and political rights prohibit the death penalty for anyone under the age of 18. I presumed that Iran would not have ratified those conventions, but it has; it subscribes to them and maintains that it does so, yet, in 2004, four juvenile offenders were executed. Thirty juvenile offenders are currently on death row in Iran. They include Milad Bakhtiari, who is 17 years old, Hussein Haghi, aged 16, Hussein Taranj, 17, Farshad Saeedi, 17, and Saeed Khorrami, 16, who were all considerably younger when the alleged incidents occurred.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">Only five countries&#151;Iran, China, the Congo, Pakistan and, of course, the United States of America&#151;have used the death penalty for juveniles since 2000. Interestingly, the Supreme Court in the United States declared in March that using the death penalty for minors is unconstitutional.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">I may not be able to carry the House in saying that I do not believe in the death penalty for anything, but I think that I do carry the House in saying that the death penalty for minors under the age of 18 is wholly reprehensible, does not meet with our understanding of justice and must be immoral and wrong.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">The second reason is the treatment of homosexuals in Iran. I draw the Chamber&#039;s attention to the case of Amir, from Shiraz&#151;a name more familiar to most of us when used in relation to wine. Amir is a 22-year-old who is now in Turkey seeking asylum. His experience of his homosexuality&#151;the words that he uses&#151;is no different from that of many young homosexuals in this country. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;I have known I was gay since I was about five or six; I always preferred to play with girls. I had my first sexual experience with a man when I was 13 but nobody in my family knew I was gay.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">Many homosexuals in this country would say exactly the same.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">Amir was first arrested two years ago at a party; nothing was happening at that party, he just happened to be there with other homosexuals. At the time, he was fined 100,000 tomens, which is about $120&#151;a considerable sum in Iran today. Since then he has been pursued by Colonel Safaniya who runs Shiraz&#039;s Office for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prohibition of Vice. He was arrested a second time a year ago when he was caught in a campaign of gay entrapment by the paramilitary group the Basiji, which works unofficially under the hard-line Pasdaran or Revolutionary Guards. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 8WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
With your permission, Sir Nicholas, I shall read from his account of what happened when he was arrested. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;There was a metal chair in the middle of the room. They put a gas flame under the chair and made me sit on it as the metal seat got hotter and hotter. They threatened to send me to an army barracks where all the soldiers were going to rape me. There was a soft drink bottle sitting on a table. Ali Panahi told one of the other <i>basiji</i> to take the bottle and shove it up my ass, screaming, &#039;This will teach you not to want any more cock!&#039; I was so afraid of sitting in that metal chair as it got hotter and hotter that I confessed. Then they brought out my file and told me that I was a &#039;famous faggot&#039; in Shiraz. They beat me up so badly that I passed out and was thrown, unconscious, into a holding cell. When I came to, I saw there were several dozen other gay guys in the cell with me.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">Following that, he received 100 lashes. He says that subsequent to the events in Mashad earlier this year to which I referred the situation has considerably worsened. He continued:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;After the Mashad incident, visits from the authorities would become an almost daily occurrence. They would come to my house and threaten me. They knew everything about everything I did, about everywhere I went. They would tell me exactly what I had done each and every time I had left the house. It had gotten to the point where I was starting to suspect my own friends of spying on me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In one of these arrests the Colonel told me that if they catch me again I would be put to death &#039;just like the boys in Mashad&#039;. He said it just like that, very simply, very explicitly. He didn&#039;t mince his words. We all know that the boys who were hanged in Mashad were gay&#151;the rape charges against them were trumped up, just like the charges of theft&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When you get arrested, you are forced by beatings, torture, and threats to confess to crimes you didn&#039;t commit. It happens all the time, it happened to friends of mine.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="51011h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">as John Donne said many centuries ago. Also, we still send gay Iranians back to Iran and refuse to grant them asylum. In June 2004, Hussein Nasseri, a 26-year-old Iranian, killed himself in his car in Eastbourne. He shot himself between the eyes with a shotgun on being told that he had been refused asylum. I do not believe that this country should be sending gays back to torture, fear, oppression and&#151;potentially&#151;hanging or stoning.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">Secondly, nobody has yet raised Iran&#039;s human rights record at the United Nations, despite the fact that in 2001, 12 gay men aged between 14 and 57 were stoned in Iran. In 2000, 16 were killed; in 1999, 10 were killed, and it still goes on. I do not share the views of the hon. Member for Southend, West on our policy of engagement: on the whole I believe that that policy has been particularly astute. The Foreign Secretary has been one of the most able in trying to maintain a strong relationship with Iran, which might tease them into a better understanding of the world. However, we must engage in discussions on human rights, if necessary in strong terms. Otherwise, young people in Iran will continue to be killed. Young women will continue to be executed and young men will continue to live in terror. Engagement with Iran cannot mean ignoring human rights abuses.

<a name="51011h01_para46"><a name="stpa_47">My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), who went with me to New York and wowed a crowd of 20,000 people with his speech, astounded me on that occasion and has done so again. I was lucky to accompany him and I spent four days with the organisers of that rally and with many of their supporters. I got to know them pretty well. I learned at first hand of the devastation created by the Islamic fundamentalist mullahs over the past 25 years in Iran. I learned that Iran was by any measure of decency and freedom an uncivilised and brutal regime. How does that impact on this country? If it impacts on us in a serious way, how do we deal with it?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para47"><a name="stpa_48">Only last week the Foreign Office officially confirmed that Iran&#039;s Revolutionary Guards Corps was behind the deadly attacks that recently claimed the lives of eight British soldiers. The regime does impact on us. Also last week a member of the British diplomatic service said that the Iranians were colluding with the Sunni Muslim insurgent groups in southern Iraq and were providing them with the deadly terrorist technology perfected by Iranian-funded Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon. This does impact on us.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para48"><a name="stpa_49">Only five weeks ago, Dr. Pierre Goldschmidt, a Belgian nuclear scientist and former head of the United Nations team investigating Iran&#039;s nuclear programme, called on the Security Council to give that inspection team greater powers to determine whether Iran was trying to build an atomic bomb. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;It is reaching the point where it is beyond critical. As things stand, we cannot prove that Iran has a military programme, but we do have indications that this is the case&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is the question that everyone should be asking.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">If Iran is in the process of building an atomic bomb, that clearly has an impact on every one of us and on every one of our constituents.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">I visited Israel a week after I visited New York, and I was privileged to meet some of the most senior figures in its Government, Opposition and intelligence service. I questioned them intently about their understanding of the Iranian atomic threat. Their answers were both unequivocal and deeply disturbing. First, they maintained that there is no doubt that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Secondly, they believed that the pace of development has quickened in recent months. Thirdly, they estimated that the Iranians are within two years of being able to produce a nuclear weapon. Finally, and equally disturbingly, they also maintained that the Shihab 5 delivery vehicle will be ready and

capable, within the next two years, of delivering its weapons to the heart of Europe and Russia, to say little of Israel.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51011h01_spnew13"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis </b> : Is my hon. Friend aware of a recent report that some EU ambassadors felt it necessary to withdraw from a parade that they were attending in Iran when they saw the slogans that were displayed, one of which read:

</p>






<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51011h01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Binley </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for bringing that to my attention. I did not know of that particular incident, but it is in keeping with many of the slogans being paraded throughout Iran, and we should take note of the intent behind them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">Let me return to the point that I was making; Israel considered the Iranian situation to be the doomsday scenario.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">What do the American intelligence people think about Iran&#039;s intentions? Only last week, an American intelligence officer said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;This is not like the pre-war debate about whether Iraq was working on weapons of mass destruction. Iran has a nuclear weapons programme. There are no doubts.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">Finally, the National Council of Resistance of Iran&#151;the organisation that first alerted the world to Iran&#039;s nuclear programme in 2002&#151;has produced an in-depth report into Iran&#039;s nuclear weapons programme, which leaves us in no doubt. I assume that the Government have a copy&#151;I assume that the Minister, certainly, has a copy&#151;because it is required reading for any Foreign Office Minister. If the Minister does not have a copy, I would be happy to ensure that he has one, because this is a frightening document that should disturb us all.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">The situation is clear: here is a state, organised along the lines of a mediaeval theocracy, which will soon be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon with a range of 5,000 km. Here is a society that makes heroes of suicide bombers. Could a more serious problem be facing us now, and could there be a greater threat to the security and well-being of all the people whom we represent?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para55"><a name="stpa_56">What can we do about the problem? We could continue with our current policy of appeasement, which the EU and Britain have pursued for several years without any discernible success. I do not believe that that is the way to go now, because it is apparent that the mullahs have taken little notice of that policy; to my mind, it has become totally discredited. I shall therefore ask the Minister several questions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para56"><a name="stpa_57">In the light of recent events, will he confirm that our whole approach to the Iranian situation is being reviewed and revised? Does he recognise that our attitude to those who seek an internal regime change in Iran must also change, not least to ensure that a new and more robust message is sent to the present Iranian regime? Is it not time to recognise the right of the Iranian people to resist the present regime, and to do all that they can to bring about democratic change in that country? Is it not time to remove the PMOI from the US State Department&#039;s list of debarred organisations and from the European Union&#039;s list? Is it not time to call on the Security Council to give greater power to the UN&#039;s investigation team to determine whether the Iranians are trying to build an atomic bomb, as I, and many other

people, believe they are, and as the document proves? Is it not time to impose a full technical embargo on the regime to attempt to halt its progress in that regard?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">As the Israelis said, the present situation has the potential to produce a doomsday scenario. The Minister has the potential to do something about it and his response will tell the British people whether he and the Government are capable of facing the challenge. I believe that they are.

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51011h01_spnew15"><b> Dr. Phyllis Starkey  (Milton Keynes, South-West)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) on securing the debate, because its subject is crucial and the timing is opportune. However, I totally dissociate myself from the commendation that he and his hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) gave to the National Council of Resistance of Iran&#151;an organisation that almost totally lacks credibility. It is a sect, not a political party, and has virtually no support in Iran. It is a diversion from the real issues, and I do not want to give it any more attention in my remarks.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">Iran is an important regional player in a highly unstable region. As everyone knows, relations between the US and Iran are particularly fraught. I join my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) in strongly commending the role that the UK Government have played, together with our partners in the European Union, in trying to reach a negotiated resolution of the nuclear issue; we need to continue in that role.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">The nuclear issue is important, not only in relation to Iran but in the context of controlling nuclear proliferation in general and in asserting the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in overseeing international agreement on, and carrying through, the framework for dealing with nuclear proliferation. However, I fear that we are at a tipping point, from which we could easily slide into the sort of confrontation that Conservative Members appear to seek, instead of achieving a resolution.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">The UK and the EU have a key role in helping to find a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue, but we need to remind ourselves of our history in relation to the region, because people in the region know the history and tend to see the current action of the UK, France and the US through the historical prism of our past behaviour in the region.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">In the early years of the 20th century, Britain and the Russians agreed to divide Iran into spheres of influence. In 1919 Iran had a trade agreement with Great Britain in which, although Britain formally reaffirmed Iran&#039;s independence, it attempted to establish a complete protectorate over it. I imagine that everyone is aware that Iran&#039;s Prime Minister, Mohammed Mossadeq&#151;he was elected to the Iranian Parliament in 1923 and again in 1944 and became Prime Minister in 1951&#151;was removed from power in 1953 in a complex plot orchestrated by the British and US intelligence agencies. The present Government do not need to apologise for our past behaviour; however, we need to be aware of it, as the Iranians have historical reasons for not regarding

all that we and the US do as being totally above board or without some ulterior motive. That is why we should be careful.

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51011h01_spnew17"><b> Dr. Starkey </b> : No; there is very little time, and the alternative point of view has had enormous coverage.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">We need to be careful in how we engage with Iran. That is not to say that we should not criticise Iran for a variety of reasons, but I shall deal with that in a moment. Nevertheless, we need to be aware of how what we and the US say is perceived not only by the Iranian Government but by the public at large.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">The hon. Members for Southend, West and for Northampton, South, whose speeches seem to have been based on what the NCRI has told them, should understand that Iran is a deeply devout Muslim country. It is also socially very conservative. The Iranian Government may well be responsible for policies that many of us would find abhorrent, but regrettably those policies are often quite popular with large slabs of the Iranian population. We need to understand that, and not do as the NCRI does and pretend that if we can get rid of a few mullahs everything will be sweetness and light&#151;far from it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">We need to be careful. The UK Government should be clear, consistent and transparent, and engage in dialogue not only with the Iranian Government but directly with the Iranian public.
</p>






<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51011h01_spnew18"><b> Mark Pritchard </b> : On that point, will the hon. Lady give way?

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51011h01_spnew19"><b> Dr. Starkey </b> : No, I am not going to give way.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">I know that others want to speak, so I shall touch only briefly on three other matters: the nuclear issue, human rights and the recent attacks in southern Iraq.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">We should remember that Iran&#039;s nuclear programme started under the Shah&#039;s regime. It is an Iranian issue, and it can easily be presented as an Iranian nationalist issue. Another difficulty is the asymmetry of the non-proliferation treaty&#151;an asymmetry with which I agree&#151;which gives those with nuclear weapons different obligations to states without such weapons. That can be seen as the west saying, &quot;It is all right for us to have nuclear weapons, because we are responsible and will not do dreadful things with them, but it is not okay for other countries to have them.&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">We also have to deal with the fact that we are not consistent across the piece. Everyone in the region knows that Israel already has a nuclear capability. It is rather like the elephant in the corner: no one speaks of it. There is a deliberate diplomatic ambiguity about Israel&#039;s nuclear potential, but the other countries in the region know about it and feel that it is not consistent for us to focus only on their potential for nuclear weapons and ignore the fact that one country already has such a potential&#151;a country that has in the past not been averse to attacking others. We need to take those factors into account.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para68"><a name="stpa_69">The Government have been pursuing the right line on the nuclear question, and we need to persist, but we must be clear and consistent in putting pressure on Iran to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 13WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
comply with the IAEA. We must also be extremely careful not to use language that allows our stance to be projected as yet another example of the US and the UK&#039;s attempting to control Iran or impose their will on the country. We should recognise Iran&#039;s right to have access to a civil nuclear programme, but like everyone else Iran must comply with the IAEA.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para69"><a name="stpa_70">As for public diplomacy, we should tell the Iranian people directly that countries such as Belgium that rely heavily on nuclear energy have to import all their fuel, as we are asking the Iranians to do. Enriching the fuel themselves would be economically inviable for the Belgians, as it would be for the Iranians. If we can get those ideas across, we should persist in our line on nuclear power.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para70"><a name="stpa_71">My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda has highlighted a specific aspect of Iran&#039;s poor record on human rights, and many hon. Members can cite other issues in that regard. We need to be clear and firm in our stance on human rights. In that respect, members of the European Union have greater credibility than the United States, because unlike the United States we are opposed to the death penalty&#151;full stop. We need to be consistent and credible, and to back credible human rights campaigners in Iran such as the Nobel peace prize winner Shirin Ebadi.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para71"><a name="stpa_72">Also in respect of human rights and democracy, we should have been more assertive in pointing out the way in which the Guardian Council ruled out a great many people who should have been able to stand in the elections, thus giving the electorate a very poor range of candidates from which to choose. We also need to assert that the human rights of all ethnic and religious groups in Iran should be protected.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">We should ensure that Iran&#039;s human rights commission deals with the complaints that are brought to it. However, we must avoid at all costs the lunatic strategy that a variety of neo-Conservatives in the United States appear to be parading: to suggest that one way to bring down the regime in Iran is to stir up conflict between all the ethnic groups there, in order to achieve fragmentation. That appears to be giving an immense puff to a number of rather spurious groups in the United States that claim to represent different ethnic groups in Iran.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">Finally, if the British Government have clear information about Iranian involvement in the bombings in southern Iraq, it needs to be brought forward. Otherwise, we must be careful to stick to what we know: the explosive devices used were similar to those used by Hezbollah in Lebanon, suggesting that they might have been of Iranian provenance, and that the Revolutionary Guards might have been involved in smuggling them. We should pursue that with the Iranian Government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para74"><a name="stpa_75">It is obvious to everybody who knows about Iran that there are a great many groupings within its power structure, some of them tolerated by the Government, and some operating off their own bats. We need to stick to the facts, and not to indulge in hyperbole which will only further alienate members of the Iranian Government rather than holding them to account and making sure that they move in the direction in which we would wish them to move.

I rise to ask the Minister to assure us that the Government&#039;s connections with the Iranian Government will be used to try to secure the interests of the persecuted Baha&#039;i community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">For 17 years, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has passed resolutions on human rights in Iran, often referring specifically to the plight of the Baha&#039;i. In addition, the commission&#039;s special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief reported in March 2005 on several aspects of the persecution of the Baha&#039;i, including destruction of sites of historic significance, access of Baha&#039;i youth to education, and blood money legislation as it relates to the Baha&#039;i and other minorities, and in February 2003 the working group on arbitrary detention reported severe human rights violations in respect of Baha&#039;i. The list goes on. There is no question but that the Baha&#039;i are persecuted in Iran. Will the Minister provide us with an assurance that he will use this Government&#039;s connections to ask the difficult questions that must be raised with the Iranian Government in order to understand why those activities take place?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">The different international mechanisms have all found various evidence of the continuing persecution of the Baha&#039;i in Iran. By necessity of mandate, each report can provide only a comparatively limited analysis of the human rights situation in Iran, and of a specific situation such as that of the Baha&#039;i. That highlights the need for the restitution of a UN special representative to Iran, who would be mandated to provide an in-depth report about each aspect of the human rights situation in Iran, including that of the Baha&#039;i.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para77"><a name="stpa_78">I am an optimist; I still feel that there is a case for attempting some form of dialogue with the Iranian authorities. The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) and I have had useful conversations with representatives at the Iranian embassy about this matter in the past. I recognise that some people are more sceptical about the case and about having more dialogue, but it would be remiss of us not to turn every stone in seeking the solution to the persecution that the Baha&#039;i and other groups feel.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">I should like to make an offer to the officials who represent Iran in this country. I and other representatives of the all-party friends of the Baha&#039;i group seek a non-confrontational dialogue to understand how the Iranians see their treatment of the Baha&#039;i community, and to explore whether there is something we can do to persuade the Iranians to see the Baha&#039;i in another way.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">I ask the British Government to provide an assurance that they will use their contacts and dialogue with the Iranian authorities to apply pressure to ensure that the Baha&#039;i and other religious sects, who represent no threat whatever to Iran&#039;s integrity, are afforded the opportunity to live freely and without persecution.

We have heard recently of many instances of human rights abuse, and particularly of those against the Baha&#039;i in Iran. Up to 1998 there had been 200-odd Baha&#039;i deaths, many at the behest of the Iranian Government. That activity has waned since 1998; however, the persecution of and violence against the Baha&#039;i continues. Since 1998, seven Baha&#039;i have been on death row, which caused an international outcry. Members in both Houses of this Parliament spoke out in defence of those Baha&#039;i, and none were executed. That shows that the views of this House and of other bodies can impact on countries such as Iran.

<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51011h01_spnew24"><b> Mr. Nick Clegg  (Sheffield, Hallam)</b>  (LD): I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) on securing this debate. It is particularly timely given the events of the past few weeks and during the summer recess, which underpin the volatility of relations between the United Kingdom and Iran.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para83"><a name="stpa_84">Everything that has been said during this debate has reinforced the difficulty of being optimistic about the state and prospects of UK-Iranian relations. The nascent move towards political reform in Iran seems to have been displaced by the election of a President on an explicitly populist and nationalist ticket who once famously said that Iran


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;did not have a revolution in order to have a democracy.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">As we heard in eloquent testimony from the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and others, human rights abuses continue unchecked. Iranian influence in Iraq seems to be growing day by day, as does the threat of escalating nuclear proliferation in Iran and, therefore, the region as a whole. What can we do about that? There seem to be two options. The first, which I 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 16WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
have always endorsed, is the European Union approach of critical, firm engagement. The other is a harder threat of military action.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">The reality is that both options are becoming increasingly implausible and incredible. That is the dilemma facing us. The policy of engagement has not led to the benefits that those of us who supported it thought it would. The EU3 dialogue on the nuclear issue is heading into the cul-de-sac of the UN Security Council; the EU-Iranian trade and co-operation agreement was still-born; and the undesirable alternative of deploying some military threat is logistically impossible given the military quagmire in Iraq and, as the Foreign Secretary recently informed us on the &quot;Today&quot; programme, is inconceivable. That suggests that the Iranian Government can sit pretty because they believe that there is no meaningful leverage on what they do. We are bereft of the instruments to effect change in Iran, because the leverage that we would like to exercise does not exist.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">Two issues loom over that and make the absence of leverage all the more acute. The first is the military quagmire in Iraq. Regardless of all the reasons why the invasion of Iraq was misguided and unlawful, one striking effect appears to have been to allow Iran to exercise influence in a part of the world for which there has been a long-standing Persian ambition. Western foreign policy used to be built on the premise of preventing Iran from doing precisely what it is now doing: mobilising the Shi&#039;a majority in Iraq to exercise Iranian influence. It is extraordinary that one of the after-shocks and after-effects of the UK-US invasion of Iraq has been precisely to grant Iran that influence which had previously been denied to it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">Secondly, Iran seems to be proceeding with an explicit policy of re-orientation towards what is loosely called the east. The way in which the Iranian Government are actively pursuing links with China and Russia is an important factor that has not yet been mentioned. It is an easy relationship to establish. The Chinese and Russians have every incentive to exploit US and UK discomfort by tacitly aiding Iran in return for much-needed oil and gas reserves. As the Russian-Chinese-Iranian relationship deepens, our meagre leverage over Iran continues to weaken. One flows from the other.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">I have two questions for the Minister. First, the policy of engagement is only credible if it is wedded to a threat of sanction should the policy not be reciprocated by the Iranian Government. However, if a referral to the UN Security Council were to take place, Chinese and Russian resistance makes it most unlikely that UN sanctions would be agreed to. Will the British Government, either on their own or through the European Union, take steps to impose UK or EU sanctions in the absence of a multilateral route when and if the policy of engagement has been fully frustrated?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para89"><a name="stpa_90">Secondly, what steps are the Government taking to persuade Russia and China in order to avert a crisis in relations between Iran, the EU and the US? I suspect that the route to a lasting solution to the fraught and volatile nature of our current relations with Iran passes through Moscow and Beijing as much as it does through London, Washington, Tehran or Brussels.

<a name="51011h01_time7"><h5>10.35 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51011h01_spnew25"><b> Mr. Keith Simpson  (Mid-Norfolk)</b>  (Con): This has been an excellent debate, and I am sorry that certain colleagues were unable to speak. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) on speaking with such emotion&#151;putting the case for the prosecution, as it were. Five other colleagues also spoke on the subject. In the few minutes available to me I shall follow the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg) in homing in on the core issue of what is to be done. That is the crucial matter.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para90"><a name="stpa_91">The Government&#039;s policy towards Iran, as many hon. Members have said, is one of constructive but critical engagement. The touchstone areas in our relationship&#151;putting aside the important matter of trade where the deficit is largely on our side&#151;are human rights, which have been well aired, Iran&#039;s development of a nuclear programme, and its support for terrorist groups throughout the middle east&#151;specifically, however much we dress it up, in Iraq. We have debated whether the Government are right to pursue their policy of constructive engagement, but events of the past six months have rather sadly proved that it is now insufficient. By all criteria, including the evidence produced by colleagues today and by others, it seems that the influence of the British, the Europeans and others on the Iranian Government is pretty limited. The Foreign Office&#039;s own report on human rights has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;There has been no significant progress in Iran since our last Annual Report&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para91"><a name="stpa_92">That has been graphically demonstrated today. Will the Minister tell us whether we have managed to have any influence on the human rights aspect since that report?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para92"><a name="stpa_93">The Government have worked incredibly hard within the EU3 to try, through a combination of pressure, influence and threat, to persuade the Iranians not to go ahead with the development of their nuclear programme, but sadly that has failed. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) is quite right: for the current Iranian President and groups in Iran it is a national objective to acquire nuclear weapons. The process of persuasion has failed, so what is the alternative? The Foreign Secretary has said that it is incredible that military action would be taken against Iran. It might be incredible, but I can imagine at least one regional power carrying out what many would regard as incredible if it thought that its existence as a nation was at stake.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para93"><a name="stpa_94">Two other specific irritants in our relationship with Iran put pressure on the policy of constructive but critical engagement. First, we have forgotten that over a year ago the Iranians seized three Royal Navy patrol boats and arrested eight Navy personnel&#151;an illegal act on any criteria. The personnel have been returned but the patrol boats have not. Is there any hope of those patrol boats being returned as a result of constructive engagement?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para94"><a name="stpa_95">Secondly, there is the question of the immediate impact. We know the complexities: the Iranian regime might well decide to put pressure on the British Government because of our attempts to put pressure on them in relation to the nuclear programme. The question has been raised of whether the Iranians are providing military logistics, munitions and a safe haven 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 18WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
for militia groups in south and north Iraq to carry out attacks against the Iraqi security forces and the coalition forces. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West raised that point and perhaps fairly tried to say that the case was not yet proven. Any fair-minded person might draw a conclusion from statements ranging from that made by the unknown Foreign Office representative, who more than a week ago seemed to state pretty categorically that the evidence existed, to the Prime Minister&#039;s, who massaged that slightly, to that of the Secretary of State for Defence yesterday, who basically said that there was such evidence but that we were probably talking about the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Perhaps we need clarification from the Minister. Today is the perfect opportunity to put the question to bed once and for all.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para95"><a name="stpa_96">This has been an important debate. The Government&#039;s policy of attempting constructive engagement was motivated by a desire for the best possible outcome, but the historian within me tells me that we have been round this buoy before in the 1920s and 1930s with the Soviet regime, and then with Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. We also went round it in the 1960s and 1970s with China. The problem is that if a regime is not prepared to go through any form of constructive dialogue, and indeed regards it as a form of weakness, what, as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam said, is the alternative? The alternative might well be that a regional power decides to do the inconceivable and take military action. The Government are now in a position where they must reconsider their current policy of constructive engagement. It has not failed completely, but it has come to the end of its usefulness for policy making as far as Iran is concerned.

<p><a name="st_27"><a name="51011h01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Middle East  (Dr. Kim Howells) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) on securing the debate. I know that he is passionate about the subject, and he gave an eloquent performance. We share many of the concerns and fears that he and many other hon. Members expressed, and I will try to deal with them one by one.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para96"><a name="stpa_97">The debate has been remarkably constructive. We heard eloquent and passionate pleas about issues that affect us all, such as the dangers of nuclear proliferation, on which we heard from the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg) and others. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) described the barbarity of practices that should have no part in any country in the 21st century. I hope that that message and his eloquence reach beyond this Room. They have certainly had an impact on the Government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para97"><a name="stpa_98">Everything that we heard this morning highlights the great contradiction that Iran represents. It is a very important country. It is big and has a young population. It has the potential to be a great player on the world scene. It grieves me all the more, therefore, that because of the actions of its regime, our discussions about Iran are almost always couched in negative terms. We want 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 19WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Iran to be a great country. It has a wonderfully rich history, as everybody who goes to the British Museum can see for themselves. It has enormous potential. It has natural resources that we would all like to have. However, as we heard this morning, some pretty terrible things are occurring, and there are great dangers for the whole world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para98"><a name="stpa_99">We have much on which to co-operate with Iran. One part of my job is counter-narcotics. Some 95 per cent. of the heroin coming into this country and Europe comes from Afghanistan, and most of it finds passage through Iran. The Iranians have lost a lot of soldiers and policemen on the eastern borders trying to prevent heroin and opium from coming in, and Iran has at least 2 million opium addicts of its own. I do not want to lose the contacts that we have with the Iranians. It is very important that we co-operate with them, and I want everyone to know that. On the eastern border we are helping to teach them how to handle customs and working with them to tighten the border. They have a very difficult task, but if they fail, we shall all suffer. The children on our streets will suffer as a consequence of more heroin coming in. We ought to remember that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para99"><a name="stpa_100">As hon. Members have pointed out, it is not enough simply to point to the constructive elements of our relationship. We must take seriously the matters raised today. Let me start with Iran&#039;s nuclear programme, about which I feel very strongly. Iran&#039;s actions in the past and present do not inspire confidence that its programme is, as it claims, solely for peaceful purposes. Anyone who, before the Iranian presidential elections in the summer, saw former President Rafsanjani tell the entire world, in his interview with Gavin Esler, that Iran had told lies and conducted deceptions, and that it was, of course, interested in arming itself, should learn the lesson that we must take what Iran says on that very serious issue with a sackful of salt. Along with France and Germany, and with the support of Javier Solana, we have pursued a policy of constructive engagement, as the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson), who speaks for the Conservatives, termed it. We felt that that was the proper way forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para100"><a name="stpa_101">It is all the more hurtful, in a way, that Iran chooses to snub our approach when we have kept the country, for at least the last two years, from having to face an immediate referral to the United Nations Security Council. It is foolish for Iran to do that. The Iranians&#151;somebody referred to them earlier as the Persians, as they are indeed known in the area&#151;are very skilled diplomats. That skill is acknowledged across the world. For them to do that is extremely worrying and a backward step. The help and good will that existed to try to get them to understand what the world feels about their nuclear programme is a lesson that seems to have been lost on them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para101"><a name="stpa_102">I agree entirely with what has been said in this Chamber. There is absolutely no explanation for Iran&#039;s programme of nuclear conversion and nuclear enrichment, other than that they are building a nuclear bomb. Iran does not have a working reactor. The Russians are constructing one at present&#151;at least, they were. We are not quite sure whether the work is going ahead, but we know that very worrying things are happening in Iran. Reinforced tunnels are being built, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 20WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
which look as if they could be designed to store nuclear technology or nuclear production facilities. Since they have no nuclear reactor, there would be absolutely no need for them to conduct that enrichment exercise. The Russians have already told the Iranians that they can supply enough nuclear fuel, specially designed for that reactor, to last over the coming decades, even if Iran expanded its nuclear reactor programme. Remember, it does not have a nuclear reactor that works at present.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para102"><a name="stpa_103">So what do we do? That is the big question. The widely respected International Atomic Energy Agency is the only multilateral organisation that looks at such matters, and, indeed, it was awarded the Nobel peace prize last week. The agency has tried hard to persuade the Iranians that there is a better way forward than the one that they have chosen. The Iranians for a while abided by what the IAEA suggested&#151;we were the conduit for those ideas&#151;but have now rejected those suggestions. The board of the IAEA has by majority vote now decided to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para103"><a name="stpa_104">What worries me is this, and it is a big worry: I had the privilege on behalf of the European Union and, of course, of this country to chair our meeting at the UN with the non-aligned members, where we discussed the nuclear issue, among other matters. I heard from those who spoke on behalf of the non-aligned nations a version of the past two and a half or three years that was pure fantasy. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) in a way put her finger on the point when she said that a feeling exists of, &quot;Why should Iran not have a bomb?&quot; I am not sure that people around the world understand the centrality of the issue to the future of world peace. It is no good saying that things might have been different if we didn&#039;t start from here, if the second world war hadn&#039;t taken place, if America hadn&#039;t developed the bomb, or if Russia hadn&#039;t developed the bomb. That is, of course, nonsense.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para104"><a name="stpa_105">I would apply the same conditions to Israel as to Iran. We continually ask Israel to abide by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We always have done, and we shall continue to do so. We do not attempt to hide that at all. To argue that the number of countries that can own and can use a nuclear bomb should be extended seems to me to be a criminal analysis of a situation that is already serious enough. We must be very clear. The greatest thing that we can do is to be completely transparent and honest in dialogue at the United Nations and elsewhere about this very important issue. We know that delivery systems are available that countries such as North Korea, among others, are selling and that can lob a nuclear weapon a very long way. I have even heard reports that Europe would be within the range of some nuclear weapons.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para105"><a name="stpa_106">The hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) asked whether we would replace Trident. I laughed at the very idea that I would say such a thing in this Room. If Iran did develop a nuclear weapon, however, it would throw the whole issue of how we get rid of our nuclear stocks&#151;how we demilitarise&#151;back into the melting pot. The issue poses enormous challenges to everyone.

to complain about that, other than to ask whether you could use your good offices to provide some clarity on whether there is any point in writing in to request to speak. I wrote in July to the Speaker&#039;s Office to indicate that I would like to catch your eye during this debate. I realise that letters do not necessarily mean that one gets to speak, but on my most recent visit to Westminster Hall, the Clerk, acting on the Deputy Speaker&#039;s instructions, rushed down to say that I had not written in.

The Secretary of State for Defence refreshingly admitted yesterday that he did not have the foggiest idea about the position on that matter, but he did mutter something to the Minister. We need some clarity on the Government&#039;s view, and reassurance that the people at Camp Ashraf continue to have protected person status.

I assure him that the matter will be raised. I trust him exactly on what he said about writing in July and hope that the Minister will get around to replying to his important intervention.
</p>






<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51011h01_spnew29"><b> Dr. Howells </b> : I did mutter a few words of advice to the Defence Secretary yesterday.

There is a contradiction there.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para107"><a name="stpa_108">My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda highlighted one group but could have highlighted many. He described a savage act that did nothing to enhance Iran&#039;s reputation worldwide, and I hope that news of his eloquence will get back to that country. He could have talked about Christians, Jews and many others who have been persecuted inside Iran. We should be concerned about such persecution, which certainly sends out messages to the rest of the world that do nothing to enhance our cause of constructive engagement.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para108"><a name="stpa_109">I note the example of the inspirational investigative journalist, human rights defender and now political prisoner, Akbar Ganji, who remains in jail, where he has been for most of the past five years. Such people believe that Iran should be speaking to the rest of the world about a range of issues, not least a subject that I hope to cover in this last minute.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para109"><a name="stpa_110">My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West and other Members asked about the involvement of Iran in southern Iraq. I was in Iraq recently, and there is no question but that there has been at least Revolutionary Guard involvement there. It has been suggested over the past week that some of the bomb-making technology may well have come from Hezbollah. I have no doubt about that. The technology and the way that it is being used bear all the marks of Hezbollah.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para110"><a name="stpa_111">If Iran thinks that it can somehow stymie the efforts of the people of Iraq to create a democracy, it should think again. The world is watching and wants Iran to play a role that is constructive, not destructive.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h01_para111"><a name="stpa_112">We have something very special to think about because we have lost eight soldiers as a consequence of bombs. We should never put the enemy on a pedestal, and I am certain that our forces in the south of Iraq will overcome that bomb-making technology, as they have done in many similar campaigns. The enemy may initiate a new technology, but our soldiers will find a way of overcoming it.

<a name="51011h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Durham and Tees Valley (European Funding)</h3>

<a name="time_9">
<a name="51011h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_34"><a name="51011h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Iain Wright  (Hartlepool)</b>  (Lab): It is a privilege to have secured an Adjournment debate so early in the new Session and on an issue with such potentially enormous consequences for the future of the north-east&#151;particularly the Tees valley and County Durham&#151;and other regions in the United Kingdom.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para0"><a name="stpa_113">Let me warn you in advance, Sir Nicholas, that my speech will not take the form of a wildly rhetorical and passionate argument about Britain&#039;s position in the European Union, about EU expansion or even about Britain&#039;s future financial contribution to the EU budget. The topics about which I am concerned are somewhat dry and technical, and I am delighted to say that, as a chartered accountant, I shall be able to mention some accounting rules, although I am not sure that others will share my enthusiasm for them. Nevertheless, when there is the prospect of my constituency and other constituencies in Durham and Tees valley receiving &#163;600 million, I can be as dry as the desert.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para1"><a name="stpa_114">I shall focus on the technical calculations, which might have an adverse effect on the ability of Durham and Tees valley to secure substantial sums of European money. However, it would be useful briefly to set out the north-east&#039;s economic performance in recent decades and the contribution that European funding has made towards narrowing the gap between the north-east and the rest of the UK.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para2"><a name="stpa_115">In the 1980s, the north-east, including Tees valley and County Durham, suffered immensely as a result of the decline in its former industrial base in coal mining, shipbuilding, steel and manufacturing. That led to mass structural unemployment in that decade, with 110,000 jobs lost in manufacturing between 1981 and 1997 and significant rises in worklessness and reliance on benefits. That in turn means that the region now needs more than ever to continue to embrace change in the regional labour market and to introduce new industries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para3"><a name="stpa_116">From the late 1990s onwards, however, there have been indications that Durham, Tees valley and the wider north-east are changing. The gross value added growth rate in the north-east has been converging with that of the UK as a whole, particularly since 1998. There is more employment, with 200,000 extra jobs being created in the region in the past seven years, and the prospect of full employment for the first time in decades.
</p>






<p><a name="st_35"><a name="51011h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham)</b>  (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that some structural unemployment is generational? The money that Europe is providing is therefore having to address generational structural unemployment, which, in other areas, has been tackled in different ways.
</p>






<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51011h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Wright </b> : I absolutely agree. There are second and third-generation people in our constituencies and others who were completely reliant on benefits, and European funding has been vital in breaking that cycle and ensuring that prosperity and employment return to the north-east.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para4"><a name="stpa_117">Unemployment has fallen much more dramatically in the north-east than in other regions. It has fallen by 26 per cent. since just 2001, although we must recognise 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 24WH</b>

that the region had higher jobless figures to start with. There are more business start-ups and there is growing business confidence. Companies such as Tees Valley Regeneration are undertaking ambitious regeneration ventures on former brownfield sites such as Victoria harbour in my constituency and Middlehaven in Middlesbrough.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para5"><a name="stpa_118">The most significant reason for that economic upturn has been the policies advanced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor since 1997. Of similar importance, however, has been the assistance provided by European funding in tackling the structural problems faced by Durham and Tees valley. In 2000&#150;06, the north-east was allocated &#163;434 million from the objective 2 programme, which helps regions to adjust to economic and social change, and &#163;194 million from the objective 3 programme that aims to tackle unemployment and low skills and to encourage entrepreneurialism.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para6"><a name="stpa_119">I am sure that all hon. Members could give examples of the benefits that European funding has brought to their constituencies. In my constituency, two valuable projects have helped us to address the structural weaknesses in the labour market and the wider economy. Hartlepool Working Solutions was given &#163;250,000 from European social fund money. Its aim is to provide the long-term unemployed in the most deprived areas of the town with training and employment advice, and it has helped almost 1,200 people, of whom 500 have found employment and 670 have gone on to achieve further qualifications and training.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para7"><a name="stpa_120">One targeted communities package project was the introduction of information and communications technology centres. With over &#163;800,000 of European regional development fund money, it provided 18 new community facilities, of which 15 have state-of-the-art ICT centres and cr&#232;che facilities. Training in computing can now be given in the most deprived areas of Hartlepool.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para8"><a name="stpa_121">European funding has had a major impact on Hartlepool. It has helped to increase significantly the skills level of the townspeople and thus to reduce unemployment. Without it, more people would be on the dole. Much progress has been made, but more needs to be done if we are to eradicate completely the structural problems in Tees valley and Durham. That is why continued and expanding European funding is vital.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para9"><a name="stpa_122">If I may, Sir Nicholas, I will say a few words on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor), who cannot be here because she is at an Intelligence and Security Committee meeting. She asked me to say that one of the main beneficiaries of European funding in Stockton is Queen&#039;s campus of Durham university, which contributes &#163;3 million to the local Tees valley economy. My hon. Friend said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;European funding has done wonderful things for Stockton South, helping to regenerate the economy and bring back much-needed jobs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>






<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51011h02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Industry and the Regions  (Alun Michael) </b> : My hon. Friend rightly illustrates the benefits of European funding, but will he take into account the fact that three quarters of public spending on regional development comes from UK domestic sources, and that, under any scenario, that proportion is set to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 25WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
increase in the near future? That is bound to happen as a result of the enlargement of the EU with the accession of the 10 poorer member states. Following his point about the importance of investment in his area, I emphasise that such work will increasingly be funded domestically.
</p>






<p><a name="st_38"><a name="51011h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Wright </b> : I fully agree with and accept what my right hon. Friend says. All money that is made available to the north-east, particularly to County Durham and Tees valley, is welcome. There has been massive investment in the north-east since 1997. The theme of my speech is that there seems to be a technical and inconsistent argument about the allocation of future European funding that could mean that we in the region will miss out on &#163;600 million. I want to highlight that point, and to make sure that Ministers are aware of the inconsistency and will try to rectify it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para10"><a name="stpa_123">There are grounds for optimism in helping to address those structural issues, but long-standing problems remain: educational attainment still lags behind the national average, and employment in Durham, Tees valley and the wider north-east remains biased towards low-skilled and low-paid work. That is the consequence of long-standing reliance on an economy built on heavy manufacturing, which has largely ended. We have seen the social and economic difficulties experienced by a society and a work force that are adapting to the 21st century requirement for high skills and greater and faster competition after losing one kind of employment. Although there has been growth, the north-east was the slowest growing region in the UK in the past decade. To avoid falling further behind, the region needs to grow at least 25 per cent. faster, and even faster if we are to narrow the gap with the rest of the UK.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para11"><a name="stpa_124">I hope that I have shown that Durham and the Tees valley have suffered from structural changes over the past 30 years, although there have been significant improvements recently. We now stand at a fork in the road, and the direction that is taken in the next few months might shape the nature of the sub-regional economy for decades. We can accentuate the positive by building on the improvements of the past few years and ensuring that structural changes to the economy and the shape of the labour market help us to continue to narrow the prosperity gap between us and the rest of the UK, or we can highlight the negatives, thereby losing any progress made in increasing skills and helping to ensure and to accelerate population migration, especially among the young and the economically active.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para12"><a name="stpa_125">Highlighting the negatives would leave the area with few prospects and high levels of deprivation and dependency on benefits. Future European funding is therefore vital to the north-east in general and to the Durham and Tees valley economy in particular as it will enable us to tackle the next phase of structural change and ensure that the economy has the necessary strengths and skills to compete in the modern global economy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para13"><a name="stpa_126">The new European funding programme is due to start in January 2007, and I understand that it will have three strands&#151;the so-called three Cs. The first is convergence&#151;targeting poorer regions of the EU with the aim of reducing the gap between their economic performance and that of the rest of the EU. The second is competitiveness&#151;funds will be given to increase the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 26WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
competitiveness of regions that are not eligible for the convergence strand. The final strand is co-operation&#151;the aim of joint working and the sharing of best practice.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para14"><a name="stpa_127">I understand that the best position for Durham and the Tees valley will be to receive funding from the convergence strand, which would allow us to bring some &#163;600 million into the region for economic development and regeneration for the period 2007&#150;14. We could be eligible for such amounts through what is known as the statistical effect of enlargement, which applies to member regions and sub-regions whose per capita gross domestic product is below 75 per cent. of the EU average.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para15"><a name="stpa_128">If we exclude Tyne and Wear, and especially Newcastle, which could be seen as an economic powerhouse in the north-east, the GDP of the north-east is one of the lowest in the country. The GDP per capita for Durham and Tees valley is even lower. The latest figures compiled by Eurostat show that the rolling average GDP of Durham and Tees valley for the period 2000&#150;02 was 75.7 per cent. of the EU average. The relative decline in the period 2001&#150;03&#150;&#150;we are growing, but not as fast as other regions&#151;means that the rolling average was about 74.78 per cent. of the EU average. This is the main point that I want to get across&#151;there is the prospect of hundreds of millions of pounds for the region, but our eligibility for the convergence strand is borderline, and every percentage point is vital. A point more, and we receive nothing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para16"><a name="stpa_129">A major problem arises, however, from the calculation of GDP per capita, especially from the inclusion of incomes arising from economy activity that cannot easily be attributed to a geographical region. It is easy to identify such economic activity on land. In my constituency, Heerema is building an oil rig, which can be attributed to the north-east economy, but the extraction of oil and gas from the North sea is less easy to attribute.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para17"><a name="stpa_130">The Office for National Statistics assigns such potentially difficult economic incomes to a virtual region of the UK called extra regio&#151;a treatment that is consistent with the European accounting rules. Extra regio is a substantial part of the UK&#039;s GDP; it amounts to some 2 per cent. of national income, which is much more than other European states and reflects the importance to the UK economy of offshore oil and gas production.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para18"><a name="stpa_131">The problem arises when Eurostat calculates regional GDP from the national data. Eurostat reallocates extra regio to regions pro rata, which has the effect of inflating the GDP per capita of all UK regions by about 2 per cent. Such a sharing out of extra regio is, in fact, contrary to the European system of accounts 1995 accounting procedure&#151;I said that I would mention accounting rules&#151;which is the legal basis for the compilation of EU regional statistics. The ONS has expressed its concern to Eurostat about that gross inconsistency. In June 2005, Len Cook, the national statistician, pronounced that the current treatment of extra regio is


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;not statistically sound nor consistent with ESA 95. To not change the current method must reduce confidence in EU wide use of these statistics, as it appears that we are now deliberately continuing a practice that has a doubtful scientific basis&quot;.</p>

As he has suggested, the UK Government representatives have made that very point to the EU. Indeed, I recently wrote to the Commission to make our position clear and to urge it to introduce improved arrangements for the treatment of extra regio as soon as possible, and in time for the next financial perspective. I agree with the point that my hon. Friend makes.

On the contrary, I believe that everyone accepts that the system is inconsistent, and that it has a detrimental effect on the UK&#151;particularly on the north-east, but also on other areas. I hope that we can address the inconsistencies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para19"><a name="stpa_132">I shall briefly mention Durham university. Durham county council&#039;s economic development section and the Tees valley joint strategy unit have been extremely helpful in highlighting the inconsistencies. Durham university carried out research to establish the components that make up GDP, as measured by Eurostat, and concluded:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;Regional and subregional estimates of GVA per head [used to develop GDP figures]&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are subject to significant statistical error&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At a sub-regional level&quot;&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para21"><a name="stpa_134">I am concerned that the potentially inaccurate and inconsistent use of inflated statistics may have profound repercussions on the future allocation of funding for Durham and Tees valley. We may miss out on &#163;600 million because of the inclusion of that 2 per cent., which is itself against EU accounting procedures.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para22"><a name="stpa_135">Imagine what that &#163;600 million could help to achieve. That sum of money is over three times the budget of One NorthEast, the north-east regional development agency. That money could help to lever in further private and public money, which would help substantially to address the structural weaknesses in the sub-regional economy. We could put in place a 21st century transport infrastructure, such as a co-ordinated rail system in the Tees valley, with linkages to the expanded Teesport and to Durham Tees Valley airport, and a truly world-class logistics and distribution network. The money could help us to continue to address the skills shortages that prevent us from competing fully with the new graduates in China and India. It could also help to continue the progress made in the knowledge economy by Durham and Teesside universities so that real innovation could occur in the renewable energy and biotechnology industries, in which we have the potential to lead the world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para23"><a name="stpa_136">I strongly urge my right hon. Friend, in the remaining weeks of the UK&#039;s presidency of the EU, to press for the correction of the current blunt and unfair calculation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para24"><a name="stpa_137">It has already been said that the north-east suffered during the 1980s. It suffered not only the managed decline that we have seen in existing industries but suffered from a Government whose policy ripped the heart out of many parts of the north-east. That included my constituency of North Durham, where the Durham coalfield was closed down more or less overnight. On Tyne and Wear, shipbuilding was also closed down rapidly. Very little support was put in place for those communities, which were solely reliant on the shipbuilding or coal mining industries. Employment figures for the region in 1979 show that 29,000 people were employed in shipbuilding or shipbuilding-related industries on the Tyne; now there are less than 2,000. Where have all those people gone? In many cases, the economically active have moved out of the region, which has led to skill shortages in certain areas. It has also led to the problem in my constituency of a lack of hope: young people have no aspirations to go into higher education or new jobs in regions such as the north-east if opportunities are not there.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para25"><a name="stpa_138">We in the north-east are occasionally accused of having a begging-bowl mentality, and it is something of which I have accused some regional politicians over the years. It is important to remember, however, that European funding has actually helped in respect of physical regeneration and some of the issues that affect people. Unlike Scotland and Wales, the north-east does not have a loud voice. I hear what the Minister says about moneys coming from the Government, but unless he can give me an assurance that they will match the &#163;600 million, I will remain sceptical of the claim that the north-east will not lose out to principalities such as Wales.
</p>






<p><a name="st_42"><a name="51011h02_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael </b> : In discussing the availability of European finances, it is important to remember that the UK is a net contributor to the European Community budget, which means that all receipts from the EU come at a cost to the UK taxpayer. It is not free money. We contribute about 1.6 euros for every euro we receive. That is the reason why the Chancellor said that recycling money between Europe and the UK may not be the way to go and that it would be better if there were a different European approach. A tighter budget would allow more use of domestic finances to correct imbalances within regions of the UK, which we are already doing. That is not putting regional development on one side; the alternatives are not simply European funding or nothing.
</p>






<p><a name="st_43"><a name="51011h02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Jones </b> : I am sorry, but I do not agree. Will the Minister give hon. Members an assurance that if the north-east does not get the &#163;600 million, he will knock on the Treasury&#039;s door and ask for that money? In a moment I will highlight some projects that depended on money in the past, and will depend on money in the future. If the Minister can give the assurance that I ask for, many hon. Members from the north-east will go away very happy.

<p><a name="st_44"><a name="51011h02_spnew9"><b> Alun Michael </b> : It is not a matter of my giving assurances in the Chamber today. I ask my hon. Friend to look at the Chancellor&#039;s comments on the future of European funding and at our arguments about needing a tighter, more focused European budget as the focus of the European Union shifts, as it must do, to the improvement in economic activity in the poorest regions, and especially in the poorest countries.
</p>






<p><a name="st_45"><a name="51011h02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Jones </b> : I hear what the Minister says, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool said, the north-east will lose &#163;600 million. If that were to happen in Wales, no doubt the Taffia would make a big song and dance about losing &#163;600 million. I would like the Minister to say that if the north-east loses that money, it will get it from another source. As I will explain, some projects need funding as they affect the long-term regeneration of the north-east. The north-east is still on the bottom of the pile and if we want to change that, we need the investment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para26"><a name="stpa_139">I recognise that the Minister is a Welsh Member, but I hope that he will also lobby hard for the regions of the north-east, which desperately need Government investment if they are to close the prosperity gap between the north-east and the rest of the country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para27"><a name="stpa_140">There is a lot of criticism about how European Union money is distributed; the trade unions and others worked together to ensure that the money was directed to where it was needed. That is now being done by One North-East, which I accept had five wasted years under the previous chairman and chief executive, but which is now getting its act together and making strategic decisions about where investment from Europe should go to.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para28"><a name="stpa_141">The money is vitally needed. I should like to cite a few examples of where it has made a difference in Durham. The first are physical developments, which one can actually see, such as Net Park in the Prime Minister&#039;s constituency. My hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool mentioned how we want to change the nature of industry and how it is viewed in the north-east. Net Park does exactly that: it is a 250-acre site for the creation of modern science-based technology and industry, which is coming out of the regional universities. It is getting nearly &#163;900,000 of European funding. Closer to my constituency, in that of my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong), the strategic e-business centre at Consett provides high-class office and factory units for emerging e-businesses. In Bishop Auckland, which comes under Sedgefield council, the national railway museum has attracted funding. Those are three examples of how European funding is being used, helping to diversify the north-east economy, in tourism or e-business.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para29"><a name="stpa_142">Another important aspect of regeneration, which is often forgotten about, is the development of the individual. We can see buildings going up in the north-east as a result of regeneration, but it is less easy to point to the benefits arising from some of the money being used to increase skills and achievement by individuals. I can cite a couple of projects in Durham, which are improving participation and achievement by 14 to 19-year-olds. The key strategy, which is now in place with the learning and skills council in County Durham and Durham county council, is to get such people into 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 30WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
employment and raise their aspirations. It has ensured that 16-year-olds can achieve level 1 and 2 qualifications. It is about giving people hope.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para30"><a name="stpa_143">There is also a problem in parts of my constituency that have high levels of adult illiteracy. The County Durham project, return to learn, has targeted those hard-to-reach individuals who have limited or, in some cases, no literacy or numeracy skills. To date, 1,300 individuals have been helped: that is 1,300 lives that have been changed directly by European funding. When we have bigger debates about Europe, people should remember those issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para31"><a name="stpa_144">Finally, one project in my constituency, the Mace Base/Impact project, is trying to target youngsters aged 13 to 16 who display not only low achievements and aspiration but low attendance at school. Some show school attendance below 50 per cent. The project has so far helped 480 young people into vocational education and experience and given them careers advice and hope. In a lot of communities across the north-east, it is all about giving people hope and the confidence that they have a place in the world, whether in the north-east or a wider market.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para32"><a name="stpa_145">European structural funds have been important in reducing long-term unemployment, widening participation in lifelong learning and promoting entrepreneurship. This is not an academic debate, although my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool makes it sound boring and tedious in terms of some of the accountancy-speak. I hope that I have highlighted that it is not only about physical regeneration but about helping individuals. Remember that boring accountants have a role in life in providing assistance to some of the most vulnerable people in my constituency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para33"><a name="stpa_146">Finally, I would like a guarantee to come out of today&#039;s debate that whether the &#163;600 million comes from Europe or is matched by Whitehall the Minister will lobby hard in Europe on behalf of the north-east and, if that fails, he will ask with vigour for the money to be replaced to ensure that vital projects that have been and will be undertaken in the north-east can continue.

to have a gross domestic product per head of 75.9 per cent. of the average in the former 15 EU member states. If the average GDP in Tees valley and Durham was less than 75 per cent. per head, we would be eligible for statistical effects funding, whatever that might be&#151;it is money, so it is good.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para36"><a name="stpa_149">The GDP of Tees valley and Durham is inflated by a mathematical exercise that says that Great Britain benefits from a 2 per cent. accrual to GDP from offshore oil and gas. The Office for National Statistics puts that in the funny little country called extra regio. I will apply to see whether it has Members of Parliament, I think; I could see myself becoming a Minister quite quickly in extra regio. Heavens above, the EU puts the money out of extra regio, takes away my ambitions, and allocates it across the regions of the UK so that 2.2 per cent. of notional money is added to the GDP of Tees valley and Durham. That is how the figure gets to 75.9 per cent. Fool as I am at mathematics, even I can work out that the true GDP is 73.7 per cent.&#151;below the 75 per cent. figure. It ought, therefore, to bring us the much-needed statistical effects funding. As I understand it, the disadvantage from which we suffer is entirely mathematical.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para37"><a name="stpa_150">The reallocation of extra regio funding in such a way does not have much impact in other countries in Europe. That is an important point, because North sea gas and oil give a high figure for the UK. Figures would not be inflated in such a way, for instance, when considering French regional development contributions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para38"><a name="stpa_151">No calculation that I have seen makes that point particularly clear. I look to the Minister, who is a great master of detail, as he has just shown, to help me. I think that I am right that there is not a 2.2 per cent. accrual to the GDP of Tees valley and Durham from North sea oil. Any profit that comes from North sea oil or any enhancement of our average GDP in Tees valley and Durham is already counted in Tees Valley and Durham&#039;s money, so that the offshore accrual brought inshore is totally artificial.

Eurostat about ESA 95. Eurostat has consistently refused to change the accounting methodology and says that it will not look at it until the next structural funds programme period in 2007. But there are precedents for national Government with a political will, as I am satisfied ours will have, to negotiate special deals for certain areas, particularly those seriously affected by economic decline, as part of the negotiating process in which financial programmes are drawn up. I hope that that process is under way.

<a name="51011h02_para39"><a name="stpa_152">If something is not done, we will suffer serious disadvantage. Much regional funding now comes from domestic funding. It is sensible not to make a major contribution into the EU and then fight for some of it back but to measure our contribution in a more balanced way and keep our domestic resources to supplement the GDP of those that need it. The disadvantage is great, however, at between &#163;500 million and &#163;600 million over the next seven years.

<p>
<a name="51011h02_para40"><a name="stpa_153">I want to reflect what my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham said: this is not about Tees valley and Durham holding out its hand. Historically authorities in London regarded Tees valley and Durham as a hopeless case, the old dosser with a hangover, wearing a raincoat tied up with string with a bottle of brown ale in the pocket, asking for more charity to keep him going. It is not at all like that. We are now a dynamic economy.

<p>
<a name="51011h02_para41"><a name="stpa_154">Last Thursday I had the pleasure of driving a JCB. Hon. Members were safely well away from that operation although they will be relieved to know that I was not allowed to do it on my own. I did so to cut the first bit of soil to found a new &#163;200 million polyethylene plant at Wilton in Tees valley. Huntsman, an American multinational which already has an ethylene plant there, has historically exported its ethylene product which has been processed in a whole range of places in the world into polyethylene. British polyethylene needs have had to be imported again.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para42"><a name="stpa_155">Huntsman could have put that polyethylene manufacturing plant pretty well anywhere in the world because it was already being processed externally. Yet it chose to put it in Teesside. It chose to put it in Wilton in the Redcar constituency because it appreciates that the circumstances there are good. The labour force is strong and committed; the raw materials are readily available; the land is readily available and the Wilton complex itself is a well resourced location with the infrastructure already in place. Huntsman can simply build its fabulous, highly modern plant&#151;the largest for the manufacture of polyethylene in Europe&#151;in Wilton. It is safeguarding 1,700 jobs and will generate more than 400 more, and in the meantime there will be a great deal of construction work. That will add hugely to the sub-regional economy of Teesside. We are dynamic and we can attract such investment. Of course, it was assisted immeasurably by a Department of Trade and Industry grant, which encouraged Huntsman to go there.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para43"><a name="stpa_156">A further major centre of development in my constituency is Teesport. Here, perhaps, I can make the point most strongly about the potential danger from any loss of structural funding through the mathematical quirk. Teesport is the second largest port in the UK in terms of volume and the tenth largest in western Europe. Some 10 per cent. of all traffic through UK ports is handled at Tees and Hartlepool. My hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool and I represent constituencies 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
on opposite sides of the mouth of the River Tees. The port has a unique asset in that it is the only port on the east coast that can take 150,000-tonne vessels and provide direct access to the sea in 30 minutes. The port is very important for the chemical industry&#151;the basic industry at Wilton&#151;in terms of the export of feedstock and the import and export of chemicals themselves. The development of agricultural feedstock in relation to chemicals is helping the port to grow.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para44"><a name="stpa_157">There is a major steelworks in Redcar&#151;the Corus steelworks&#151;which over the past few years has had to change the basis of its functioning. It was an integrated plant. Historically, its slab and its final steels went into Corus itself, but Corus decided that the steelworks at Redcar would no longer be able to do that, that it was focusing its activities on two other sites, in Wales and Scunthorpe, and that Redcar would have to sink or swim as a merchant mill manufacturing its own slab and exporting it on the export market. In fact, the situation has turned around to some extent so that Corus still wants some of Redcar&#039;s steel, but in the immediate future the profile will move away from imports and very much towards exports, with the intention that Corus should export probably about 3 million tonnes of its product over the next few years, in an increasing graph. That will open up more wharfage along the banks of the river and open the potential for an environmental industries park next to the wharf.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para45"><a name="stpa_158">Teesport has an ambitious plan for a deep sea container port, which I am heavily involved in trying to promote. One has to pause and say that if we were a statistical effect region because there was not this mathematical quirk and we were awarded convergence funding, that funding would be available to upgrade road and rail infrastructure. Some constraint on the development of Teesport is imposed by the rail infrastructure, and a programme is needed to develop and improve it. There is a need for 21 in-and-out train paths a day; currently, there is the capacity for only 19 in and out. An internal rail link between Corus and the port is urgently needed to enable the port to deal with the increasing requirement for steel slab, which needs to be exported. Within the next three years, I am told, the rail infrastructure improvements to service the proposed deep sea container terminal will be important. Signal improvements will be needed to cope with all the expansion in rail traffic that the developments require, and a new railhead will be needed at another flourishing industrial installation just outside my constituency&#151;Cleveland Potash, a major potash mine.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para46"><a name="stpa_159">It is important that our dynamism can continue to develop through all those obvious outlets and it is issues such as infrastructure that make all the difference between Teesport flourishing and perhaps not flourishing so fast. The magic key, the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down, is what we are worried about when we consider the mathematical quirk robbing us of convergence funding.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para47"><a name="stpa_160">Today, I am looking for reassurance that the Minister will take on board our situation as an economy that is dynamic but that has a long way to go because of all the depredations over our steel, coal and so on throughout the Thatcher era, and because of the decline in manufacturing generally. We start from a low base, but we are dynamic. I seek reassurance that the Minister takes seriously the need to negotiate for the funding&#151;

How optimistic they are about the negotiations to change the mind of the EU; and can the Minister give us reassurances of the kind asked for by my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham, namely that if there is no change in the method of accounting, so that we remain disadvantaged as a result of a European quirk, the funds will be replaced by our own Government?

<p><a name="st_50"><a name="51011h02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Alan Reid  (Argyll and Bute)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) on having secured this important debate and on the well argued case that he, the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) and the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) have made. I was pleased to hear from an accountant who was able to explain accounting principles in a way that a lay person could understand&#151;I was certainly able to follow his argument.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para48"><a name="stpa_161">It has long been one of the principles of the EU that those regions with a lower than average per capita gross domestic product should benefit from the EU&#039;s structural funds. Such funds have been of great benefit to many UK regions, including the Highlands and Islands. The Tees valley and Durham area has benefited from European regional development funding in recent years. I note that projects such as Cathedral park and the River Green centre in Durham, and community centres such as the Grange villa community centre, have benefited from European money, and the hon. Members from the north-east were able to explain all the other benefits that European funding has brought to that part of the country. European regions with a low GDP are inclined to suffer from the shutdown of traditional industries, and the Tees valley and Durham area follows that pattern&#151;in recent years it has lost many manufacturing, steel and coal mining jobs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para49"><a name="stpa_162">Regions with a low GDP can also suffer from the geographical disadvantage of being far from Europe&#039;s main centres of population, and the European structural fund has an important role to play in creating a level playing field, allowing remoter regions to compete with those at the geographic heart of Europe. Structural funds, as we have heard, can be used to invest in infrastructure, transport and business premises; to give help and support to those seeking to start and develop small and medium-sized businesses; and to train workers&#151;many of whom might have been unemployed for a long time&#151;in the new skills that are needed in the modern world if they are to compete in fields such as computing and internet technology.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para50"><a name="stpa_163">It should be noted that London and the south-east also benefit when structural funds assistance is given to remote parts of the UK. Hon. Members from the south-east seem to be forever complaining about the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s plans for more house building in the region. There is clearly a shortage of housing in London and the south-east for those who want to live and work there, but it has to be borne in mind that many of those who have migrated from other parts of the UK to the south-east have done so because of the lack of job prospects in their home regions. They would have preferred to live, work and spend their lives in the areas 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 35WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
in which they grew up, but economic conditions have forced them to migrate to the south-east, causing the housing problems. Therefore, structural investment in the more remote parts of the UK is important not only for those parts of the country but for London and the south-east. If it were left purely to the market, the whole population would simply move to the south-east and there would be no green grass left there.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para51"><a name="stpa_164">Issues have been raised pertaining to Durham and the Tees valley. Hon. Members have made an important point about the statistical quirk that means that Durham and the Tees valley&#039;s GDP would be under the 75 per cent. threshold that would qualify it for European structural funding were it not for the fact that European statisticians have added on a notional amount for Britain&#039;s oil and gas reserves. I agree that it is entirely illogical to say that Durham and the Tees valley benefits to the extent of 2.2 per cent. of its GDP from Britain&#039;s offshore oil and gas reserves. It is undoubtedly not true that that 2.2 per cent. benefits everybody throughout the UK equally. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the Government are making a case to the European Commission that that notional amount should be excluded from the calculation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para52"><a name="stpa_165">The addition of 10 new members to the EU last year reduced Europe&#039;s per capita GDP. That means that in many regions where the average GDP had been below the 75 per cent. threshold before the 10 new states joined, their GDP is now above the 75 per cent. threshold. It is important to bear it in mind that the economic circumstances in those regions have not changed because of the 10 new regions joining the EU.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para53"><a name="stpa_166">Last year the European Commission proposed an increase in the structural and cohesion funds budget to allow generous transitional arrangements for regions with a low GDP in wealthier member states. However, the Government rejected that model, and they appear to favour a model under which the European structural and cohesion fund would be much smaller, with its resources concentrated in the EU&#039;s poorer member states. Some regions in the UK that might have benefited from transitional funding would not benefit under the Government&#039;s model.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para54"><a name="stpa_167">As the Minister said earlier, the Government have stated that under their preferred model, national Governments would take over responsibility for structural assistance to their own regions with a low per capita GDP. However, the Government have been vague about the detail, and hon. Members pressed the Minister for assurances.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para55"><a name="stpa_168">Before the recess the hon. Member for Hartlepool tried to get information out of the Government, when he tabled a written question asking what estimate the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry

<a name="51011h02_para60"><a name="stpa_173">The hon. Member for Hartlepool understandably feels strongly. He spoke about &#163;600 million being at stake. I felt that the Minister was slightly evasive&#151;am I allowed to say that, Sir Nicholas? That is certainly what the Minister was, but if I were not allowed to say so, I should apologise. He was evasive as to the Government&#039;s response. It was interesting to hear about the extra regio aspects of the matter, about which, clearly, no one has told the Deputy Prime Minister; if they had, he would have wanted an elected regional assembly for somewhere out in the North sea. He has probably recognised that that might be the only place in the country where he could win a referendum on establishing such an assembly. However, the point adds an important element to the debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para61"><a name="stpa_174">The hon. Members for Hartlepool and for North Durham spoke about second and third generations of their constituents living on benefits. There is a question of a new north-south divide opening up. I think that we all welcome the movement of some aspects of government from the cities, and London in particular, to the regions. However, there is a danger that we could go too far down the line of establishing economies in the north that are particularly sustained by public sector jobs&#151;although that professional employment and salaries those bring are important&#151;because of the risk 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
of two separate economies: one in the south predominantly driven by the private sector and wealth creation and the ability to give bonuses and shareholdings to employees; and a rather more static one in the north and the regions. We need to keep our eyes open for that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para62"><a name="stpa_175">I began to get to know the region a little about 15 years ago, when I was a special adviser to the then Minister of Trade and Industry, Tony Newton. I think that he, looking back, would still consider the greatest sadness of his political career the fact that he could not secure the future of shipbuilding in Tyneside and Wearside. People do not, I think, understand how much effort he put into the attempt. It was, in the end, European Commission rules that prevented a rescue package from being put in place.
</p>






<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51011h02_spnew19"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : I also have a long memory. The closure of Swan Hunter at that time was directly down to the Conservative Government, who took a political decision to put the last order for the oil replenishment vessel into Barrow rather than Swan Hunter. I am not quite sure how hard the Minister fought.
</p>






<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51011h02_spnew20"><b> Charles Hendry </b> : Having been party to the many discussions that went on, I think that Lord Newton had a tremendous personal commitment to the continuation of shipbuilding. I do not want to divert the debate in that that direction, Sir Nicholas, because you would rule that out of order, but the rescue package that he wanted to implement was blocked by European Commission rules on what state aid could be given to manufacturing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para63"><a name="stpa_176">I had the chance to see some of the changes about which the hon. Member for Hartlepool spoke in connection with the resurgence of Hartlepool, when I spent a few days there last year. It would perhaps be churlish to point out that I was there trying to prevent him from winning his seat, but a tremendous amount of new investment is under way, a magnificent change that we are all pleased to see. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that that investment goes back beyond the time of the present Chancellor and that credit should also be given to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) for his stewardship of the economy, which was the point at which much of the investment started, and which is one reason for his being so adequately prepared to take on the job that he has applied for.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para64"><a name="stpa_177">I welcome the Government&#039;s engagement in negotiations over the financial framework for 2007 to 2013 and the future of EU structural funding. That is clearly a vital issue and has clearly taken on added importance for the UK since the commencement of our presidency of the European Union. Indeed, that has placed us in the driving seat with respect to future changes. I hope that the Government will take the opportunity to help to maximise the social and economic development of regions across EU member states&#151;something that the structural fund scheme, when administered properly, can play a vital part in helping to achieve.

</p>


<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
which we should be heading&#151;I suspect that the Minister does not agree, but I feel very strongly about it&#151;surely individual member states, rather than EU institutions, know best how regional projects could be developed in the most practical, resourceful and beneficial way. Indeed, that point is acknowledged by the House of Lords European Union Committee in its report. We therefore look to the Minister for reassurances that any reforms will be balanced by the ability of member states to pursue domestic regional development policies. I know that the Minister&#039;s Department is committed to creating added value to the funds. Does he acknowledge that that greater element of flexibility is a means by which that could be achieved?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para66"><a name="stpa_179">Stemming from that point, there is also an issue regarding financing and the ability of the richer nations to pursue domestic policies in spite of the money that they are ploughing into the EU budget. As has been said, the statistical effect of EU enlargement is central to that in that it has caused average GDP per head to lower, thus making regions in the original 15 members of the EU relatively wealthier. However, as the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) said, there has been no change in the absolute wealth of those regions. In the case of objective 1 regions, where the qualification criterion is an average GDP per head of less than 75 per cent. of the EU average, we are therefore faced with the prospect that our most-in-need regions will not be guaranteed the same funding as previously. What steps are the Minister and his Department taking to address that? Can he guarantee that, following reform, no UK region will face losing out on previous funds it has received, and can he reassure us that there will be resources for us to support such regions domestically if need be?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para67"><a name="stpa_180">I hope that, equally, the Government will commit themselves to tackling unnecessary bureaucracy and simplifying decision-making processes. That is a vital way forward for improving the value and efficiency of the structural funds scheme. We know only too well from the uncertainty and complications of common agricultural policy reform the effects that bad administration and poor decision making can have on those whom such schemes are designed to help. We would welcome a commitment from the Minister to ensure that any changes are practical, can be carried through smoothly and are communicated properly to individual member states.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para68"><a name="stpa_181">This issue does not just affect the north-east. Constituencies such as mine, in the south-east of England, face huge pressure to build houses because of the economic growth taking place there. Many of us want to see much greater and faster growth in the regions because it will stop the pressure for new house building in our constituencies. EU funding clearly has an extremely important role to play in that and I therefore congratulate the hon. Member for Hartlepool on securing the debate, raising the issue and recognising that it is important not just for his constituency and the north-east region, but for other parts of the country as well.

your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas. It is also a pleasure to respond to the thoughtful and vigorous contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright). He did not just speak as an MP appealing to the pork barrel, although, for the avoidance of doubt, I did hear him say the words, &quot;If there&#039;s money for my constituency, I&#039;m interested,&quot; and who could disagree with that? However, he confronted some real issues about the way in which we deal with European funding and our responsibility to try to promote the economies of regions such as the north-east.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para69"><a name="stpa_182">My hon. Friend rightly referred to the enormous problems experienced by the north-east. They are very similar to those experienced in my constituency and other parts of south Wales. I remember the devastation caused to the economy when the steelworks closed and the difficulty of promoting alternative employment and a more entrepreneurial approach to the development of business right across the spectrum. He rightly stressed the progress that has been made&#151;the 26 per cent. drop in unemployment and the success of other Government policies. It is fair to say that changing the economy in the longer term involves a change of culture as well as simple issues of funding and finance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para70"><a name="stpa_183">My hon. Friend made it clear that he is ambitious for his constituency. As a Government, we want to be even more ambitious for the future. In pursuing that objective, we have devolved vastly increasing sums of money to the regional development agencies. Of those regions, the north-east, as is right in terms of its economic problems, gets the most&#151;in comparative terms&#151;of that contribution. We are also considering&#151;I pay tribute to the way in which the Secretary of State has approached this&#151;the way in which city regions can promote the economy. In other words, we are considering how the city or cities in a region can help to drive the economy. I visited Newcastle recently in my hon. Friend&#039;s company and it was a salutary and challenging experience. We spent some time going along the banks of the Tyne, and I was struck not just by the fact that many areas were a hive of activity during previous industrial periods but by the immense potential there. That potential is being realised in Newcastle and Gateshead but it extends a long way into the former industrial areas along the Tyne.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para71"><a name="stpa_184">We need to promote increased business engagement, which was very much in evidence, as was the partnership between a variety of local authorities in the north-east. I was reassured that the city areas are not seeing the future of the region just as an opportunity for themselves but as an opportunity to work with other local authorities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para72"><a name="stpa_185">I took away from that visit the fact that young people in the area need much greater ambitions. We met very bright young people who love the area but do not think of business as the life for them. We need to take the opportunity, through some of the projects the Government support, to encourage young people into roles of initiative and leadership. I refer particularly to the investment we have made in entrepreneurship education with colleagues at the Department for Education and Skills; the work of Enterprise Insight and enterprise week; the work of social entrepreneurs, which we support and which makes a contribution to the

economy; the work of bodies such as the Manufacturing Advisory Service, which is organised on a regional level and has proved extremely successful in regions&#151;including the north-east&#151;in helping manufacturers to squeeze a greater return out of the work that they undertake; and the promotion of information and communications technology, which has contributed about 40 per cent. of GDP growth in the European Union in recent years.

I say to him that there is a great deal more to apologise about than he seemed to accept. Lord Newton is a very nice man but he was part of a Government that devastated business and the regions of this country, particularly places such as the north-east. I make no comment on the hon. Gentleman&#039;s advocacy of the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) as the leader of his party, but I say to him that, whether he takes a step backwards or forwards in time, it will be a long time before his party is able to overcome the guilt it rightly has for the devastating damage it did to this country and to come to be regarded as a contender for office in future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para75"><a name="stpa_188">I was particularly pleased with the contributions of my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird), although they were challenging. They demonstrated their knowledge and understanding of their constituencies and what is needed for their future success. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) was unable to attend, but she spoke to me about the matter last night and I know that she wanted to be part of the debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para76"><a name="stpa_189">In an intervention, I pointed out that the UK is a net contributor to the EC budget. That means that all receipts from the EU come at a cost to the UK taxpayer. It is not free money: we currently contribute about 1.6 euros for each euro we receive. The message that I take from that is that we should make sure that every euro that comes into this country is well spent and should look for better ways of doing things in the longer term. Indeed, change has already taken place. We have significantly increased domestic spending on regional policy across the UK, focusing resources on drivers of productivity, such as skills, infrastructure, enterprise and new technology. Structural funds have played an important part in that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para77"><a name="stpa_190">In Durham and Tees valley, we have committed more than &#163;300 million in grants as part of the current objective 2 programme. The money has been used to support 800 projects, representing more than &#163;520&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million of investment and the creation or 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
safeguarding of 30,000 jobs. The funds have been used to drive forward initiatives such as the Business Link County Durham project, which has assisted 938 small businesses, the Cathedral Park project, which has been mentioned and which has developed brownfield land in Durham for local businesses, and the Middlehaven project, which will provide essential infrastructure for Middlesbrough. All those are important.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para78"><a name="stpa_191">However, domestic programmes play an increasingly important role in the region&#039;s regeneration. County Durham&#039;s urban and rural renaissance project has focused on addressing development opportunities and improving neighbourhood infrastructure. The incubator initiative at Queen&#039;s Meadow business park offers integrated services for promoting business creation and growth. The West Middlesbrough Trust has gained more than &#163;3 million for housing renewal.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para79"><a name="stpa_192">Domestic spending in the form of national programmes and co-financing for structural funds plays by far the most important role in our regional development. I accept that it is sometimes difficult to disentangle what is domestic and what is European money, but the important point is that domestic spending&#151;this is a fact&#151;now plays the most important role.
</p>






<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51011h02_spnew21"><b> Mr. Iain Wright </b> : Hartlepool has been a huge beneficiary of domestic regeneration funding, including neighbourhood renewal funding and the single regeneration budget. Last week, the Government announced that Hartlepool had received &#163;9.2 million to pump into the town&#039;s most deprived wards. That is all very welcome, but the fact remains that, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) said, there is &#163;600 million on the table and we are not allowed it because of a statistical quirk. That is the point that I want the Minister to address. Will the Government pledge to fill that gap as far as possible?
</p>






<p><a name="st_58"><a name="51011h02_spnew22"><b> Alun Michael </b> : My hon. Friend is wrong: there is not &#163;600 million on any table anywhere&#151;there are calculations that can be made about the likelihood of returns. The point that I am making to my hon. Friend is that for every euro&#151;or, for that matter, every pound&#151;of European funds spent in this country, we have to spend another &#8364;1.6 or another &#163;1.6. It is important to bear that in mind when we come back to the key point that I was trying to make to set out the context for our consideration of European funding: three quarters of public spending on regional development in the UK already comes from domestic sources.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para80"><a name="stpa_193">Under any scenario, that proportion is set to increase further in the near future. The enlargement of the EU following the entry of 10 poorer countries means that EU regional funding will inevitably and, I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree, rightly shift to those new member states. That situation requires a fundamental reappraisal of EU regional policy, which is what the Government have been trying to promote in debates in Europe. We are determined to push for an effective reform that delivers a good result for the UK as well as for the EU as a whole.
</p>






<p><a name="st_59"><a name="51011h02_spnew23"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : I am not quite sure what point the Minister is trying to make. The advantage of European structural funding for the north-east is that there is no 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 42WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
need to go through the competition that would be required if the funding were allocated through Whitehall. The important point, however, is that the Minister said that the &#163;600 million is not on the table. Well, I am sorry, but I have got news for him. There are people in the north-east who have projects based on that figure, and those projects are costed and out there. If the money is not there, those projects will not go ahead. I cannot understand why it is so difficult for the Minister to give a commitment to plug the gap if it actually appears.
</p>






<p><a name="st_60"><a name="51011h02_spnew24"><b> Alun Michael </b> : I confess that I cannot understand why my hon. Friend finds the point so difficult. The budget has not been agreed, so there is no money on the table. The rules under which money is to be allocated were being debated in Brussels yesterday; indeed, I took part in wide-ranging discussions about them. It is not a question of there being a bag of money on the table that is somehow being denied by the Government. That familiar argument is sometimes used when people have calculated a figure based on a set of assumptions that may or may not come about who then say, &quot;That money is being denied us by an evil Government.&quot; That argument is heard more frequently from Opposition Members than from one&#039;s own side, but I want to make it clear that there is not a bag of money waiting to be collected from Europe, provided the Government remove an obstruction. It is not true. It is mythology. It is made up. I shall not go there.
</p>






<p><a name="st_61"><a name="51011h02_spnew25"><b> Mr. Jones </b> : I do not agree with the Minister. Will he come to the north-east and tell those councils and organisations that have predicated their projects on getting EU funding in this round that they cannot have the money? If it does not come from Europe it will have to come from somewhere else. It is not acceptable for the Minister to say that the money is not there and that we are making it up. Organisations need that money, and if the gap is not to be filled by Europe, it will have to be filled by someone else.
</p>






<p><a name="st_62"><a name="51011h02_spnew26"><b> Alun Michael </b> : I sigh deeply because my hon. Friend must accept the fact that there is no budget and therefore that a sum of money is not waiting. We believe that the proposals made by the European Commission are excessive and bad for the UK; as a result, the level of EU funding is being debated. Once the level of funding is decided, a debate is to be had on how that funding should be allocated.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para81"><a name="stpa_194">Let us go a little further on the question of reform of the wider EU budget. As the Prime Minister made clear in his speech to the European Parliament in July, we are committed to working towards a deal on the EC budget during our EU presidency. However, it has to be the right deal; it must equip the EU for the challenges of the 21st century, and it should respond to the needs of the 10 new member states post enlargement.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para82"><a name="stpa_195">We face a major competitive challenge from countries such as China and India. In those circumstances, we question whether it is right for the EU to continue to spend 40 per cent. of its budget on agriculture and to focus 50 per cent. of its structural fund budget on the older, richer member states. For that reason, we have made a case for a fundamental review of the EC budget during the next financial perspective in order to focus on 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 43WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
areas where EU intervention will create genuine added value and where the budget is likely to have the greatest impact. We are looking beyond the 2007 financial perspective, but it is time to take a longer look if we are to succeed in getting a more efficient and effective Europe.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para83"><a name="stpa_196">My hon. Friends the Members for Hartlepool and for North Durham referred to the theoretical figure of &#163;600 million. Again, I underline the fact that the Government set out the detailed methodology for applying a guarantee of domestic contribution to regional development funding in a written answer on 11 December 2003. If our proposals for reform were to be accepted, we would increase the domestic resources available for regional policy by the amount that our regions would have received had the current arrangements for allocation of structural funds been applied under a no-reform scenario with an EU of 25 member states.
</p>






<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51011h02_spnew27"><b> Vera Baird </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>






<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51011h02_spnew28"><b> Alun Michael </b> : Perhaps my hon. and learned Friend will let me finish dealing with the point; she can then address what I have said.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para84"><a name="stpa_197">The information is in the public domain&#151;it has been put to Parliament more than once&#151;yet we still revert to theoretical bags of money. It is not possible to calculate the exact value of the guarantee at this stage, just as it is impossible to calculate the exact value of future structural fund receipts under different reform scenarios. Structural funds are allocated by reference to statistics on regional economic performance across the EU for the most recent three years prior to the programming period for which data are available. Indeed, what my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool said about how the figures are calculated is salient at this stage, because until the budget and the rules that are to apply are fixed and known, all figures are theoretical.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para85"><a name="stpa_198">In order to calculate the value of the guarantee it will be necessary to know data such as the GDP and employment statistics for the whole of the EU available for the most recent three years prior to the start of the next programme period in 2007. I say that again because the figures for one region have to be set against the figures for regions across the EU. It is likely that the most recent data will be for 2001 to 2003, and they will not be available until the end of 2005 at the earliest. Again, it is impossible to make meaningful estimates at this stage.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para86"><a name="stpa_199">The guarantee will be subject to the same additionality requirements as the current structural fund allocations to ensure that the new money does not replace pre-existing structural expenditure, which means that the guarantee will be additional to the Government&#039;s current domestic expenditure on regional development, including the domestic resources used to co-finance the structural fund&#039;s programmes in the region.
</p>






<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51011h02_spnew29"><b> Vera Baird </b> : I appreciate what the Minister is saying about there being no budget overall. However, my 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 44WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
understanding from the joint strategy unit&#151;the Tees valley-wide joint strategy body&#151;is that the amount of European funding at stake, as its director is quoted as saying, is up to &#163;500 million over seven years to support vital economic development and regeneration projects. I appreciate that we cannot count on that, with its decimal points perfectly in place, while the budget is still undetermined, but my right hon. Friend is casting his net quite wide when he talks about long-term changes in the budget and says that we cannot really rely on a penny until we have sorted everything out. I wonder how realistic that is.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para87"><a name="stpa_200">I want to make one further point: the guarantee that funding of this kind will be replaced by domestic sources on the same basis as it is made available from the EU means that the accounting quirk will still be against us. Is that what the Minister wants?
</p>






<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51011h02_spnew30"><b> Alun Michael </b> : My hon. and learned Friend mixes two things. First, we want the statistics on which any calculation is made to be the best possible, which is why we made representations to the Commission about how the calculations are made, as I said earlier. I agree with the points that were made earlier; my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool made a specific point in addition to the matter of the extra regio money, which I am not entirely sure that I understand. However, I will be happy to look at the detail with him later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para88"><a name="stpa_201">My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar said that people who have spoken to her say that there is &quot;up to&quot; &#163;500 million available. It is easy to use that phrase, but what does it mean? It depends on a series of conditions. We know that the north-east requires the greatest help among the regions of England that require help of different kinds, and will therefore be the greatest beneficiary. However, we cannot put a figure on that at this stage. We are not talking about the long-distant future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para89"><a name="stpa_202">I have talked about two things: first, how the figures will be calculated for the 2007&#150;2012 period and, secondly, about the need for a major overhaul of EU funding and how that is done, as the Prime Minister set out in his speech. We want it to start early and not to wait until the end of the next period so that yet again we are in debates a year or two before the start of a new financial perspective about how the new arrangements will work. People need a longer perspective on how support is provided.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para90"><a name="stpa_203">We have made considerable advances already on the matter of statistics. The Commission published its revised draft regional aid guidelines in July. In line with our representations on the Commission&#039;s original text, the new proposals are much more flexible: 23.5 per cent. of the UK will fall within the assisted areas compared with only 9 per cent. in the initial proposals. If those changes had not been made, the guidelines would have excluded the possibility of any coverage of the north-east. I am happy to go into greater detail if my hon. Friends want me to, to underline the fact that there are ongoing negotiations in which we are achieving success, not only on some of the great strategic issues but in some of the detailed arguments and on statistical issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para91"><a name="stpa_204">The difficulty at present is that the member states refuse to agree to the EC budget in June under the Luxembourg presidency. That budget was higher than 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 45WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
we had advocated at the 1 per cent. level but considerably lower than the large increase for which the Commission had argued. It is incorrect to assume that the Commission&#039;s proposal has been agreed, which must be the basis for the &#163;500 million-figure that is being bandied around. We must bear it in mind that if that figure or anything like it were to obtain, we in the United Kingdom would pay &#163;1.60 for every &#163;1 coming in and would be greatly constrained in the provision of money for additional domestic regeneration which we have greatly expanded, particularly into the funding of the regional development agency.
</p>






<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51011h02_spnew31"><b> Vera Baird </b> : The Minister is making a clear point about the cost of funding.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para92"><a name="stpa_205">I am anxious about the second point that you allowed me to raise, Sir Nicholas. If the Government&#039;s undertaking is to replace moneys that would otherwise come from this budget, on a like-for-like basis for eligibility the suggestion is clear that the mathematical quirk that excludes Tees valley will continue because the Government will replicate the existing rules. That worries us and that is what the debate is about. Can the Minister help us?
</p>






<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51011h02_spnew32"><b> Alun Michael </b> : No, I think my hon. and learned Friend is wrong. Such matters are inevitably complex. First, the guarantee is based on the response to our proposals, and we have passed to negotiation, trying to get as close as possible to our proposals and away from the Commission&#039;s inefficient and expensive proposals. Like for like would have applied if the existing set of rules had applied next time, compared with what we want rather than looking backwards to an earlier period. The statistical anomalies are neutral as regards the way forward we are arguing for.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para93"><a name="stpa_206">On the accuracy of statistics on regional and economic performance in the UK, in addition to discussing Eurostat&#039;s methodology for allocating extra-regio output, my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool questioned the accuracy of statistics on regional economic performance in the UK. The Office for National Statistics is responsible for providing Eurostat with that information and makes use of the best available data and methods that have been agreed throughout the EU to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. However, I am happy to look at any specific anomaly or concerns that my hon. Friend may have and to ensure that they are fully discussed with the Office for National Statistics.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para94"><a name="stpa_207">The reform negotiations to date have been important. The Commission proposed a major increase in its budget, advocating a major 30 per cent. real-terms expansion in the structural funds budget from &#8364;257 billion in the current cycle to &#8364;374 billion for the next EC financial perspective. It proposes to focus on three new objectives: a convergence objective for regions with GDP below 75 per cent. of EU average, a competitiveness objective for richer regions, and a co-operative objective to finance cross-border co-operation projects, which is likely to focus more on better-off areas in better-off states.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para95"><a name="stpa_208">There has been good progress on negotiations to date, but a number of key issues remain to be resolved. More importantly, we still need to reach a settlement on the overall size and focus of the structural funds budget. We also need to reach agreement on a number of technical rules for future programmes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para96"><a name="stpa_209">I spent much of yesterday with Commissioner Danuta H&#252;bner and representatives of the Committee of the Regions and the European Parliament discussing the implications of some of the rules that we are discussing. It is important to understand that at the moment, while we hold the EU presidency, we have the obligation to try to reach an outcome and we are determined to make swift progress towards an agreement, while at the same time maintaining a firm national position on the size and focus of the spending of structural funds, and arguing for a disciplined and sustainable structural funds budget consistent with an EC budget of 1 per cent. of EU gross national income. The argument about the guarantee in the statement relates to the wish to achieve an outcome.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h02_para97"><a name="stpa_210">Our discipline proposals would ensure that the EU&#039;s limited financial resources were carefully targeted at the poorest countries and the poorest regions in those countries where EU intervention is likely to have the greatest added value. We are acutely aware of the difficulties faced by this country&#039;s poorer regions and of their development needs. That is why such regions remain a priority in our work and why an unprecedented guarantee was included as an accompaniment to our proposal on how EU funding should be developed. I assure colleagues that the needs of Durham, the Tees valley and the whole north-east are a high priority in my work with the RDAs and for the Government as a whole.

<a name="time_15">
<a name="51011h03_time0"><h5>12.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51011h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough)</b>  (Con): I should like to begin by thanking Mr. Speaker for kindly granting me the opportunity to have a debate on the Rushden fire service and by thanking you, Mr. Taylor, for chairing the debate. I should also like to thank the Minister for attending to respond to it. This is probably the first time that there has been a debate in Parliament on Rushden, and I am grateful that I have been given the opportunity to highlight one of the most important issues affecting the town and the surrounding area in my constituency.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para0"><a name="stpa_211">I am pleased to welcome to the Palace of Westminster Councillors Allan Bailey, Ron Pinnock, Mrs. Pinnock, Paul Bell and Steven North, who have been instrumental in highlighting the issues, and Steve Mason, Gary Mitchell and David Limer, who are local firefighters.
</p>






<p><a name="st_70"><a name="51011h03_spnew1"><b> David Taylor  </b> (in the Chair): Order. I remind the hon. Member that it is not strictly in order to refer to people outside the debate.
</p>






<p><a name="st_71"><a name="51011h03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bone </b> : Thank you, Mr. Taylor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para1"><a name="stpa_212">I should like to pay tribute to the superb job that firefighters do in my patch and around the country. They risk their lives day in and day out for us, and the hugely important job that they do should be noted. Our instinct would be to run away from a terrorist attack, but the firefighter&#039;s instinct would be to run towards it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para2"><a name="stpa_213">Rushden lies in the east of the Wellingborough constituency and is a largely urban area. Rushden fire service serves the towns of Rushden and neighbouring Higham Ferrers and Irchester as well as several towns and villages outside the constituency. Rushden has the only full-time fire station in the whole of east Northamptonshire. It is home to Northamptonshire&#039;s incident response unit, which is manned by the whole-time, professional firefighters in Rushden, and which would be used to respond to a chemical, biological or other terrorist attack in the area or as a back-up to the incident response units in London should there be a large-scale attack in the capital.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para3"><a name="stpa_214">Rushden, Higham Ferrers and Irchester have a population of more than 40,000 people. The huge increase in development that is about to take place in the county will mean many more new homes in the area and increased traffic on the roads, all of which require a fire service at Rushden fire station that has a 24-hour guaranteed turnout. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister declared that an extra 167,000 homes are to be built in Northamptonshire during the next 20 or so years, and 10,000 are to be built in east Northamptonshire. There is also a huge ongoing project to develop thousands of homes in east Wellingborough, which is beside Rushden.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para4"><a name="stpa_215">At a time when Rushden and the surrounding areas are set to grow rapidly, we should be thinking about more fire cover provision, or, at the very least, what is in place at present, but certainly not a reduced fire service. Is it not in the interests of all those who live in and who will migrate to the area to have the satisfaction of knowing that, should they need it, there is 24-hour guaranteed turnout for a fire engine from Rushden 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 48WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
station? I should be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s view later in the debate, but it certainly seems that any talk of reducing a service while the population who need to use it is growing is ludicrous.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para5"><a name="stpa_216">Given the plans for huge expansion in Northamptonshire, will the Minister tell us what plans there are to expand the fire service in the county, with particular reference to east Northamptonshire and Rushden? What guarantees are there that that will be done before the development of the extra homes? Can the Minister guarantee that proper infrastructure will be in place beforehand?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para6"><a name="stpa_217">Last year, the previous administration of Northamptonshire county council proposed to cut fire cover in Rushden. Under the current system, if a pump from Rushden fire station is required, a full-time, professional team is guaranteed to turn out 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The fire station operates two watches of seven full-time firefighters, who rotate in shifts for four whole days and nights. Those watches are required to turn out at any time of day or night. It is often at night that the most deadly fires occur.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para7"><a name="stpa_218">Rushden operates a second pump, which is manned by part-time, retained firefighters. It is used for incidents that need more than one fire engine, when the first pump has already been called out, and if another area, such as Wellingborough, requires a back-up pump. Part-time, retained firefighters are not required to turn out if the second pump is needed. There is a huge countrywide problem in recruiting part-time, retained firefighters, as most retained firefighters are already in full-time employment and become part-time retainers as a supplementary job.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para8"><a name="stpa_219">There is a particular problem recruiting retained firefighters in Rushden because the decline of the manufacturing industry in Northamptonshire means that people who used to work locally have to travel further to work and are unable to devote as much time to becoming part-time firefighters. Will the Minister acknowledge that fact and tell us the number of retained firefighters in Northamptonshire and in Rushden 10 years ago, five years ago and now? Will he also tell us what the establishment for retained firefighters is for Northamptonshire and for Rushden, and how far short we are of that number today? At Rushden, there is meant to be a complement of about 15 retained firefighters but the station is currently running with about seven. Recently, the second pump at Rushden was not manned for 14 days and nights due to the lack of retained firefighters.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para9"><a name="stpa_220">Retained firefighters do a hugely important job, and their efforts must be noted, but if there is no guarantee that they can turn out, a full-time professional team is surely needed in the interests of community safety. Unfortunately, that is not how the previous administration at the county council saw things. It proposed to cut the number of full-time, professional firefighters from 14 to eight, who would operate one watch only&#151;from 9 to 5, Monday to Friday. In the evenings and at weekends, the people of Rushden, Higham Ferrers, Irchester and east Northamptonshire were to rely on part-time, retained firefighters to man the first pump, but, as we know, the retained firefighter system does not guarantee that a pump will turn out.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para10"><a name="stpa_221">What would happen if the recent situation in which there was no retained pump for 14 days and nights were to occur under the new proposals? A pump would have to be called out from a neighbouring fire station such as Wellingborough, which would increase the time it took for the fire engine to reach the incident. What if that fire engine were already being used? If there were no other pump in the area to respond at that time, the people affected would have to wait until one became free, but when a house is on fire, or there has been a serious road accident, time counts. Time can be the difference between a minor house fire or a major one. Time can be the difference between living or dying. One reason given as to why the Government are pushing through the regionalisation of control centres is to reduce response times so that fire engines can respond to incidents more promptly. It would certainly seem at odds with that that the previous Labour Administration&#039;s proposal would almost certainly increase incident response times. I am sure that the Minister will respond to this obvious anomaly later in the debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para11"><a name="stpa_222">Much has been made of risk assessment and prevention as reasons to cut fire cover in Rushden. Yes, we need smoke detectors, but we need both prevention and reaction. We cannot have one without the other. Smoke detectors cannot put a fire out or cut someone out of a car when there has been a road traffic accident. Does the Minister think that road traffic accidents, arson attacks and house fires will decrease when we have more houses? I suggest that they will increase.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para12"><a name="stpa_223">The proposals would give the people of Rushden a guaranteed turnout between 9 and 5 on weekdays, but no such guarantee at any other time. That simply is not good enough. Calls for fire engines in the area have doubled since 1995. In that year, there were 10 road traffic accidents and 17 property fires. In the first nine months of this year, there were 42 road traffic accidents and 51 property fires.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para13"><a name="stpa_224">The main driver for the proposals was to save money&#151;about &#163;300,000 a year. To save money at the risk of losing lives does not sound right to me. Surely the county council could have looked for savings elsewhere rather than through cutting front-line services. Let me give hon. Members one example: the county council operates a spin department of over 15 people, which costs more than &#163;500,000 a year. Yes, 15 spin doctors cost &#163;500,000 a year. If I were to ask the people of Rushden whether they wanted fewer firefighters or fewer spin doctors, I know the answer I would get.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para14"><a name="stpa_225">That, unfortunately, is a symptom of Labour administration. There is more and more spin, not enough listening, and a cut in core public services. After the 2001 general election, Mr. Taylor, I felt that many politicians of all parties had become arrogant and out of touch. We are more than happy to preach to people, but we are not prepared to listen. I founded the Listening to Wellingborough and Rushden campaign, which aimed to seek the views of local people, groups and organisations and then campaign on their behalf for change. I listened to local people at every opportunity through surveys, attending public meetings, visiting residents and them coming to me. People were crying out for someone to listen to their views and concerns, and then to do something about them. It pays to listen to the views and concerns of the people whom we represent on how we can improve their local services&#151;
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 50WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the services that they pay their taxes for and for which, rightly, they expect something in return. While tax continues to rise, people do not expect their services to be reduced, especially those services that are in the business of saving lives. That is what the debate is really about. It is about a fire service, which if cut as the Administration had proposed to do, would put lives at risk.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para15"><a name="stpa_226">In October 2002, as part of my listening campaign, I went to listen to firefighters on the picket line at Wellingborough, which is the neighbouring fire station to Rushden. I learned from talking to them that, although the firefighters believed that the Government have been economical with the truth, they also felt that the Fire Brigades Union was not being frank with me. I would not have known that had I not gone to listen to them. Although I do not agree with strikes, I knew that those firefighters were heroes before the strike and would be heroes after the strike, and I owed it to them, as local heroes, to listen to their views. Therefore it was as a co-ordinator of the Listening to Wellingborough and Rushden campaign that I found out about the proposals to reduce the fire cover at Rushden fire station.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para16"><a name="stpa_227">In August 2004, I went to see the firefighters about the issue and was horrified to learn about the proposed cut. Overnight, we produced 15,000 leaflets that informed local people of the proposed changes. Ten thousand of those were delivered by local firefighters and their families; the remainder were distributed by Conservative activists, who all pulled together to ensure that the residents were made aware of what was happening to their fire service. People who had never previously been involved in politics helped us to ensure that the message got out.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para17"><a name="stpa_228">I passed the information that we received up through the shadow Cabinet, so that it was aware of what was happening. I had discussions with the Leader of the Opposition and received his support. In October 2004, I was able to present the petition we raised to the leader of the Conservative party. The local firefighters organised their own petition and set up street stalls, and the listening campaign also supported those efforts. We sent the petition to the county council to inform it of the huge depth of feeling among people who did not want to see their fire service reduced. We produced and delivered a newsletter to all homes in Rushden and Higham Ferrers that explained what the listening campaign had been doing on their behalf.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para18"><a name="stpa_229">That was direct democracy at work&#151;asking the people for their views and feeding that information back to those who made the decisions. The county council took a different view, however. It put out a glossy propaganda sheet that, in keeping true to the nature of spin, dealt with everything except the real issue. That was the county council&#039;s form of consultation with the public. Yes, it organised a public meeting but in a different town&#151;it was not held in Rushden. Therefore the listening campaign organised its own meeting. People in the town came along&#151;it was an opportunity for firefighters, local councillors, cabinet members of the county council, and the chief fire officer and his team to get together to discuss the issue. But that did not work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para19"><a name="stpa_230">The Labour county councillors took the proposals to the full council meeting in March. Every Labour member voted for the cuts, while every Conservative

<br>&nbsp;<br>
member opposed them. The cuts went through; after that we were into the general and local government election period. Rushden fire service became a key issue in both elections, and it was during that time that democracy was really at work. The issue was debated thoroughly in the media and in leaflets. At the beginning of the campaign, the Conservative party chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), visited Rushden firefighters. He took the information that he had found out back to inform the shadow Cabinet, and suggested that the Leader of the Opposition visit the town to see for himself what a devastating effect the cut would have.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para20"><a name="stpa_231">During the general election, both the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister visited Rushden. However, while the Prime Minister did not leave the confines of a local leisure centre, the Leader of the Opposition went and met the people of Rushden. He talked to them on the high street, and he specifically set time aside for a meeting with Rushden firefighters. When it came to the election, democracy proved to work. Overwhelmingly, the towns that were affected by the cuts to Rushden fire service moved towards the Conservatives. We gained two county council seats in Rushden, so we now hold all three. The Conservatives gained a county council in Irchester, and held the seat in Rushden.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para21"><a name="stpa_232">What I have described is a demonstration of democracy in action at its very best. We had an issue, we had the arguments, we had the debate, and ultimately, the people decided what they wanted, and they voted for it. David took on Goliath and won. It shows that, in this day and age, people can still change things, peacefully, democratically, by working together. I doubt whether there has ever been a time before where firefighters, the Fire Brigades Union, the Tory party and uncommitted people have worked together to change something. That restores my faith in democracy and shows what can still be done.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para22"><a name="stpa_233">There is now a new Conservative administration at county hall, very ably led by councillor Jim Harker. Conservatives on the county council have honoured their commitment, which was made before the election. There has been no cut to the service at Rushden fire station, and the new administration has set up a review, so that the decisions about the safety of our community can be properly made. The review is being led by Councillor Liz Tavener, who is the cabinet member for public protection, and a scrutiny sub-committee has been set up to review Labour&#039;s cuts, led by one of the new county councillors for Rushden, Councillor Andy Mercer. He played an important part in the listening campaign, and was part of the debate, and has turned out to be an excellent representative for the local community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para23"><a name="stpa_234">I should like to hear the Minister&#039;s views, particularly on the matters that I have raised about the future of the Rushden fire service and east Northamptonshire. In addition, I should like him to comment on the fact that we still have an opportunity in this democracy to change something that the establishment did not want to happen. That shows our commitment to improving core public services through democracy, rather than focusing on spin and propaganda. Our win, both in the general

<br>&nbsp;<br>
election in Wellingborough and at the county council, is an example of a triumph for democracy and action. That is what I fear that this Government try to stifle. It was not the Conservative party that was proved right over the issue at the election; it was the people of Rushden who, given the chance to say what they wanted for their families and their lives, were proved right in the end.

</p>



<a name="time_16">
<a name="51011h03_time1"><h5>12.48 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_72"><a name="51011h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick) </b> : May I say how pleased I am to see you in the Chair this afternoon, Mr. Taylor? I congratulate the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) on securing this important debate, and allowing me to help him to highlight the excellent job that our fire and rescue services do, day in and day out. He has raised his concerns about the issue of protection for Rushden.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para24"><a name="stpa_235">I hope that all hon. Members would welcome the integrated risk management plan approach of the fire and rescue services, because it is designed to respond to the needs of all their constituents and their local communities. It is not Government diktat. During the summer recess, I had the opportunity to visit a number of fire and rescue services across the country, including some in the east midlands last week. Such visits have given me the opportunity to see at first hand the excellent work that is going on locally. I shall try to respond to all of the points that the hon. Gentleman raised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para25"><a name="stpa_236">Let me be clear: the overriding objective of the fire and rescue service is to save lives The Government have set ambitious targets to drive down accidental fire deaths and injuries. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s public service agreement target is to reduce the number of accidental fire-related deaths in the home by 20 per cent. by 31 March 2010, and deliberate fires by 10 per cent. by the same date. That includes a floor target that no local fire and rescue authority will have a fatality rate from accidental fires in the home of more than 1.25 times the national average by 2010.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para26"><a name="stpa_237">The Government have been criticised for setting targets that have been described as too modest. There are those who say that we should have zero tolerance of fire deaths, and I accept that principle. However, we are dealing with the real world, and have set targets that we believe are practical to achieve and will assist fire authorities; then we can move on. We have put in place the framework to enable us to do all that we can to achieve the targets, and that seems to be working. Accidental dwelling fire deaths were down by over 20 per cent. in 2004. However, anybody who has been involved with the fire service over the years knows how volatile fire statistics can be. Until we can see the results replicated over several years, we will not be able to demonstrate that we have a trend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para27"><a name="stpa_238">The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 has put prevention at the heart of the Government&#039;s agenda for improving the fire and rescue service, creating a new duty to promote fire safety. The Government are reforming general fire safety legislation, ensuring that responsibility for safety in non-domestic premises will rest with the person responsible for those premises through the regulatory reform order.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 53WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para28"><a name="stpa_239">The fire and rescue national framework sets out the Government&#039;s priorities and objectives for the fire and rescue service and what authorities should do to achieve them. It provides clear strategic direction from Government while ensuring that authorities are free to make local decisions. To make a difference, as the hon. Gentleman said, the service needs to move towards a culture of effective prevention, alongside its already excellent 999 response&#151;and that is exactly what is happening. The move away from prescriptive national standards to locally designed integrated risk management plans is determining that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para29"><a name="stpa_240">The Government have put the framework in place and we are supporting it through substantial funding for the service. In 2005&#150;06, fire and rescue authorities received an average 3.7 per cent. increase in grant, and no authority received an increase of less than 2.5 per cent. The Government are also investing heavily in a new national network of regional control centres called FiReControl. This morning I laid before the House a statement detailing the locations of those centres, including the last one for the south-east region. We will provide for a new system called Firelink, and the new dimension programme, also mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, has seen us commit an additional &#163;188 million for mass decontamination, urban search and rescue, and high volume pumping equipment in order to improve the capability of the fire and rescue service to respond to major disasters including terrorist incidents. We have made contributions to every fire authority to ensure that that happens.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para30"><a name="stpa_241">Fire and rescue authorities have generally responded well to the challenge presented by the introduction of IRMPs, and have achieved much in a short space of time. That introduction has given senior fire and rescue service managers the flexibility to make decisions about fire cover based on existing and potential risks to their communities, within a strategic framework set by locally elected members. They have long sought that freedom, and they are starting to make the most of it. All fire and rescue authorities are shifting the emphasis from reaction to prevention and, in the process, freeing resources to direct towards community safety activity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para31"><a name="stpa_242">We have heard the hon. Gentleman&#039;s views on the future of the fire and rescue service, on the number of firefighters on the retained duty system in Northamptonshire, and on new housing, which I come to now. It is for local fire and rescue authorities to take account of current and future risks to their communities as part of their IRMP. Those plans should also set out ways in which the authority will work in partnership with its neighbours to address the risks that have been identified. We are reviewing the ODPM&#039;s funding mechanism for local services to help to ensure that funding allocations for major services and infrastructure are provided alongside growth.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 54WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para32"><a name="stpa_243">As part of the three-year settlement process, the ODPM intends to use forward-looking population data, which will benefit authorities that are experiencing significant levels of growth. Indeed, another consultation paper on the distribution of formula grants, which covers this and other issues, was launched in July and finished only yesterday, so this matter is clearly under review, as the hon. Gentleman requested. The Government currently have no specific plans for the future of the fire and rescue service in Rushden or Northamptonshire. We set out our expectations of all fire and rescue authorities in the national framework, and authorities set out plans to tackle effectively existing and potential risks to their communities in their local IRMPs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para33"><a name="stpa_244">The hon. Gentleman also asked about the number of firefighters on the retained duty system in Northamptonshire. My information is that there are 237. That is 16 more than five years ago, but coincidentally exactly the same number as 10 years ago. If the hon. Gentleman requests further information, I will be very happy to write to him.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para34"><a name="stpa_245">The hon. Gentleman also asked about 24-hour turnout. The station in Rushden will still have 24-hour cover. Day crewing will be retained through the night. The Government have put in place a comprehensive and robust framework that will ensure that our fire and rescue services are fit to meet the challenges of the future. That includes locally determined IRMPs that best meet the risks that our local communities face and that offer safety and value for money to local people, and a national network of regional fire and rescue control centres that will increase resilience, cut response times and provide more effective fall-back. Arson reduction strategies are in place, as are youth intervention programmes, home safety fire checks, smoke detector installations, and much more. All will contribute to increasing public and firefighter safety and to creating fire and rescue services that save more lives, including in Rushden and the rest of Northamptonshire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para35"><a name="stpa_246">I am fully confident that the consultation carried out by the local fire and rescue service, as provided by the chief fire officer and approved as recently as this year, will be fit for its task and will protect local people. I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s conclusion that democracy will prevail. I should point out that we have just won a general election and that the British public have decided, but we have withdrawn from dictating to local fire authorities the complexion of their local cover.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h03_para36"><a name="stpa_247">No size fits all. We have moved away from protecting buildings to protecting people. Our joint ambition is to support the fire and rescue service and to cut deaths and injuries. We are confident that that is what is happening, and we are hopeful that we can drive down the number of deaths and injuries. I am very grateful for the opportunity provided by the hon. Gentleman to put my points on the record today.

<a name="51011h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Corporate Social Responsibility</h3>

<a name="time_17">
<a name="51011h04_time0"><h5>12.58 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_73"><a name="51011h04_spnew0"><b> Sarah McCarthy-Fry  (Portsmouth, North)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful for the opportunity to bring to the attention of hon. Members and the Minister the very important issue of corporate social responsibility. In the short time available to me, I shall set out the old narrow view of the responsibilities of company directors, how things have moved on in the 21st century, and why it makes good business sense for organisations not only to accept corporate social responsibility, but to embrace it and make it central to all their strategic decision making. I shall also set out where Government can help to bring all that about.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para0"><a name="stpa_248">Historically, the legal responsibility of the directors of a company has been to maximise shareholder value, either by a return in the form of a dividend or by capital growth, or by a combination of the two. However, it can be argued that that is a very narrow view and that there is a moral and legal responsibility to consider the interests of employees, the local social and environmental impact of doing business, and the impact of company operations on the economy of the whole country and, indeed, globally. The Government are committed to promoting responsible business behaviour as a key part of their sustainable development strategy, which involves both the public and private sectors.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para1"><a name="stpa_249">Corporate responsibility can encompass many things. At the moment, it typically encompasses community involvement in the form of charitable gifts, community investment, commercial initiatives in the community or even just allowing employees to take time off to take part in community volunteering projects. However, it also involves looking at the benefits to the wider community and the environment of a company&#039;s day-to-day business operations, job creation, investment in a region, the taxes that are paid, the goods and services that are provided and general wealth creation in our economy. Increasingly, corporate responsibility is about responsibilities to the whole value chain. Where, for example, are raw materials being sourced? To whom are goods and services being sold?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para2"><a name="stpa_250">Organisations are moving on from being solely responsible to their shareholders to being responsible to a wider group of stakeholders. Who are a business&#039;s stakeholders? It could be those who can influence or who are affected by an organisation&#039;s activities, such as investors or the wider community. It could be those who have an explicit or implied contract with the organisation, such as employees, customers or suppliers. It could be those who possess the information, resources or expertise that an organisation needs to formulate and implement its strategy, such as City analysts and even politicians such as ourselves. We can therefore define company responsibility as a business&#039;s positive impact on society and the environment as a result of its operations, its products or services and its interaction with key stakeholders, such as employees, customers, investors, communities and suppliers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para3"><a name="stpa_251">We might ask why businesses should sign up to such an approach. What is in it for them? Increasingly, corporate value is measured against non-tangible as well as tangible assets. What is a company&#039;s brand or 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 56WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
reputation worth? How quickly can its reputation be lost if the company is seen to be adversely affecting its local environment or ruthlessly exploiting child labour overseas? Let us take the example of diversity. Consider the spending power of people from ethnic minorities, people with disabilities or people from single-parent households. Consider also how a company will attract and retain the best talent. Some 12 per cent. of all new graduates are from ethnic minorities. Surely, that is a reason for organisations to consider their policies on diversity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para4"><a name="stpa_252">The same is true of the environment. Of course, there are legal obligations with which to comply, but in today&#039;s competitive world, with diminishing natural resources and the cost of waste disposal rising, it surely makes sound business sense to consider using recycled packaging and pursuing greater energy efficiency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para5"><a name="stpa_253">Consumers and investors are also becoming much more discriminating. The Government are trying to encourage savings and investment, and more people than ever will be looking at self-invested pension plans and personal pension plans, while all new babies will now have a child trust fund. Parents will be looking for a suitable investment for that fund and for many of them, financial return will not be the only criterion. People have choices and they are exercising them by looking at the ethical background of investment opportunities. That is true not only of investors but employees. According to a survey by Environics, three in five people want to work for a company whose values are consistent with their own.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para6"><a name="stpa_254">Fairtrade certification mainly covers coffee, chocolate and bananas. Brand recognition of Fairtrade is growing, and more than one third of the population now recognises the Fairtrade mark. I know that from my own observations because, for the past few years, I have been going out during Fairtrade fortnight offering free samples of Fairtrade chocolate. In the beginning, people were very suspicious and thought that it would taste different. However, in the last year I went out, many people said, &quot;Oh yes, we already buy Fairtrade&quot; or &quot;Yes, we recognise it.&quot; That is borne out by the Fairtrade sales figures. Since 2001, overall sales of Fairtrade certified products have grown by 83 per cent., and the estimated UK retail value of those sales is more than &#163;140 million. More and more products are gaining Fairtrade certification, and we can now buy Fairtrade wine and even Fairtrade flowers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para7"><a name="stpa_255">A new generation of citizens is learning about sustainable development and the environmental impact of business as part of the national curriculum at key stage 2. That will colour their decisions in the future as adult consumers, investors and citizens. The recent scandals in corporate governance and a raised awareness of environmental and social issues may have led to some loss of trust between business and the general public, and businesses need to work hard to regain that trust. People need a way to measure and compare the environmental and social performance of companies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para8"><a name="stpa_256">Many leading businesses have recognised that and now produce an array of corporate responsibility reports. However, many companies, known as the laggards, just pay lip service to the idea, and that makes it difficult for the general public to distinguish between a company that reacts to issues or crises as they arise and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 57WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
a company that puts corporate social responsibility at its core, involving it in all business decisions. We must also consider the organisations that do not rely on a well known brand. How do we ensure that they take on the wider interests of stakeholders, not just shareholders?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para9"><a name="stpa_257">It will take time for consumer power to create a significant impact. Currently, ethical consumers represent only about 5 per cent. of the population on an active basis, although that proportion is growing. What are we to do until critical mass is reached in that respect? My view is that the issue is too important to be made voluntary. Some regulation is needed. Health and safety is considered too important to be left to a voluntary code. It is a statutory responsibility. Corporate responsibility is too important to be left to a voluntary code.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para10"><a name="stpa_258">There are wide implications to the term stakeholders. We are all, after all, stakeholders in the planet. Climate change threatens us all. Whether or not the recent increased hurricane activity can be directly linked to global warming, it had a devastating effect on the people of New Orleans, and climate change will affect us all in that way if we do not take action soon. As we exhaust our natural resources, it makes sense to conserve what we have for the long term, and not to exploit it for short-term gain.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para11"><a name="stpa_259">We all recognise the importance of sustainable development, but do we all recognise the actions that we need to take to achieve it? Most of us have signed up to the Make Poverty History campaign, but do we know which companies continue to exploit workers in the developing world, on poverty wages, in unsanitary and unsafe working conditions? Are we happy to let subsidiaries of UK firms do that, safe in the knowledge that they have no legal responsibility to tell their shareholders that they are doing so?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para12"><a name="stpa_260">I am aware that the Government have tried to address those issues through the White Paper &quot;Company Law Reform&quot;, but I do not believe that they have gone far enough. I do not think that enshrining in statute the principle of enlightened shareholder value is sufficient. Success is too narrowly defined by financial outcomes. A possible interpretation is that where a conflict occurs between public good such as environmental or employee protection, and the success of the company, members&#039; financial interests must take precedence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para13"><a name="stpa_261">The language in the proposed measure appears a bit woolly, such as in the provision that a director must act in a way that he considers,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para14"><a name="stpa_262">The term &quot;consider&quot; is highly subjective and will be judged differently by different people. Also, directors need only consider members&#039; interests.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para15"><a name="stpa_263">The freedom of companies to operate must be balanced with clear responsibilities to society and the environment. I should like the company law reform Bill to include a statutory duty to affected stakeholders as well as to shareholders. Specifically, there should be a duty for directors to identify, consider, minimise and report on any negative social and environmental impacts caused by a company&#039;s activities in the UK or overseas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para16"><a name="stpa_264">Multinational corporations present distinct challenges to corporate governance, since, effectively, they co-ordinate their activities as an integrated

<br>&nbsp;<br>
economic network that is beyond the boundaries of an individual nation state. We need to look carefully at how to prevent UK companies from taking advantage of weaker regulatory regimes overseas, particularly in developing countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para17"><a name="stpa_265">Finally, we must look at the reporting regime. Although the operating and financial review that is required by UK listed companies is a welcome step in the right direction, it does not go far enough, as it requires company directors to report only in the interest of the company&#039;s shareholders, and not that of affected stakeholders. If the operating and financial review were linked with a duty for company directors to report significant negative social and environmental impacts, and a legal duty to take reasonable steps to minimise those impacts, the reporting would become a management tool for the business. It becomes the building blocks of an action plan rather than just another report for the shareholders.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para18"><a name="stpa_266">The first reports under the operating and financial review are due to be published next year. I should like a working party to be set up with business, the Government and other stakeholders to examine those reports, look at the commonalities and the differences and come up with a standardised benchmark for reporting. I want companies to report on their social impact and ethical behaviour in relation both to their own aims and the aims of their stakeholders. There are many examples of good practice in corporate social responsibility reporting. Let us use those companies that have been the trailblazers; let us show the rest of the business world how it can be done and how it should be done.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para19"><a name="stpa_267">The Government could develop standardised performance indicators, setting out benchmarks and requirements for stakeholder dialogue and public reporting. That could be overseen and monitored by a standards board which could be established as a subsidiary of a company law and reporting commission, building on the role of the Financial Reporting Council. Let us give consumers and investors the power to make informed choices by ensuring that companies present their reports in a standardised way so that people can make meaningful comparisons.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para20"><a name="stpa_268">But regulation and reform of company law are just one way in which the Government can have an impact. Government procurement presents a huge opportunity to act as a lever to encourage business along this road. The UK Government, regional development agencies, local authorities and health service trusts spend more than &#163;17 billion a year in the form of direct contracts, grants and support to start-up businesses.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para21"><a name="stpa_269">Yes, there are legal requirements that have to be met in awarding public contracts but there are still real opportunities to use sustainable procurement to drive change. We need to highlight these opportunities and actively encourage innovative practice. If these public bodies took the lead in setting minimum standards of corporate social responsibility among their suppliers it would send a clear message to the business community. It would help to create a level playing field between the social enterprises who already operate in the interests of the wider stakeholders and those companies that just pay lip service to it. Because of the impact and profile 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 59WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that these public bodies have with members of the public it will also help to raise awareness among ordinary consumers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para22"><a name="stpa_270">In conclusion, if we are serious about sustainable development, corporate social and environmental responsibility needs to be at the heart of business organisation in the UK, and at the heart of UK companies&#039; activities overseas. The impacts are far wider than just here at home. Today, I have outlined two ways in which I feel the Government can act: by reforming company law and by using the enormous purchasing power of public bodies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para23"><a name="stpa_271">It is often said that we are powerless in the face of globalisation and the power of capital. But if we do not do something about sustainable development, the power of capital will be worthless in the face of environmental and economic collapse. The Government cannot act alone; it has to be a partnership, a balance of incentive and regulation. I believe we should start by agreeing the basic premise that a company does not exist in isolation and that capital is only one of the building blocks that adds value. From there it is but a short step to acknowledging that directors should act in the interests of their affected stakeholders as well as shareholders, which in a nutshell is what corporate social responsibility is all about.

<a name="51011h04_time1"><h5>1.13 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51011h04_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Energy  (Malcolm Wicks) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) on securing the debate on this important subject. She mentioned that her constituents were suspicious when she offered them Fairtrade chocolate. I would not be suspicious. Indeed, as I look forward to two one-and-a-half-hour debates tomorrow on energy policy in this Chamber and the Adjournment debate at 7 pm, at about 4 pm I shall be looking for my hon. Friend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para24"><a name="stpa_272">With so much debate surrounding corporate social responsibility it is important to have a clear understanding of what it is, what the Government are doing and where the future might lie. It is clear from my hon. Friend&#039;s introduction to the discussion that it is an important and complex debate, and today will certainly not be the end of it. CSR might seem difficult to define precisely but one would know if one saw it. In essence, it is about how we recognise a good company. A good company in the 21st century takes sustainable development seriously and takes responsibility for its environmental, social and economic impact. We have already referred to the sourcing of materials&#151;timber comes to mind&#151;and the impact on other parts of the world. The horror of child labour is another example presented to us by my hon. Friend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para25"><a name="stpa_273">CSR is, in part, about sustainable development. Given the environmental concerns that have been highlighted, that will grow in importance. It interfaces with good employment or human resource practice. The good company with a social conscience may have been ahead of the Government in terms of what we now call the work-life balance. The good company recognises that employees, including fathers, have children, and puts paternity as well as maternity leave on the agenda. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 60WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
It is a company such as B&Q, which has always practised non-ageist policies in recruitment and does not reject people because they are in their late fifties or sixties while saying &quot;In no way can you get a job.&quot; It takes occupational pensions seriously; it recognises that many in the work force with grown-up children now have caring responsibilities for others. A good company, for social and also commercial reasons, will want to treat those employees seriously.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para26"><a name="stpa_274">CSR covers a range of things, including some of the more traditional social projects supported by many companies, whether in the local community in a one-factory town, or nationally or internationally. The impact of Rowntree, the chocolate company, on one city over more than 100 years since the pioneering report into poverty at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries is a case study, which also partly reminds us that such social programmes are nothing new.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para27"><a name="stpa_275">We would recognise a good company with a social conscience and social responsibility when we saw it. Nevertheless it is worth rehearsing the reasons why business should practise corporate social responsibility. CSR is not only about businesses being more responsible because of the moral and ethical considerations, valuable though such things are. It also enables companies to become more efficient, more profitable and fundamentally more sustainable in the longer term. Improving UK competitiveness and raising productivity are central to our aims as a Government and at the Department of Trade and Industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para28"><a name="stpa_276">Corporate responsibility can contribute to raising competitiveness. Many businesses have found that CSR can lead to a better reputation with customers, which will increase in the decades to come, and improve staff motivation. Most companies say that their biggest asset is their people, and it is common sense that people want to work for organisations of which they can feel proud. That is backed by strong survey evidence as well as the experience of individual companies. For example, one survey showed that 82 per cent. of employees involved in a company&#039;s social responsibility activities would recommend that company as an employer&#151;a great testimonial. In another survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, two out of three graduates said that a company&#039;s ethical reputation would influence their decision to apply for a job. Again, there will be a momentum behind such research findings.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para29"><a name="stpa_277">Government&#039;s role is to create the right framework to encourage high standards of corporate behaviour. CSR must start with compliance with the law, and in the UK we have a strong record of regulation on a range of issues related to corporate activity including health and safety, employment terms and conditions, and environmental protection. We recognise that the regulatory framework will evolve over time to reflect changing circumstances. That represents the baseline for company behaviour. The crunch question is what companies do voluntarily to raise the performance beyond the minimum legal standards.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para30"><a name="stpa_278">I appreciate that there is considerable support for more mandatory measures to ensure company accountability and, although we fully support high standards of business behaviour, we do not accept that a one-size-fits-all approach would necessarily benefit the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 61WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
business community, the environment or wider society. We believe that a more targeted and carefully designed range of policy instruments should be deployed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para31"><a name="stpa_279">Our approach is therefore to provide the right policy environment that sets decent minimum standards while stimulating companies to raise their game and their performance beyond those levels. Getting the balance right is crucial: imposing new burdens on business could hurt competitiveness and stifle innovation, which many businesses are bringing to this subject.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para32"><a name="stpa_280">How do we do that? One basic way in which we can help to create the right balance is by setting out clearly the standards we expect of company directors. The company law reform Bill that will be introduced later during this Session will include a statutory statement of directors&#039; general duties. The Bill will set out for the first time how directors are expected to behave in an authoritative but accessible way.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para33"><a name="stpa_281">In line with the recommendation of the independent company law review, the statutory statement will adopt an approach that the review called &quot;enlightened shareholder value&quot;. Under this approach the basic goal for directors should be the success of the company for the benefit of its shareholders. However, we believe, as the review did, that business prosperity and responsible business behaviour are two sides of the same coin. The duty will therefore go on to say that, in seeking to promote the success of the company, directors must have regard to factors such as the interests of the company&#039;s employees and the impact of the company&#039;s operations on the community and the environment. My hon. Friend discussed some of the implications of that and I am sure that the debate will continue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para34"><a name="stpa_282">That alternative approach, which my hon. Friend supports, would enable or require company boards to override the interests of shareholders where they considered that this would satisfy broader ethical or social considerations. That is the point that the debate has reached. I believe that there are two important reasons why it would not be the best way forward. An extremely pluralist approach&#151;as some call it&#151;would muddy the waters unhelpfully: directors would lack clarity about what they were meant to be doing, and it would in practice be more difficult for anyone to hold directors to account. For example, what should directors do if environmental and employee interests point in different directions? Directors could be put in a difficult, even an impossible position, and all of the company&#039;s stakeholders, including shareholders, would be impotent to challenge their decisions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para35"><a name="stpa_283">We believe that the most effective way to promote responsible business behaviour is to show how such behaviour leads to business and commercial success. If we are not able to do this, there is little prospect of achieving high standards of business behaviour. That is precisely the area where both engaged shareholders and well-informed customers can and do make a difference.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para36"><a name="stpa_284">As my hon. Friend knows we work closely with Business in the Community on a number of initiatives, including sponsorship of its awards for excellence and corporate responsibility. It will have to find a snappier name for that, I suspect. Both programmes illustrate the growth of CSR with more companies participating and the standards of performance increasing year on year.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para37"><a name="stpa_285">Programmes such as Envirowise, funded by the Government, offer advice to business to help improve their resource efficiency. Savings are estimated at over &#163;1 billion to date. As part of the world summit on sustainable development commitment on sustainable production and consumption, the Government have pledged to ensure that the &#163;13 billion of goods and services bought every year for central civil Government are sustainable. That was the second theme of my hon. Friend&#039;s speech.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para38"><a name="stpa_286">In October 2003, the Government signed up to the recommendations of the cross-government sustainable procurement group. Action so far includes ensuring that from 1 November 2003, all new Department contracts apply minimum environmental standards&#151;such as on energy efficiency, recycled content and biodegradability&#151;as well as value for money when purchasing certain types of product. I know that my hon. Friend is aware of that development and will welcome it. Our new goal is to be recognised as among the leaders in sustainable procurement across EU member states by 2009. Greater transparency is vital to building up trust and a reputation. The number of companies that have reported on their performance has already increased significantly over the past few years. UK companies are now among the leaders for quality and quantity in that kind of reporting. They were responsible for seven out of 10 of the top global reports in a recent survey, for example.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para39"><a name="stpa_287">As part of our reform of company law, we have introduced a statutory operating and financial review&#151;as was mentioned&#151;which will play a key role in putting financial statements in the context of a broader discussion and analysis of the business. Following that review, companies need to report on matters such as employees, the environment, and social and community issues, where those are necessary for an understanding of their business. We hope that the review will help to improve transparency through a step change in the quality of company reporting as well as by recognising the potential for intangible and non-financial issues to have an impact on company performance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para40"><a name="stpa_288">One way to ensure that CSR is part and parcel of the way in which we do business is to ensure that the skills and competencies for responsible business practice are embedded right across companies. To help with that, the Government launched a CSR academy to help to develop individual skills and to integrate CSR, in an understanding way, into recruitment, appraisal and the professional development of employees. That is important. CSR needs to be embedded and integrated, rather than being regarded as something that one does during the last half hour of a course. Looking to the autumn, we plan to license promotion of the academy competency framework overseas and we will publish a resource on how to use the framework.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para41"><a name="stpa_289">Much of the CSR debate centres on the impacts of our companies&#039; operations and relationships overseas. I think that it is fair to say that, internationally, the UK is seen as among the leaders in CSR, both in policy and in practice. Given globalisation, the multinational nature of many of our companies, sourcing from abroad and all the things that my hon. Friend mentioned, the globalisation of CSR is vital.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h04_para43"><a name="stpa_291">I welcome the debate on how business can contribute to tackling the challenges that we face. We believe that business prosperity and responsible business behaviour are two sides of the same coin.

<a name="51011h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Local Strategic Partnerships</h3>

<a name="time_19">
<a name="51011h05_time0"><h5>1.28 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51011h05_spnew0"><b> John Hemming  (Birmingham, Yardley)</b>  (LD): I am grateful for the opportunity to consider this issue, which is important throughout the country, particularly given the development of local area agreements and the like. A local strategic partnership, or LSP, is basically a body that brings together the local authority, a number of statutory bodies, and the voluntary and community sector in the local authority area. That is a good idea; partnership working is definitely good. In Birmingham, for instance, the national exhibition centre was established through partnership working. Getting the bodies to work together is good. In Liverpool, there is a scheme called &quot;INclude&quot;. It operates in the Liverpool 8 area and involves various people, including those from the housing association, the council and the police, working out of the same building. They have the same problems, so they work together to solve them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para0"><a name="stpa_292">However, there are some difficulties with the way that things are happening. Many people&#151;too many, to a certain extent&#151;have their fingers in the pie, so the pie tends to get a little overloaded. There is also a difficulty with checks and balances. Some schemes run the risk of mild corruption and conflicts of interest, as was seen with the new deal company in Radford and Hyson Green in 2003. There are many issues related to checks and balances, and the comparative role of, say, a chief executive and elected politicians. Politicians are accountable to the electors and are therefore interested in the wider picture, whereas people representing individual organisations might have a narrower perspective linked to that organisation. It is a challenge to try to bring that together.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para1"><a name="stpa_293">One difficulty in that area is with targets. Everyone goes on about targets, and one must accept that we need a mechanism for measuring things. However, there is an obsessive approach to targets from Government offices for the regions and from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Let us consider the police. One target, particularly in many urban areas, which receive neighbourhood renewal funding and so on, is to reduce the gap between the people who do worst and best. The police in Birmingham, for instance, have done well in reducing car crime. They have reduced it by 10 per cent., but they have not closed the gap. The reason is that most car crime happens in car parks&#151;as all the cars are concentrated in one place, there is more car crime. Unless the car park is shut down, the gap will not be closed. It is a mistake to beat the police around the head because they have not closed the gap.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para2"><a name="stpa_294">Similarly, primary care trusts have a target of reducing the prevalence of smoking by 26 per cent. That is a good idea; I do not want to encourage anyone to smoke. I have never smoked; it is not a good thing to do. How do the PCTs know how many people are smoking? When a little boy goes around the back of the bike sheds to start smoking at the age of 13 or 14, does he first write to the trust to say, &quot;I&#039;m going to start smoking&quot;? When we make our new year&#039;s resolutions, do we write to the trust to say, &quot;We&#039;re going to stop smoking this year,&quot; and, having stopped smoking, to announce, &quot;We&#039;ve stopped smoking&quot;? In reality, it is difficult to quantify certain information.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 65WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para3"><a name="stpa_295">There is another challenge. Someone who runs a project dealing with hard-to-reach youths who come in off the street out of gangs complained to me recently. It is a success to get such youths into a project, but that is not taken into account. It is unfair and unrealistic to beat people around the head because they have not managed the same objectives and targets as one might manage in a leafy suburb of the city. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not distinguish between targets that can be effected by agencies and other targets.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para4"><a name="stpa_296">Unemployment is an important issue, but one cannot expect the local strategic partnership to be responsible for the global economy. If we are to have such targets, they must take into account the health, well-being and quality of life of the community, and the economy. Specific targets should relate to relevant agencies, and they should be part of their own operational plans and hence part of the LSP annual plan. It is unfair to blame the LSP for tornadoes or for companies going bust. The ways things are going the Government would blame the LSP if Martians invaded.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para5"><a name="stpa_297">A further problem is that Government offices for the regions and the ODPM look for direct cause and effect between the spend of relatively small sums of money and major targets. Another difficulty is that the analysis of targets falls into arrears. We are battered around the head about the status of council housing, when the evidence shows that it is moving forward in Birmingham. I know that there is pressure from the Government to get rid of council housing and that therefore if the housing is owned by a registered social landlord it does not fall within the LSP figures and the LSP does not get battered around the head.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para6"><a name="stpa_298">There is another problem with targets. There is no target for having public toilets. The pressure is on local authorities from the Government to close down public toilets. During the past five years, since the Audit Commission decided that it was not important whether areas had public toilets, we have seen something like a 20 per cent. drop in their number throughout the country. The hardest aspect of a project is that some will have an effect on crime and liveability. The effect is difficult to quantify, such that it ticks the boxes when the project goes back to the ODPM.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para7"><a name="stpa_299">The critical path analysis is another problem. It takes a certain amount of time for things to happen. Home-start, which is a perfect scheme in my constituency, supporting families with young children, is in difficulties because it does not know what is happening to its funding next year. No decisions have been taken, because everyone is interfering.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para8"><a name="stpa_300">In Birmingham we operate a scheme in which a lot of funding is devolved to the wards. Our wards are big: they have about 25,000 people in them, including the kiddies. We also involve the local community. I am sure that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe) is aware that we have ward advisory boards. The police and the primary care trust also consider things. However, the pressure from the Government is to stop that, to move away from it and to centralise. That would take away the local allocation of schemes.

<p>
<a name="51011h05_para9"><a name="stpa_301">At the same time, the Government report, &quot;Making it Happen in Neighbourhoods: The National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal Four Years On&quot;, which came out in January and which has the product code 04NRU02643, should people want to find it, states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;The strategy places great emphasis on involving communities. A problem with previous approaches was a lack of involvement of local people. The strategy wants to change this by getting local people to be involved in making decisions. It also aims to encourage agencies to consult residents thoroughly on what services they need and how they can be delivered in the most effective, accessible ways&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.We have learned that while a framework or model like neighbourhood management may help, different areas will need to find their own solutions. The challenges of deprivation are wide-ranging, varying from place to place. So are the solutions. Only locally appropriate neighbourhood renewal is likely to be effective. The delivery arrangements we have put in place are flexible and continue to develop. But at their best they are all about facilitation&#151;enabling rather than controlling regeneration &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The move to super output areas will enable more precise targeting&#151;nationally, regionally and locally&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.This multiple deprivation information is now being used by neighbourhood renewal partnerships up and down the country. They are making sure that their local plans and activities are really focused on neighbourhoods and types of problems that need most attention.&quot;</p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para10"><a name="stpa_302">We are doing that in Birmingham, but we are getting pressure to change, and to reduce the proportion of the spend that goes through the ward and district structure and to centralise more of it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para11"><a name="stpa_303">What happens nationally with funding and the generation of various non-jobs and odd schemes? In 2004, Manchester funded a thing called CowParade, which was part-funded by neighbourhood renewal funding. Let us not be critical about statues of cows dotted around a city for about a month. The project raised some money for charity and so on, but is that really the sort of thing that should have funding from neighbourhood renewal funding, given all the constraints, floor targets and everything else? I do not mind Manchester doing that. It was Manchester&#039;s decision&#151;there is no problem&#151;but it is unfair to bat the city of Birmingham around the head for doing what the Government recommend in their reports, and for civil servants to tell the city to do something else.

<a name="51011h05_para12"><a name="stpa_304">For instance, when I became chairman of the local strategic partnership in 2004, I sat down with the regional director of the Government office for the west midlands, and we identified a few problems and worked out a solution that involved setting up a project board, or sub-committee, of the strategic partnership. But the Government said, &quot;No, you can&#039;t do that. You must have consultants.&quot; I know that the Government have to spend a lot of money on consultants; otherwise, they will not hit their target of about 1p on income tax for consultants. They must use consultants whenever possible. Therefore, we had to have a neighbourhood renewal adviser. A nice bloke came along, talked to everybody, looked at the issues and suggested that we do what we had intended to do in the first instance. A year later, after Government involvement delayed us from doing things, we have finally done them.

<a name="51011h05_para14"><a name="stpa_306">There are tensions between the Government-funded community empowerment network and Birmingham residents associations, and between systems of neighbourhood management and devolved government, which we have been establishing in the city. It is definitely a good idea to use commissioning rather than a bidding system. That is entirely valid, but there is always something nagging away in the background. It is a bit like a gangster coming around to one&#039;s shop and saying, &quot;Oh, those are nice windows. Don&#039;t you want some insurance?&quot; The civil servants say, &quot;We haven&#039;t signed the money off yet. If you don&#039;t do this, you might not get your money.&quot;

<p>
<a name="51011h05_para15"><a name="stpa_307">It is very simple, really. We need some straightforward things from the Government: first, less interference, and, secondly, an understanding of the importance of timeliness. Birmingham is a big city, and changes cause chaos all over the place unless people are given time to adjust. Thirdly, we need straight answers to straight questions. The Government should tell us if something is or is not acceptable.

Gentleman&#039;s attack on the Government, but I would like to put a question to him. He acknowledged that he is the chairman of the strategic partnership, which recently had a poor rating from the independent reviewer. As MP for part of Birmingham, a local councillor and self-proclaimed candidate for love rat of the year, does he not think that he may already have too much on his plate? If, as intended, some of that stuff was left to local people rather than to the hon. Gentleman, with his desire to do all those jobs, we might get a better deal from the strategic partnership.

<a name="51011h05_para16"><a name="stpa_308">The question is whether there is merit in Members of Parliament being involved in the process. I believe that there is. The hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) is chairman of the Hartlepool local strategic partnership. Another Labour MP is being interviewed on Friday for the post of chairman of his local strategic partnership, but it would be unfair to identify him and I do not have his permission to do so. It is sensible for the local authority executive to decide who should chair the local strategic partnership. If the Government were to say that they would take the money from me if I continued to chair it, I should fall on my sword tomorrow. It would not be a problem. Critically, it is a matter of getting better services for the city of Birmingham.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para18"><a name="stpa_310">I congratulate the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) on securing the debate; the subject is clearly important him, his constituents and the wider population of Birmingham. I shall attempt to answer his questions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para19"><a name="stpa_311">I shall start by putting the Government&#039;s policy on local strategic partnerships and local area agreements into context. The local strategic partnerships are playing an increasingly important role in providing leadership in their localities and in securing sustained improvements to the quality of local services. Evidence shows that they are making a positive difference to the delivery of services in many areas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para20"><a name="stpa_312">A key element of that new enhanced role is that LSPs are the engine room for developing local area agreements. The LAAs provide what the hon. Gentleman seeks; they allow greater flexibility for the delivery of local public services with greater devolution, and they give local authorities and their partners the ability to deliver. They also allow greater flexibility in the use of funding streams. Most of all, they ensure that the various organisations in health and education, the local authorities, the police, the private sector and, commonly, the voluntary and community sectors share the objectives. If the objective in an area is to reduce crime, how much better it will be to involve the youth services, the local education authority, the primary care trust and the police in achieving those aims.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para21"><a name="stpa_313">If the hon. Gentleman is sceptical about my words, I shall pray in aid Sir John Egan, who emphasised the role of LSPs in his review &quot;Skills for Sustainable Communities&quot;. The document stated that LSPs


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;need to work together to create both shared values and a sense of responsibility for making delivery of sustainable communities a reality in their area.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para22"><a name="stpa_314">The Government have a strategy for neighbourhood renewal. From 2001 to 2006, resources are being made available through the neighbourhood renewal fund&#151;the NRF&#151;for the delivery of LSPs in 88 of the most deprived local authority areas, which includes Birmingham. Indeed, as I shall show, Birmingham is the largest recipient of such funding.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para23"><a name="stpa_315">The purpose of the NRF is to provide support to local authorities in England&#039;s most deprived districts to enable them, in co-operation with their LSPs, to improve services in their most deprived areas. I am sorry to introduce another acronym, Sir Nicholas, because I know your natural hostility to them, but let me explain the importance of super output areas&#151;SOAs. We can now identify at sub-ward level the most deprived areas, so that we can target our efforts. Even in prosperous areas such as Cheshire, to pick one at random, there are, as you know, pockets of deprivation. We therefore want to target our funding, and SOAs allow us to do so.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para24"><a name="stpa_316">Within NRF areas, there are floor targets. I think that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley has confused what a floor target is. He shakes his head, but I have not given the explanation yet. I hope that he will bear with me until I do; if he then wants to disagree, he is free to do so. The achievement of Government floor targets is part of the purpose of the NRF. As he said, the local target is to narrow the gap between deprived areas and the rest of the country. The challenge is a big one: not only to improve the situation in the relevant areas, but to narrow the gap with more prosperous areas. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Oct 2005 : Column 69WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Logically, there are two ways of doing that. The first is the Conservative approach, which is to make the richer areas poorer. That is one way of narrowing the gap. The problem with that approach was that the poorer areas became even poorer, so the gap remained.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para25"><a name="stpa_317">Our approach is that all boats should rise with the tide, but the lower areas&#151;the worse-off areas&#151;should rise faster. We recognise that that is a challenge. Where I disagree with the hon. Gentleman is on his claim that the Government punish areas that do not meet their floor targets. In fact, the major criticism of the neighbourhood funding system is that it punishes successful areas, because the identification of an NRF area is based on its deprivation. As an area comes out of deprivation, in part because of the success of the neighbourhood renewal strategy, the funding that central Government make available is withdrawn. Because we are a benevolent Government, that withdrawal is on a transitional basis, but funding is nevertheless withdrawn. I was lobbied and am being lobbied intensively by Members of Parliament representing areas that have lost their neighbourhood renewal funding. I say to them that that is because those areas have succeeded.
</p>






<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51011h05_spnew3"><b> John Hemming </b> : Without going into the minutiae of the different floor targets, I want to raise this point. It was not made by the independent inspector, but the judgment has been that Birmingham has not done so well on worklessness, for instance, so the funds have not been finally signed off as yet.
</p>






<p><a name="st_80"><a name="51011h05_spnew4"><b> Mr. Woolas </b> : I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point, which I shall answer directly, but just to finish my point, far from bashing Birmingham around the head, as he described the situation, Birmingham&#039;s allocation for 2006&#150;07 is &#163;32.3 million. Many MPs would welcome such an allocation of resources. The proposed allocation for 2007&#150;08 is &#163;37.6 million. That is up from &#163;22 million, and there is an additional resource of &#163;4.8 million through the safer and stronger communities fund.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para26"><a name="stpa_318">The hon. Gentleman says that those are only indicative announcements. They are indeed indicative, as is the revenue support grant announcement, which is made every November. It is indicative because it involves taxpayers&#039; money; it is not my money or my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s money. In return for taxpayers&#039; money to address some of the inequalities, the Government reasonably ask that the LSPs provide evidence, under their devolved powers, to show that the money will be used to meet the floor targets.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para27"><a name="stpa_319">I shall outline more details for the record and for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman who secured the debate. An LSP, which must be accredited by Ministers, must be in place in order for neighbourhood fund money to be received. The grant is paid directly to the local authority, which is the accountable body, for the expenditure, but the expenditure must be agreed by the LSP.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para28"><a name="stpa_320">The LSPs in the neighbourhood areas were formally accredited in 2002 and 2003. Since then, the ODPM&#039;s neighbourhood renewal unit has replaced annual accreditation with a performance management approach, under which the LSPs self-assess their

<br>&nbsp;<br>
progress towards achieving delivery of the national floor targets and the local targets that they set. In other words, the Government have further freed up the regime by asking the LSP to assess its own performance against those targets.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para29"><a name="stpa_321">Birmingham&#039;s self-assessment concurred with the Government&#039;s subsequent assessment that its rating was what is called amber-red, or in head teacher language, &quot;could do better.&quot; That was Birmingham&#039;s self-assessment, and one with which we agreed.
</p>






<p><a name="st_81"><a name="51011h05_spnew5"><b> John Hemming </b> : The point that I made earlier was that worklessness is not entirely within the control of the LSP, although the LSP can work on it and aim to improve employment. The amber-red rating comes, in part, from council housing and worklessness. With that as a defined methodology, we are measuring something that the LSP cannot control.
</p>






<p><a name="st_82"><a name="51011h05_spnew6"><b> Mr. Woolas </b> : Again, the hon. Gentleman&#039;s intervention goes to the heart of the matter. He might have a point if the Government were using the financial leverage of the neighbourhood renewal fund, or indeed any other funding mechanism, to punish an area for not narrowing the gap on worklessness or not meeting the other floor targets, which I shall go through if I have time, in the way that the hon. Gentleman described.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para30"><a name="stpa_322">As I have tried to explain, however, neighbourhood renewal funding is withdrawn when the targets are met. That is the point of the scheme. It is an incentive for the population and the local economy to succeed and to meet local health, education and crime targets, but it is not true to say that the Government punish areas that do not meet those targets. The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the nature of the targets that have been set and their purpose.
</p>






<p><a name="st_83"><a name="51011h05_spnew7"><b> John Hemming </b> : There is a misunderstanding about the detailed mechanism. The reality is that there is a different process because certain LSPs have been deemed amber-red. In fact, a different process is in operation for signing off the finance. I am concerned about measuring people against things that they cannot control.
</p>






<p><a name="st_84"><a name="51011h05_spnew8"><b> Mr. Woolas </b> : The hon. Gentleman says that the Government are measuring an LSP against things that it cannot control, but the Government are in fact measuring an area by its deprivation indices, and giving funds to local agencies that can influence, albeit not wholly, those targets. The announcement in July was an indicative announcement of neighbourhood renewal fund money and applies not only to Birmingham but across the piece.
</p>






<p><a name="st_85"><a name="51011h05_spnew9"><b> Steve McCabe </b> : Perhaps I was being unfair to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) when I suggested that he sought to cover his own failures by deflecting blame elsewhere. Given that we are debating the performance of the strategic partnership, is not there an argument for an independent investigation into how the resources have been used and how that procedure is working in Birmingham compared with other parts of the country?
</p>






<p><a name="st_86"><a name="51011h05_spnew10"><b> Mr. Woolas </b> : I would have thought that, as a public representative, I would be obliged to answer that

<br>&nbsp;<br>
question in the affirmative. It is public, taxpayers&#039; money that is used. The Audit Commission has, and does, look at the performance of LSPs in the context of the fact that the local authority is the accountable body.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para31"><a name="stpa_323">Let me tell my hon. Friend what the Audit Commission found in respect of LSPs in neighbourhood renewal funding areas. It said that they


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;have made significant progress in implementing performance management systems. This is a notable achievement given the complexity and sensitivity of developing performance management in a partnership context. It marks a further stage of development in the lifecycle of LSPs and demonstrates a level of organisational maturity which is reassuring given their relative youth.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para32"><a name="stpa_324">If I may say so, all the evidence shows that the neighbourhood renewal strategy is delivering and is doing so because of the funding that has been made available and the partnerships that have been put together.
</p>






<p><a name="st_87"><a name="51011h05_spnew11"><b> John Hemming </b> : May I take this opportunity to agree with the Minister that the strategy is delivering, to a certain extent? One advantage that we have in Birmingham is that it is a sort of social science experiment, in which we do not do exactly the same thing across the whole city, and so it is possible to measure the exact results from the use of funding in certain areas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51011h05_para33"><a name="stpa_325">However, I return to the point about different treatment. Although I accept the point that the finance will probably get signed off relatively quickly, there is a different categorisation for those LSPs which&#151;in Birmingham&#039;s case through no fault of its own&#151;end up in the amber-red category. They are treated differently in terms of the signing off of the finance from those who are amber-green or green. The point that I am making is that that categorisation is linked to something of which they are not directly in control.
</p>






<p><a name="st_88"><a name="51011h05_spnew12"><b> Mr. Woolas </b> : The hon. Gentleman seems to be complaining about the reality of the real world. In setting floor targets, no one is suggesting that the LSP or

the local authority is responsible, or has within its powers the responsibility, for curing all the world&#039;s ills. However, I have a responsibility to the taxpayer to examine why improvements are made faster in some areas than in others. I do not want to say that improvements are not being made. In Birmingham, for example, levels of burglary fell by 16 per cent. between 2001 and 2003, compared with a 6 per cent. fall in England as a whole, and so the gap is narrowing. I do not suggest that that has happened entirely because of&#151;

<p>
<a name="51011h05_para34"><a name="stpa_326">The situation now is that the Government Office for the West Midlands assessed the Birmingham strategic partnership as amber-red overall, which confirmed, as I said, the partnership&#039;s own self-assessment.

<a name="51011h05_para35"><a name="stpa_327">I shall answer one specific question before my time runs out. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley said that the chairmanship of the LSP is down to the local authority. The Government do not dictate the governance of LSPs; that is a matter for local decision making. I understand that in the case of Birmingham, there is a draft constitution that accepts that the local authority leader is the chair&#151;I think that he is the deputy leader&#151;
