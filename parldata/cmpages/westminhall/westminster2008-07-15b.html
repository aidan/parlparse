 I am grateful for this opportunity to raise a vital topic. My intention in seeking the debate is not to pretend that nothing is being done; quite the contrary—I want to applaud the work that has been going on in the Department, particularly since the National Audit Office published its report on dementia last year. Consultation on the national dementia strategy and the direction of travel that that signals is very welcome. My interest in the issue does not come from personal family experience— I would not wish that on anyone—but from the contact that I have had with families in my constituency who are living, perhaps I should say struggling, with the consequences of dementia. Those contacts have come about through opportunities provided for me by the local carers centre in Sutton and the local branch of the Alzheimer’s Society; they have certainly done much to teach me about the impact of that terrible disease. I hope that the Minister will see today’s debate as part of the consultation on the strategy and an opportunity to build the consensus that is necessary to deliver and sustain the long-term changes needed to make a difference to people with dementia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para1"><a name="08071578000011">I want to raise three issues. First, I want to explore some of the lessons from past reports and initiatives to improve the quality of dementia care. Secondly, I want to raise some concerns about work force planning and research aspects of the emerging strategy. Thirdly, I want to pose some questions, and make some suggestions, about the review of anti-psychotic prescribing announced by the Minister. The Select Committee on Public Accounts produced a report in January that summed up the challenge:</p>
<a name="80715h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08071578000400"><ul><p class="tabletext">“Dementia affects over 560,000 people in England and costs some £14 billion a year. Parallels can be drawn between attitudes towards dementia now and cancer in the 1950s, when there were few treatments and patients were commonly not told the diagnosis for fear of distress.”</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08071578000012">For the UK as a whole, dementia costs £17 billion a year—more than cancer, stroke and heart disease put together—and we are told that in the next 20 years the cost will more than double.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08071578000013">The Public Accounts Committee and National Audit Office reports are not the first reports to turn the spotlight on dementia. There are plenty of reports, if one digs into the subject. Just eight years ago, the Audit Commission published the first of two reports called “Forget Me Not”. Those reports make salutary reading, because the lack of early diagnosis, the patchiness of provision, the need for better management of complexity and the importance of strategy were all set out in their pages. They show a sad truth about this area of public policy and many others—it is particularly so with respect  <br></br>

to the NAO report: often there is nothing new to be said, but what there is to say must be said time and again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08071578000014">Shortly after the Audit Commission report appeared, the Department of Health published the national service framework for older people. Standard seven in that very welcome document covers older people’s mental health. It states:</p>
<a name="80715h0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08071578000401"><ul><p class="tabletext">“Older people who have mental health problems have access to integrated mental health services, provided by the NHS and councils to ensure effective diagnosis, treatment and support, for them and their carers.”</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08071578000015">The NSF was widely welcomed at the time. It was all there: the benefit of early diagnosis; the need to refer to specialist services to confirm diagnosis; best practice advice on dementia care pathways; and the service model. That was in 2001, yet by the time the NAO took a look and published its report in 2007, little had changed substantially. Yes, there were, and are, beacons of good practice around the country; there is no doubt about the fact that some really good, dedicated staff are providing good services and bringing about good outcomes. However, for most of the country, dementia care remains firmly in the dark ages. As the NAO found, less than half of those with dementia receive a diagnosis. Even among those national health service organisations with agreed dementia care pathways, more than half admitted to the NAO that they are not using them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08071578000016">The draft strategy rightly identifies the need for an integrated approach from diagnosis to end of life. Again, the NSF offered a tool for securing that integration: the single assessment process. Despite a deadline of April 2002 for its introduction, only a minority of NHS organisations are using it. The roll-out appears to have stalled, as it seems that the signals have not been getting through to local decision makers, and that the incentives to change behaviour have been too subtle. The priority that the Minister and the Department of Health have now attached to dementia is essential to achieving the step change that we all want, but if the experience of the past is any indicator for the future it will not be sufficient. It will require national leadership, both political and clinical, so will the Minister take on board the proposal in the NAO report that a national director for dementia services should be appointed to provide national leadership, and that that should be underpinned by networks for dementia, in much the same way as happens for cancer care, to provide clinical leadership at regional level?</p>

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="08071578000017"><a name="80715h0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="08071578000456"><b>Susan Kramer (Richmond Park) (LD):</b>
 My hon. Friend talks about a lack of progress in dementia care; but is he also aware that in some areas there have, in a sense, been backward steps, particularly where behaviour is very challenging, such as the decision by the South West London and St. George’s Mental Health Trust to get out of providing care to such highly challenging patients through its flagship facility at St. John’s, which is to be closed? There is now a desperate search for an alternative provider of such care, and it has been discovered that there is only one possible bidder in the entire area to provide care for challenging patients.</p>

 I think that my hon. Friend has made some important points about how reorganising services can cause people a lot of concern, and how that needs careful handling, particularly in the case of people with dementia and those who care for them. A lack of continuity of care is a great cause for concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08071578000021">As for trying to get the signals right, changes to incentives, such as the GPs’ quality and outcomes framework, and national tariffs, are required. The quality and outcomes framework awards just 20 points out of 1,000 to dementia. The new strategy for developing the framework, promised by Lord Darzi in his recent review, will be critical to driving change. Can the Minister suggest when the strategy will be published, and how it will connect with the dementia strategy? It will require clear and enforceable standards, backed up by robust and regular inspection. At present, only 28 per cent. of care home places are registered specialist dementia places, despite the fact that 62 per cent. of places are filled by people with dementia—in some cases the figure is as high as 80 per cent. That surely results in some people being inappropriately placed, and the home failing, because of the want of appropriately trained staff, to provide the level of care required.</p>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="08071578000022"><a name="80715h0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="08071578000460"><b>Mr. Andrew Smith (Oxford, East) (Lab):</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate in an area in which I know he does a great deal of work. He rightly referred to the quality of placements. Will he also explore the even more prevalent problems that face families who struggle to care for people with dementia? They often have the agonising dilemma of wanting to keep their family member with them and provide them with a familiar place to live, while they become increasingly stressed about providing that support and care. Is not there an equal need for evaluation and monitoring of good practice in that respect, to ensure that PCTs and social services provide appropriate support, to help with the reality that those people grapple with?</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="08071578000023"><a name="80715h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="08071578000461"><b>Mr. Jim Hood (in the Chair):</b>

 Thank you, Mr. Hood. Again, that was a very good point, and I guess that I would respond to it by saying that I hope the Minister will tell us something about the read-across from the national carers strategy to the dementia strategy. That must obviously be tailored to the specific circumstances of families who are coping with dementia. The generic strategy, welcome though it certainly is, needs to be tailored in that way—the right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08071578000025">I was going to say something about the Care Quality Commission which will replace the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the Healthcare Commission. It must ensure that all care homes train their staff in the needs of people with dementia. Indeed, it needs to provide training in other settings too—particularly domiciliary care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08071578000026">Inspection must be more than a response triggered by specific concerns. It must be seen as part of a continuous improvement process across all standards and should be regular. The CQC should also be required to measure routinely the experience and satisfaction of service users and carers in all settings, not just care homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08071578000027">In December 2007, the Department of Health published its operating framework for this year. Among its local priorities was the following:</p>
<a name="80715h0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08071578000402"><ul><p class="tabletext">“The Department will shortly be publishing details of the clinical and economic case for investing in services for early identification and intervention in dementia, which PCTs will want to consider when developing local services.”</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08071578000028">That was flagged up as a local priority, not a national requirement or even a national priority. Will the NHS operating framework for 2009-10 elevate dementia to the status of a national requirement, or at least to a national priority? Try as I might, I could not find any sign of the promised business case for investing in services. Has it been published?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08071578000029">Getting the traction necessary across the whole health and social care system requires more than incentivising the Department of Health and the NHS to change their behaviour and practice. It also needs the buy-in of the Department for Communities and Local Government, so that local area agreements, the negotiations between agencies that are involved, and the new comprehensive area assessment process can be employed to lever change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08071578000030">The consultation document states that the proposed development requires work force growth if the new and improved services are to be delivered. Work force planning is a critical and complex matter. At the diagnosis end, is the Minister confident that enough people with the necessary training will be in place to undertake the necessary assessments? Will there be enough neurologists and geriatricians to deal with the huge increase in the number of referrals for specialist diagnosis? The earlier people are referred, the more critical those specialist services will be in achieving a successful diagnosis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08071578000031">The NAO report found that community mental health teams have an average of 275 people with dementia on their books, compared with the 1,000 whom the prevalence data suggest have that condition. Many teams lack specialists in dementia. An early diagnosis may be made, but what happens afterwards, particularly to support the family, including those caring and coping at home? Information is critical. Signposting on its own, however, is not enough to support carers in particular. They need expert advocacy to help them to access the support and services that they require, which are different at different stages of the disease. One model that I hope will be considered is portage services, which have been developed in children’s services. I am not suggesting that we equate people with dementia with children. Portage services simply provide a model for standing alongside carers and families to help them to manage the complexities of all the agencies that they must deal with. I hope that that can be considered.</p>

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="08071578000032"><a name="80715h0001.htm_spnew8"><a name="08071578000463"><b>David Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate. On 14 May, I introduced a ten-minute Bill on the management of dementia in care homes. One of its objectives on work force planning and training was to make dementia training, including in the use of anti-psychotics, mandatory for care home staff, as it is not mandatory at the moment. That would be a straightforward and simple step for the Minister to take after the consultation process is complete. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?</p>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="08071578000033"><a name="80715h0001.htm_spnew9"><a name="08071578000464"><b>Mr. Burstow:</b>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08071578000034">Work force development for care homes, housing and community-based staff are essential, as are support and development for carers. The consultation document suggests that the strategy must be staged over five years to overcome the various work force constraints that I have discussed. Again, if experience teaches us anything, it is that five years is a challenging and ambitious period in which to achieve all that. The same can be said of research. I welcome the intention to hold a summit to consider a planned programme of research. The foundations are in place for a significant increase in research funding, but at present, a quarter of the Department of Health’s £700 million research budget is spent on cancer, compared with just 3 per cent. that is spent on dementia. Total Government spending on dementia research through both the Medical Research Council and the NHS is just £25 million. The UK falls well behind France, Germany, Canada, Australia and the United States of America when it comes to investment in dementia research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08071578000035">It is not a shortage of good research proposals that is holding us back. The Alzheimer’s Research Trust told me that it rejects two out of three grant applications for want of funds. The summit is welcome, but will the Minister confirm that the Government are willing to commit new money to support more research? The potential is huge. If research resulted in a five-year delay in the onset of dementia, the number of deaths from the disease could be cut in half. Both the work force and research require investment. Has the Minister secured additional resources to implement the strategy, or will any funds allocated later this year come from existing primary care trust and social services allocations? Most of the extra investment needed to make it all happen will fall within the next comprehensive spending review period. I wish him well in winning the arguments for extra investment in dementia care in particular and social care in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08071578000036">My final concern is one that I have mentioned in the House over a number of years: the inappropriate and abusive prescribing of anti-psychotic medication. I welcome the decision to conduct an urgent review of prescribing with a view to changing practice, as change is long overdue. Countless learned reports have been written on the subject, guidance was published as part of the NSF in 2001, and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance demonstrates that practical, non-pharmacological alternatives to drugs are available. All those make clear both the benefits and the risks of prescribing anti-psychotics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para18"><a name="08071578000037">The benefits are principally for those who also have psychosis—that accounts for 6 to 10 per cent. of those with dementia—but about 100,000 people are routinely prescribed such drugs to control challenging behaviour. Community mental health teams have a critical part to play in turning that around, but they cover less than a third of those with dementia, and it will take time to grow CMHTs to the point where they have the staff and the competencies to deal with the additional challenges. Above all, the review must map out how to get GPs to change their prescribing practice. Despite all the clinical guidelines and the mounting research evidence of the harm that has been done and is being done by prescribing, GPs carry on prescribing. Securing change is urgent. GPs will be increasingly at risk of prosecution and disciplinary action from the General Medical Council,   <br></br>

as the European Medicines Agency’s committee for medicinal products for human use has referred Risperdal, an anti-psychotic, to its harmonisation processes.</p>

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="08071578000038"><a name="80715h0001.htm_spnew10"><a name="08071578000465"><b>David Taylor:</b>
 The report “Always a Last Resort” dealt with anti-psychotics in detail. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that although anti-psychotics can have a part to play in controlling distressing symptoms such as aggressive behaviour, they are often used, as we heard from witnesses, to treat behaviour that is neither distressing nor threatening, such as restlessness or being vocal? We can all visit elderly people’s homes and see that happening on a daily basis. That is not an appropriate use of anti-psychotics. Staff and GPs too readily go along with the idea that an anti-psychotic prescription is the best way to respond, when it is in fact the worst way. It shortens lives and increases the risk of stroke.</p>

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="08071578000039"><a name="80715h0001.htm_spnew11"><a name="08071578000466"><b>Mr. Burstow:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The report, to which he put his name, says that such drugs should be a last resort. The problem is that in too many places—we do not know the precise numbers; we know only that it happens in too many places—it is often not a last resort but a first. We need to change that behaviour. That is critical to realising the good intentions behind the strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08071578000040">The European Medicines Agency review to harmonise regulation on Risperdal means that the drug will be licensed in the UK for the treatment of behavioural and psychological disturbance, but in a strictly defined subgroup of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Until now, no anti-psychotic drug has been licensed in this country for the treatment of dementia. EU member states that license such drugs for the treatment of dementia stipulate that their use should be limited to a period of no more than three months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08071578000041">That will have important implications for prescribing and dementia care in this country. For the first time, clinicians will have a licensed drug that will significantly increase the burden of proof, in the context of the GMC’s guidelines on off-licence prescribing. It will become necessary to justify prescribing other drugs than the one that is licensed. If fewer dementia suffers are routinely prescribed anti-psychotic drugs for periods in excess of three months, it will increase the pressure on families and care providers as dementia patients come off the drugs. Once Risperdal is licensed, NICE should undertake an appraisal to determine its clinical and cost-effectiveness. Indeed I hope that the Government will consider that it would be in the public interest if NICE undertook an appraisal of all the anti-psychotic drugs routinely prescribed to people with dementia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="80715h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08071578000042">Another driver for change comes from the USA. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration exercised its powers to require manufacturers of traditional anti-psychotic drugs to make safety-related changes to prescribing information, or labelling, to warn about an increased risk of death associated with the off-licence use of these drugs to treat the behavioural problems associated with dementia. In 2005, it made a similar requirement for atypical anti-psychotic drugs. The pressure from Europe for a licensed drug, together with the review, and pressure from the United States, must make us question what the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency could do to ensure that we have good safety information on all anti-psychotic drugs in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para0"><a name="08071578000043">Although I welcome the review, it is my view, from all the information that I have seen and lobbying that I have received over the years, that there is a compelling body of evidence to justify action to tackle inappropriate and abusive prescribing. I understand that the review will concentrate on drawing up the action plan needed to change clinical practice, which is not as easy as it sounds. It is easy to say, “Change clinical practice”— many people have been saying it for a long time—but practice remains the same. Elements of any plan should include: a role for the MHRA in requiring safety-related changes to all anti-psychotic drugs labelling; a contribution from the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Psychiatrists in drawing up and issuing clearer guidelines and driving behavioural change; the role of the GMC, not in waving a big stick, but in supporting behavioural change and, if necessary, policing unacceptable behaviour; the role of the Healthcare Commission, the Commission for Social Care Inspection and their successors in inspecting prescribing practice—for example by looking at the length of time anti-psychotic drugs are prescribed—and the contribution that clinical governance and audit in PCTs can make. I also hope that we can have a strategy setting out the support and information that families need so that they can ask pointed questions at medication reviews and other times about the appropriateness of the prescriptions offered to them. I think that the voluntary sector can make a huge contribution in raising awareness and by working with the Department of Health and others to move the agenda forward.</p>

Inevitably, in a debate like this, I have concentrated on those areas where I have concerns, but my purpose today has been to pose some questions and make some suggestions based on past experience. There is much to welcome in the proposed national dementia strategy, and I hope that it becomes the basis for a national consensus that delivers the dignity and quality of life that people with dementia, and their carers, deserve.</p>

Taken with the updated carers strategy, it is clear that the Government have made such issues a priority, and I feel that there is now a real commitment to finding solutions to the problems. My hon. Friend the Minister is a dedicated and committed champion of the needs of vulnerable people of all ages, and I am sure that the current consultations will result in policy changes that will begin to transform our care system.

parties in raising them in the House. Many of those hon. Members are in the Chamber today, and I congratulate them and the society on their work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para3"><a name="08071578000047">Recently the all-party group on dementia reviewed the Alzheimer’s Society report, “The Dementia Tax”, and I spoke at that meeting. Two of the report’s longer-term recommendations were that there must be recognition of the specific heavy burden of care costs carried by people with dementia and their carers, and that the care they receive should be of good quality and at a fair price. The debate on the future funding of social care involves a radical rethink of how we pay for and deliver care, and that debate is obviously at an early stage. Part of the difficulty is that few people think about or plan for the costs of care in the way that many plan for other costs in retirement. The new care funding settlement could look at ways for people to insure against high costs of care and support. Provision for care and support could be made through pensions, private savings, housing equity or through private insurance. However, in the new settlement, when people cannot afford their care the Government will always have a responsibility to step in and ensure that people get the support they need to live their lives.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a very important point, but a third of people over 65 will be suffering from some form of dementia when they die. Is it not likely, therefore, that the premiums for such insurance would be prohibitive, particularly for those with few resources?</p>

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="08071578000049"><a name="80715h0002.htm_spnew2"><a name="08071578000469"><b>Barbara Keeley:</b>
 Very much so. I was about to say that it is right to highlight at present the extent to which care charges hit those with dementia the hardest. We must take account of that as we move forward the debate on future funding.</p>

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="08071578000050"><a name="80715h0002.htm_spnew3"><a name="08071578000470"><b>Mr. Stephen O'Brien (Eddisbury) (Con):</b>
 For clarification, has the hon. Lady considered how to divide funding between people with immediate needs, those at an intermediate stage—for example, those over 50—and those who are much younger and could still be incentivised to consider their future long-term care needs? How should we approach people who might have had a chance to insure against the contingency of long-term care, but chose not to do so, compared to those who never had that chance? Those seem to be the issues with which she is grappling.</p>

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="08071578000051"><a name="80715h0002.htm_spnew4"><a name="08071578000471"><b>Barbara Keeley:</b>
 They are indeed the issues, but the debate is at an early stage, and it is right that we consider all such issues as we work through it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para4"><a name="08071578000052">In care homes—the most intensive and costly part of the social care system—more than two thirds of residents have some form of dementia. However, given that only one third of dementia sufferers are cared for in a care home, a large number of people are left dependent on social care at home, much of which is provided by unpaid family carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para5"><a name="08071578000053">It is important to emphasise the limited and often variable quality of care services for people with dementia. I met a group of carers of people with dementia at an Age Concern drop-in centre in my constituency. Most of the people whom they cared for were still living at home, but using respite care. Those carers were experts  <br></br>

on the standard of respite care available locally and were pretty scathing—sadly—about its quality. It is a reflection of the current state of care services that users and carers have low expectations of quality, and that must change. Like other hon. Members, I am sure, I am a firm believer in applying the test of whether we think that a care service would be good enough for our own parents, spouse or partner. We have some big issues to deal with on quality, and if we link them to funding, as has been discussed, I think that people would be more prepared to make a contribution to care costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para6"><a name="08071578000054">The consultation document for the national dementia strategy makes a commitment on the outcome of early diagnosis and intervention, which I believe is vital in transforming the future of dementia care. Many of the improvements in care for people with dementia are reliant on good-quality early diagnosis, and with medical developments more could then be done at an early stage for those with dementia, which could mean that they can live independently at home for longer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para7"><a name="08071578000055">The NICE guidelines on drug treatment for mild cases, which seem to have hampered NHS funding, need further review. We are talking about a cost of £2.50 a day, which must be weighed against other costs that families incur—it is important that in our debates we weigh up the costs to families.</p>

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="08071578000056"><a name="80715h0002.htm_spnew5"><a name="08071578000472"><b>Mr. Burstow:</b>
 Does the hon. Lady agree that NICE needs to be able to take a wider view of the costs and their impact on carers when assessing such drugs?</p>

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="08071578000057"><a name="80715h0002.htm_spnew6"><a name="08071578000473"><b>Barbara Keeley:</b>
 Our strategies should not deal with the issues separately. I was making the point that we must start to weigh up the costs to unpaid family carers, resulting partly from their reduced work hours. We must also consider the outcome for those with dementia who will spend longer in care homes without that early care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para8"><a name="08071578000058">On care services, a key question is whether we go for local flexibility in provision of services or for setting national standards for care. We had a debate in this Chamber on the future of care a few weeks ago, in which I argued strongly for setting national standards. There are two local authorities and two primary care trusts in my constituency, all of which set different criteria for levels of need and the allocation of care services. It is unacceptable to me, as the MP for Worsley, that local people face those differences. I want a national basic entitlement to care. It is important that our social and community care services develop so that we provide that care early and at lower levels of need, although it would have resource implications that need to be faced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08071578000059">It is estimated that 2,200 people in Salford have dementia, so there are about 1,000 such people in my constituency. With their carers, they are a significant group. If we want early diagnosis and intervention for people who have dementia, care must be provided earlier, and advice and support must be given both to them and to their carers. The point has already been made that early intervention could and would prevent later costly treatment, as well as—this is important—preserving quality of life for people with dementia and their carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08071578000060">There is concern about age discrimination in the provision of treatment and care. The national service framework for older people states that clinical need should be the basis for treatment, regardless of age, but  <br></br>

<meta name="Date" content="15 July 2008"/>
<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>15 July 2008 : Column 10WH</b><br></br>
many individuals and organisations in the field of dementia care have given examples that show that is not the case. The equalities Bill will contain a new equality duty that will cover age discrimination. The new law will ban unjustifiable age discrimination such as a doctor failing to investigate a health complaint raised by an older person or not providing treatment simply because of age. Work also needs to be done to tackle the culture of ageism that is built into health services and which affects decisions about paying for care. That difficult issue will need a fundamental change of attitude from health providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08071578000061">Recent research commissioned by the Department of Health through the Centre for Policy on Ageing reported different types of ageism in the health care system. Examples include “productivity ageism”—giving priority to young adults because they are more productive—and “health maximisation ageism”, which is used in quality adjusted life years assessments; the greater life expectancy of younger people means that they benefit more. A third type is “fair innings ageism”, which, as the name suggests, compares remaining expected healthy life years to an average and gives a weighting that benefits younger people. Older people deserve good treatment too. If we were to apply the test of whether we think a service or treatment good enough for our parents, we would not apply ageist attitudes when deciding if older people should have the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para12"><a name="08071578000062">As has been said, it is crucial to recognise the vital role that unpaid family carers play in dementia services. The national carers strategy was launched recently, and carers’ concerns are now considered in relation to health and social care in a new way. I have campaigned, through two private Member’s Bills, for health professionals to identify and support carers, and I will continue to press that case. Early diagnosis of dementia is important, and at that point, the consultant or general practitioner should also identify the patient’s carer and refer them to the support that they will need to cope with their growing caring responsibilities. I think that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said that there are only 20 quality and outcomes framework points for GPs identifying dementia patients, but there are only three QOF points for identifying carers. Surely that should be reviewed.</p>

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="08071578000063"><a name="80715h0002.htm_spnew7"><a name="08071578000474"><b>Mr. Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b>
 Does the hon. Lady agree that one of the most distressing aspects of dementia care is how it affects couples? People affected by dementia are often cared for by elderly spouses who might have different problems of their own. There does not seem to be enough emphasis in the system on keeping couples together to face their different health challenges.</p>

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="08071578000064"><a name="80715h0002.htm_spnew8"><a name="08071578000475"><b>Barbara Keeley:</b>
 That is a key issue. As we press matters such as dignity and support for carers, the issues that couples face have to be taken more into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para13"><a name="08071578000065">Carers have vital information needs, and we are starting to recognise that they should be offered training, support through carers groups and breaks from caring. The Alzheimer’s Society survey of carers and its recent report showed that only 40 per cent. of the carers surveyed attend a support group, that 29 per cent. have respite care at home and that 29 per cent. have respite  <br></br>

care through a care home. That may be due to issues of quality and availability, but given that many carers of people with dementia are at the heavy end of caring, the position must be improved. Carers I have met tell me that they feel as though they are fighting the care system to get what they and the person for whom they care need. The process can be exhausting; it is stressful enough to be a carer without having to fight the system too. To help carers, we must continue to campaign until they have more information, a simple and fairer financial system for funding, and the option of help at home and breaks when needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para14"><a name="08071578000066">Another issue of concern is the difference between the end of life care offered to cancer patients and that offered to people with dementia. Hospices do a wonderful job; I single out in particular St. Ann’s hospice in Little Hulton, in my constituency, which is a wonderful resource. We should consider whether we can offer dementia patients more dignified end of life care, in the same way as cancer patients are treated at hospices, as well as giving their family members more support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para15"><a name="08071578000067">We should have the national dementia strategy by autumn.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) on securing this hugely important debate. As everyone in the House knows, he has been extremely active in this area. Indeed, before I took up my current role he used to perform it, and did so with real distinction. I pay tribute to his work; he has shown himself to be a real champion for older people, particularly those who are vulnerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para16"><a name="08071578000069">The debate is particularly timely as it comes after last week’s dementia awareness week. The issue is of ever greater and more pressing importance in society. Current estimates suggest that more than 700,000 people in the UK have dementia, and that number is expected to rise by more than 1 million by 2025 and 1.7 million by 2051.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para17"><a name="08071578000070">As we have heard, dementia affects not only the individuals concerned, but the millions of families involved, and the cost of dementia care is £17 billion a year, of which £14 billion is for England alone. That is more than the cost for cancer, heart disease and stroke combined, which is a shocking statistic. The figure is expected to double within two decades to £35 billion as advances in health care lead to longer life expectancy. However, we are not investing enough in research at a time when more than a third of over-65s suffer from some form of dementia when they die.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para18"><a name="08071578000071">I echo my hon. Friend’s comments welcoming the national dementia strategy, which is a big step forward. I think that we all wholeheartedly back the call to bring the issue out of the shadows. He made the useful suggestion that the debate should be part of the vital consultation process that we all believe to be important and welcome. I, too, attended last week’s meeting of the all-party group on dementia, as did the hon. Member  <br></br>

for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien). On some issues, we all spoke with one voice, and we all paid tribute to the work of the all-party group, the Alzheimer’s Society and other organisations that do so much to push the issue up the agenda. We also acknowledged that the Government have listened, which is creditable; the issue is very much on the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para19"><a name="08071578000072">The strategy has three core aims, the first of which is to address the lack of understanding about dementia. We have heard, particularly from the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), who is no longer in the Chamber, about the need for more comprehensive staff training on how to deal with dementia and related issues. That is crucial, particularly for front-line staff in care homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para20"><a name="08071578000073">My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam highlighted the need for early diagnosis and intervention in dementia cases. The Public Accounts Committee report revealed that two thirds of people with dementia never receive a specialist diagnosis, which is hardly surprising given that the National Audit Office showed that only 31 per cent. of GPs felt that they had received sufficient training to help them to diagnose and manage dementia. The British Medical Association suggested that doctors had less confidence about diagnosing dementia in 2007 than they had in 2004, so the medical profession itself says that more needs to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para21"><a name="08071578000074">One problem that has been highlighted is who should take responsibility for the situation. The answer is unclear, and I echo my hon. Friend’s suggestion that we must have specialist experts in dementia. They might be a geriatrician, a GP with a special interest, or a psychiatrist with a speciality in older age, but we all agree on the need for medical specialism in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para22"><a name="08071578000075">Improving the quality of care is another priority in the new national dementia strategy, and we all accept that there will be no quick fix. About 62 per cent. of care home residents are thought to have dementia, but less than 28 per cent. of care homes provide specialist dementia care. That issue goes back to training and to the need to introduce qualifications for care home workers—I am aware that has been suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para23"><a name="08071578000076">There are concerns about research funding, and I should like to ask the Minister for his thoughts on the current level of funding, because although costs continue to rise, we all accept that there is a huge burden on the system. Nevertheless, only 3 per cent. of the Department of Health’s research budget is spent on finding new ways of preventing and treating dementia, while a quarter of it is spent on cancer research. No one suggests that those issues are not hugely important, but if we are to tackle the huge societal and economic burden of dementia, we must consider increasing the figure. Currently, in real terms, for every £289 spent per cancer patient, only £11 is spent on Alzheimer’s sufferers, so when we consider the huge numbers of people who will suffer from dementia, and its effects on their families, on communities and on society, we see that the issue must be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="80715h0002.htm_para24"><a name="08071578000077">It is vital that the work of the third sector—the voluntary sector—continues to be supported. It has done much to push the issue forward, but Rebecca Wood, the chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Research Trust, warns quite bluntly that if the level of under-investment persists, the economic consequences arising from dementia care costs will be “catastrophic”.</p>

Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam mentioned anti-psychotic drugs—an issue on which he has campaigned tirelessly. Other Members mentioned it, too, but I know that the issue is dear to my hon. Friend’s heart, and I pay tribute to him for highlighting the scandalous way in which those drugs have been used and, unfortunately, in too many circumstances, are still being used inappropriately as a chemical cosh to suppress rather than to treat. The chilling reality is that, in some cases, the use of those drugs shortens people’s lives when they simply should not be used, or are not being used for an adequate medical purpose. I support his calls for a review by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence—I should be interested to hear the Minister’s comments—on Risperdal and on the general principle. It is extremely important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para1"><a name="08071578000079">I also echo the comments, made particularly strongly by the hon. Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley), and by the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), that we must ensure that there is joined-up thinking between the national dementia strategy and—something else that the Minister has championed—the national carers strategy. I sit on the Select Committee on Work and Pensions, which is examining carers’ roles from the point of view of the responsibilities of the Department for Work and Pensions, and there clearly has to be joined-up thinking. In this debate, we have heard powerful accounts of the reality of life for families, carers and spouses—elderly spouses, who so often care for people with dementia. All of us who have witnessed such situations, either through families or through constituents, know that they are incredibly distressing. People have to care for their loved one while they are grieving for the loss of that person to dementia. It is tragic, and our society must do all it can to support them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para2"><a name="08071578000080">We are all aware of the role that carers play in society, and I am pleased that their importance is being pushed up the agenda, and that their contribution to society is being increasingly recognised. We must acknowledge that carers for dementia sufferers save the social and health services about £6 billion a year, and I hope that we all echo the calls of organisations such as Help the Aged, which want the everyday rights of carers throughout the country to be acknowledged and the care and support system to be fundamentally overhauled, particularly for people with dementia, who have specific needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para3"><a name="08071578000081">This debate has been very positive, and I look forward to the Minister’s response to the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam made. We all agree about how pleasing it is that these issues are firmly on the agenda, that we are talking about them and that things are moving forward. All parts of the House want to be part of the process, and we have to ensure that the results of the consultation and the subsequent national carers strategy transform the lives of people who are affected by that most tragic of conditions, and help their families. I hope that as a society we will then stop brushing dementia under the carpet, and I applaud all the attempts to bring the condition out of the shadows. The fact that we are talking about it today is a very positive step.</p>

Many of us who regularly take part in such debates recognise in our constituents the demand, as well as the hope and expectation, that we can find a consensual way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para5"><a name="08071578000084">Many Members fully understand that dementia is a collective term for a range of medical conditions. There are more than 100 different forms of dementia. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause, accounting for about 55 per cent. of cases, while vascular dementia accounts for about 20 per cent. The Alzheimer’s Society says that there are about 700,000 people in the UK with dementia, and that about 163,000 new cases of dementia occur in England and Wales each year. It is a life-shortening illness, although another illness is often the main cause of death. However, average life expectancy is unpredictable: the disease can progress for up to 10 years, with average life expectancy being about six years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para6"><a name="08071578000085">From a public policy point of view, that gives the disease particular complexity. About one in three or four people will need long-term care, and of that number about a fifth will have some form of dementia. Furthermore, about a third of those with dementia need institutional care and two thirds of the care home population either has, or will have, some form of dementia. Although the incidence of dementia increases significantly with age, particularly among those aged 85 and over, it is important to note that there are approximately 18,000 people under 65 in the UK who have dementia. I would be interested to hear from the Minister what account will be taken of those people in the dementia strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para7"><a name="08071578000086">As we know, in the next 20 years, the number of people aged 85 and over in England is set to increase by two thirds compared with a 10 per cent. growth in the overall population, according to Derek Wanless’s 2006 predictions. That is expected to lead to an increase in dementia occurrence. In August 2005, results from the Medical Research Council’s cognitive function and ageing study showed that improved health and mortality were not likely to guard people against the risk of developing dementia. Although there is no vaccination or cure, dementia is most common at an advanced age, so a fairly modest delay of a few years in the onset of the disease, or in its progression, could mean a significant reduction in the numbers suffering from it.</p>

It is likely that the cost of dementia in 2026 will be about £12 billion to £14 billion. At a personal level, the Wanless review  <br></br>

estimated that the cost of residential care for the elderly mentally infirm was 14.1 per cent. higher than for “ordinary” elderly residents, and that the cost of nursing care was 4.7 per cent. higher. The report, “The Dementia Tax”, by the Alzheimer’s Society highlighted the unfairness of the situation for people who need care because of dementia, and for their families: dementia it is a medical condition, but invariably it requires social care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para9"><a name="08102365000001">There are wider issues in dementia care than the actuarial estimations about current and future support. It is easy, as we consider the commitment of the British taxpayer to this issue, to forget that we are dealing with individuals such as ourselves and families similar to our own, with all the emotional, spiritual and physical needs that come with our humanity. It is right that we bear in mind those people that we know—friends and family—who have dementia, or who care for someone with it, as we debate these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para10"><a name="08071578000089">One big area of work, which has recently given rise to public outcry, is the use of antipsychotic drugs in care settings, which was touched on by all the contributors to the debate, and by those who intervened. I pay tribute to the work of the all-party group on dementia, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth for his chairmanship. In its report, “Always a Last Resort”, the group made a key point:</p>
<a name="80715h0003.htm_brev0"><a name="08071578000403"><ul><p class="tabletext">“There are serious concerns that there is widespread inappropriate prescribing, for example, antipsychotics are being used for people with dementia who have mild behavioural symptoms and prescribing is often continued for long periods of time…This is despite the fact that antipsychotics have limited benefit for people with dementia, particularly when prescribed for long periods, and despite the serious side effects associated with their use…Side effects include excessive sedation, dizziness and unsteadiness, which can lead to increased falls and injuries, as well as body rigidity and tremors. Research shows that there is almost a doubling in the risk of mortality and an increase the risk of stroke by up to three times.”</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para11"><a name="08071578000090">I am therefore glad that the Government have taken up the report’s criticisms in their consultation on the national dementia strategy, and I pay tribute to the Minister for doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para12"><a name="08071578000091">Another concern is the closure across the country of care homes for the elderly mentally infirm. There is concern not only about the provision of places to those who need them, but about the provision of places in locations that are convenient for friends, family and, in some cases, spouses, who might well be dependent on public transport to get there. We heard in an intervention about the vital need to emphasise ways in which we can best try to keep couples together. I have tabled parliamentary questions on the matter, but I was told that the Department of Health does not collect the relevant data centrally. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister would consider writing to me, and anybody else who is interested, to outline what information the Department does collect in this area. I was hoping that I might even get a quick nod of agreement from him, but I have not quite seen that happen so far. Perhaps he will address this issue in his response, but it would be helpful if we could at least know what data are collected, or whether he thinks that the Department should start collecting those data centrally, to ensure that we look at the geographic spread of places for the elderly mentally infirm, and whether  <br></br>

provision is being lost or maintained, so that we can start examining how we keep families and communities together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para13"><a name="08071578000092">Another key area of policy is telecare, which enables individuals to live independent lives and carry on living in their own home even as their dementia progresses. That is clearly a very large and wide subject, and I think it may be the subject for another debate. However, it is important to mention it briefly, as it is a key issue. Finally, there is the issue of drugs, particularly for the early stages of Alzheimer’s. I pay tribute to all those who have campaigned on this issue, not least one of my own constituents, Leila Potter, who has been engaged for many decades with all the issues arising from caring and support for those with dementia. It is only right that NICE take into account as part of its criteria wider societal costs, such as the earlier requirement for care that would otherwise not be needed if drugs were prescribed at an early stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para14"><a name="08071578000093">As the Minister knows, for more than a year, we have proposed as policy that NICE should make its judgments taking into account those wider costs. That is important, because it would require a change in NICE’s statutory remit, and thus would require primary legislation. It is something to which my party is committed, and I was very pleased to hear the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam, and for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland), confirm their interest in, and support for, that policy. I just hope that the Government can tell us, either today or very shortly, that they, too, are minded to support that policy and will introduce the necessary legislative proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para15"><a name="08071578000094">The report, “The Dementia Tax”, highlights one of the key questions facing the Government: do they deal with dementia as part of the discussion on care and support, or do they deal with it separately? What is certain is that we would have been in a much stronger position to confront the growing issue of dementia if the Government, having waited for so many years, indicated how they propose to resolve the question of funding long-term care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para16"><a name="08071578000095">I do not need to remind the Minister that the former leader of his party, Tony Blair, said in his 1997 conference speech:</p>
<a name="80715h0003.htm_brev1"><a name="08071578000404"><ul><p class="tabletext">“I don’t want to live in a country where the only way pensioners can get long term care is by selling their home”.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para17"><a name="08071578000096">That promise has been around for more than a decade, but only a little has been done about the issue. I think that the Minister would have to admit that the take-up for what has been made available has been paltry. In fact, the present Prime Minister, in launching the consultation, said that</p>
<a name="80715h0003.htm_brev2"><a name="08071578000405"><ul><p class="tabletext">“younger adults are aware that much of their parents’ hard earned housing wealth may disappear…at some point in the future they may have to sell a treasured home to pay for their own care…too many people fear the prospect of selling their homes”.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para18"><a name="08071578000097">He therefore continues to ape his predecessor, rather than take the requisite action. The Government rejected the proposals from their own royal commission; they rejected the requests made by Derek Wanless to conduct a review for the Treasury into long-term care; and they rejected his findings when he was able to conduct such a review through the King’s Fund.</p>

Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne) was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, he announced a review group, which barely met, to introduce a policy following the comprehensive spending review. The Minister who is with us today gave countless assurances that he was winning his tussles with the Treasury, which were all to no avail when the CSR was actually published. We do not have as yet the results of those consultations, which we hoped would give the Treasury the competence it needs to deliver the “new settlement”, to quote the Minister, that he hoped to announce.</p>

At best, the debate on the future of care and support shows that the Government are still searching for an idea; at worst, it is another attempt to dodge the issue until after the latest date for the next general election. Perhaps, therefore, I could invite the Minister to confirm the Government’s intent to resolve this issue before 2010 or, if the polls are anything to go by, to leave it to others to do so after that date.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) on securing this debate and, perhaps more importantly, on the work that he has done over many years to raise the importance of dementia care within and outside this place. It is now acknowledged as one of the big health and social care challenges of our time, and he deserves significant credit for our having reached the stage that we are at today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para21"><a name="08071578000102">Before I address some of the substantive points made by the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien), I would like to point out that we sit in debate after debate in which he simply reels out a narrative about the nature of the challenge, the statistics and the existing situation. He is a spokesman for Her Majesty’s official Opposition, but he never knowingly comes up with a tangible policy solution to any of the major public policy challenges. I do not blame him, because we all know the situation. The shadow Chancellor has made it clear that there are to be absolutely no spending commitments from his party before a general election, but it is rich for the hon. Member for Eddisbury to lecture me when in fact the Opposition do not appear to have any credible policies whatsoever on these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para22"><a name="08071578000103">Let me return to the substance of the debate, during which hon. Members discussed the context. Demographic change is one of the biggest challenges that now face our society. Arguably, it is every bit as much of a challenge as globalisation, climate change or fundamentalist terrorism, but rarely does it feature on the list of the top four or five priorities. As people live longer, an increasing number will have long-term conditions. Alongside that, people’s expectations about and aspirations for the quality of care and support that they will receive are radically different from those of the previous generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para23"><a name="08071578000105">As the hon. Member for Eddisbury rightly said, two thirds of people in care homes have dementia.

one of the biggest issues that the health and social care system faces. Last summer, I committed the Government to bringing it out of the shadows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para24"><a name="08071578000106">As my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) rightly said, it is important that we do not simply look for solutions to the challenge presented by dementia, or develop a dementia strategy in isolation. It is incredibly important that we look at the reform agenda in the round. Therefore, when the hon. Member for Eddisbury accuses the Government of a lack of action in such areas, it is because he seems blissfully unaware of the radical reform agenda that the Government have laid out in the past year for health and social care in this country. From 1 April this year, the “Putting People First” transformation agenda, which is supported by more than £500 million of investment, will be rolled out in every local authority area. We are shifting the system to prevention and early intervention, providing universal information and advice, and moving to a system in which the vast majority of people have personal budgets so that they can exercise maximum control and choice over their own care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para25"><a name="08071578000107">Lord Darzi’s report only last week—it coincided with the 60th anniversary of the national health service—has a strong emphasis on the working parties in each strategic health authority, and his national enabling report discusses the importance of mental health issues. The primary and community care strategy that we launched last week deals with the need to look again at the incentives, quality and outcomes framework—QOF—points and so on that inform the behaviour of general practitioners and other health care professionals involved in primary and community care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para26"><a name="08071578000108">As hon. Members have said, we have also embarked on a national consultation on the review of the care and support system. What care and support do people have a right to expect in the 21st century, and what are the respective responsibilities of the state, the family and the individual in that context?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para27"><a name="08071578000109">Within the past three or four weeks, we launched the national carers strategy, and, a couple of weeks ago, the consultation on the first ever dementia strategy. In the very near future, we will launch the first ever end-of-life care strategy. I would gently say to the hon. Member for Eddisbury that there has never been as much policy focus, investment of resources and facing up to big challenges as there has been during the most recent period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="80715h0003.htm_para28"><a name="08071578000110">I shall respond directly to some of the points that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam raised. First, he and other hon. Members mentioned the impact on families. Unless one has met a family who are dealing with dementia, it is difficult to understand the scale of the trauma, anxiety and guilt that the condition causes. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley about the test that we should set for health and social care services. I have used it myself. If the care would not be good enough for my mother or father, why should it be good enough for somebody else’s mother or father? That is the test that, over time, we should seek to establish.</p>

 Like my right hon. Friend, I am a former Minister of Trade. Some of the companies that may want to bid for the Tote already have huge holdings in the European Community. There is an issue about the marketplace. Although my right hon. Friend is not being cavalier in his comments—he is his usual stylish self when it comes to promoting his case—we need to step back and sort out the competition issues. Increasingly, bids for any part of the Tote will attract international attention. The industry is becoming global in all aspects 24/7. That will result in more issues to do with competition. Whatever happens, we should ensure that such competition is fair for the consumer but that it also maintains resources in the constituency of my hon.

 I agree. I have been accused from time to time of being a bit cavalier, but first I want to answer the point raised by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para1"><a name="08071578000193">The Tote has 540 shops, and 40 per cent. of its takings come from them. I do not know the exact figure, but those takings are a 10th of its total takings. The sale will not materially affect access to the Tote, because that will be available through other betting shops. We have an agreement that we will take the Tote to the marketplace within seven years. That is what we said. It is a transitional period that we negotiated with the then DTI.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para2"><a name="08071578000194">In terms of competition policy, the European Union has on many occasions allowed transitional periods for organisations, and indeed countries, to allow them to become fit for purpose. The mechanism is not unusual in the European Community, as every country that recently came into the Community was given transitional arrangements to allow them to become fit for purpose before fully entering the marketplace. We have argued for that principle and I accept it—it is accepted by the Commission anyway. The organisation will be part of the open competition process within seven years, once it is fit for purpose.</p>

 On the point about giving various countries’ transitional arrangements, would my right hon.

 That is where one can hit the European Union. The European Union has no responsibility at all for gambling. It tried to bring gambling under its influence during recent discussions on the services directive, but had to take it out for all sorts of reasons. I will not describe them now, because they are not particularly germane to the argument, other than to say that gambling is not part of the European Union’s remit and that it does not have the power to bring gambling under its remit. Gambling, however, is brought under that remit in so far as it relates to competition.</p>

If we want to keep the Tote nationalised and to be able to do what we want with it, the European Community will do nothing about that. It is only when we start changing the Tote that the EU will have a say on how it is changed. Otherwise, the status quo can and will prevail, and the Tote will continue to run as it does now. It is a nationalised organisation, fully funded by the state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para4"><a name="08071578000198">The Tote is in a peculiar situation, but for the sake of the discussion I will respond on the issue of state aid, although I think it is a bogus argument. There would be a seven-year transitional period, and that would take the Tote into the marketplace once it was fit for purpose. In addition, the long-term profits of part of the Tote fund sport, which should be able to be funded and not brought under competition rules anyway. As part of the Nice protocol in 2000, the Heads of Government declared that sport should be defined separately from other commercial operations.</p>

I am saying that the status quo is not an option for the Tote, because it is haemorrhaging and we are losing good staff. Although it is important to get good returns for the taxpayer, it is highly debatable whether the Tote is actually an asset of the taxpayer. No one owned the Tote and it became a taxpayer concern only once we nationalised it. We paid nothing for it, so I do not know how the Treasury can sometimes argue that it belongs to the taxpayer. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> The hon. Member for Tewkesbury is laughing.

Racing would get a good income stream, both in the short and medium term, and we could continue to build jobs. I believe that, if we want to, we can resolve the issue of the levy and bring it into the new Tote trust. That would give clear funding streams for sport on the one hand, with good governance by the BHA on the other. I think that the sport would be fit for purpose. Considering that the UK horse racing sport and industry is revered around the world, there would be a major step forward, and I hope that the proposal will be taken seriously and that we can collectively put it together and deliver for sport.</p>

Tote Cheltenham gold cup—now called the Totesport Cheltenham gold cup—has been running for many years and is one of the world’s leading steeplechases, if not the greatest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para8"><a name="08071578000203">The Tote also provides a great deal of prize money and sponsorship for many other races, not only at Cheltenham, but throughout the country. The Tote’s contribution to racing, excluding its levy payments, was £11.3 million last year. If we include the levy payments, its contribution was £20 million last year. The most up-to-date figures are being laid before Parliament today. I do not know what they are, but my guess is that they will show a considerable improvement on what is already a good record for the Tote’s contribution to racing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para9"><a name="08071578000204">The Tote is the largest commercial sponsor of racing by a considerable margin: it sponsored 442 races last year and delivered 42 per cent. of the total prize money on offer through the sport. While we often hear that racing is the sport of kings, it is important to point out that the reality is different. Although royalty are involved in racing and make a welcome contribution, on many occasions the money for a race is as little as £2,000. Given the cost of looking after horses, particularly with the current cost of feeding and transportation, prize money is important. The Tote also provides many other services. There are many betting shops, services on race courses and special low-cost bets that are attractive. The Tote is a national institution, so if it were lost, not only would racing lose out financially, but the racegoers would suffer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para10"><a name="08071578000205">As has been said, the Tote was set up 80 years ago to benefit racing. As has also been pointed out, no Government have ever put any money into racing, so the taxpayer is not due any money from a sale or transfer of the Tote. When the then Home Secretary, the present Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, originally announced his intention to transfer or sell the Tote, a figure of £50 million was mentioned. Some people, myself included, said that that was too much and that the taxpayer was due no return at all for the Tote because no taxpayer ever put any money into it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para11"><a name="08071578000206">The original decision to transfer or sell the Tote was welcomed, but no one could have envisaged that it would take so long to get from there to where we are now, wherever that might be. During a debate on 21 November 2007, after Europe stepped into the debate—I shall return to that point later—I called for the Government to allow an extra two or three months at least for the Tote to come to terms with the European judgment and look at its future options. Those two or three months were granted by the Government, but that is a short delay for coming to terms with the situation. It is a rather different situation from the 10-year delay that we have experienced.</p>

 The Conservative Government in the 1980s were quick to justify their privatisation mania on the basis that they were sometimes getting rid of inefficient, loss-making state enterprises. The hon. Gentleman portrays the Tote as never having been such an enterprise over an 80-year period. He was one of the more enthusiastic privatisers, although not in this place at the time, so does he believe that the sale of the Tote makes any sense whatever for the taxpayer, the racegoer or anyone else involved in the imbroglio?</p>

 I was outside this place at the time, but I certainly supported turning British Steel’s £1.5 million a day loss into profit. I continue to support that kind of thing, but the Tote is a different situation altogether. It was set up for racing. The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central, made the case that it is not so much a business as part of a sport, and I shall advance that argument in a moment.</p>

We were being rebuked for trying to press the matter on. As we have heard, the result of the delay is that the staff at Wigan, whose jobs I believe should be protected, are unsettled, senior members of the Tote have been lost and it is very difficult for the Tote to recruit people. That has had a destabilising effect on it and can hardly be helping its finances. Importantly, it cannot be helping to enhance its value if it is to be sold commercially.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para14"><a name="08071578000211">At the risk of embarrassing the right hon.

The only thing that was included in the Bill was the nationalisation of the Tote, as a number of us pointed out at the time. It was stated outside the House that the purpose was to transfer the Tote to the new trust, which was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Lipsey, but that was not stated in the Bill.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, but may I guide him by saying that the use of the term “fair price” in the 2004 Act, instead of “market price”, was where the whole thing fell down with Europe? We tried to defend the word “fair” as against “market”, but Europe believed that that meant that we were giving a subsidy. Rightly or wrongly, that was the argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para22"><a name="08071578000220">We had a long debate with the EU about whether the price should be a fair price or a market price, and it demanded that it be a market price because of the distortion of trade. Whether we accept it or not, that was its argument. That was what Neelie Kroes, the Commissioner, insisted on, which was why we got into the long discussion about what the market price was. We paid millions to have assessments made by accountants’ firms, and we found ourselves in difficulty. The process fundamentally broke down at the European Union at that time, and others hid behind that later on.</p>

 I agree with the right hon. Gentleman, and I shall return to Europe in a moment, but I am aware that time is pressing on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para23"><a name="08071578000222">I am concerned about the open-market sale, first because that was not what we agreed to when we passed the 2004 Act. Secondly, as I asked the right hon. Gentleman in an intervention, if there is a open-market sale, how can we ensure that racing continues to get the same amount of money from the Tote after the process is finished?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para24"><a name="08071578000223">We have heard a great deal about the 50-50 split, with 50 per cent. going back into racing, but that poses questions. First, what is racing? Secondly, would it get through Europe? The right hon. Gentleman says that it should—not that it would—but the previous proposal should have, too. Important though the money from the sale would be, it would be much less than if the sale had taken place last year, because of the market conditions. Also, it would be a one-off payment. The important thing is the Tote’s year-on-year contribution to racing. If I highlight any point that I am making, it is that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para25"><a name="08071578000224">We find ourselves in a difficult situation. We all know that Europe intervened, as we have discussed, and it is my submission that the European judgment was wrong. That is the view of the all-party group on the racing and bloodstock industries, which is very active. For example, the EU referred to the Tote as a “public company”, but it is a public company only because the Government nationalised it. It stated that a transfer below market value would constitute aid, but who exactly would it aid? The company is already up and running, and has been for 80 years. The proposal was not to transfer the Tote to another company, which probably would have constituted state aid, but a simple administrative change whereby the Tote could, for example, have appointed its own chairman. That is not state aid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para26"><a name="08071578000225">The EU went on to state that such a transfer or sale would “distort the betting market”. I am not sure how many bureaucrats in Europe actually go into betting shops or place bets, but that is simply nonsense. The organisation has been taking bets for 80 years. If the Tote, instead of the Minister, appointed its chairman,  <br></br>

how would that distort the betting market? It is palpable nonsense, so the Government should challenge that ruling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para27"><a name="08071578000226">I am romantic in that I want the Tote to be transferred to the racing trust and believe that that can be achieved. I do not agree entirely with the right hon. Gentleman’s analysis of how it should be done, but I agree in principle that that should be achieved. We are at a crossroads in the financing of racing, and it would be a huge boost to racing if it could run a successful business that continued to put money back into racing. However, I fear that the Minister, whom I greatly admire and consider a friend, is not quite powerful enough to overcome the Treasury’s demands. I do not know whether racing or the Treasury will benefit from those demands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para28"><a name="08071578000227">A couple of Fridays ago, we had about 145 people at a charity dinner in the House for the Injured Jockeys Fund.

There is an appetite for moving forward together, and I hope that the Treasury does not prevent us from doing that.</p>

I have only a passing interest in racing, which is not a sport that particularly attracts me. My interest is the fact that the Tote’s headquarters are in my constituency. Its financial headquarters are in my right hon. Friend’s constituency. The Tote came to Wigan some 20 years ago. It was not an easy shift. It is never easy prising southerners out of Harrods and sorting them out with woad and whippets, but we managed to get them up there and they work well with the local authority. The local authority felt that it was so important to the local economy to get the Tote to come to Wigan that it evicted members of its staff from their offices to put Tote staff in there, and make it a success. The fact that the Tote is still in Wigan, and is a success, proves that that was right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para30"><a name="08071578000232">We have some 600 employees in Wigan. Working relationships are extremely good, with the management, trade unions and work force working well together. That is not only because the Tote a good employer, but the nature of the work is flexible as to the times when people work; mothers can work around school times, and so on. That makes the Tote a valuable employer in the Wigan economy.</p>

They are very important to the Wigan local economy, which like many local economies in the country is in transition, from heavy industry—the steel, mining, cotton and textiles on which it used to be based—to a more modern, service industry-based economy. Getting the staff headquarters to come to Wigan was very important. We had last-minute planning difficulties and again the council evicted some staff to move the Tote into their offices. That is more proof of the importance of the Tote to the local economy, and the council’s view of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para1"><a name="08071578000234">My hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale) was profoundly wrong when he implied that the matter could be left over. It is very important to get a resolution now. I have learned from discussions with the Tote that senior management are already being lost, and in a service industry of this kind it is not infrastructure such as buildings that is the most important thing—it is senior management, and the way they run the organisation. When they are lost, not only does the value of the Tote go down, but the value of whatever sale is made will go down too. It is not just that we need to take account of something in the outside market; it is also a question of the nature of the industry. If it loses its senior management it will lose market value as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para2"><a name="08071578000235">The Minister and his predecessor have been pressing strongly on the future of the Tote.

We have a meeting tomorrow at the highest level—with the Prime Minister. Our one aim will be to impress on him the need to ensure that whatever resolution is reached, it is decided on swiftly, with a guarantee for a number of years that the headquarters of the Tote and its successor will be in Wigan. We are confident that if that guarantee is given, for four, five or seven years, or whatever it may be, the successor will find that Wigan is such a good place for its headquarters that it will stay there and take the opportunities in the international betting field that my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central outlined, so that they can not only maintain job opportunities but expand them, and make Wigan a centre for the betting industry nationally and internationally.

The onward sale of the Tote has been an issue for some time. In fact, it was the Select Committee on Home Affairs, which also brought about the formation of the British Horseracing Board, the forerunner of the British Horseracing Authority, that in 1991 recommended that the Tote should be passed to racing for free. The points that I am making are to underline and support the model put forward by my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para4"><a name="08071578000239">In 2001 the Labour party manifesto said:</p>

However, it has also been made clear that any potential buyer will need to work closely with racing. The Government should pay tribute to the racing industry for its contribution to taking the issue forward. I know that we do not seem to have had much success so far, but we can only keep trying. As co-chair of the all-party group on racing and bloodstock industries I commend the Minister for asking us to get actively involved in many of the outstanding issues in racing, which include the onward sale of the Tote and the levy. It is important that we ask the Government to continue with the granting of the seven-year exclusive licence for the so-called transition period, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central referred. That must be part and parcel of the sale.</p>

I am not just referring to the Tote but to other betting forms, exchanges and operators. I would like the Minister to try to give some assurance that any eventual purchaser of the Tote could not relocate its remote operations—call centre and internet operations—offshore. I should certainly like clarification of that, because it is a significant weakness of the sport’s current funding arrangements that several companies are licensed overseas. There are operators in the Isle of Man, Gibraltar, Ireland, Malta and so on, who pay no levy and no tax to racing. We do not want to lose another whole income stream for racing and the Government.</p>

the sale proceeds. There is some doubt; the difference between the gross and the net, of course, is in issues such as accounting for pensions deficits, the Government’s professional fees, and all such money that might be sliced off instead of giving the 50 per cent. gross amount of the sale to racing. I would like the Minister to comment on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para10"><a name="08071578000245">What we might call the Dick Caborn or Cook model for the future onward sale of the Tote is a seductive and attractive option. I am attracted to it because I do not think that the Government should be committed to selling the Tote to racing. Decoupling the property estate of 540 shops—setting up a racing trust just for pool betting and selling off the betting shops—sounds attractive in theory, but I have my doubts about the value in practice of selling on the Tote pool or setting up a racing trust.</p>

The on-course Tote pool is attractive at Cheltenham or Doncaster St. Leger, my local track, but it is not so attractive on a wet Monday afternoon at Great Leighs or Southwell. We can all come up with examples. I have some doubts. If racing cannot come up with a price for the whole estate, why can we not consider splitting the 540 shops? Perhaps 270 could be contained within the racing trust and the Tote, and the other 270 could be sold to the highest bidder. I have some doubts, although in theory I would like to support that proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para12"><a name="08071578000247">The other issue was combination, another attractive proposal to link the levy to the new Tote and bring in an arbitration mechanism similar to that used by the Copyright Tribunal. That is an attractive option as well, and I would certainly like to hear the Minister’s comments on that model. My right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central said that, hopefully, it could become operational by 1 January 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para13"><a name="08071578000248">On the current credit crunch, the all-party group on racing and bloodstock industries held its annual dinner last night. The chairman of the British Horseracing Authority, Paul Roy, is an expert in the City; he makes his money doing deals on the stock exchange and so on. He said—I will use his exact expression, because I made a note of it—that the current valuation of the Tote was “shot to pieces”. Earlier this year, it was £400 million or £500 million. It started from a baseline of £50 million, as the hon. Member for Tewkesbury said earlier. That is a difficult issue to get around, and I do not know the answer to it.</p>

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="08071578000249"><a name="80715h0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="08071578000518"><b>Mr. Caborn:</b>
 May I help my hon. Friend? The answer is to take the shops and put them into a package. Mike Smith—another experienced City person—or a group would then judge when it should be put into the marketplace. Then we could let the Tote get on with restructuring itself and attacking the international marketplace. There are two separate issues. The principal decision to be taken is whether to decouple the shops from the Tote. When I say the Tote, I mean the pool, the credit and the internet. The Tote could then be split off, and we could say, “Mr. Smith, you will deal with that and get the possible price when you believe that to be right.” We should get on with the Tote. The status quo is not an option, because we are haemorrhaging at the Tote. It must be given a new lease on life. That is what  <br></br>

separates the two. When to flog them on the marketplace is a judgment for Mr. Smith when he believes that the market is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para14"><a name="08071578000252">I have not underlined the significance of the Tote to the local economy in Wigan. I speak as a former leader of Barnsley, which is in the same group of authorities and is similar in size to Wigan, another white working-class area. Barnsley is on the wrong side of the Pennines, but apart from that, it has many characteristics in common with Wigan. As a former leader of Barnsley, I would hate to lose a big company like that with an international reputation. I hope that that aspect will be uppermost in the Minister’s deliberations if and when he comes to a decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para15"><a name="08071578000253">I will finish on a couple of points that were raised earlier. The Minister mentioned the outstanding Turf TV case. I understand that the jury will deliberate on 31 July. I am sure that appeals will be made, which will drag out the case. It is probably a commercially sensitive situation, what with Goldman Sachs’ involvement. Can he outline how many bids have been received and how many of those he feels are positive bids that ought to be considered rather than dismissed? How many are serious bids? One point on which I disagreed with the hon. Member for Tewkesbury involved referring the matter back to Europe. It took two years to bottom it the last time it was referred to Europe, and I can see it dragging out for a further two years. That is the last thing that the people of Wigan want. I will leave it there. The issue is important to the House, but it is particularly important to the people who work in Wigan.</p>

 I shall keep my remarks brief in order to allow the Minister to respond, hopefully in some detail. It has been clear from today’s very welcome debate that some hon. Members here are much more familiar with the history of the Tote than I am. The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn) has played a central role in the painful, extended labour that is the debate about where the Tote will ultimately end up. I have never bought a copy of the <i>Racing Post</i>, although I confess to being an occasional purchaser of <i>The Guardian</i>; obviously, I need to change my purchasing habits, or I will not have access to insider tips about which horse to bet on at which race course.</p>

Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner) made a naked pitch for jobs—as good constituency Members, we all understand that he should—and the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) made a strong point, which had not been debated until he raised it, about offshore betting and how it affects the industry as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para17"><a name="08071578000256">The Tote is a large employer, with 4,000 employees. Members have referred to its 450 shops, or 540—I am not quite sure what the number is—and its large presence throughout the country. It has significant employment implications. The Tote, along with the levy, makes a substantial contribution to the industry, so we need to resolve the issue. The policy has had a long gestation period; Members will have seen the time line helpfully provided by the British Horseracing Authority, which did not go back in any detail to 1928, when the original Act of Parliament was passed, but concentrated on more recent years, including the announcement in March 2000 of the intention to sell the Tote to a racing trust and two separate manifesto commitments that it would be appropriate for the Government to uphold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para18"><a name="08071578000257">My final comments relate to the points made by the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central, who introduced the debate. He described clearly where we need to go from here: delivering on the manifesto commitment, which is a responsibility for the Minister to pick up; delivering for the Treasury, which is clearly seeking something out of the sale; delivering for racing, most importantly, and ensuring that the industry continues to receive the support that it needs; ensuring as far as possible that jobs are secure; and allowing the Tote to grow and take advantage of the many technological developments emerging with the internet and so on, to allow it to extend to other markets and ensure its long-term survivability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para19"><a name="08071578000258">The right hon. Member made an interesting proposal about decoupling the Tote shops from the Tote. Other Members have rightly questioned the timing of that, in relation to where the market is nationally and internationally, and questioned whether now is the best time to secure the best possible value. I shall listen carefully to the Minister’s response to see how he intends to address that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para20"><a name="08071578000259">I think that the right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para22"><a name="08071578000264">I pay tribute to the horse racing fraternity. The one thing that unites us on both sides of the House is the importance of horse racing to British industry. We can be rightly proud of horse racing in the UK. We now have 60 race courses employing more than 88,000 people, and about 9,000 races a year. I understand that about £10 billion is bet through off-course bookmakers, and a study by Deloitte last year suggested that it contributes well over £3 billion to the economy—a significant sum of money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para23"><a name="08071578000265">In a previous debate in this Chamber, my hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) suggested that it sometimes seems that there are as many bodies representing different parts of racing as there are races. I am sure that the Minister will agree that a little consolidation would be a small step in helping us to move forward. Sadly, however, on the matter before us there have been too many headlines on the front pages of our newspapers, not least in the <i>Racing Post</i><i>, </i>rather than on the back pages. It is grabbing the news for the wrong reasons, which is the background to today’s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para24"><a name="08071578000266">Three outstanding issues hover over the industry. The first, which has been mentioned, is the resolution of the levy—the annual lump sum agreed by the levy board and paid by the bookmakers to horse racing. The second issue is the on-course bookmakers dispute, their legal status and the charge that they pay to a race course, which has been thrown into disarray by drafting errors in the Gambling Act 2005. The third issue is the subject of today’s debate—the future of the Tote itself, which was first mooted back in 1999, but still rumbles on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para25"><a name="08071578000267">I pay tribute to hon. Members who have commented today. All spoke with passion, not least my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson), who illustrated the Tote’s importance to Cheltenham and the value that it brings not only to that race course, but to others around the country. I pay tribute to the all-party group on racing and bloodstock industries, which provides a wealth of experience. However, I find it bizarre that the Government, who are tasked to solve such problems, have handed over responsibility to a parliamentary group that does not have the clerical support or the finances to answer the questions. I wonder whether the Culture, Media and Sport Committee might have been a better source of scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para26"><a name="08071578000268">The battle scars of this saga are well documented, and they have been mentioned again today. The matter was first raised by Labour in 1999 and again in an election pledge in June 2001 to sell off the Tote. In 2004 there was the debacle with the European Union about a possible conflict with state aid rules. Another election pledge followed in May 2005, and although we did not actually have an election in 2007—of course we thought that we might—I am sure that if we look in the archives one day, we will see that it would have been in that election manifesto, too. We could place bets on whether it will be in the June 2010 election manifesto. Who knows? Perhaps the Glasgow, East by-election will have an influence on whether that date changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para27"><a name="08071578000269">Sadly, the question about the future of the Tote has rumbled on, as has repeatedly been mentioned today. Bids have been agreed, then scuppered, prices confirmed,  <br></br>

It amended the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004. The Tote should have been sold off, for which the Act made provision, but because that was not going to happen when the Act came into fruition, an SI had to be introduced to allow the state to continue ownership. That was when we first raised the issue before us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="80715h0007.htm_para29"><a name="08071578000271">At that time the Minister and I were pretty kind to each other because we were still trying to understand our briefs.

We are not as grey as the former Minister for Sport, although it is clear from the manner in which he gives his speeches that he has not lost any of his energy—clearly, he is still eating three Shredded Wheat in the morning.

In East Devon, that will mean having to find approximately 450 extra places by 2015—a feat that may prove particularly difficult, as all seven secondary schools in the constituency are full and, with no land to build on, temporary classrooms will be needed for at least the next three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para1"><a name="08071578000351">Devon county council and the Learning and Skills Council both agree that there is a real need for additional 14-to-19 education capacity in East Devon, although no real provision has yet been made for post-16 education. In fact, I was shocked and appalled to discover that the Liberal Democrat-led county council was attempting to sell off land adjacent and belonging to the community college at Withycombe Village road to the tune of approximately £500,000. Now is the time not to start selling off ground belonging to community colleges, but to examine ways of acquiring land to accommodate students. That land is used by 90 children a day. If it was sold, classes for next year would have to be cancelled. When contacted by the school, Devon county council was, amazingly, unaware of the school’s use of buildings on the land, despite providing funding for two of them. I simply cannot understand what the county council thought it was doing.</p>

There are also 600 more teachers and 1,800 more teaching assistants.”—[<i>Official Report</i>, 25 June 2008; Vol. 478, c. 284.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para3"><a name="08071578000353">Not for the first or last time, the Prime Minister was slightly missing the point. East Devon has been unfortunate in receiving very little of what has been allocated to Devon as a whole. In the past 10 years, only one school has been rebuilt and only 44 additional classrooms provided, and there are only 103 more teachers and only 127 more teaching assistants. That is an extremely small proportion of what has been allocated to Devon as a whole. Why?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para4"><a name="08071578000354">In the light of all that, the logical solution appears to be for the Owen building on the Rolle College campus to be retained for educational use, as it could house a greatly expanded post-16 centre, accommodating up to 1,000 students. Not only does that accord with the stated wishes of the late Professor Levinsky, but the Owen building can provide immediate good-quality, purpose-built accommodation for a large number of young people from 14 to 19 and already includes facilities such as a library. Use of the site will provide opportunities to work collaboratively with other organisations to offer a range of educational qualifications. That may include opportunities for the development of training and education for adults, as well as the provision of services to the wider community of Exmouth and East Devon.</p>

in England” to introduce new legislation to strengthen the current funding entitlement for adults. The Prime Minister stated that</p>
<a name="80715h0010.htm_brev1"><a name="08071578000432"><ul><p class="tabletext">“we need a major drive to upskill our workforce, investing in training to boost the employability of millions of adults, help employers harness the skills they need to build successful British businesses, and create a more prosperous society.”</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para6"><a name="08071578000356">One hopes that, having recognised that need for training and education, the Government are actively seeking ways to implement their legislation. We propose that if the Owen building is successfully secured for educational purposes, adult learning could also take place on the Rolle campus. Firms in Devon have been experiencing difficulty in hiring adults with appropriate skills and training. Acquiring the Owen building for educational purposes could work towards successfully addressing that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para7"><a name="08071578000357">In addition to more direct educational uses of the site, a broader range of community uses could be established. If the council is attempting to sell off community college land, it is all the more essential to purchase the Owen building to house increased student numbers. Aside from legislation that will necessitate an increase in capacity for 14-to-19 education, the new town of Cranbrook and the regional spatial strategy resulting in an increase in the population within travelling distance of Exmouth provide the potential to sustain post-16 and adult training in the future. The main study report for the Exeter, Torbay, Mid Devon and East Devon housing market assessment, launched on 24 July 2007, has found that 19,000 additional properties are required to be built in the area over the next five years to meet an acute shortage, substantially increasing the amount of housing in the area and, subsequently, the need for more educational capacity. Surely the Minister agrees that with the increased pressure put on local authorities by new education legislation and an increase in housing in the area, the Government should be doing all they can to assist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para8"><a name="08071578000358">The county council was apparently prepared to take a leading role in securing the site. In December 2007, when pledging £3 million, the leader of the county council, Councillor Brian Greenslade, said,</p>
<a name="80715h0010.htm_brev2"><a name="08071578000359"><ul><p class="tabletext">“Devon county council recognises what a body blow losing Rolle college will be for Exmouth and we are therefore pleased to be working with other stakeholders to give what support we can to help deliver further education in Exmouth.”</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para9"><a name="08071578000360">The county council is working in partnership with the Learning and Skills Council, East Devon district council, the South West of England Regional Development Agency, Exeter college and Exmouth community college to ensure the long-term viability of this facility. That cross-party consortium has the express aim of assisting Government plans to retain British teenagers in either education or training until the age of 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para10"><a name="08071578000361">Despite meetings with the university prior to the site being placed on the open market, the consortium’s efforts to purchase the Owen building and surrounding campus for educational purposes suffered a setback with Plymouth university’s unexpected announcement that it was pulling out of exclusive negotiations and putting the site for sale on the open market. Surely the Minister must agree that that was an act of bad faith on the part of the university.</p>

However, in the light of the current economic climate and the developer’s desire to incorporate the consortium’s wishes, it revised the offer to a smaller sum. That was rejected by the university, which is now planning to sell the land in smaller plots. I hope that that is not being done to avoid a section106 agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para13"><a name="08071578000364">However, in a letter of 13 September 2007, the Minister said that as the funding from the sale would be reinvested in educational provision on the Plymouth campus, it was to his way of thinking satisfactory, regardless of the acknowledged need for education provision in Exmouth. Although it is true that that money may be invested in educational provision in Plymouth, does he really believe that that was a constructive answer? Surely he must concede that it does not begin to solve the multitude of problems caused by the lack of educational provision in Exmouth?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para14"><a name="08071578000365">The Minister overlooks the loss of revenue to Exmouth, and the amount of public money that will be wasted if the new college building is flattened to make way for more housing. The Owen building was constructed only three years ago, at a cost of £2 million, financed by the Higher Education Funding Council. To demolish it to make way for housing would surely not be an appropriate use of public money. Is he suggesting that a purpose-built educational faculty, recently paid for with taxpayer’s money, should be levelled by bulldozers to make way for yet more housing? At a time of economic crisis, with the cost of living continually rising, does the Minister honestly believe that taxpayers would see that as an acceptable and rational way to spend their money? That money was spent on education in Exmouth, not Plymouth, and as such the town should not be forced to suffer through the university’s decision to move its campus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para15"><a name="08071578000367">In October 2007, I led the same cross-party delegation to meet the Minister for the South West, the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw). He pointed out, as previously mentioned, that Devon county council and the Learning and Skills Council agree that there is a real need for additional 14-to-19 educational capacity. On one hand, that observation gives credence to the consortium’s efforts to purchase the site; but on the other, it demonstrates contradictions among Ministers and shows their inability to work within a joined-up Government. If the Minister for the South West can appreciate the situation and support the consortium’s work to secure the site for further education, why is he being directly opposed by his colleague, the Minister here today?</p>

group formed to oversee the future development and well-being of the town is backing the consortium’s plans. In a report on the proposals, an association spokesman said:</p>
<a name="80715h0010.htm_brev3"><a name="08071578000433"><ul><p class="tabletext">“It is our view that the campus should not be used for residential apartments or housing.”</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para17"><a name="08071578000369">Many Exmouth residents hope that the site does not end up in the hands of developers, as they are acutely aware of the lack of available space in Exmouth or the surrounding area to build a facility from scratch as suitable as the Owen building. Instead, a new school would have to be provided at a cost of about £25 million, and there is no obvious site for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para18"><a name="08071578000370">On 20 May 2008, I wrote to the Minister to point out that true long-term value for money for public funds would be gained for the local community and economy only by establishing a post-16-year-old college, and not by razing an outstanding facility to the ground. I requested a meeting with him and the Minister for the South West. The response that I received simply stated that</p>
<a name="80715h0010.htm_brev4"><a name="08071578000434"><ul><p class="tabletext">“less funding for schools and further education in Exmouth would mean more funding for higher education in Plymouth”.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para19"><a name="08071578000371">That naively neglects the very real and pressing need for education provision in the Exmouth area, which has already been recognised by the Minister for the South West. It is yet another example of the impact that central and regional policies are having on small coastal and rural communities in the south-west. It is time for the Government to step in to resolve the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para20"><a name="08071578000372">The strategy that says that we should create main centres of economic, cultural and academic excellence takes no account of the special conditions that exist in coastal and rural areas like the south-west, as the communities there also need to be sustained. How does the response make Exmouth a more sustainable community? The town has already lost a vital economic asset; all stakeholders, including Ministers, should be working together to ensure that something of worth is put in its place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para21"><a name="08071578000373">One of the schools hoping to move onto the newly vacated site is Exmouth community college. It is the largest secondary school in Europe, and its facilities are among the best in the country. The school received a good rating in its latest Ofsted report, and it now has a considerable waiting list. At present, the sixth form has 389 pupils, but the school will have to accommodate another 350 extra pupils by 2015, when education up to the age of 18 becomes compulsory. However, the school has no room to expand or to build new facilities. If the Minister is satisfied with less funding for schools and further education in Exmouth, where does he propose housing those students?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para22"><a name="08071578000374">Exmouth community college is the only secondary school in this expanding seaside town, and a large percentage of learners stay on into the sixth form. The school has a year 11 stay-on rate of 82 per cent., which is considerably higher than the national average; in addition, this year it accommodated 20 new students from surrounding schools, who were attracted by the courses and facilities available. There has been a significant increase in results over the last three years; and students’ progress, which was inadequate three years ago, is now good throughout the college. Despite those impressive results, the college loses a number of potential students and there is a significant post-16 drop out level in East  <br></br>

Devon due to certain courses being available only at Exeter college or East Devon college. The acquisition of Rolle would enable those courses to be provided locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para23"><a name="08071578000375">It almost beggars belief that such a real need is being ignored by a Government who like to pride themselves on believing that education is important. In November 2007, during topical questions the Minister for Schools and Learners stated:</p>
<a name="80715h0010.htm_brev5"><a name="08071578000435"><ul><p class="tabletext">“I remember visiting Exmouth community college last summer with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families. The issues with that site were pointed out to us, and I have sympathy with the college’s plans.”—[<i>Official Report</i>, 12 November 2007; Vol. 467, c. 395.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para24"><a name="08071578000376">He praised the good work of the college, and hoped that it would continue. If the Minister for Schools and Learners and the Minister for the South West are both able to see sense and support the plans of the community college, why does the Minister remain so blinkered in his view?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para25"><a name="08071578000377">Unless the school receives proper support, in the form of increased space and facilities, there is a real possibility that the good work that has been achieved will suffer. Surely the Minister must agree that that is in no way a desirable outcome?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para26"><a name="08071578000378">With the impact of the new specialised diplomas for young people, there is a genuine need for schools and colleges to set up partnerships with other institutions in order to provide the wide range of resources required to teach the new courses. If the community college were to collaborate with Exeter college and Devon county council by sharing facilities and staffing at the Rolle site, the young people of Exmouth and the surrounding area, including Exeter, would have access to the very best curriculums and qualifications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para27"><a name="08071578000379">The future of Rolle college campus in Exmouth can no longer be overlooked or brushed under the carpet. It is imperative that Brian Greenslade, the leader of the Liberal Democrat-led county council, puts a formal offer to Plymouth university for the purchase of the Owen building. The university has no formal bid on the table. It is struggling with debt; and by selling the land in small parcels, it would appear that the consortium is in an excellent position to purchase the Owen building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para28"><a name="08071578000380">The consortium, a cross-party group, is attempting to comply with Government policy in an area of the country with an outstanding school that is struggling to provide for its pupils. If the campus goes to the highest bidder for redevelopment, the town will be left with nothing. Although the consortium continues to work towards achieving a positive outcome for Exmouth from the Rolle closure, it is receiving little assistance from the university, the Learning and Skills Council or the SWERDA, which has refused to give any funding to the project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para29"><a name="08071578000381">I raised the matter at Prime Minister’s questions and was told that he would look into the matter. I subsequently sent the right hon. Gentleman a detailed letter, yet I have heard nothing. Ministers must realise that it is a real and pressing matter. Unless measures are taken quickly, it will have a detrimental impact on the young people of Exmouth and East Devon as a whole.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) on securing this debate. As he rightly said, it is an important subject. It is appropriate to debate it in this Chamber, as it genuinely involves a balance, which the House has to strive to maintain, between local needs and discretion on the one hand and national policies and priorities on the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para30"><a name="08071578000383">I assure the hon. Gentleman that the quality and quantity of education available to young people and adults in East Devon is of equal significance to the Government as it is to him. That was made apparent in the answer that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister gave in the House on 25 June. I hope that it will be made evident also by what I have to say this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para31"><a name="08071578000384">The closure of Rolle college campus raises two main issues. Both are important, but I stress that they are distinct. The first is the decision to transfer the University of Plymouth’s faculty of education from Exmouth to the university’s main campus in Plymouth. As the hon. Gentleman has indicated, that decision was taken by the university’s board of governors in the autumn of 2005. In announcing the change, the late—and very much missed—vice-chancellor, Professor Roland Levinsky, described the reasons for that decision as follows:</p>
<a name="80715h0010.htm_brev6"><a name="08071578000436"><ul><p class="tabletext">“This is a necessary development to help us achieve the mission of becoming an international centre of learning and research excellence, serving the whole of the South West peninsula.”</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para32"><a name="08071578000385">Along with many other people in the Exmouth area, the hon. Gentleman protested against the board of governors’ decision at the time, as was his right. The reasons for doing so were, frankly, entirely understandable. They included concern for the future of teacher training at the university of Plymouth and for the staff and students of the faculty of education. Notably, in view of the fact that most newly qualified teachers take up their first posts near the institutions where they trained, their concerns also included, quite properly, the possible effects of relocation on the supply of teachers to schools in the Exmouth area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para33"><a name="08071578000386">I emphasise that the university authorities attempted to give reassurance on those issues from the start and made it clear that the relocation from Exmouth did not signal the end of teacher training at the university. Most importantly, a new faculty of education building on the main campus was promised at a cost of £25 million. We have since heard that the building has been named after the Rolle family, in recognition of their long-standing connections with the institution and the area. Teacher training at Plymouth is in a healthy and robust state, and with almost £4 million of grant from the Training and Development Agency for Schools to support 321 training places in the next academic year, the success that it enjoyed at Rolle college is set to continue in its new home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para34"><a name="08102365000004">That was the process by which the decision to close Rolle college was taken, the reasons for it and its effects. It might well be asked, however, what the Government were doing while that was happening. That is where we come to the crux and heart of the matter. Over the past three years, unlike my predecessors as Ministers for Higher Education, from the Conservative party as well as my own, I have reminded the House many times of the limitations of the Government’s  <br></br>

powers to intervene in university management decisions. To a significant extent, those are limitations that Parliament has put in place by enacting, for example, the Education Reform Act 1988, the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 and the Higher Education Act 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="80715h0010.htm_para35"><a name="08071578000389">It was entirely right of Parliament to have acted in that way. I strongly believe that the historical autonomy of universities is part and parcel of their academic freedom and the strength of our higher education system in this country. It allows them to contribute fully to the well-being of their local areas and identify and pursue their unique institutional missions. If one compares the state and performance of our higher education institutions to many of those overseas, one will see that university autonomy is one of the factors that lead to the strength of our performance. Indeed, I can do no better on that point than quote the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts.) This is one of the areas in which, party politics aside, I am bound to agree with him. He said:</p>
