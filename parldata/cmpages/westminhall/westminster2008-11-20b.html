 Welcome to the Chair, Miss Begg. Just over 40 years ago, the surgeon Christiaan Barnard performed the first heart transplant on a human. The 55-year-old recipient survived for only 18 days, but the operation was an important medical milestone, showing that transplant surgery was a viable procedure for patients with organ failure. Since then, surgical techniques have moved on enormously in terms of both the range of transplants performed and their success rate. Today, transplant surgery helps thousands of desperately ill patients every year, giving them a new lease of life and new hope for the future against all odds. However, the impact that this miracle of medical science can bring to patients&#146; lives is limited by the fact that the demand for organs far exceeds the supply. Currently, 8,000 patients are on the waiting list for transplants. Of those, 3,000 will eventually receive surgery, but 1,000 will die while waiting for organs to become available and thousands face a long and uncertain future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para1"><a name="08112070000007">That is why my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), when she was a Health Minister, set up the organ donation taskforce in 2006 to consider the barriers to organ donation and make recommendations on how they could be overcome. In its first report, published in January, the taskforce made 14 recommendations, all of which were accepted by the Department of Health and its counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08112070000008">One of the key issues to which the taskforce pointed was the need for better donor identification and referral. None of us underestimates what an incredible gift it is to donate one&#146;s organs, handing life to a patient on the brink of death. The amazing stories of children, parents and grandparents given new hope and more time with their families and friends are eloquent testimony. Indeed, families of deceased donors frequently say that they have drawn great consolation from the fact that their tragedy led to a happier outcome for someone else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08112070000009">The problem is that at present, only one in four people are on the donor register. Numbers have trebled since 1997, which shows that we are heading in the right direction, but even so, the gap between those registering for organ donation and the number waiting for a transplant is growing. Why is that happening? We know that there are many misconceptions that discourage people from joining the donor list. For instance, there is a myth that one must be a certain age to become a donor, which is not true. It is also suggested that donors will not receive the same quality of care in hospital, which is frankly an affront to clinicians&#146; ethical conscience. There is also a   <br>

squeamish belief that organs are removed from dying people while they are still alive. That is not true; it is a myth that stems from the fact that some organs are retrieved, but from people who are dead. A considerable proportion of people, estimated at 90 per cent. of the UK population, say that they support organ donation, yet only 26 per cent. have signed the organ donor register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08112070000010">Our first priority must be to increase the number of people putting themselves forward as donors. That means exploding some of the myths, making a positive case for organ donation and translating people&#146;s good intentions into hard action. Starting a public debate about organ donation is an important end in itself. Since the taskforce reported in January, a further 1 million people have signed up to the register, and the Department is now embarking on a &#163;4.5 million publicity drive with the ambitious aim of getting 20 million people on the register by 2010, working towards 25 million by 2013.</p>

 I certainly support what the Minister is saying and what the Government are doing on the matter, but there is one thing that I find curious, and I would be grateful for her reflections. Although more and more people have signed up to the organ donor register&#151;not as many as we would like, but many more&#151;and that graph is going upwards, the number of cadaveric transplants, which is the desired end result, has gone flat. That suggests, curiously, that there is no link between the number of people signing the register and the number of transplants. We need people to sign to prevent the number from falling, but it does not appear to be the solution, for some reason, to the lack of a rise in the number of transplants.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman touches on a number of points addressed by the taskforce in both its reports&#151;I shall return to them briefly in my comments&#151;about arrangements in the health service to ensure that even where the health service is aware that somebody is on the donor register, or where donation has been indicated in discussions with the family and the individual, the system works to its optimum potential. If he will bear with me, I will go on to discuss ways of ensuring that we close the gap that he identified, as well as our response to the taskforce&#146;s report on presumed consent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08112070000013">I know that the hon. Gentleman is knowledgeable, and takes a great deal of interest in the subject. He will be aware that only a tiny proportion of people die in circumstances that could be described, if he will forgive me, as conducive to organ donation. The window of opportunity between a patient&#146;s death and the removal of the organ from their body is narrow indeed, and only a tiny proportion of deaths fit the bill every year. That means that we must maximise the chances that the few people who die in the right circumstances, if I can call them that, are willing to donate their organs. That is why the chief medical officer made the case for changing the law to presumed consent, so that clinicians could presume that every patient is happy for their organs to be removed unless they specifically opt out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08112070000014">Given the seriousness of the organ shortage and the sensitivities and complications surrounding the proposal, the Secretary of State asked the taskforce to consider that question separately as a matter of urgency.

grateful for the thoroughness with which the taskforce has responded. Its second report, published this week, emphasised how finely balanced the arguments are, but it argued in the end that donation rates could be optimised without presumed consent: that is, within the current legislation and without the requirement for further legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08112070000015">As part of a large body of evidence, the taskforce carefully examined the situation in Spain, which has the highest donor rate in the world and is frequently cited as proof that presumed consent works. It concluded that Spain&#146;s success was due not to presumed consent but to how its medical systems are organised and the unenviable fact that Spain has a high rate of road traffic deaths, which often give rise to circumstances suitable for organ donation. On the back of those findings, the Secretary of State decided that our immediate priorities should be in line with the taskforce&#146;s initial recommendations; increasing the number of people on the organ donor register, as I have already mentioned, but also reforming local and national systems so that we can optimise the potential for donation and help as many transplant patients as possible. We have already taken some key steps since the taskforce published its report in January, and I would like to provide a brief progress update on those steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08112070000016">First, at a national level, we have a new national clinical director for transplantation and a programme delivery board, which will provide strong leadership and oversee the implementation of the taskforce&#146;s recommendations. Secondly, we are strengthening the local work force to help the NHS to increase the number of donors. The NHS blood and transplant service is in the process of increasing the number of national donor transplant co-ordinators by 146 per cent., with 29 new appointments already made. In addition, all trusts have been asked to appoint clinical donation champions and to establish donation committees, to drive through local changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08112070000017">Thirdly and finally, we are putting in place local systems and infrastructure to maximise the opportunities for organ donation. That includes online systems to speed up the allocation of donated organs and reimbursing hospitals for the costs associated with organ donations, thereby removing any financial disincentives to transplantation. We must also ensure that the NHS is in a position to cope with the additional organs that will become available for transplant, which is why we are working with the national commissioning group to build a stronger network of organ retrieval teams across the UK. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) took part in a programme on this subject on Channel 4, so he will recall that the surgeons from Spain who featured in that programme made particular reference to the fact that the real benefits, and therefore increased donations, came from having those advocates and that system in each hospital.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08112070000019">He very much hoped that Ministers in the Department would reaffirm that that reorganisation is their top priority at this stage. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>

 I can certainly confirm for my hon. Friend that it is a top priority. I can also confirm that resources have been made available to ensure that those services are developed, so the Department is moving forward on that issue. Part of that process is about increasing the number of people on the organ donor register, to ensure that access to organs is possible. However, as I have already mentioned, the process is also about investment in the relevant services and about the discussions with the families and patients, regardless of whether or not they are prepared to be a donor, to ensure that that work is done. As I have said, the systems to ensure that referrals work quickly and accurately are also important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08112070000021">The taskforce predicts that, if we implemented all  14 recommendations from its first report, that could lead to a 50 per cent. increase in organ donation rates within five years. In response to the point made by my hon. Friend, may I say that we intend to implement those recommendations? However, the Department is of the view that, because of our commitments in this priority area, we can do better than that. We would like to see organ donation rates rise from about 800 a year to 1,400 a year by 2013, which would put the UK alongside the countries with the best rates in Europe. Of course, hon. Members should bear in mind the fact that, on average, each donor can help three patients, so such an increase would help an extra 1,800 people a year to receive the transplant that they so desperately need, which would be a considerable achievement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08112070000022">I do not underestimate, however, the urgency of the situation or the desperate consequences for the thousands of people awaiting transplant surgery if that approach does not yield the improvement that the taskforce expects. It is for that reason that the Secretary of State has made it clear that we intend to keep a very close eye on progress and, if necessary, we will bring more radical solutions to the House, including the prospect of introducing some form of presumed consent. Closing the door on any option means closing the door on patients who are on the very edge of life&#151;patients for whom a transplant represents their last hope&#151;which is why we need to keep an open mind while continuing to make the important reforms that the taskforce has recommended. The lessons for us are quite clear, given the progress that Spain has been able to make. We are determined to turn the situation in the UK around, and I believe that in the years ahead we can achieve a substantial increase both in the number of organs that are made available and, more importantly, in the number of patients whose lives are transformed by transplant surgery.</p>

register and I have held my organ donor card since 1986. For 10 years before that, I think that it was known as the kidney donor card, before it was expanded to become the broader organ donor card. Interestingly, I was comparing donor cards with my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) in the Members Tea Room earlier this week, and he informed me that, when he was first elected to the House in 1979, his very first debate was about taking forward the whole donor campaign. He had had his card since 1979 and it still had that date on it, which was pretty impressive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08112070000024">To discuss organ donation is literally to discuss the question of life and death. The House must recognise that, and I am sure that the whole House will join me in paying tribute to all those people who are donors, whether of blood, plasma or bone marrow, and all those people who are on the organ donation register. The number of people on that register is increasing; 15.8 million people was the last publicly recorded figure, according to NHS transplant data. In particular, we must pay tribute not only to all those people who have given up their organs in death so that others might live but to their friends and families who, in their moment of grief, were prepared to support organ donation. Although all hon. Members will doubtless hold strong opinions on this issue and will seek, quite rightly, to call the Government to account, I have no doubt that this debate will be underpinned in all our minds by the awareness of these selfless acts by hundreds of people across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08112070000025">Many of us will remember the first transplant; indeed, the Minister herself referred to it earlier. It was performed by Dr. Christiaan Barnard in South Africa in 1967. It is one of the very first memories that I have of news on television, along with Churchill&#146;s funeral and the first man to step on the moon, events that all took place during those pioneering days of the 1960s. As of today, 7,981 people in Britain are waiting for transplants, but only about 3,000 transplants are carried out each year, tragically leading to the situation in which more than 1,000 people die each year for want of a transplant. The chief medical officer has stated that other people are &#147;dying silently&#148;, because doctors know that there is no hope of them receiving treatment, so they are not putting them on the transplant waiting lists. In Britain, we have about 13 donors per million in our population, whereas Spain&#151;the best in the world&#151;has 35 per million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08112070000026">This issue was last raised in legislative terms during the passage of the Human Tissue Bill in 2004, when  the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) pushed for a system of presumed consent. I dare say that we will hear more from him in a moment. This is an issue of conscience and is therefore free vote territory, certainly for the Opposition. Although I am the Conservative spokesman on health, on this issue, my words today do not constitute a party line on presumed consent. When we voted on introducing presumed consent in 2004, I voted against it, as did the current Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08112070000027">I welcome the debate, which comes after Monday&#146;s publication of the expert taskforce&#146;s report on presumed consent. The taskforce was commissioned to look into the issue by the Prime Minister in January, following his apparent conversion. In his homiletic article for <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> of 13 January, he said:</p>

I pay tribute to Elisabeth Buggins and her team for the thorough and thoughtful process that they have undertaken. It is refreshing to see a progression of thinking in the report, from the group having disparate views on the matter to its members reaching broad consensus. Not only were the group&#146;s views disparate, but, according to the journalist Michael White&#146;s article in <i>The Guardian</i> this week:</p>
<a name="81120h0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08112070000163"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Ministers had been assured that a majority of its members favoured &#145;presumed consent&#146;&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08112070000030">In paragraph 2.7 of the report, the taskforce crystallised its task as seeking to check &#147;whether the intuitive answer&#148;&#151;presumed consent&#151;&#147;is, in fact, correct.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08112070000031">We cannot escape the fact that this subject touches on people&#146;s notions of what is appropriate in death. It also touches on the sanctity and ownership of our bodies, in terms of any form of living will before death, and on the wishes and interests of the next of kin after death. However, the primary hurdle is the evidence as to whether a change in the law would lead to an increase in organ transplants and to universal access to them across the country. The Minister has sought to address that issue. There seems to be no evidence to suggest that that hurdle can be cleared, but the taskforce did not completely write off presumed consent. It noted that it &#147;may deliver real benefits&#148;, but the stronger concern, which outweighed that possibility, was that it</p>
<a name="81120h0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08112070000164"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;carries a significant risk of making the current situation worse.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="81120h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08112070000032">The taskforce ultimately opposed a move to presumed consent at this stage. Its important, objective report is a good basis on which to build policies and decide our direction for the future. It will be interesting to note whether those who do not agree with the report&#146;s outcome go to the usual refuge of those who do not like a report&#151;disputing it and asking whether its process was flawed. I shall look forward to that debate.</p>

In order to assert that it is, one has to look at the figures in the years before and after the change in the law to see whether any other factors were relevant. There was an issue in France, but I believe that it was some years later and was not related to a misapplication of the law. Therefore, I do not think that the case was exactly as she put it.</p>

A particular concern is the preservation of patient trust when there are fears about the temptation to harvest organs. I absolutely support the Minister&#146;s comments about such suggestions being an affront to doctors. Looking at the issue from the other end of the telescope, we must deal with the fears of those whose ability to feel well-served by medical and health care professionals is based on that element of trust. That is why this issue is so important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="81120h0002.htm_para1"><a name="08112070000039">I think that we all want the amount of transplant surgery in the UK to rise to European levels, particularly those in Spain, or to those in America. What is needed is an expansion in the capacity of transplant surgery across the country, which means having trained surgeons and properly equipped support units, keeping organs from degenerating, and having universal coverage by donor transplant co-ordinators, or advocates&#151;that word has been used. Where we do it, we do it well, but it is all too patchy in the UK. Although Spain is prayed in aid, transplant surgery is so widespread there, in so many categories, that the prior consent of the individual or next of kin is established without needing to rely on the presumption of consent. The question then becomes whether presumed consent is the best way of educating a populace about organ donation and convincing them that it is the right thing to do.</p>

has fewer organs available for donation than we have in Britain. Equally, the USA has achieved an impressive increase in donor numbers while rejecting any legislative move towards presumed consent. If experts cannot produce evidence that a system of presumed consent would increase the number of transplants, there is no case for changing the law, and we should focus on increasing education and capacity. The report made it clear that a number of other avenues need to be pursued before a move to presumed consent can be entertained.</p>

The Government have performed very poorly on organ donation. Answers to parliamentary questions have revealed that between April 2007 and March 2008, of the 444 hearts that were offered for transplantation, 317 were not accepted because they were damaged or had poor function, or for a reason unrelated to the condition of the heart. Of the 127 hearts retrieved, only three were found to be unsuitable on arrival at the transplant centre. That means that of 444 hearts&#151;that is 444 donor patients, of course, and 444 often very difficult conversations with families in the first throes of grief&#151;only 124 were made use of. That suggests that there is a prior question to consider in trying to increase the number available.</p>

That information was in an answer in May. Will the Minister therefore tell the House what has become of the organ care system, which I understand has been piloted at Papworth? Instead of the organs being kept on ice, where they degenerate, they can be kept operating, oxygenated and enriched until they are needed. That has to be a better option, and we know that it works well elsewhere. Why do the Government appear to be dragging their feet on that issue?</p>

Those data are currently collected through UK Transplant&#146;s potential donor audit, although it should focus on conversion rates&#151;getting a new organ in a person&#151;rather than donation rates. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to tell us what progress has been made on that.</p>

The first was education aimed at clinicians and teams involved in donation, and the second was education for the general public, and specifically the black and minority ethnic population, to raise awareness of donation. Has the Department commissioned research on how best to do that, and when will it report? As with so many areas of health, the need for donor organs is three to four times higher among black and minority ethnic citizens than among the white population, due to higher rates of diabetes and kidney problems. What measure do the Government propose to encourage higher rates of organ donation among those racial groups?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="81120h0002.htm_para18"><a name="08112070000056">Having looked at the full cycle of organ donation  and transplantation, is the Minister aware of a series  of errors in the prescribing and dispensing of immunosuppressants used to prevent organ rejection? Those errors have resulted in serious long-term medical consequences for patients. There are currently two immunosuppressant products used post-transplant that have the same active ingredient, but due to their narrow therapeutic indices, they are not freely interchangeable. As with many drugs, they are often prescribed on the basis of the active ingredient. That can lead to inadvertent switching between the two products, which could lead to organ rejection. There are two known cases of that, and a further 36 reports of such inadvertent prescribing or dispensing errors that have, thankfully, had less serious consequences.</p>

need for retransplantation. Does the Minister agree that urgent attention and guidance is required to ensure that all prescribing and dispensing health care professionals are made clearly aware of the difference between the two products and the need to clarify which they  intend a patient to receive, so that those errors are prevented and successful organ transplantations are not put at risk?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="81120h0002.htm_para20"><a name="08112070000058">The Minister will be aware of the operation reported yesterday to give Claudia Castillo a new trachea using a donated windpipe, stripped and then covered with stem cells from her hip. Although the operation was undertaken in Barcelona, it was scientists at Bristol university who transformed the windpipe, so I am sure that the Minister will be more than familiar with the case. The advantage is that Miss Castillo does not need to use immunosuppressant drugs, because of the presence of her own genetic material in the windpipe. What action can the Government take to progress that technology? Will the Minister continue to urge the research councils and others to maintain and expand their support for it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="81120h0002.htm_para21"><a name="08112070000059">It is clear from the taskforce&#146;s report that it does not believe at this stage that presumed consent is the best way of achieving the desired outcome&#151;more successful transplants. It is clear also that there is much for the Government to do to raise transplantation rates, and there are questions about their performance to date. The outcome of the report is possibly a touch embarrassing for the Prime Minister, and it is disappointing that he has not seen fit to acknowledge it as the taskforce&#146;s evidence-based conclusion. <i>The Guardian</i> quotes him as being &#147;dismayed and frustrated&#148;. Given that this is a free-vote issue, like every other Member he is of course entitled to his view. But as the expert taskforce that he himself set up has raised serious concerns about adopting a presumed consent regime at this stage, and ahead of trying other avenues, it must be hoped that he will not use his position or the machinery of government to promote his view, and certainly not to save face.</p>

 I declare an interest, as one of the largest transplant centres is part of the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="81120h0002.htm_para26"><a name="08112070000065">The very first question I ever had to answer as a Health Minister in the House of Commons was from Tam Dalyell, who was a great supporter of presumed consent. I remember the Department of Health briefing on why we were not in favour of presumed consent, and the Department has probably remained quite consistent in its approach. One reason I wanted to speak in the debate was that I was slightly worried that we were being too rational. The problem with the debate is not the rational arguments, but the irrational side of the debate. In a sense, we ask about consent at a time when the people concerned are probably past caring, because, with the exception of live kidney donation, whoever gave the consent is dead at that point. The key thing is how we look after the bereaved and the families. The conversation needs to be much wider, by its very nature. We should look at those aspects of the issue more clearly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="81120h0002.htm_para27"><a name="08112070000066">The second troubling aspect, which has been touched on, is whether we are focusing on the right thing; I am not sure we are. If I remember my 1999 briefing correctly, when I asked why donations in this country had dropped so much, I was told, &#147;To put it frankly, it is not least because road safety here has improved so much that we do not have sufficient numbers of accidents involving young people arriving in hospital, which means perfect bodies for donation are arriving in the right place.&#148; Now those young people survive, which is a very good thing. Someone asked me at that time why the UK was so far ahead of the rest of Europe in kidney transplants. The answer was that those countries had the money to finance dialysis, so they never invested in transplant techniques. I am slightly worried that we will get hooked on the idea that all that matters is increasing the number of live transplants, and we will not pay attention to artificial devices that might bring us to the point of not needing those transplants. They are not the be all and end all; perhaps we are having the wrong debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="81120h0002.htm_para28"><a name="08112070000067">The debate has been going on for decades. To go back to the introduction of the donor register, anyone who wants to have a good look at the subject should consult the record of Friday&#146;s debate in the House of Lords on the European Union report on increasing the supply of donor organs. It was a very thoughtful debate and brought out the facts. One thing on which we should do a bit more work is donor matching across Europe. Every time I see a certain constituent of mine on Harborne high street he comes up to me and says, &#147;I owe you my life,&#148; because we arranged to go to the Brussels register for him, and a liver, I think, was found for him in a fellow EU country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="81120h0002.htm_para29"><a name="08112070000068">There is a rational debate to be had, but I want to focus on the irrational debate. Hon. Members are right; it is a question of whose body it is, anyway. It is not an artificial argument. In <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> this week, a piece by Irwin Stelzer was headlined, &#147;Gordon Brown demands money&#151;and organs&#148;. Such ideas&#151;the Prime Minister demands your organs&#151;get into political debate. We know that it is nonsense, and the debate should not be in that area, but it is taken there. We have a problem with language. I really think that we should stop talking  <br>

about organ harvesting, as that gives me the creeps. It becomes difficult when we use language of that kind to engage in debates such as I had last year when the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs went to China and we talked about the human rights record. One of our biggest arguments against the Chinese human rights record is the way in which they clearly streamline executions to happen so that they can harvest organs. They said, &#147;What is your problem? Those people are going to be put to death anyway, so what is the problem with co-ordinating the timing?&#148; We said, &#147;Can&#146;t you see it?&#148; and they said, &#147;No, we can&#146;t.&#148; It is an incredibly emotive debate, not a rational one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="81120h0002.htm_para30"><a name="08112070000069">It is right to say that on one level it is an insult to clinicians to assume that they would ever make a clinical decision based on the need for the organ, but the fears, nevertheless, are out there. We need to deal with that. Presumed consent goes to the heart of the relationship between the individual and the state, but also the relationship between the individual and the national health service. That institution has the most enormous good will; and there are other ways around the problem. To draw again on the expertise of the House of Lords, Baroness Finlay talked in her speech about using brain stem death testing as a standard practice that would increase the availability of organs at a time when they could be used properly. She cited the example of practice at Charing Cross hospital, and explained that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="81120h0002.htm_para31"><a name="08112070000070">I know that there is a clinical debate, because I seem to recall that an attempt was made to introduce such practice in a private Member&#146;s Bill five or six years ago, and clinical arguments were made both ways. I do not for a moment pretend to understand it, but the core of the matter must be a wider debate. The more publicity we can get&#151;even through today&#146;s debate&#151;and the more we bring the issue into the open, the better. There is clearly a quite irrational element to the issue, because whenever the population at large is asked about it, the result is something like 90 per cent. saying they are in favour. However, I think people would like to be asked. The way to overcome the difficulty is by having the necessary conversations earlier on, and as much in the open as possible. Even in Spain, people are asked, by the way; there is no evidence that, even though there is presumed consent there, transplants are ever done without obtaining consent.</p>

I urge the Minister if possible to take note of the report, which was extremely thoughtful. I pay tribute to Elisabeth Buggins, who is the chair of the strategic health authority in my area. That is another west midlands interest to be declared.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="81120h0002.htm_para33"><a name="08112070000072">My final thought is that when, many years ago, Bruce Keogh&#151;who is now Sir Bruce Keogh, and is at the Department of Health&#151;was a surgeon in Birmingham, a debate was going on about which transplant centre should be closed, for clinical excellence reasons. I asked him if I could spend a day with him to see a patient through the process, and see what happened. It was an  <br>

eye-opening experience. I asked him at the end of the day what makes a really good surgeon, and he said it was knowing when not to do something. On this occasion the Government could legislate for presumed consent, but there are many other things we could do that would not break people&#146;s trust or break faith, and would give us the desired result. This may be one of those occasions when the wisest thing is not to do it.</p>

It was endorsed by the BMA, and since then, the BMA and its ethics committee have campaigned for an opt-out system of organ donation together with all the other things, because it is not an either/or situation. There is complete consensus about things that must be done. In 2002, I proposed a motion at the Liberal Democrat party conference, which is an unusual beast because policy is made on the basis of representatives&#146; votes.

They are not as straightforward&#151;these things are never completely straightforward&#151;as a donation from a family member, but it is now at least possible for people who are unrelated and do not know the recipient to donate organs, although the numbers of those who do so are small.</p>

I am now of the view that &#147;presumed consent&#148; is the wrong terminology, from whichever direction one comes. It is the wrong terminology for several reasons, which I shall not go into&#151;indeed, they are set out in an important part of the report. Although I do not speak for the BMA on this matter, it will probably seek to engage with the Government on changing the wording. We are not talking about a consented thing. There is not consent under the current system. It is an authorisation, and that is why Scotland&#151;as I always say, &#147;as so often&#148;&#151;has got it right. This is an authorisation process; it is not consent. It is not possible for relatives to give consent, let alone informed consent, for someone who is dead. They do not have ownership or the right to do that.</p>

An opt-out system would have default authorisation. It is much healthier to get away from the use of &#147;consent&#148;, popular though it was when the Human Tissue Act 2004 was going through Parliament, because we were talking about events in Bristol and Alder Hey in which consent was the issue and consenting processes had not been adequate.

Therefore, no one is proposing to move from a system of informed consent to one of non-informed consent or presumed consent. Under the current system, even if someone puts their name on the organ donor register, there is no record of the basis on which they do so. When people sign a consent form for an operation, under best medical practice there are clear professional guidelines and doctors have a duty to ensure that the consent is valid and appropriate. We do not know on the basis of what information people choose to have a donor card or put themselves on the organ donor register. Putting their name on the register is an indication of their preference. It is wrong to imply  <br>

that that is informed consent, when we do not even require informed consent in the American sense in normal medical practice. We require appropriate consent. Consent is a process, and the amount of information that patients want will vary from case to case. For that reason, it is wrong to call the process of registering on the organ donor register &#147;informed consent&#148;. If it is informed consent, it is hard to understand why relatives are invited to veto that, as they are, for practical reasons.</p>

 Indeed. I hope that there is broad consensus in the House&#151;or at least among right hon. and hon. Members in the Chamber today&#151;that we can change the terms. There is clearly a difference between an authorisation being an opt-in or an opt-out. I am not seeking to change the terms of the debate. There is clearly a difference. The issue is what the default position should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para15"><a name="08112070000093">Why should one support an opt-out system, and what factors are necessary in order to do so? It has been suggested that it would have to work for it to be the right thing to do. I do not think that that is the case. I happen to think that it would work. However, we would never know; we would have to look at what the evidence suggested. There is good evidence that it would work, and I will say later why I do not agree with all the conclusions of the taskforce report. But that is not the only issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para16"><a name="08112070000094">What is the right thing to do? There is an argument in principle, which I accept must be countered by practical arguments, because even if an opt-out system was ethically right in principle, if there were risks in pursuing that and we did not have the evidence that it would work, those would be good arguments for not going with the principle. However, I feel strongly that the default position should be to save lives. I am not happy with a system in which the default position is not to use organs that could be used because someone has not specified that they do not want them used. It is wrong to allow so many organs to be buried or cremated with their owners when those people would not have objected to the saving of lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para17"><a name="08112070000095">The default situation at the moment means that people die while waiting. With an opt-out, whatever the other arguments, it has to be recognised that the default&#151;the do-nothing position&#151;is saving lives. Then one gives people an opportunity to express their autonomy by withdrawing that authorisation and opting out. The moral arguments for moving to that position are strong and, if they were the only arguments I would say that they were irresistible. I was disappointed not to see that discussion in the summary report, although it may be in one of the 447 pages of annexes, of which I have only read a couple of hundred so far. They are not available  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para18"><a name="08112070000096">The other question is, does an opt-out system work? I was surprised by the conclusions in the summary report, which said that it did not work, because I remember seeing good evidence that it did. So I went to the systematic review, which is a process that I strongly commend. There is nothing methodologically wrong in seeking a systematic review of the methodology of published peer-reviewed papers on the subject. Opinion can be safely excluded. There are plenty of opinions published in review articles on both sides of the argument, including a number by Dr. Matesanz, who is cited many times in the summary report. But opinions do not pass muster in a systematic review of the evidence. So his opinion that it does not work is, like my opinion, discounted when looking at the evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para19"><a name="08112070000097">The summary set out clearly the inclusion criteria for the studies that were considered. It explains what are good methodologies and what it is hoped that studies would comply with and then it analyses which studies do comply. It lists the studies that are excluded and included. Some of the studies are between-country studies, trying to control for all the factors that vary between them, including road traffic accident rates, to see if there is a difference that can be aligned with an opt-out system, compared to countries with an opt-in system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para20"><a name="08112070000098">Then there are in-country studies, where the rates of organ donation are looked at before and after a change in the system. The summary says this, on page 33 of annex N, paragraph 3.3.3, in respect of the between-country trials:</p>
<a name="81120h0003.htm_brev2"><a name="08112070000178"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Of the eight studies that investigated the impact of presumed consent law on donation rates by comparing data from different countries, four had no major methodological flaws and a sufficiently robust analysis to provide reliable results.

<a name="81120h0003.htm_brev3"><a name="08112070000180"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;and any relationship between organ donation rates and presumed consent (or other factors) is one of association only and not cause and effect.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para22"><a name="08112070000100">In other words, such studies are a clue, but one cannot say that something is definitely so, although if one has tried to adjust for confounding factors, they are informative. The summary continues:</p>
<a name="81120h0003.htm_brev4"><a name="08112070000181"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;All four studies use regression analysis on national data from between 17 and 34 mainly European countries. Three of these studies found that presumed consent was statistically significantly associated with increased rates of organ donation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para23"><a name="08112070000101">Three out of four found that association after a regression analysis and found that it was significant. It continued:</p>
<a name="81120h0003.htm_brev5"><a name="08112070000182"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;One study reported that a presumed consent regime provided additional donors, but this result was not statistically significant.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para24"><a name="08112070000102">So it does not go the other way. It was not three versus one; it was three versus nought and one with no comment. The summary said:</p>
<a name="81120h0003.htm_brev6"><a name="08112070000183"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The estimates of the magnitude of the effect of presumed consent varied. Two studies reported an approximately 20-30 per cent. increase in organ donors, and the other studies reported increases of 2.7 and 6.1 donors&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para25"><a name="08112070000103">per million population. The summary concludes, without saying much else in between, I have to say:</p>
<a name="81120h0003.htm_brev7"><a name="08112070000184"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Thus, although overall the evidence suggests that presumed consent law is associated with increased organ donation rates; there are also other important factors that are associated with the variation in organ donation rates between countries.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para31"><a name="08112070000109">The between-country studies are interesting. Belgium is the key country, because it introduced a soft system of opt-out, which is what is being proposed for this country. What Austria does is not as directly relevant to the debate in this country. Two studies in Belgium found  a significant increase in organ donation, and they  show that that was sustained. I do not understand why Dr. Matesanz&#151;I understand why the hon. Member for Eddisbury quoted him&#151;said that he did not know of any country where increased organ donation rates were sustained after the change of law to an opt-out system, when it is clear from the taskforce&#146;s figures and the studies that it reports that Belgium is one such country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para32"><a name="08112070000110">I am not saying that that is clear evidence or proof that that resulted from presumed consent or opt-out, but Dr. Matesanz made a different point, and it cannot be sustained. That is why opinion should not be given the same weight as published studies. Time and again in the report, the opinion of one person from Spain is cited over and above the summary of the evidence from the systematic review. Given what I have just said about sustained rates of donation, one problem with opinions&#151;I say the same about my opinion&#151;is that they are not as valuable as studies. I am sure that if Dr. Matesanz went through what I have said, he would be able to pick holes in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="81120h0003.htm_para33"><a name="08112070000111">The studies conclude that the system works in Belgium, although cause and effect cannot be proved. However, we must consider something that was not studied. Antwerp did not introduce the soft opt-out system, even though the rest of the country did so, and Belgium changed the law. The hospital in Antwerp found that there was no increase in organ donation, which suggests that it was the change in the law and the operation of that change that made the difference, not simply a national publicity campaign that was associated with the change.

consent is introduced, the donation rate may increase because of all the fuss, public debate and information, and that would be welcome. But Antwerp was not cut off from the national media, or from the parliamentary and media debate, or from information campaigns. It just did not operate the system, and it did not get the change.

I cannot believe that doctors would stop doing their job. No one is suggesting that under the soft system of opt-out, relatives would not be approached if there was an unregistered opt-out.

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para7"><a name="08112070000120">I pay tribute to the families who have given permission, and I have the utmost respect for patients who have received an organ: I wish them well. During my clinical years, I worked to improve their welfare, and I have devoted a considerable amount of parliamentary time to that, too. However, if we ask someone who has successfully received an organ under the current system whether they believe that that system works, and they say yes, that is not surprising. Canvassing an unbiased sample of people for their opinion would make any conclusions truly powerful, but that would mean asking the relatives of people who did not receive an organ and who died as a result. Obviously, one cannot ask dead people what they think about the fact that they died for want of an organ that a donor would want them to have&#151;the donor&#146;s relatives, however, refused to give consent&#151;because, I would argue, we have an opt-in system, and not an opt-out system, so the organs were lost because they were buried or cremated. However, it does not appear from the summary report that the relatives of such people were sought out. I allege that those people are the losers&#151;and they would claim the same&#151;under the current system, because we do not have the increased donation rate that the systematic review suggested might result from opt-out. I do not understand why the taskforce did not do that, unless it sought to gather evidence solely to back a certain opinion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para8"><a name="08112070000121">The taskforce asked relatives who had said yes what they thought about having a chance to do so. They naturally said that they valued that opportunity, and the fact that at the time of their bereavement they could make a decision to give life to someone else. That can be comforting&#151;I do not deny that ,and there is research evidence to suggest that that is the truth. However, I cannot find any evidence in the summary report to suggest that people who said no were approached. We know that 40 per cent. of relatives consistently say no despite the fact that&#151;as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston and others have said&#151;only 10 to 15 per cent. of people would want their relatives to say no. I do not believe that every time that 40 per cent. see a newspaper, television or soap opera storyline about the fact that the lives of three people per patient can be saved and transformed by an organ donation, they do not regret saying no for understandable reasons at a time of grief. Were those people sought out and asked whether the current system left them in a bad position? I cannot find evidence from the summary report that they were. Will the Minister reflect on whether that was done and, if it was not, whether the report and evidence base is appropriately balanced?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para12"><a name="08112070000125">There is no evidence&#151;most faiths support organ donation&#151;that any faith would overturn its principles and say from the pulpit that because saving lives is now the default position everyone should opt out. The report does not suggest that faith leaders said such a thing; it is just a remark. In fact, we know from campaigns against animal research that having an active campaign provides the opportunity to put the merits of the issue&#151;it raises the profile of the cause and is educative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para13"><a name="08112070000126">Finally, in my critique of the report, I want to draw attention to a bias. The report states that the taskforce is concerned&#151;and I recognise this concern&#151;that, under an opt-out system, some people may not want to donate, but would be too apathetic or disorganised to opt out. I do not think that the taskforce means that in a judgmental way, but those are the terms that it uses. Such people might suffer a loss of autonomy if their organs were used because they had not registered an opt-out or informed their families&#151;under a soft system the families would be asked if there was an unregistered opt-out&#151;of their decision. There would be a risk of a loss of autonomy, and if there were a small number of such people, that would be a negative thing. I accept that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para14"><a name="08112070000127">That is not the only question. There is no mention in the summary report of a second loss of autonomy which is even greater and costs lives. The first loss of autonomy that I mentioned saves lives: on the one hand, there is a loss of autonomy but, on the other, lives are saved. I would like to put on the record the fact that that may well be a price worth paying under an opt-out system. What about the people who, like me, under the current system, value the opportunity for our organs to be used after death and do not like the fact that someone could be asked, &#147;What do you think?&#148; In addition, what about the all people who, unlike me, are too apathetic or disorganised to get themselves on the organ donor register&#151;I exclude the hon. Member for Eddisbury from that, because he has brandished his donor card&#151;but who would want their organs to be used? Up to 40 per cent. of people&#151;not just a handful&#151;would find, looking down on us, that their organs were not used. That is a loss of autonomy far greater than the one feared under the opt-out system, and it costs lives. That is not mentioned in the summary report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para15"><a name="08112070000128">I cannot understand why the report does not take a balanced view of all three of the issues I have mentioned. I feel strongly about this issue, because so many people die while waiting for organs that one expects the taskforce in the summary report at least&#151;the matter may be mentioned in the annexes&#151;to ensure that its sample and consideration is not biased. I do not think that any of the individuals on the taskforce were biased, but I think that there was a loss of overview on those points. As I have not had a chance to talk to the taskforce, if it writes to me and says that I am wrong on some of those points, I would put it on the record, that I would regret that I misrepresented the matter.</p>

going to wait and see. I cannot speak for other organisations and I do not necessarily speak for my party, but, personally, I accept that we will now have to wait for an opportunity to debate the matter again and have a free vote on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para17"><a name="08112070000130">I wish the Government well in their efforts, but, sadly, I do not think that we can be optimistic about getting the 50 per cent. increase in donor rates. Some 10 years ago, I introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill on the matter and was told, &#147;There are a number of things happening, so just wait and see. We&#146;re going to do our best.&#148; The Government did do their best, but there has been no change. After the Human Tissue Act 2004, we were told, &#147;Just wait and see; a significant improvement will occur by these means.&#148; So far, that significant improvement has not been made, although there have been improvements in some areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para18"><a name="08112070000131">The National Kidney Federation and the all-party kidney group produced a transplant manifesto, which the Government welcomed. Short of opt-out, the manifesto requested a number of things that are being implemented as, indeed, are the recommendations from the taskforce&#146;s first report. I am not confident that even if those proposals were implemented, they would significantly increase the number of organs available. The limiting factor is not capacity in the system at the moment; it is the relative refusal rate of 40 per cent. No matter how many organ donor retrieval teams there are or how many transplant surgeons there are, there will not be an increase in cadaveric organs while there is a relative refusal rate of 40 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para19"><a name="08112070000132">In Spain, they do both. They have an opt-out system, and then they layer on all the other things we are planning to implement. I hope I am wrong and that layering on these things without an opt-out system will bring down the relative refusal rate because there will be transplant co-ordinators who will do it better. However, I think intensivists are doing a good job already. The prospective donor audit has shown the 40 per cent. threshold to be stubborn&#151;a little bit of progress has been made&#151;because the question is different. Under an opt-out system, people would say to relatives, &#147;From the register, there&#146;s no reason to believe that your loved one did not want to save lives with their organs. Do you know of any unregistered opt-out, otherwise we plan to save lives with these organs?&#148; Under the current system, people have to say to relatives who are at the height of their grief, &#147;Can we have permission to take organs from this body? We don&#146;t know what they would have wanted.&#148; Relatives naturally go with the status quo. Studies show that relatives cite views such as, &#147;Surely he&#146;s suffered enough. We don&#146;t really want the body interfered with.&#148; That is entirely understandable. However, it is cruel to put the question to relatives in those terms. Those who speak to the relatives do not want to put pressure on them or put them under duress by mentioning that there are other grieving relatives who are watching someone who needs that organ die. I understand that view, but while we have these systems, we will have a problem. Elizabeth Ward, who invented the kidney donor card, has long supported an opt-out, even though it would sideline her creation. We ought to bear that in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para20"><a name="08112070000133">I mentioned another concern in an intervention: strangely enough, getting more people on the organ donor register, has not made any difference in the past.

the organ donor register, it would have an impact. However, it does not seem to have done so, unless it has maintained the donation rate, which would otherwise drop. Although I hope that people will sign the organ donor register and discuss it with their families, I remain concerned that that will not resolve the problem. People have asked me whether the 15 million names on the register are really 15 million different people. What is the quality of that data? Efforts have been made to &#147;clean&#148; the data, and perhaps that will show a drop in numbers if it truly works. However, I cannot believe that a quarter of the relevant population is on the register. Relatives hardly ever refuse to give consent when they know of a registration or a donor card, but yet the number is still 40 per cent. It just does not add up, and I have never understood why that is the case.</p>

However, at least we have had the debate, and I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which she introduced it. I have enormous respect for the way in which the Prime Minister and the former chief medical officer were prepared to say that, on the basis of the evidence, their previously held view was not the right one. We should have more of that in politics and we should not criticise as a U-turn something that we have called for. I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Member for Eddisbury put his side of the argument. I know that he takes a different view, but I hope that he will agree that when this returns to the House, it must be given a free vote. This is not something that can be easily included in party manifestos to justify a Whip, nor is it something that will persuade those of us with strong views either way to obey a party position.</p>

 I would like to respond to the points raised and I thank hon. Members for their measured and thoughtful contributions to what we all find a challenging and finely balanced debate. I start by reminding colleagues that the number of possible donors each year is between 2,000 to 3,000 people. That number is getting smaller because, thankfully, we continue to see a reduction in deaths from accidents&#151;especially road accidents&#151;and strokes. Increasingly, there is better care for patients with major brain injuries.</p>

Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) asked about balance and posed the question of what should come first&#151;opt-out and then reforms, reforms and then opt-out, or a combination of both. It is worth noting that Spain had an opt-out system for 10 years from 1979 without any significant effect on the rate of donations. Significant changes in Spanish donation rates occurred only after the introduction of infrastructural and other changes in 1989&#151;changes on which the taskforce based its recommendations in the first report.</p>

When families are aware that their relative wanted to be a donor and had registered on the system, 90 per cent. agree with donation. That takes us back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) about the importance of focusing on the bereaved families and trying to be understanding of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para24"><a name="08112070000138">I tried to clarify this issue during the debate. Yes, there was the old donor card, but as hon. Members have mentioned, under the Human Tissue Act 2004 that requires lawful consent. Where that lawful consent exists&#151;the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred to a figure of 40 per cent.&#151;there can be an override, not in law but in practice. Because the support of the family is needed to get the appropriate medical and social history, in practice, clinicians will not proceed. That is not a matter of law; they will not proceed in the face of strong family opposition. Therefore, it is not as simple as stating the case one way or the other. Like other hon. Members in the Chamber, I have held various donor cards. I am on the register and, should a tragic event ever occur, I have taken the precaution of making my wishes absolutely clear&#151;as has my husband, who is also registered&#151;and those wishes are to be adhered to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para25"><a name="08112070000139">There are ways of proceeding but it is not a straightforward issue. From international evidence, we know that two crucial things are needed for delivering consent. As well as making the donor&#146;s intentions known, we must have a fully trained professional work force to ask the relatives for consent, and we must ensure that the family have as much time as they require. The taskforce made those recommendations and both are being delivered on. That is crucial.</p>

 I will deal with the next point and then I will be happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman. He raised a question regarding presumed consent or opt-out, and informed consent. I agree that opt-out is a better term, and that is what we should concentrate on. He went on to say that doctors would not themselves opt out; well actually, they do, because they are not happy with aspects of the current law. That is not because it is not clear enough, but because of the other support that is required. Those factors are all closely interwoven.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="81120h0004.htm_para26"><a name="08112070000142">In response to the taskforce, the Government have looked at all the arrangements and the points that were identified regarding what needs to be done in the system, and I will return to those briefly.

The Government are pursuing a policy of making the changes now, as rapidly as possible, with the finance&#151;I will come on to answer the questions asked by the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O&#146;Brien) about what that is&#151;and of keeping progress under review, because of the important points that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon made about the people who die without an organ being donated. We are not closing off any option. This is a very difficult situation. What comes first?

We are at one on that. I did not criticise it. May I take her back to the relative refusal rate and the register? Could she help me with the mathematics of this? We know that only 10 per cent. of relatives refuse when someone is on the organ donor register, but otherwise a total of 40 per cent. refuse. How is it that the relative refusal rate was 40 per cent. when 5 million were on the register and it is still overall 40 per cent. when 15 million are on the register? Surely, for those  15 million, the 10 per cent. figure should operate, which should bring the average down. I cannot understand how that works and why the increased registrations are not leading to a significantly reduced overall relative refusal rate.</p>

We are seeing progress, but let us be clear; let us not understate the challenge that we face. In particular, the public debate needs to continue on why people should be on the register and why they should make it clear that they are on the register. There needs to be greater understanding generally of the importance of that for individuals and their families, should they find themselves in this position.</p>

There were clear recommendations, first, on identifying all potential donors and increasing the number on the register; secondly, on how to develop stronger local systems to optimise donations from both living and deceased patients; and thirdly, on how we can strengthen the organ retrieval arrangements throughout the country to ensure that we maximise every possible opportunity.</p>

of the financial disincentives that were in the system have been removed&#151;I referred to that in my speech&#151;and we are continuing that process. That includes reimbursement of costs associated with organ donation. I also referred to the efficiency of having electronic donor registration and an online system, which would speed up allocation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="81120h0005.htm_para1"><a name="08112070000151">I said that we were expanding the organ donation work force, that the Department of Health had a national clinical director for transplantation to drive forward the recommendations, that recruitment was under way to increase the number of national transplant co-ordinators by 146 per cent. and that 29 new appointments had already been made. I pointed out that we were arranging for there to be clinical donation champions and that they would have leave to bring forward changes at local level. I also talked about extra funding of &#163;4.5 million for publicity aimed at getting more donors and more awareness of organ donation. We are making progress in relation to all the recommendations and our commitment is underlined by finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="81120h0005.htm_para2"><a name="08112070000152">The hon. Member for Eddisbury also asked about the black and minority ethnic community and said that we needed to do more in that area. I agree. The national health service blood and transplant service is funding a two-year study now to examine the reasons why individuals make gifts and donations generally and how those findings can be used to increase the rates among the BME communities. There is no obvious barrier in terms of beliefs or ethics, but that study will enable us to make progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="81120h0005.htm_para3"><a name="08112070000153">The national blood and transplant service has undergone a major restructuring in line with recommendations 1 and 2. As we have said, an executive director was in post as of 1 September. Currently, there is capacity within all transplant units to ensure that donated organs are not wasted. In the next five years, the Department will be working actively with national and local commissioners to expand the services. That is a great challenge, particularly in heart and lung transplant services. All the new donor co-ordinators and clinical champions are receiving training. That training includes major workshops that are already in place and making progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="81120h0005.htm_para4"><a name="08112070000154">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister did not seek to intervene on, influence or steer the taskforce recommendations. All of us keep revisiting the subject of organ donation, for the obvious reasons stated today. The Prime Minister made it clear that he wished to see the debate start and he took great care not to prejudice the question. He has always made it clear that he recognises, as we all do, that this is a sensitive and complex issue, on which people have a wide range of views. Having set up the taskforce and asked it to address the issue and, like the rest of us, accepted that an expert opinion was necessary, he has willingly supported the way forward that has been outlined for us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="81120h0005.htm_para5"><a name="08112070000155">I might point out that there were significant amounts of Government funding for stem cell research and the excellent work in my home city of Bristol by a brilliant university. The hon. Member for Eddisbury will know this. The Department will award &#163;1.4 billion to  &#163;1.7 billion over the next three years for research  and development. That relates particularly to the transformational agenda and translating science into activity. I am delighted, having just seen Royal Assent given to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, that stem cell research is proving its great relevance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="81120h0005.htm_para6"><a name="08112070000156">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston referred to the very important question of the bereaved relatives and how crucial that is to the success of donations. I do not disagree with her at all. There are very good signs in the health service that work is proceeding on that issue. I do not know whether she is aware, for instance, of the success achieved by a team in Bolton, who have increased donor rates sixfold in a year by embedding the discussion about being a donor in the end-of-life care pathway. They received a <i>Nursing Times </i>award for the &#147;incredible service&#148; that they provided. Their work shows that supporting families in such difficult times can help them with the decision. My hon. Friend also made points about brain stem death testing being normal practice. That is a key role for the clinical champions, and we intend to have one in every intensive care unit by 2009-10 for precisely those reasons.</p>

is above my pay grade, and should any discussion take place in the future, I am sure that his representations will be noted, but I am not in a position to predict what will happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="81120h0005.htm_para8"><a name="08112070000158">In conclusion, we all recognise that we have a duty on behalf of the thousands facing an anxious wait and uncertain future on the transplant lists, and that means we have to keep all our options open, so the Department will monitor progress carefully. As I said at the beginning of the debate, if we do not achieve the outcomes that we and all Members participating in the debate are clearly looking for, we will all need to reconsider our approach, and that will have to include the possibility of legislation. For the moment, it is right that we place our trust in the experts, and focus all our attention on implementing their recommendations in full and closing the gap so that those waiting for the donation of organs or tissue receive them.</p>
