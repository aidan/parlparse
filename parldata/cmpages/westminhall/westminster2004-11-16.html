<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41116h01_spnew0"><b> Dr. Gavin Strang  (Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful for the opportunity to draw the attention of the Chamber to the work and growing needs of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para0"><a name="stpa_0">In September 2000, Heads of State and Government from across the world met at the United Nations millennium summit to address the major challenges facing humanity at the dawn of the new millennium. The outcome was the millennium declaration&#151;a powerful statement of shared fundamental values and key objectives. Of course, values and objectives are essential, but in a vacuum they are just words. Crucially, the millennium declaration also contains eight goals, with 18 associated concrete, quantifiable and time-limited targets. Nearly 190 countries have signed up to the millennium development goals, and the Department for International Development has made them the main focus of its work. Goal six of the millennium declaration is to


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para1"><a name="stpa_1">The associated targets and indicators commit the international community, by 2015, to have halted and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS and the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para2"><a name="stpa_2">It was clear to anyone who knew anything about AIDS, malaria or TB that we did not have a chance of making so much as a dent in their spread without a massive increase in international effort. The figures speak for themselves. Last year, close to 5 million people acquired HIV, bringing the number of those living with the virus to about 38 million. The AIDS epidemic claimed nearly 3 million lives last year, many as a result of TB. Each year, more than 8 million people become sick with TB, 2 million of whom do not survive. Malaria strikes 300 million to 500 million people every year and kills more than 1 million, nearly all of them in Africa, and most of them children under five years of age. These three diseases are entirely preventable and treatable, but between them they cause more than 6 million deaths worldwide every year, mostly in the developing world. Every death is a personal tragedy. However, the diseases strike not only individuals; they attack communities, regions and nations, causing economic decline, social breakdown and political instability.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para3"><a name="stpa_3">In April 2001, invoking the millennium pledges, Kofi Annan announced his proposal for a global fund. In June 2001, the United Nations General Assembly special session on AIDS concluded with a commitment to create such a fund, and the G8 summit the following month announced the launch of a new Global Fund to

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Just a few months later, in June 2002, the Global Fund board approved the first round of grants to 36 countries.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para4"><a name="stpa_4">The Global Fund is an independent public-private partnership. Its 23-person board includes representatives of donor and recipient Governments, non-governmental organisations, the private sector and affected communities. The board also includes representatives of UNAIDS, the World Health Organisation and the World Bank, but those three do not have voting rights. The current chair of the fund is US Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para5"><a name="stpa_5">In its first two years, the Global Fund has approved 314 grants in 128 countries, totalling $3 billion. Some 61&nbsp;per cent. of the grants are to go to Africa, 23 per cent. to Asia and north Africa, and 16 per cent. to Latin America, the Caribbean and eastern Europe.
</p>






<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41116h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Marshall  (Glasgow, Shettleston)</b>  (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is also a case for including the very poorest nations of the Pacific, such as Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Kiribati among the countries that urgently require help from the fund?
</p>






<p><a name="st_3"><a name="41116h01_spnew2"><b> Dr. Strang </b> : I agree that many countries deserve help from the fund. Provided that their Governments or agencies can introduce meaningful schemes, which will give value for money and tackle the problem, they should get help. My hon. Friend confirms how huge the challenge is.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para6"><a name="stpa_6">Some 56 per cent. of the fund&#039;s grants are targeted at HIV/AIDS, 31 per cent. at malaria and 13 per cent. at TB. Hon. Members may be interested to hear of some recent achievements. More than 10,000 insecticide-treated nets are being subsidised for pregnant women in Madagascar. Private practitioners in the Philippines are&nbsp;being trained in the internationally recommended directly observed treatment short-course&#151;DOTS&#151;treatment strategy for TB. In Kenya, 250 community centres are being used for HIV prevention outreach work. HIV and TB testing laboratories in Moldova are being modernised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para7"><a name="stpa_7">The Global Fund operates in a series of rounds. Every eight months, it launches a new round, issuing an invitation to interested parties to apply for grants. Applications are then scrutinised by the fund&#039;s technical review panel and sent to the fund&#039;s board with a recommended course of action. The principal recipient of a grant does not have to be a Government agency. It could be a community-based organisation or an NGO, a faith-based organisation, an affected community, an academic institution or a private sector body.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para8"><a name="stpa_8">Proposals are normally made for five years, but a two-year grant agreement is initially negotiated. Disbursements are made during those two years, usually quarterly. Towards the end of that time, the overall performance of the programme is evaluated by the Global Fund to determine whether to renew the grant.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para9"><a name="stpa_9">Groundwork is done to ensure that the funded projects are appropriate to local needs. Country co-ordinating mechanisms are partnerships that develop grant proposals designed to fill gaps in local HIV, TB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and malaria programmes. Those partnerships also&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monitor the proposal&#039;s implementation, and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 345WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
co-ordinate with other domestic programmes. The country co-ordinating mechanisms are expected to have broad representation, although it is argued that, in some countries, the representation is still not broad enough and that there should be better representation of non-government bodies in particular.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para10"><a name="stpa_10">Steps are also taken to ensure that the money will be well spent. Prior to paying an approved grant, the fund appoints a local fund agent to assess the fiscal and administrative capacity and systems of the grant&#039;s proposed principal recipient. Through a grant agreement with the Global Fund, the recipient is made accountable for its expenditure and results. When further disbursements are requested from the fund, the local fund agent must verify the evidence of the progress achieved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para11"><a name="stpa_11">The secretariat aspires to be as lean an operation as possible. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;Administration costs are kept low and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are expected to decline as grant expenditure increases.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 10 May 2004; Vol. 421, c. 60W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para12"><a name="stpa_12">Less than 3 per cent. of the annual commitment is used for central administration and management of the Global Fund each year. An additional 2 per cent. is used for local oversight of grants by local fund agents.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para13"><a name="stpa_13">The Global Fund has adopted other mechanisms to ensure prudent and efficient spending. For example, the fund must have received all the money for a grant before a grant agreement can be signed. That money then sits in the fund&#039;s account for the two or three years of the&nbsp;grant, gradually being disbursed in instalments. The board&#039;s comprehensive funding policy understandably errs on the side of caution, so much so that some argue for its rules to be loosened. I would be interested to hear the view of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development about that live issue.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para14"><a name="stpa_14">The global struggle against AIDS, TB and malaria requires huge resources. Donors&#039; records of contributing to the fund are patchy. The G8 had the privilege of launching the fund, and those wealthy nations bear a responsibility to live up to their commitments. The UK&#039;s recent record is a good one, and I expect that my hon. Friend will say something about that. On 20 July, the Prime Minister launched the UK&#039;s new strategy to tackle AIDS in the developing world, and announced that we would double our contribution to the fund to more than &#163;150 million over the next three years. The UK has also consistently made it clear that our donations to the Global Fund are additional to the resources that we already make available to fight AIDS, TB and malaria.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para15"><a name="stpa_15">The United States has significantly increased its pledge this year, agreeing to give up to $547 million to the Global Fund in 2004. However, that pledge was limited to a maximum of one third of the total amount received by the fund. Contributions fell short, despite an&nbsp;urgent appeal to which the UK was the first to respond. Unless the US exercises discretion, it will give&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$87 million less than its maximum potential contribution this year. Does my hon. Friend have any news on that?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para16"><a name="stpa_16">Things look bleaker for next year. The President has&nbsp;requested only $200 million for the fund in 2005. I&nbsp;believe that the House and Senate were due to meet 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 346WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
yesterday to discuss proposals for the US contribution to the fund. The Senate was to suggest $250 million, and the House was to propose $400 million for the foreign operations donation. Further sums of up to $300 million are being discussed for labour, health and emergency spending. Again, does my hon. Friend have something to say about that?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para17"><a name="stpa_17">There is great concern that there will be a major shortfall in the fund&#039;s finances from 2005. The resource needs of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fund will reach $3.4 billion next year, yet the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fund has received pledges of just $2.1 billion for 2005&nbsp;onwards. My hon. Friend knows that last year our Prime Minister joined Jacques Chirac and Romano Prodi in a commitment to work to ensure that Europe provides up to $l billion to the fund annually. I hope that my hon. Friend will tell the Chamber that that remains the UK Government&#039;s position, and that he and his colleagues are working in Europe to achieve that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para18"><a name="stpa_18">The resource needs of the fund are set to expand significantly in the coming years, not only because worthy causes can always use more money, but because we are starting to renew the existing grants. The five-year projects received funding for only the first two years. Operators of the fund will now decide whether those grants merit extension for another three years. If we assume that 85 per cent. of grants from the first three rounds are extended, those renewals will incur programme liabilities of $1.4 billion next year. That is more than the total amount that the fund is expected to provide this year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para19"><a name="stpa_19">Renewing grants for projects that are working well will be vital, but it is not enough for the fund simply to renew existing grants in the year ahead. The AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria epidemics will not stand still for the year, and neither must the fund. It must continue to launch new rounds and invite proposals for new work to combat those terrible diseases.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para20"><a name="stpa_20">Operators of the fund have always launched a new round of grants at every second board meeting; that is, every eight months. According to that schedule, the&nbsp;board should have agreed in June to launch round five two months ago, but that did not happen. The board meets again this Thursday and Friday in Arusha, Tanzania. Many people hope that agreement to launch round five can be reached then. My hon. Friend knows that the fund&#039;s executive director, Dr.&nbsp;Richard Feachem, fully supports the call for round five to be launched immediately after this week&#039;s board meeting.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para21"><a name="stpa_21">The launch of round five has already slipped. If the board were to miss another opportunity to launch the round, it would risk losing momentum for the fund at a pivotal time. We know that the need is there, and we know that there are eligible programmes waiting to apply for funding. Will my hon. Friend assure us that the UK will use its influence at the board meeting this week to secure the announcement of a fifth round?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para22"><a name="stpa_22">The good example set by the UK must now be used to lever in improved levels of funding from other donor countries to support a new round. Two replenishment conferences are scheduled for next year to make future funding of the fund more certain. It would be helpful if my hon. Friend confirmed that the UK will play a full part in those conferences and that it will be represented at the highest level.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para23"><a name="stpa_23">I suppose that no organisation that handles billions of pounds of public money is exempt from criticism, and although the Global Fund is largely popular, it is no exception. The fund has recently had to weather accusations that it has been too slow to disburse its money to people on the ground. That is an easy accusation to make&#151;the fund has approved a total of $3&nbsp;billion in grants, but only $628 million has been disbursed to date.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para24"><a name="stpa_24">In large part, such a discrepancy is inevitable in that the $3 billion represents the total amount that all approved grants will cost over two years. Of course, the fund does not pay out the entire two years&#039; funding at the start: it is paid in instalments, usually quarterly. In addition, the $3 billion total includes round four grants, which were approved only in June and so are barely ready for the disbursements even to start. In fact, disbursements have historically kept pace with the targets set by the fund, and they are only slightly below the target for the third quarter of this year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para25"><a name="stpa_25">I notice that the UK&#039;s new strategy for tackling HIV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and AIDS in the developing world includes a commitment to work with the fund to disburse money more quickly and effectively, and I welcome that. It is true that there are problems with some grants. In some cases, there are problems with getting a grant agreement in place and, in others, the recipients have problems in meeting the fund&#039;s conditions or implementing their commitments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para26"><a name="stpa_26">Donor countries have rightly insisted that the fund&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should have tough standards for awarding grants,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negotiating grant agreements and making disbursements. It has to be accepted that, to some extent, the effect of tough standards will be the delay or cancellation of some disbursements. Provided that that is for good reason, we should accept that as a worthwhile price to pay to protect the fund&#039;s reputation for financial responsibility.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para27"><a name="stpa_27">The Global Fund offers advantages that many countries&#039; bilateral programmes do not. Although the UK is innocent of aid tying, many countries tie their aid by, for example, insisting that funds are used to buy goods or services based in the donor country. That can have negative consequences and reduce value for money to the recipient country. Global Fund money is not tied in that way.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para28"><a name="stpa_28">The Global Fund is participatory. The involvement of all stakeholders has always been part of its operation, from the composition of the board to the country co-ordinating mechanisms on the ground. The fund promotes country ownership, supporting proven interventions identified by the recipient countries, rather than reflecting the ideology of donor countries. Fund awards go where they are most needed. The political or economic interests of donor countries are not a driving force in the allocation of money.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para29"><a name="stpa_29">The fund is democratic, and that is reflected in the representative nature of its board. It is transparent, and information about grants is freely available, for example on the fund&#039;s website. It has built-in mechanisms to ensure accountability in all its procedures.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para30"><a name="stpa_30">The Global Fund is not our only weapon against AIDS, TB and malaria; far from it. The &#163;150 million promised by the UK to the Global Fund is only a part of the &#163;1.5 billion that this country will spend on the international fight against HIV/AIDS over the next three years. Bilateral work has an important role, as has the work of other international agencies and the voluntary sector, but the role of the Global Fund in&nbsp;raising money and spending it in a fair, accountable and effective way is vital if we are to reverse the spread&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of those diseases and honour our millennium development pledges.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para31"><a name="stpa_31">The announcement of the Global Fund in 2001 was a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bold initiative, responding to the millennium development goal on AIDS, TB and malaria. It has got off to a reasonable start, and substantial funds have been raised, awarded and disbursed. However, as has been pointed out time and again, support for the fund must be judged against the enormity of the destruction meted out by the diseases worldwide; they cause more than 6 million preventable deaths every year. It is vital that we do all we can to increase the fund and its impact. I urge the Government to do all they can to respond to the challenge, and to encourage other Governments to do likewise.

<a name="41116h01_time1"><h5>9.48 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41116h01_spnew3"><b> Tony Baldry  (Banbury)</b>  (Con): The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strang) has made an excellent speech on the challenges for the Global Fund. He should be congratulated on initiating this important debate. I do not want to repeat what he said, as I agree with much of it. I shall focus briefly on the future, what aid flows go into the Global Fund, and what aid flows come out of it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para32"><a name="stpa_32">The Select Committee on International Development was in India when the Overseas Development Institute held what I understand was an excellent meeting in Portcullis House with Dr. Richard Feachem, head of the Global Fund. My impression is that Dr. Feachem made it pretty clear that, unless countries agreed to a fifth round of proposals next year, he would probably step down. I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that a fifth round of proposals is crucial for the future of the fund, not least because increasingly an underclass of countries is rejected in the first few rounds of proposals. Indeed, some 62 per cent. of countries are rejected. However, a fifth round can happen only with more money.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para33"><a name="stpa_33">So far, the Global Fund has the value of two-and-a-half-years&#039; worth of funding, at a rate of some $5.7&nbsp;billion, but it is looking towards $8 billion, which would carry its work forward for five years. That money is needed, not least to ensure that treatments for AIDS, malaria and TB are increased in middle-income countries, which are still overlooked and would be crucial to round five.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para34"><a name="stpa_34">There has, however, been an increasing trend towards bilateral&#151;and not towards multilateral&#151;AIDS programmes of late. Those bilateral measures have seen middle-income countries miss out the most.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, President Bush has pledged&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;significant sums towards fighting AIDS&#151;some $5 billion. That is likely to be renewed with his election and that is good news. However, it is good 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 349WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
news only for a handful of African countries, such as Uganda and Botswana, where the funding has been ring-fenced. Beyond such countries, there is nothing new from the United States.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para35"><a name="stpa_35">It is fair to say that the UK has done a considerable amount of restructuring of its aid flows to fight the pandemic, and that has resulted in a much greater financial commitment by the Government. I think that&nbsp;the UK&#039;s contribution to the Global Fund is being doubled to &#163;150 million over three years, which is a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;significant departure from the stance of the US Government. They have committed only a small part of their total AIDS budget to the Global Fund. It is excellent news that UK Ministers are supporting the Global Fund, and that should be applauded.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para36"><a name="stpa_36">However, as always, there are winners and losers with new aid commitments and the losers on AIDS appear to be middle-income countries. For example, all of the UK&#039;s HIV/AIDS programmes in Honduras, which has the worst problem in central America, have been cancelled this year. Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the region and it now has 60 per cent. of HIV/AIDS cases in central America. Infection is spreading from coastal regions to big towns and there is little access to affordable drugs because almost half the population live on less than &#163;1 a day.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para37"><a name="stpa_37">Two successful UK programmes to fight HIV/AIDS and help sufferers in Honduras will not be renewed after 2005. One programme, worth &#163;450,000, is designed to help direct aid to the most vulnerable people in Honduras. Another UK programme, worth &#163;550,000, trains health workers in preventing AIDS. The Government are also scrapping the &#163;1.75 million poverty reduction programme in Honduras.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para38"><a name="stpa_38">The redirection of aid flows from middle-income countries has come exactly as the Government have increased aid flows to other countries. I understand that; it is an issue that we have debated in the past. However, it is worth considering where such flows are going. Top of the list is India. As I said, the Select Committee has just returned from there after a three-week visit, just as Dr. Feachem addressed Members of the House.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para39"><a name="stpa_39">It is worth considering what Dr. Feachem has said about India and AIDS. India has overtaken South Africa as the country with the largest number of HIV-infected people. He says that he does not believe official estimates that about 5.1 million Indian citizens are infected with HIV, compared with 5.4 million people in South Africa. He said recently in New Delhi:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;India is at the centre of the global AIDS pandemic&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para40"><a name="stpa_40">Many believe that unless AIDS is contained in India it will increase as it did in African countries during the 1990s, helped by widespread migrant labour, sex workers and stigma about sex and AIDS. The Indian Government have rejected Dr. Feachem&#039;s claims. The head of India&#039;s national AIDS control organisation said that the rate of new HIV infections and the percentage of people infected remained much lower in&nbsp;India than in South Africa. One of the concerns about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV/AIDS is that there still appears, even at Government level, to be a stigma about acknowledging infection rates.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para41"><a name="stpa_41">Dr. Feachem&#039;s warning has been closely followed by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the UK Government. The second initiative, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good news, is the UK&#039;s decision to redesign its 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 350WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
&#163;123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million strategy to fight HIV/AIDS in India to reflect the new Congress party-led Government&#039;s increased willingness to tackle the disease, although many foreign donors and non-governmental organisations have criticised the National AIDS Control Organisation for its bureaucratic approach to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;managing India&#039;s response to the epidemic. Only &#163;28&nbsp;million of UK aid has been disbursed in the past few years by NACO; &#163;95 million still sits in the bank.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para42"><a name="stpa_42">Such redesigns are symptomatic of the difficulties facing the Global Fund. Clearly, Governments are listening to the Global Fund&#039;s advice, but they are going it alone, and there is a danger that the extra UK money will be bilateral, not multilateral. The UK has increased its commitments to the Global Fund, but has also moved towards making bilateral commitments, and other countries may do the same. That could undermine the Global Fund just as it is trying to secure the fifth round. India clearly needs the extra money, but the Global Fund should be trusted to invest it, not least because 50 per cent. of the money that it invests is invested because people in recipient countries, rather than the donors, say where it should go. The Global Fund also ensures a fairer disbursement of moneys, and that means that middle-income countries do not miss out.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para43"><a name="stpa_43">Unless there are firm financial commitments to the Global Fund and a slowing of bilateral aid programmes, the prospects of the all-important fifth round will be diminished. If the fifth round did not take place, that would be a real setback for such a fledgling institution, especially given that 2005 is seen as the make-or-break year for the millennium development goals.

</p>

<a name="41116h01_para44"><a name="stpa_44">How could extra funding be found for the fifth round? Two original options are being considered. The first is the suggestion from Dr. Peter Piot, head of UNAIDS, that Africa&#039;s $15 billion debt, which is serviced every year, should be channelled instead into health and education, which Dr. Piot has been quoted as saying are

<p>
<a name="41116h01_para45"><a name="stpa_45">The other option in the short term&#151;perhaps a more realistic one&#151;is the international finance facility. Dr.&nbsp;Feachem has called for the IFF to be launched in early 2005. I am afraid that the US does not support that initiative, but other international measures have not been supported by the US at their initial launch. Multilateral institutions and NGOs alike see the international finance facility as one of the best prospects of finding the funds to meet the millennium development goals.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41116h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Lepper  (Brighton, Pavilion)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I also congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) on securing this important debate, and at an important time: the board of the Global Fund is due to meet in a few days at Arusha in Tanzania.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para48"><a name="stpa_48">I do not want to repeat what has already been said about the development of the Global Fund and the possible threats that it now faces. I would like to focus on the work of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance, which works as part of the Global Fund system. I am proud that the alliance is based in my constituency of Brighton, Pavilion. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will recall his visit to its headquarters with Dr. Peter Piot and me when it marked the tenth anniversary of its valuable international work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para49"><a name="stpa_49">The International HIV/AIDS Alliance has a long-standing relationship with the Global Fund board, as part of the NGO delegation. It has on the board of directors an employee of its India office, who is also a board member of Communities Living with AIDS, TB and Malaria. It is the principal recipient of global funding in Ukraine. The programme in Ukraine for which the alliance is responsible has been judged one of the 10 best organised programmes in a country that is funded by the Global Fund. The alliance provides technical support to Global Fund recipients in Asia, Africa, Latin America and eastern Europe.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para50"><a name="stpa_50">The alliance has worked primarily on providing technical advice and resources to enable the effective participation of civil society organisations in the Global Fund&#039;s country co-ordinating mechanisms in 40 countries, including Honduras and Bolivia, as well as working with the Caribbean Regional Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS. It also provides advice and resources to Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Philippines and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para51"><a name="stpa_51">Since earlier this year, the alliance has been the principal recipient in Ukraine. Its work there focuses on developing community participation and involvement in capacity building among country-based organisations. It centres on preventive work, care and&nbsp;support for people living with HIV/AIDS, clinical care, procurement and supply management, and information and education on policy and advocacy.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para52"><a name="stpa_52">In Ukraine, it is estimated that there are now 49&nbsp;projects, serving an average of 1,000 clients each. The financial support totals about $1 million and the overall number of people who receive services is about 30,000 to 40,000. Over the past quarter, 350,000 condoms have been distributed as part of the work that is being undertaken in Ukraine. The programme is important and its work is best judged by its effect on individuals. The International HIV/AIDS Alliance provides examples that bring home to us what lies behind the talk of funding and programmes&#151;the impact on the lives of individuals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para53"><a name="stpa_53">In Ukraine, Tamila was helped by Light of Hope, a local organisation, with the support of the Global Fund. She is 19 and was admitted to a psychiatric clinic after 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 352WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
an unsuccessful suicide attempt. The ambulance doctors found out that she was living with HIV and revealed her status to the doctors at the psychiatric clinic. Tamila was not using drugs and was not involved in the sex trade, but she was treated aggressively and beaten by medical staff in the resuscitation unit at the hospital to which she was taken.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para54"><a name="stpa_54">Through the work of Light of Hope, the local organisation with which the International HIV/AIDS Alliance works, there has been intervention in Tamila&#039;s case. A review was held and she now receives the emotional, medical and legal support that might not otherwise have been available to her. She would have become another wasted life because of the prejudice that exists towards those living with HIV/AIDS.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para55"><a name="stpa_55">I shall cite a further example of the way in which bureaucracy can prevent help from reaching those who should receive it. Working with a locally based charitable foundation called Alternative, the alliance found out about a HIV-positive woman who gave birth and, because of the circumstances in which she was living, left her child in the hospital. She believed that she could not give it proper care. Later, because she had a job and her life became more stable, she felt able to try to reclaim her child, but Ukrainian bureaucracy and stereotyping about socially vulnerable people made getting the child back a complicated task.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para56"><a name="stpa_56">The project staff at Alternative, backed by the Global Fund, did all they could to help. Eventually the woman was able to establish her parental rights and her child came back to her, but the child was suffering from TB by then. Once again, agencies funded by the Global Fund, working through the guidance of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance, were able to intervene in people&#039;s lives. The lives of those two people might otherwise have been wasted. None of us in the Chamber has any doubts about the importance of the Global Fund&#039;s work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para57"><a name="stpa_57">I echo the concerns expressed by other Members. The fifth round is crucial, as are decisions that are to be taken later this week. There has already been delay, and there is concern that the US Government may be pushing for a further delay of the fifth round. That could lead to the removal of funds from some of the most successful work&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on all three diseases, thus denying many people&nbsp;who desperately need it access to care, support and medicines, such as anti-retroviral treatment, and delaying the start-up of much-needed prevention programmes. Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary tell us what the Government are doing to ensure that no such delay occurs?


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para58"><a name="stpa_58">As hon. Members have said, 2005 is a crucial year for all development programmes: the UK will lead the European Union and G8 presidencies and the millennium development goals will be reviewed next autumn. We know that we are falling short of those goals and that one of the main reasons for that is the failure of many G8 nations to respond adequately to the AIDS pandemic. It is possible to reverse the impact of AIDS and to care for those who are suffering. Next year, the UK Government will be in a central position to influence what happens. What specific commitments are they considering making during their EU and G8 presidencies to ensure that we take those vital programmes forward to combat all three preventable illnesses, and the impact of HIV/AIDS?

Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) on securing the debate. I could not disagree with anything he said. Neither could I disagree with anything said by the Chairman of the Select Committee on International Development, whom I congratulate on distributing the new international development magazine. I am sure that its next edition will include an article on the subject of our debate.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para59"><a name="stpa_59">I am pleased that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper) mentioned several issues in Ukraine. I worked there some years ago and know that it suffered badly after the Chernobyl disaster.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para60"><a name="stpa_60">I will try not to repeat what has been said, but some figures are so stark that I may repeat them. As the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh said, the United Nations Secretary-General issued a call to action in April 2001 to battle malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS, to mobilise, manage and disburse funds with the Global Fund and to try to reverse the spread and reduce the consequences of those infectious diseases and others between now and 2010. The Global Fund was created to finance a dramatic turnaround in the fight against those diseases, which kill more than 6 million people a year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para61"><a name="stpa_61">I hope that the Under-Secretary will detail the financial commitments and proposed disbursements for the year ahead, now that we have heard from the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh about what has already been committed and disbursed. To date, the Global Fund has committed $3 billion in 128 countries to support aggressive intervention against AIDS, TB and malaria. It is vital.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para62"><a name="stpa_62">The fund is truly an international project, with a global impact, fighting three of the deadliest problems that the world faces. The statistics about what it is doing and what it is hoped it will do are impressive. As has been said, TB kills about 2 million people a year&#151;an estimated one third of the world&#039;s population may be infected. It is estimated that, in the next 15 years, it could claim 35 million lives and that 200 million may become sick with it. About 250,000 children die each year of TB.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para63"><a name="stpa_63">Poverty and TB go together. It costs only $10 for a full treatment course to cure infectious patients. The Global Fund is helping to detect 3.5 million additional cases of infectious TB. It is also hoped that it will cure 2 million people through the directly observed therapy strategy. The fund is also fighting the new scourge&#151;multi-drug-resistant TB&#151;with more than 12,000 new treatments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para64"><a name="stpa_64">We have heard that an estimated 45 million people are infected with HIV worldwide; 95 per cent. of those live in the poorest countries, in what we call the developing world, but more than 20 million have been killed worldwide, and the virus is now the leading cause of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death in Africa. Again, children suffer. More than 15&nbsp;million children have been orphaned by AIDS and that figure is projected to double in the not-too-distant future. Over the next five years, the fund should provide 1.6 million people with anti-retroviral treatment, reach 52 million people with counselling and testing for HIV prevention, and support more than 1 million orphans with medical services, community care and education.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para65"><a name="stpa_65">Malaria kills at least 1 million people per year and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could cause more than 300 million clinical cases. More than 40 per cent. of the world&#039;s population is at&nbsp;risk from malaria. That figure is increasing&#151;in the 21st century, when we should be winning the battle&#151;because of poor health systems, drug resistance, climate change, war and poverty. It is the poorest, and children, who are most vulnerable. Ninety per cent. of malaria deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and approximately 3,000 people die of it each day in that region&#151;many of them children. The fund is providing finance for 108 million treated bed nets to protect families from transmission and is delivering 145 million treatments for resistant malaria.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para66"><a name="stpa_66">AIDS, TB and malaria are the most lethal combination that one could imagine. That combination is hitting the world&#039;s poorest people hard, in Africa. The most vulnerable group, as I have said, are children, many of whom are already orphans. The effect of orphanhood on children in Africa is terrifying. For most people, the death of their child is the worst thing that could ever happen; but what happens to children who are orphaned in some countries seems like a fate worse than death.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para67"><a name="stpa_67">In Zambia, 65 per cent. of child prostitutes are orphans. In Addis Ababa, 75 per cent. of child domestic workers are orphans. Such children are more vulnerable to sexual abuse than any other sector of society. There are orphan gangs and orphan delinquents&#151;bewildered, lonely and angry children. Never having known love, they reach adulthood and have their own children. That growing band of potential orphan parents will be one of the highest-risk groups. If they die, their children will have no grandparents to look after them. That is a time bomb that is ready to explode, if it is not already doing so.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para68"><a name="stpa_68">Many of those orphans are also the carers for their siblings. I met a young boy in Addis Ababa who told me his story. He was 14, with a 12-year-old brother. His mother and father had died. They lived together in what&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was basically a cardboard-box and plastic slum dwelling. They spent their days shoe shining and going to school. They earned enough money to buy food to eat. If they earned more, the older boys would steal the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;money. That is how they existed&#151;and they are vulnerable; one fears for their future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para69"><a name="stpa_69">An objective observer of what is unfolding would be forgiven for thinking that the world had gone mad. At a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time when starvation and disease grip parts of our planet, obesity and over-consumption are major problems in the west.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para70"><a name="stpa_70">The Global Fund provides some salvation, and its resources give hope to the millions who suffer TB, malaria or AIDS. What can the fund do? Previous speakers told us about what has happened and spoke of its potential, but we must look to the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para71"><a name="stpa_71">The statistics seem bleak, but only last week I heard at first hand of one case in which the battle against TB had been won and the war against AIDS was being fought with determination. A gentleman called Winston Zulu came to visit me in Parliament. He is from Zambia and is one of 13 children. He was treated for TB and recovered, but he has been living with AIDS since 1990. He had four brothers, all of whom died of TB or HIV. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 355WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The last one passed away in March because of a lack of access to anti-TB drugs. I feel for him as I am one of four brothers; he said that he was the only survivor. He was cured of TB in 1997 and he is now an advocate for the changes that can be delivered by the Global Fund.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para72"><a name="stpa_72">Winston Zulu is now married and an inspiration to many. I met him not only at Westminster but in Edinburgh, where he was speaking to a group that included another person who deserves mention. Sir John Crofton, a 92-year-old inspirational individual, developed the first co-ordinated drug resistance programme. I think that it provided the foundation for the DOTS programme that the Select Committee saw being delivered so effectively in India, in one of the successes in the battle against TB. It was good to see that the man who developed the treatment 50 years ago is still battling on today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para73"><a name="stpa_73">The Select Committee visited India, but I went there in March to see at first hand how DOTS was unfolding. While there, I spoke to mothers and children who would have been orphans but for the investment of a relatively small amount&#151;$10 per head for a life saved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para74"><a name="stpa_74">I met the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State after that visit, and I spoke of the concern that the funding of TB programmes might end in the not-too-distant future. I was pleased to receive a letter from the Under-Secretary. The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) and I had raised with him the question of future funding for anti-malaria programmes in India. He wrote:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;The Government have also told us that the Global Fund for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AIDS, TB and Malaria, to which DFID has committed &#163;180&nbsp;million, has made a grant to India for TB control in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. They have therefore decided not to ask for DFID assistance for TB in those states, which means that our programme in Andhra Pradesh will end in 2005 as planned.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para75"><a name="stpa_75">Credit where credit is due: not only did the Under-Secretary stay in touch and keep me up to date, but DFID is playing its part. I say, &quot;Well done.&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para76"><a name="stpa_76">Sadly, the opposite was the case in Malawi at the Bottom hospital in Llongwe. There, we saw TB sufferers and AIDS victims being treated in a medical system that appeared to be falling apart. The health workers were falling victim to the same diseases, and 50 per cent. of poor households were affected by AIDS. Although every bed was full in the children&#039;s ward, we were told that it was a quiet time&#151;at busy times, there are two or three children to each bed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para77"><a name="stpa_77">The Global Fund can invest in education to ensure prevention and reduce the spread of those diseases that have been mentioned. Again, that is likely to help the most vulnerable&#151;the children, and especially young girls, many of whom miss their education because of the pressure to leave school to become carers when their families need their help.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para78"><a name="stpa_78">One statistic on the education of children in Malawi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sticks in my mind. We were told that of every 1,000 children who start primary school, two would graduate and one would die of AIDS. That cycle must be broken, and the Global Fund can help. However, the fund is no good without the political will of donors and recipients. We must continue to say that what is happening is unacceptable; the tide of devastation must be turned.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para79"><a name="stpa_79">We have just remembered the dead of two world wars, during which resources were made available to defeat the enemy and the political will was unbending. We are now at war in Iraq and spending hundreds of millions of pounds to enable Iraqis to experience democracy. However, at the same time, people are dying by the million of preventable diseases&#151;1 million a year of malaria; 2 million a year of TB, and possibly 3 million a year of AIDS. Those are the real weapons of mass destruction in today&#039;s world; they are the killers that we should focus on.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para80"><a name="stpa_80">The holocaust that is unfolding is made all the worse by the fact that we know what is required to bring it to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an end&#151;resources and political will. The resources must be made available, whatever the mechanism. The Global Fund is needed and our attention should not be diverted from the war that we should be fighting&#151;against poverty and disease. Many people, including me, have expressed their concerns about what is going on in Iraq, but few have seen it as a diversion from a much greater problem: the death toll from malaria, TB and AIDS this week could exceed the total number killed in Iraq since the war began. We cannot go on like that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para81"><a name="stpa_81">I hope that the Under-Secretary will address a number of issues: the future funding of the Global Fund and the proposed International Financing Facility; what we can do to play our part in that when the UK Government chairs both the EU and the G8 in the year ahead, and how we can work in partnerships&#151;no individual country can make progress on its own. Partnership is needed, and ways of ensuring that future disbursement means that money that has been pledged gets through to those who need it most. Most of all, we must play our part in the world to ensure the political will to end this tragedy.

<a name="41116h01_para83"><a name="stpa_83">The UK played a leading role in setting up the Global Fund in 2002 and has remained strongly committed to it, pledging about &#163;154 million for the first seven years of its operation. Because it is still in its infancy, it is possible to measure the impact of the Global Fund anecdotally only, and that is what we have tried to do today. However the transparency and accountability of the fund, two of its core founding principles, have already allowed the organisation to demonstrate its success. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh is right; it would be grossly unfair if, because it is so careful about accountability and transparency, it were to be castigated in its early years for being slow in spending its money.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para84"><a name="stpa_84">The UK has doubled its pledge from 2005 to 2008, thus bringing our overall commitment to approximately &#163;259 million. That makes the UK the fourth largest donor to the fund, and we share the Government&#039;s pride in that achievement. Earlier speakers have rightly stressed the importance of tying up round five as quickly as possible.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para85"><a name="stpa_85">The Global Fund operators tell us that donor contributions have enabled it to approve 296 programmes in 128 countries. Roughly three fifths of that funding goes to Africa, one fifth to Latin America, one fifth to Asia, and very small amounts go elsewhere.

<a name="41116h01_para86"><a name="stpa_86">The 2004 UNAIDS report provides fresh evidence&#151;if we needed it&#151;of the scale of the AIDS crisis that Africa is facing. It is universally acknowledged as the biggest threat to Africa&#039;s development and the No. 1 cause of death in that continent, yet rates of HIV infection continue to rise in sub-Saharan Africa overall and in most individual countries, with a few encouraging exceptions such as Uganda and Botswana.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para87"><a name="stpa_87">Last year alone, an estimated 3 million people in the region became newly infected, but that shocking statistic is only the tip of a very sad iceberg. In earlier debates in this Chamber, we discussed in detail the consequences of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that, including destruction of public sector infrastructure, economic and educational collapse, and&#151;worst of all&#151;collapse in the health service itself as some doctors and nurses become infected and others flee to the first world, encouraged by higher salaries and better conditions. Those trends come after a decade of international efforts to highlight the devastating effect of AIDS, particularly on that continent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para88"><a name="stpa_88">The Global Fund has much to offer. There are four key ways in which it can direct its energies into helping to break the AIDS epidemic, and in some respects it is already doing so. A significant proportion of the funds should be spent on the anti-retroviral drugs that are needed to treat people with AIDS. The importance of anti-retroviral therapy has been much discussed in our debates on AIDS. The treatment is still not a cure, and it presents new challenges; there are side effects and there is drug resistance. However, it has dramatically reduced mortality rates, revitalised communities, and brought hope and quality of life to people who are HIV-infected. AIDS is gradually becoming a manageable chronic illness, rather than simply a plague.

</p>

Africa is still relatively small. The World Health Organisation estimates that nine out of 10 people who urgently need treatment for HIV are not being reached. It is predicted that 5 million to 6 million people in developing countries will die in the next two years without anti-retroviral drugs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para90"><a name="stpa_90">India and Brazil are the greatest examples for the production of generic anti-retroviral drugs. The cost of drugs in those countries has been reduced. Brazil is now home to up to one third of all the people being treated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for AIDS and it has successfully reduced its HIV/AIDS-related deaths by more than 85 per cent. That is a remarkable figure. Furthermore, the Brazilian Government have estimated that anti-retroviral drugs made savings of about $2 billion in hospital care that would otherwise have been needed by people living with HIV. That is a significant figure, as there are also many other diseases to fight. We should think about what else the money that is spent on hospital care for AIDS patients could have been spent on.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para91"><a name="stpa_91">I am not suggesting that domestic generic production is the right way forward for every country, and it is important that we always remember to pay tribute to pharmaceutical companies that are lowering their prices to third-world countries. It is worth remembering that Merck is the world&#039;s largest corporate donor; if benefits in kind are included, it donates more than Bill Gates.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para92"><a name="stpa_92">A recent Oxfam survey report drew attention to the urgent need to fund health services to deliver treatment. The funding of those essential services should go hand in hand with the massive cuts in the prices of drugs that are coming into effect; in some countries they are being provided in domestic programmes. The Global Fund is already providing opportunities for countries such as Uganda to deliver comprehensive programmes that include treatment using anti-retrovirals. Estimates indicate that by 2009 the Global Fund will have increased the number of people living with AIDS on ARV treatment fivefold, to around 1.6 million. Sadly, that is still a small proportion of the total, but it is none the less a remarkable figure. The fund is also expected to have provided voluntary HIV/AIDS counselling and testing services aimed at prevention to 52 million people. Prevention is of course the best cure of all.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para93"><a name="stpa_93">Those are encouraging targets, but I should stress the necessity of continuing to prioritise the introduction of health services across Africa if we are really to see tangible global progress. In a recent speech on AIDS in Africa I emphasised the use of anti-retrovirals for pregnant women, which, on the cure side of the equation, is how the greatest number of lives can be saved at the smallest cost.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para94"><a name="stpa_94">The final role for the Global Fund should be to strive to encourage more research and development by pharmaceutical companies into the treatment of all three killer diseases. In the past, companies have often invested large sums in drugs that failed to produce a return on their investment while producing a huge benefit for people in developing countries. Indeed, a delegation from Merck told me that much in its corporate donor programmes started from one of its programmes that was a commercial disaster but saved a large number of lives. If we harden up the guarantees for companies on intellectual property rights in the first

<br>&nbsp;<br>
world, we will encourage them to ensure that the desperately-needed investment in drugs in the third world carries on with fewer side effects.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para95"><a name="stpa_95">The figures indicate, I believe, that tuberculosis kills more people than AIDS and malaria combined, although the equation is quite complicated because a lot of people who die of TB are infected with HIV/AIDS. Leaving that grisly statistic aside, however, the fund has an excellent record on TB. Modernisation of labs for TB in Moldova is one example of success in Europe, and the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion talked about Ukraine. The training of private practitioners in the recommended TB control strategy known as DOTS&#151;directly observed treatment short-course&#151;in the Philippines is another example. In five years the fund aims to have quadrupled the number of people being treated for multi-drug resistant TB. Furthermore, it estimates that 3.5 million TB patients will have been offered DOTS treatment by then.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para96"><a name="stpa_96">I strongly believe that malaria must be tackled by a coupled approach of prevention and cure. The Global Fund aims to do just that. Prevention is best achieved through the drainage and spraying of swamps and ditches where mosquitoes breed and through the use of netting. Much of my mother&#039;s family were involved in the colonial service in Africa, and it has been deeply frustrating for me to see the extent to which things went back in the wrong direction after independence. Progress made in fighting mosquito-borne infections, particularly malaria, was lost. For years and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years we went in the wrong direction, as basic procedures were lost in countries where relatives of mine worked.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para97"><a name="stpa_97">So far, the fund has subsidised more than 10,000 insecticide-treated nets for pregnant women in Madagascar, as well as focusing on a cure through the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supply of artemisinin-class combination therapy&#151;ACT&#151;drugs to areas most in need. The all-party group on AIDS has a terrific reputation and I particularly welcome the start of a new group on malaria, which I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O&#039;Brien) chairs. That group has just embarked on a programme of studies that will produce a report for Ministers in the new year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para98"><a name="stpa_98">In a short space of time the Global Fund has undoubtedly achieved much. It is essential, as all hon. Members who have spoken have stressed, that the uncertainty over the fifth round be lifted as quickly as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible, as it needs to go ahead. The scale of the problems with all three diseases is so vast that we have to be quite modest about what can be achieved in the short term, but the Global Fund is achieving a great deal and doing so in a way that is almost entirely corruption free. If the Chamber will forgive an unfortunate military parallel, we are getting more bangs for the buck out of the Global Fund, but there is so much more to do.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para99"><a name="stpa_99">We do not even have all the Governments on side. When one listens to the pronouncements from the South African Government on HIV/AIDS, one realises that it is not just about resources; we must arrange delivery structures and change attitudes among Governments and many ordinary people if we are to get rid of the scourge of these three diseases.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para100"><a name="stpa_100">The Global Fund has a vital role in all this. I&nbsp;congratulate the Government on their work with it and hope that we can tie up the fifth round as soon as possible.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="41116h01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development  (Mr. Gareth Thomas) </b> : I, too, congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) on securing this debate. He is right to remind us of the urgency of the need to tackle the three epidemics.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para101"><a name="stpa_101">The debate brought back memories of my visit in May to Dukathole township in South Africa, where Christian Aid was doing some remarkable work with the South African Anglican Church in supporting a number of women and was providing support to orphans and a number of people dying of TB as part of its AIDS-related work. That example reminds us just how severe the challenges of AIDS, TB and malaria are in making progress on international development. Together, those diseases cause around 6 million deaths. As my right hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh said, poor countries shoulder the vast majority of the burden associated with diseases that threaten to undermine progress on all the millennium development goals. AIDS, more than any other issue, is reversing the progress that has been made in sub-Saharan Africa, and particularly in southern Africa. AIDS is steadily reversing the development progress that we have seen.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para102"><a name="stpa_102">Worldwide, there are almost 60 million people with AIDS. In view of those figures and the need to make more progress, in July we published our strategy on HIV/AIDS for the next three years to support the global effort scale-up on the epidemic in the developing world. We have supported that strategy with a commitment to provide some &#163;1.5 billion over the next three years to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work on HIV and AIDS control. That money is particularly important in the context of figures from UNAIDS, which estimates that next year we should be spending some $12 billion in the fight against AIDS and by 2007 we should be spending some &#163;20 billion. The stark statistic is that by 2003 we were spending only&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some $4.7 billion worldwide. That indicates the importance of the Global Fund and also, more generally, the importance of scaling up assistance for the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para103"><a name="stpa_103">The three epidemics feed off each other. After years of decline, the number of TB deaths in Africa is beginning to increase again. TB is the fourth most common cause of death from communicable diseases, and multi-drug&nbsp;resistant TB is an increasing problem. About 100&nbsp;countries worldwide have malaria, and almost half of those are in sub-Saharan Africa. Like the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), I welcome the&nbsp;formation of an all-party group on malaria, and I&nbsp;look&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward to engaging with it. It will undoubtedly complement the excellent work done by the all-party group on AIDS, in which my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh is an active participant.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para104"><a name="stpa_104">The hon. Member for Canterbury alluded to recent advances in the production and widespread distribution of insecticide-treated nets and artemisinin-based therapy for drug-resistant malaria, which give the international community an opportunity to scale up the prevention and treatment of malaria.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para105"><a name="stpa_105">As I said, there is a range of methods for us to use to support the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria. The Global Fund is one such method, but the UK has spent 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 361WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
some &#163;1.5 billion since 1997 on strengthening health systems in developing countries&#151;a crucial part of the infrastructure to fight AIDS, TB and malaria.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para106"><a name="stpa_106">We also work with, and fund the work of, other equally crucial international bodies, including UNAIDS, the World Health Organisation and its vital three-by-five initiative, and UNICEF, with which we are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working to strengthen the response of African Governments to the orphans and vulnerable children crisis. We are also working with organisations such as the Gates Foundation, the Clinton Foundation and major pharmaceutical companies to reduce the cost of drugs and other interventions and to increase access to them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para107"><a name="stpa_107">Like the hon. Member for Canterbury, I pay tribute to the work of pharmaceutical companies, but it is worth remembering just how skewed the worldwide market in drugs is towards the developed world. Some 50 per cent. of the drugs market is based in north America, some 25&nbsp;per cent. is based in Europe, and only 1 per cent. is based in the continent of Africa. That is a powerful reminder of the fact that further progress is needed to focus on the drugs that developing countries need and to provide access to those drugs. That is the responsibility not only of drug companies but crucially of rich donors, who need to support developing countries and to help them to develop their own regulatory and in-country capacity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para108"><a name="stpa_108">Crucially, we also support the work of key non-governmental organisations. I alluded to the work of Christian Aid, which I saw in South Africa. My hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper) rightly paid tribute to the work of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance. I am grateful for the opportunity that he has provided to put on record my appreciation of the hugely significant work that it does. It plays a particularly important role in fighting the stigma and discrimination that still bedevil the fight against AIDS in particular.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para109"><a name="stpa_109">The International HIV/AIDS Alliance targets AIDS and campaigns for more assistance to groups such as men who have sex with men and injecting drug users. It&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also supports needle-exchange programmes, and highlights the needs of sex workers, which is particularly important. We need to continue to support that work, which is why I was pleased to be able to announce an extra &#163;1 million of support to it as part of our decision to increase support to NGOs working in Latin America. The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) alluded to the situation in Honduras, where the alliance is already working. Its work is globally respected, and I look forward to continuing to engage with it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para110"><a name="stpa_110">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) also rightly alluded to the excellent work of Results UK. I, too, had the privilege of meeting Winston Zulu in the UK last week. He is a remarkable man who is remarkably dignified in the face of the terrible loss that he has experienced. Four of his brothers have died of TB and AIDS for want of access to the drugs that have helped him to survive&#151;a powerful reminder from him and Results UK of the need for us to do more on TB and malaria, as well as on AIDS.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 362WH</b>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para111"><a name="stpa_111">My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh alluded to the fact that the Government played a leading role in setting up the Global Fund in 2001. He also mentioned that it has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approved $3 billion of grants to more than 300&nbsp;programmes in more than 120 countries. Of those grants, 60 per cent. are going to sub-Saharan Africa and more than 20 per cent. are going to Asia, the middle east and north Africa. Approximately 56 per cent. are going specifically on HIV-related work, 30 per cent. are going on malaria and 13 per cent. are going on TB.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para112"><a name="stpa_112">Predictable and sustainable financing will be critical to the fund&#039;s continued success because it will help the fund plan, give confidence to the poor and make a real and lasting impact on the ground in countries where these epidemics are at their worst. That is one reason why the Government decided in July to double our pledge from 2005 to 2008, bringing our overall pledge to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#163;250 million, or $450 million, and making the UK the fourth largest donor to the fund. In September, following a request from Kofi Annan, Nelson Mandela and the fund&#039;s executive director, Richard Feacham, we brought forward &#163;3 million, or $5.3 million, from our pledge for 2005 to help the fund leverage the maximum contribution from the United States. I am pleased to say that a number of other donors followed suit. We are prepared to consider putting more money into the fund, although we obviously have to consider the case for doing so alongside the case for putting money into other funding instruments and our own country programmes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para113"><a name="stpa_113">Showing results will remain essential if the fund is to continue to give donors and beneficiaries the confidence and the information that they need to invest in the fund, and good results will obviously be a powerful factor in attracting more money from donors. The Global Fund management team recognises that and has been working with DFID staff to develop effective and appropriate performance indicators. As my right hon. Friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh suggested, the fund needs to widen its donor base in the G8 and, more importantly, the wider international community. I pay tribute to the work of Richard Feacham, who is seized of that point and who has been actively lobbying outside the fund&#039;s traditional circle of donors.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para114"><a name="stpa_114">My right hon. Friend asked whether the UK supported a round five, and we do. There will also be high-level UK representation at future replenishment conferences, and we shall be lobbying others to contribute to the fund.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para115"><a name="stpa_115">My right hon. Friend alluded to the role of the Americans, and I want to place on record my appreciation not only of their continuing, large contribution to the Global Fund and the fight against AIDS more generally but of their increasing co-operation with the UK through the US/UK taskforce. We are looking at how we can tighten our links and improve co-ordination on the ground in five specific African countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para116"><a name="stpa_116">My right hon. Friend asked about European Community funding for the Global Fund. The EC pledged &#163;260 million for 2004, and the total EU pledge to the fund represents approximately 48 per cent. of all the pledges for 2004.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para117"><a name="stpa_117">The second way in which the fund can make maximum use of its resources is by targeting poor countries&#151;a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) in an intervention. The Government&#039;s view has always been that the fund should prioritise its assistance to help the very poorest countries scale up their efforts against AIDS, TB and malaria.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para118"><a name="stpa_118">The hon. Member for Banbury, who chairs the Select Committee on International Development, rightly reminded the House that we should not forget the needs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of middle-income countries. He highlighted the problems in Honduras, and mentioned the decision of the Department for International Development to withdraw from direct bilateral programmes with that country. By way of reassurance to the hon. Gentleman, I&nbsp;flag up the fact that considerable donor assistance is still going into Honduras&#151;and Latin America more generally&#151;from the World Bank, the United Nations Population Fund, the European Union and the Global Fund.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para119"><a name="stpa_119">Through our assistance programmes for Latin America, we are seeking to increase effectiveness and joint working among those donors operating in Honduras and other Latin American countries. We have also increased our funding to NGOs. I mentioned the International HIV/AIDS Alliance; that is one example of benefit for work in Latin America. We are also seeking to improve south-south co-operation in Latin America on, for example, the rolling-out of the excellent work done in Brazil to the wider Latin American continent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para120"><a name="stpa_120">On the point made by the hon. Member for Banbury about middle-income countries, one of the regions on which we continue to concentrate, particularly in terms&nbsp;of the stigma and discrimination that bedevils the response to AIDS, is the Caribbean. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is sending me to the Caribbean next week for a crucial conference with Caribbean leaders. The conference will look into the issue of stigma and discrimination and how we can challenge it more effectively in the Caribbean.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para121"><a name="stpa_121">The hon. Member for Banbury also alluded to the Select Committee&#039;s recent visit to India. It is right to say that we have remodelled our support for the Indian Government&#039;s National AIDS Control Organisation. I&nbsp;hope that he has had the chance to hear or meet the new head of that organisation, who is trying to reform its work significantly, speed it up and make it more effective. We recently heard that the new Congress Government have given it even more funding to enable it to extend and increase its work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para122"><a name="stpa_122">We want the Global Fund to continue to focus on working more closely with other donors. For example, it should work more closely and effectively with the US President&#039;s emergency programme for AIDS relief, the&nbsp;World Bank&#039;s multi-country AIDS programme and a series of other bilateral donors and multilateral initiatives. In particular, we look to UNAIDS as the international agency with the legitimacy and mandate to co-ordinate all those donor initiatives. One reason that we increased our funding to UNAIDS last year was in order to make it more effective at co-ordinating the work of donors.

<p>
<a name="41116h01_para123"><a name="stpa_123">On TB and malaria, we believe that the Global Fund needs to continue to work closely with implementing agencies such as the stop TB partnership and the roll back malaria programme.

Member for Banbury referred to the ninth board meeting due to take place in Arusha in Tanzania on Thursday and Friday. As well as considering a future round five, delegates in Arusha will look in the longer term at the shape and size of the Global Fund. The fund is to be commended on its recent paper on its future role and financing needs. We welcome much of it, but see opportunities to continue to improve the operations of the fund and increase its value for money. Of course, we want to make sure that the fund stays true to its intention of being a lean, effective and efficient funding instrument.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para125"><a name="stpa_125">My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh alluded to the fact that the Global Fund needs about $1.3 billion of new money to finance ongoing projects, and a further $1 million to launch a new round.
</p>






<p><a name="st_9"><a name="41116h01_spnew7"><b> John Barrett </b> : Before the Under-Secretary concludes, will he touch on the issue of expanding the capacity of potential recipient countries, and on finding out whether there are other methods&#151;particularly, perhaps, that of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;co-ordination between our medical systems&#151;to increase our capacity? Perhaps our royal colleges could work together to help with training our physicians here and abroad, or with bringing people across. When the Global Fund made the money available, capacity would be increased; the money could be more efficiently spent in the recipient countries.
</p>






<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41116h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Thomas </b> : The need to increase developing countries&#039; capacity to respond to AIDS is one reason for our putting significant money and technical assistance into such countries&#039; health systems since 1997. We need to do more about that. We published a paper on access to medicines in the first six months of this year, looking at what else we could do to build on our work in several countries in Africa to increase both regulatory capacity and in-country production of anti-retroviral and other drugs. Those are two examples of the way in which we are trying to improve developing countries&#039; capacity to respond to the AIDS crisis.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para126"><a name="stpa_126">One of the most encouraging things to happen in the past 18 months is the significant drop in the price of anti-retrovirals. The price of some drugs has come down by 95 per cent. I pay particular tribute to the work of the Clinton Foundation for that. However, getting those drugs where they need to be is a particular challenge, particularly in the case of people in rural areas who suffer from AIDS. Continued development of the capacity of in-country health systems must remain an important focus for bilateral donors in particular.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para127"><a name="stpa_127">We work closely with the Global Fund in several countries. Staff of the Department for International Development sit on country co-ordination committees and have participated in visits with Global Fund staff.

We have been actively working with the secretariat to make changes and improvements, and good progress has been made.

We remain determined to play our part in increasing the effectiveness of the global fund.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h01_para129"><a name="stpa_129">The hon. Member for Banbury alluded to the considerable additional donor assistance that is needed if we are to make progress towards meeting the millennium development goals by 2015. The UN estimates that $100 billion is needed annually if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are to continue to make progress; however, just $50 billion is currently being provided. Our response to that has been to increase development assistance significantly over the next three years. The largest increase for any Government Department has been at the Department for International Development. There is a 9 per cent. increase for each of the next three years.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41116h02_spnew0"><b> Jane Griffiths  (Reading, East)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful for the opportunity to have this debate and to raise these important matters. This is not the first time that I have initiated a debate on legal aid in Reading in this place. In July 1999, I was fortunate enough to obtain a debate on matters relating to the management of legal aid in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading. At that time, my concerns were about pressures on office staff, which resulted in inadequate scrutiny of solicitors&#039; claims. I was pleased when a reporter from the <i>Reading Chronicle</i> subsequently obtained work in that office and highlighted in even greater detail the concerns that I raised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para0"><a name="stpa_132">Today, I am talking about a different aspect of legal support for people seeking asylum in Reading, but it also relates to the quality of legal support that people receive for the money that we all pay. The subject of this debate is legal aid services for asylum seekers in Reading. Let us imagine that we are asylum seekers who have fled our own country and arrived somewhere with a different language and different customs. We have to go through a process that will decide whether we are allowed to stay in the country. Whom can we rely on to save us from being sent back to the place from which we have fled?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para1"><a name="stpa_133">As a society, we see it as a mark of our humanity that we support those who are going through the process that will decide whether they should be allowed to stay in this country. We provide support so they can get effective representation, and we make money available so that they get legal assistance. The point is to ensure that any decision on whether someone can stay or is to be sent back is based on the actual information in the case.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para2"><a name="stpa_134">I have sought this debate because I believe that the subject is important. I make no judgment in any of the cases that I shall raise. I will not say, &quot;This person should be allowed to stay in the UK while that person should not.&quot; It is not my role to do that. My role is to make the law setting out in what conditions people may remain in the UK. Of course, like all hon. Members, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then have a role as a constituency MP, helping to ensure that people who want to stay in the UK have the full opportunity to make their cases properly. It is an important part of British law that people get an opportunity to make their case, and that any decision is based on the full information in that case. Only in that way can just decisions be made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para3"><a name="stpa_135">Like a lot of MPs, I have a sizeable workload involving people who have come to the UK. This is probably among the most altruistic aspects of our work; the people whom we do the work for do not have a vote, and if their cases are heard and they are given permission to stay, become citizens and get the vote, most of us will probably be long gone by the time that they do so. It must be borne in mind that the people who I see are the ones in whose cases something has gone wrong. If everything goes right, someone makes an application and a decision is made, the constituency MP will not generally become involved. Naturally, I have more experience of dealing with the representatives of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading-based people seeking asylum than I have of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other such people, so any failings of Reading representatives are more obvious to me than those of people elsewhere.

<a name="41116h02_para4"><a name="stpa_136">Through doing such work, we get a feel for the people,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for whether they are genuine or something is not quite right about their story and for the quality of representation that they receive. Together with our staff, we see the paperwork detailing the work carried out on behalf of the people seeking to stay in the UK&#151;when their legal representatives send them with any. Before long, I and my staff dealing with people seeking to stay in the UK get a clear impression of the quality and amount of work carried out by legal representatives on behalf of those people, and particularly asylum seekers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para5"><a name="stpa_137">I recognise and appreciate the hard work carried out by many legal representatives in the field. I am not seeking to say that there is a widespread problem with the services received by asylum seekers; some legal representatives are very diligent and hardworking. I am seeking to highlight instances in which there have been problems with the service that has been provided. As I&nbsp;said, my staff and I soon get a feeling for the level of support offered to asylum seekers by those representing them. Although there are hardworking legal representatives who diligently carry out work for those whom they represent, they are, unfortunately, not the only kind. It is well known that some do the minimum work necessary to obtain the legal aid money and then send the asylum seeker to an MP, who carries out the rest of the work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para6"><a name="stpa_138">During seven years and more representing asylum seekers in Reading, I have come to know which companies, and even which particular representatives at which companies, carry out the full range of work necessary and which do not. The people who deserve to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receive the greatest support and to whose cases particular attention has to be paid are unaccompanied minors seeking asylum&#151;people under 18 who have fled their country and turned up in a strange country alone and seeking help. In the late 1990s, a number of unaccompanied minors arrived in Reading seeking asylum from the former Yugoslavia, principally Kosovo. Work with people from that area who are seeking asylum is admittedly not straightforward. It involves ethnicity, religion and employment of family, and great attention needs to be paid to detail.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para7"><a name="stpa_139">Whether through word of mouth from other asylum seekers from the same area, direction from formal agencies or whatever other way, a number of unaccompanied asylum seekers acquired the same legal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;representative, Rodney Oliver, at one Reading company, Thompson Leatherdale. These were a representative and company of which my office was well aware. We had concerns about the quality of service provided to people on legal aid who were seeking asylum, but never were able to point to any hard evidence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para8"><a name="stpa_140">I pay tribute to the work of an organisation called SASIR&#151;Supporting Asylum Seekers In Reading. In particular, that work has focused on Reading college and has been carried out by the Reading college chaplaincy team. I am especially grateful for the work of Harriet Townsend, who is a volunteer. Harriet has spent large amounts of her time accompanying people to see representatives, going though the case with them, identifying whether what has been put forward is the full case, and writing to the Home Office and to the people&#039;s legal representative. Harriet has also acted as a carer for some of those unaccompanied minors.

<p>
<a name="41116h02_para9"><a name="stpa_141">Spending time on a regular basis with young unaccompanied asylum seekers has meant that that organisation has been able to get details of what happened to people and the level of representation that they have received&#151;something that a busy constituency Member&#039;s office very often cannot do so easily. In fairness, a busy legal representative probably cannot do that either. The organisation&#039;s work threw up some worrying information about the level of service received by unaccompanied asylum seekers. I repeat that I do not make any judgment on the right or otherwise of the cases that I am about to mention. I am raising them solely because it is so important to ensure that people receive a fair and just decision and that their case is heard.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para10"><a name="stpa_142">Let us consider the case of BD, who is very mentally damaged and ill. It is believed that he was exposed to serious trauma. The case is a matter for great concern because of the mental condition of the client, yet his case was not presented properly and his history was given incorrectly. I find it impossible to believe that, in respect of someone so mentally damaged and ill, no medical evidence was presented at the appeal, which was dismissed. The case is believed to be a serious one and is listed to be examined, prepared and submitted for an office for the supervision of solicitors investigation. I&nbsp;believe that that has not been done so far, because of limited resources. I made a call this morning to the OSS, and I got the response, &quot;We can&#039;t tell you anything about any of your constituents, because, for us to talk to you, they need to write giving you authority.&quot; I&nbsp;understand data protection implications, but I find that a little bizarre.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para11"><a name="stpa_143">The next case is that of VM, who is traumatised and has psychological problems, and who arrived aged 16, with no family left, having experienced two conflicts. The case was never properly presented, the statements do not make sense and, again, no medical evidence obtained. No case was prepared to present at appeal, even though a certificate of readiness was lodged by Thompson Leatherdale six months previously. There are events recorded on file that are not true. The appeal was dismissed, and from the determination, it is clear that the impact of previous legal representation was highly significant in the dismissal.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para12"><a name="stpa_144">Many other problems have appeared as the OSS investigation progresses, including a statement by the solicitor that the client&#039;s asylum case was based on his religion, when in fact it was not. That is also being investigated by the OSS. The investigation has reached the stage of a report being prepared for adjudication due to serious problems having been identified.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para13"><a name="stpa_145">EI is traumatised and also has psychological problems and a head injury. EI arrived aged 15 with no family left, having come direct from conflict. Again the case was never properly presented and no medical evidence was obtained. The case was not pursued and Thompson Leatherdale failed to discover that the Home Office issued a refusal due to late submittal of papers; that was discovered two and a half years later by social services. When they informed Thompson Leatherdale, no action was taken on the client&#039;s behalf, even though the client would be literally destitute from the day of his 18th birthday. Following representations to the then Minister with responsibility for immigration, his case was reopened; again, the OSS is investigating.

<p>
<a name="41116h02_para14"><a name="stpa_146">The final example that I will give, although it is not the last of these cases, is that of RL, who arrived traumatised, having been beaten. RL was mentally ill and had no family left, and arrived as an unaccompanied minor aged 16, having experienced two wars. RL came direct from conflict. Yet again, the case was never properly presented and bizarre statements were submitted. The wrong geographical area was referred to. Again, no medical evidence was submitted. An appeal was lodged unnecessarily, because exceptional leave to remain had already been granted&#151;a fact that was somehow missed. That was done without the client&#039;s instructions or knowledge.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para15"><a name="stpa_147">Although I am not a lawyer, it seems to me that an appeal should be based on a client&#039;s wish to lodge an appeal and not on the arbitrary decision of a legal representative. The appeal in the case of RL was lodged unnecessarily and without the client&#039;s instructions or knowledge, and as a result, the adjudicator decided that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the appellant was untruthful. It was clear from the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determination that problems with previous representation were significant in the dismissal of the appeal. Documents were not submitted to the court by the deadline, and neither were they presented at the appeal, despite the fact that the form of reply stated that the case was in all respects ready for hearing and was submitted to the court a month previously. Again, that case is being investigated by the OSS and there is documentary evidence to support those complaints.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para16"><a name="stpa_148">Those are four serious examples of the continuous failure of Thompson Leatherdale and, in particular, of Rodney Oliver, as the person preparing and carrying out the work on the cases, to do the work properly. My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter) is in a similar position, with a number of cases in his constituency where work was carried out by Thompson Leatherdale in a similarly incompetent manner or was not carried out properly. Those cases are now before the office for the supervision of solicitors. My hon. Friend and I have together had a number of meetings with those concerned, including volunteers who are seeking to help asylum seekers in Reading.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para17"><a name="stpa_149">The problem is that the cases have been with the OSS for more than a year. The Government set up the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner to ensure that people who give advice in such circumstances do so properly. Complaints were made to the office, but it has said that it will wait until the OSS has completed its investigation. We are going around in circles. In the meantime, Mr. Oliver and Thompson Leatherdale have parted company, and the quality of the work done by the firm has improved. However, Mr. Oliver is still carrying out immigration advice work from his home in Reading.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para18"><a name="stpa_150">Of course, the cases that I have mentioned are ongoing. Appeals are taking place, decisions are being made and more than one of those concerned have been told that they are liable to be deported. The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration has stated in a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West that the existence of such independent bodies ensures quality of representation. In fact, under the Immigration and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 370WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Asylum Appeals (Procedure) Rules 2000, the client is responsible even when the solicitor is at fault. That seems to me to be against natural justice.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para19"><a name="stpa_151">It is vital that those acting on behalf of such people, particularly when they are vulnerable, unaccompanied and under 18, provide a proper service. It is also vital that when people representing asylum seekers are shown not to be doing the job, they are stopped from continuing in it. In Reading, we have a serial failure in one person representing a large number of people. People face deportation as a result of that person&#039;s incompetence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para20"><a name="stpa_152">I know that the Minister will not be able to give me answers about particular cases. I ask only whether the number of cases against Mr. Oliver currently with the OSS could be pulled together and looked at as a whole. Not only should the matters in each particular case be investigated, but the serial, continuous and widespread negligence and incompetence in those cases should be looked at together. Is it possible for the OISC to consider the conclusions made so far by the OSS and make an interim decision about the fitness of Mr. Oliver to continue to give legal representation? Is it possible to suspend any approval for Mr. Oliver to represent people seeking asylum until the cases have been investigated and a decision reached?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para21"><a name="stpa_153">As I said in my introductory remarks, I sought this debate and raised these issues not to judge the worth of the cases of the people who seek asylum to remain in the UK. That decision is not for me. I want my constituents to have full and effective representation to ensure that any decision made about them is fair and just. In the case of unaccompanied minors from the former Yugoslavia, it is clear that they have been let down by Rodney Oliver. Their cases were not heard properly, and the decisions were not made with possession of the full information. I hope that the Minister will be able to look into the matters raised, and that some action can be taken to ensure that others do not fail to get justice as a consequence.

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="41116h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Mr. Christopher Leslie) </b> : I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) on securing this debate. I&nbsp;understand her motivation for raising these issues. They are certainly of importance to her constituents, and many other Members who deal with casework from similar backgrounds will also be interested in the supervision of solicitors.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para22"><a name="stpa_154">As things stand, the legal profession is independent and self-regulating. It is therefore not appropriate for me to comment on complaints about solicitors in individual cases. The Law Society has responsibility for the conduct of solicitors. It has set up a separate body, which used to be known as the office for the supervision of solicitors or the OSS, as my hon. Friend called it, but is now known as the consumer complaints service or the CCS&#151;I want to ensure that we get our acronyms correct&#151;to deal with complaints about solicitors. In any case, where complaints are currently being examined, it is important that the investigations are allowed to proceed to a conclusion.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para23"><a name="stpa_155">My hon. Friend asked about circumstances in which multiple complaints are lodged against an individual. In such circumstances, it will be up to the CCS to decide 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 371WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
whether to pool the complaints and to look at them in the round or to scrutinise each in isolation. She also asked about the potential for suspension of a solicitor, perhaps when they are under investigation. Again, it is my understanding that that is a matter for the Law Society as the designated professional body; it has scope in those matters.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para24"><a name="stpa_156">Where the Legal Services Commission&#151;the body set up to organise the legal aid arrangements&#151;receives a complaint about a supplier of legal aid work, it will provide advice on the appropriate complaints procedure. The LSC is not empowered to investigate the legal competency of solicitors, which is a matter for the Law Society, but under the terms of its contract, it may investigate suppliers&#039; internal procedures and processes used in carrying out services, including those relating to customer services. It is a requirement of the LSC contract that all suppliers have an internal complaints procedure and that that is notified to clients.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para25"><a name="stpa_157">The LSC carries out annual audits of suppliers where those procedures may be reviewed. Following an audit, it may register quality concerns and require corrective action as a condition of the contract. The LSC has also introduced a system of peer review, whereby it uses a select group of quality-assured solicitors to review the legal content of their colleagues&#039; work. Where the outcome of an audit or peer review is poor, the LSC may intervene in the operation of the contract and impose further conditions or restrictions, and in some cases it may terminate the contract. Ultimately, the LSC may launch an official investigation, which is typically used in cases of fraud or criminality. That has more to do with the operation of the supply of legal aid work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para26"><a name="stpa_158">I should like to refer briefly to the changes to asylum legal aid that were introduced earlier this year, as they include new arrangements to improve the quality of advice given in asylum cases that are relevant to some of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the general points made by my hon. Friend. The Government are committed to the provision of publicly funded legal services as a means of promoting social justice and economic well-being, and tackling social exclusion. In respect of asylum and immigration, the Government are committed to protecting people where there is a real and immediate risk of loss of liberty or life. Our country has a long and honourable tradition of offering sanctuary to genuine refugees.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para27"><a name="stpa_159">The Government are also under a duty, however, to ensure that the taxpayer receives value for money in public spending. Asylum legal aid costs have increased significantly over the past few years, from about &#163;81&nbsp;million in 2000 to &#163;204 million in 2003&#150;04. There are many reasons for that; the main one is the increase in the number of people seeking asylum. However, asylum numbers have fallen significantly, from a high of 100,000 to this year&#039;s predicted figure of 35,000, and further falls are likely over the next couple of years. It is necessary to bear that in mind when we consider issues relating to the supply of firms and organisations that undertake publicly funded legal advice on asylum and immigration. The Home Office issues statistics on the number of asylum applications each year and each quarter. On the basis of that information, there were just&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over 80,000 asylum applicants in 2000, 49,000 applications in 2003 and almost 18,000 applications in the first six months of 2004. Again, the trend is downwards.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para28"><a name="stpa_160">The increase in costs, together with evidence of over-claiming, duplication and concerns about the quality of some legal work, meant that we had to take action. New measures were introduced in April this year to bring legal aid on asylum under more effective control and cut unnecessary expenditure. Costs are being limited and targeted on the most deserving cases, and quality advice and representation are being rewarded through a new, independently assessed accreditation scheme for solicitors working on publicly funded asylum cases, which will become compulsory from April next year. Following those reforms, most firms indicated that they wished to continue with legal aid work and many new firms applied for contracts. The concern that many suppliers would withdraw from the market once the new measures were introduced proved unfounded.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para29"><a name="stpa_161">Where there is a particular need to increase legal aid services for asylum seekers in a particular area, however, the Legal Services Commission has taken steps to ensure that capacity will be improved, through either the awarding of new contracts or increasing the amount of work done by an existing supplier, which is known as case matter starts&#151;the number of cases that the supplier is authorised to proceed with. Consideration can also be given to expanding the regional services provided by the Legal Services Commission&#039;s two largest contractors: the Immigration Advisory Service and the Refugee Legal Centre. Sufficient matter starts are allocated to each supplier by the Legal Services Commission to cover&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the expected level of asylum work during the year, but there is flexibility to adjust the allocation if circumstances change.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para30"><a name="stpa_162">On the specific situation in Reading, I reiterate that it is not appropriate for me to comment on issues raised by individual complaints, although my hon. Friend has aired the issues in this debate and no doubt the Law Society and its consumer complaints service will have noted her comments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para31"><a name="stpa_163">Currently, two solicitors&#039; firms in Reading are contracted to provide asylum legal aid services. At the start of the year, 200 asylum case starts were available to those contractors, and to date 73 have been taken up. In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addition, the Legal Services Commission allocated 150 case starts for non-asylum immigration matters, and to date 53 of those have been taken up. When requested, the Legal Services Commission has increased the number of asylum and immigration matter starts for both firms. The firms are taking on new asylum cases, and there is every indication that capacity exists to meet need in the Reading area. My hon. Friend&#039;s concerns were about the quality of those services, but it is important to set out the context; there is scope for people to get support through the legal aid system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para32"><a name="stpa_164">Additional suppliers are contracted to provide legal aid services for asylum seekers in Slough, Oxford and High Wycombe. The Immigration Advisory Service also provides an outreach service in Slough from its offices in Hounslow. The local office of the Legal Services Commission is in regular contact with suppliers in the area, so that issues of concern can be identified and dealt with promptly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para33"><a name="stpa_165">I want now to give my hon. Friend more details of the accreditation arrangements that are in place for the new legal aid arrangements. We take the issue of good quality advice exceptionally seriously. It is important that taxpayers&#039; money is not used only for general 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 373WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
advice, but for the best advice that is available. Accreditation involves direct testing of each solicitor and advice provider to ensure that they have appropriate knowledge and experience of the relevant law and procedure. Applicants undergo practical assessments, for example, conducting mock interviews and drafting statements. They are required to submit a portfolio of their work for discussion at interview.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para34"><a name="stpa_166">The standards to be achieved have been determined by the Legal Services Commission, following consultation with the Law Society and the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner. The assessment of individuals is carried out by external independent bodies, appointed and monitored by the Law Society. When the scheme becomes compulsory, individuals who are not accredited will be unable to undertake asylum legal aid work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para35"><a name="stpa_167">We want to ensure appropriate access to asylum legal services throughout the country to reflect the needs of those seeking asylum. Given the substantial reduction in the number of people claiming asylum, we intend to carry out a major national review of the future demand for asylum legal aid services. That will take account of the latest estimates of asylum numbers and the aim will be to ensure that suppliers of adequate quality are available throughout England and Wales in the areas where they are needed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para36"><a name="stpa_168">I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s need to raise such issues. I recognise that there are questions about how easy, simple and transparent the complaints processes are when people have a genuine grievance that they wish to pursue about advice that they have received from solicitors. That is something about which I and my colleagues in the Department for Constitutional Affairs are concerned. Several processes are under way that will touch on such matters, such as the Clementi review of legal services and the fundamental legal aid review. Both reviews are matters about which hon. Members have been in correspondence over the past few months.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h02_para37"><a name="stpa_169">We are especially keen to strike the right balance between access to free services and cost control, and the level of necessary regulation of those who give advice. We must achieve those important priorities. Having had the opportunity to hear my hon. Friend&#039;s worries, I shall certainly talk further to my officials about the lessons that might be learned from such cases. I hope that today&#039;s debate has been useful to those who are interested in such matters.

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="41116h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire)</b>  (LD): I thank the Minister for attending this important debate and I hope that interruptions, due to Divisions in the House, will be kept to a minimum. I am sure that you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, will agree that, although there may be differences between the parties on the issue, the House must remain committed to the principle of debt relief. I commend the work of the all-party group on heavily indebted poor countries for its persistent work in such matters.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para0"><a name="stpa_170">The year 2015&#151;the target date for the UN millennium development goals&#151;is drawing ever nearer and the commitment made more than four years ago must now be honoured. We are almost a third of the way to that target date and now is a good time to assess the position and renew our commitment to meeting those goals. The moral case for debt relief is simple. People throughout the world are living half lives; they are lives without hope and basic necessities, and often people lose their lives prematurely. We know that they deserve better and we, as a nation, can do better.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para1"><a name="stpa_171">In July 2005, we will welcome the world to Perthshire and host a summit that began as a club for the economic elite, but which has evolved into a mechanism for helping the oppressed and needy. As an institution, the G8 has shown that it has the ability and the will to address the debt of the developing world. The 1999 Cologne summit produced a comprehensive and fairer update of the heavily indebted poor countries scheme. The United Kingdom played a leading role and we can do so again in 2005.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para2"><a name="stpa_172">The structure of the G8 gives the host country real power to shape the summit&#039;s agenda and the UK presidency will be an opportunity to make a difference to world poverty. The G8 presidency will also coincide in the second half of the year with the UK presidency of the European Council. That fortuitous alignment of the stars is behind the creation of the Make Poverty History coalition&#151;a coming together of the UK-based non-governmental organisations, aid agencies and interest groups, backed by widespread public support. The coalition is well aware of the unique opportunity that 2005 presents to our country to lead seven of the world&#039;s most powerful nations. It is up to the Government to seize it and build on the good work that has already been done.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para3"><a name="stpa_173">The moral case for debt relief is clear. Nations in Africa, Asia and South America face what can only be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;described as humanitarian disasters on an unprecedented scale. The Zambian gross national product per capita in real terms was nearly $1,500 in 1970. By 2000 it had been reduced to just under $900. That is a reduction of more than 40 per cent. in 30 years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para4"><a name="stpa_174">Developing nations have not shared in the increases in living standards that other parts of the world have enjoyed. To isolate a single cause for that is impossible, but the state of affairs at present is clear. Life expectancy, for instance, in Botswana is only 38 years; Niger&#039;s literacy rate is below 20 per cent.; and 36 per cent. of people in Myanmar lack access to proper sanitation.

<a name="41116h03_para5"><a name="stpa_175">Africa is blighted by poverty, but the problem extends to all corners of the globe. There is a danger, when highlighting the problems of the developing world, that in listing those appalling statistics we may lose sight of the individual lives that are involved. Lack of access to clean water may mean a 15 km round trip to fulfil the most basic of human needs. Walking more than 15 km every day means that a basic education is almost out of the question. Who has time to go to school when their prime concern is survival?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para6"><a name="stpa_176">The third millennium development goal calls for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. Women are often responsible for gathering water in societies where opportunity is already limited. They are the first to suffer from malnutrition, as they give their children priority in the fight for survival. The lack of essential water supplies means that women are forced to sacrifice even the most basic education. Women&#039;s rights in developing countries are sometimes better served by building a well in the village than by calls for an international Bill of Rights, which might have little practical impact in a developing country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para7"><a name="stpa_177">Debt relief is not a panacea for the ills of the developing world, but it can, in most cases, make a real difference. Funding that would otherwise be used to service debts dating back to the 1970s, which were incurred to mitigate low commodity prices but which have been compounded by high interest rates and oil price surges, can now be invested in building a basic infrastructure, which will, in turn, help to address the rights and needs of local people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para8"><a name="stpa_178">So far, steps taken to reduce the debt of the poorest nations have produced real results. Debt relief has led to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;landmark educational improvements, essential immunisation schemes and vital water and sanitation projects. All are to be celebrated. Those achievements counter the suggestion that heavily indebted poor countries are unable to address the problems of their citizens. A recent study by the Jubilee debt campaign, to which I pay tribute for its work, shows that 65 per cent. of all revenue freed up through debt reduction has been spent on health and education projects.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para9"><a name="stpa_179">Since the introduction of the HIPC project, social&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spending has risen by about 20 per cent. in participating countries. Uganda, Mozambique, Zambia and Tanzania have all been able to abolish school fees for primary education. Success stories are numerous and those countries have shown that they can truly help themselves if they are given a chance to do so.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para10"><a name="stpa_180">Debt relief must be conditional on responsible economic policy and real efforts to tackle corruption, malpractice and unnecessary waste, but we must not forget the rights of developing states as sovereign nations. A solution to this is the creation of national debt relief committees such as those set up in Tanzania and Uganda, which allow the people of heavily indebted poor countries to hold their own Governments to account and to serve to strengthen national democracy. Work by Christian Aid in this area has shown that the demand for accountability already exists in developing countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para11"><a name="stpa_181">We must also accept our own responsibility in the drive to ensure that development aid and cancelled debt revenue reach those who are most in need. Efforts made in clamping down on terrorists&#039; assets should be

extended to those who siphon off Government funds for their own benefit. Good governance is a must if developing nations are to have a chance of recovering from their parlous predicament, the origins of which can be traced back to the 1970s. We must, however, make the distinction between anti-corruption drives, which are essential, and disagreements over economic policy. Corruption is global and not solely the preserve of developing nations. It should not be used to veto or delay help that is already long overdue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para12"><a name="stpa_182">International institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are not a substitute for the voice of the people. They were not elected by the citizens of heavily indebted poor countries&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they must accept that they lack the democratic legitimacy of elected Assemblies. A recent World Development Movement report highlighted the IMF&#039;s demand that Zambia privatise its state bank despite a vote in Parliament against such a policy. The decision taken by Zambia&#039;s Parliament was not simply a knee-jerk reaction, but a response to a 10-year process of privatisation at the behest of the IMF. In the same period, there has been negative economic growth, a rise in foreign ownership of capital and a fall in living standards. I am not suggesting that the IMF is responsible for that state of affairs, but it is absurd that Zambia was asked to take the same medicine over and over again without being allowed to look for an alternative cure.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para13"><a name="stpa_183">The Zambian Government were explicitly threatened with the withdrawal of HIPC-prescribed debt relief if they abided by the decision of the nationally elected Assembly. Cases such as this fuel charges that the west is continuing a policy of neo-colonialism through institutions that it can dominate. The export of free-market ideology has not been kind to many impoverished countries, and we must learn that first-world economies do not always provide the solution for developing-world economies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para14"><a name="stpa_184">I call on the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for International Development to use their positions in the IMF and the World Bank to work towards policies tailored to specific countries and to end this one-size-fits-all approach, which has been shown seriously to damage fledgling economies. That would be an important step in addressing some problems that I have already mentioned regarding international monetary institutions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para15"><a name="stpa_185">Changes must ensure that the distinction is made between debts incurred through criminal and irresponsible activity and debt that a country should be required to pay back. In the future, there should be an administrative bankruptcy procedure for nations that cannot repay all their debt.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para16"><a name="stpa_186">Finally, a shift in emphasis from a structural macro-economic policy to a focus on outcomes linked to the millennium development goals would ensure that debt relief achieved what it is intended to achieve, rather than acting as an accompaniment to economic ideology.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para17"><a name="stpa_187">The much-vaunted success of the Asian tiger economies was based partly on protectionism and partly on state subsidy. Some leeway must be granted in heavily indebted poor countries to protect their firms and producers from international markets. Only yesterday, an article on the BBC&#039;s website highlighted

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
the problems of international markets facing Mexican maize farmers in the state of Oaxaca. Their low-intensity farming methods do not allow them to compete with heavily subsidised US competitors, and they are forced either to adopt unsustainable practices or to face extinction. Mexico is not classed as a heavily indebted poor country, but that does not mean that it is not home to areas of extreme poverty.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para18"><a name="stpa_188">The focus of today&#039;s debate is debt relief, but again it is important to note that debt relief alone will not solve the problems of a developing world or achieve the millennium development goals. We must adopt an holistic approach that combines fair trade policies with increasing aid alongside the reformed HIPC scheme.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para19"><a name="stpa_189">At this point, perhaps we should consider the impact of the common agricultural policy on developing countries; the damage that it can do has been well established. However, although changes to the policy do not go far or fast enough, they are going in the right direction. When the CAP was established, it was based on intervention and subsidies. Heavily subsidised produce was exported to the world market, driving down world prices even more, which was very disruptive and damaging to developing countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para20"><a name="stpa_190">In 1990, we moved on to the MacSharry reforms, which involved direct payments to farmers. Now we have come to the mid-term review: the emphasis is not on extending production in Britain or Europe, but on reinvigorating rural development and environmental practices in the countryside. We should compare that with what happens in America, where considerable and increasing subsidies are paid to promote production. That continues to have deleterious effects on developing countries. The European Union&#039;s common agricultural policy is not perfect by any means, but it is moving in the right direction and we should ensure that that progress goes on and increasingly meets the needs of developing countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para21"><a name="stpa_191">The first steps of debt relief have been made, but we&nbsp;must ensure that our commitment is long term and that the early momentum is not lost. I welcome the Chancellor&#039;s pledge to meet 10 per cent. of the costs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needed for the World Bank and the African Development Bank to cancel multilateral debts. That will ensure that those institutions&#039; resources can be used to fund future projects in the developing world. It is important that debt relief should not be used to substitute for existing Government aid programmes. The Liberal Democrats also support the proposal for the creation of an international finance facility. If that were created and all the signatories contributed, the IFF could play an important role in increasing development aid to the world&#039;s poorest nations. It is estimated that the extra $50 million a year needed to achieve the development goals could be raised through the issue of bonds funded by long-term commitments from developed nations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para22"><a name="stpa_192">The Chancellor has referred to that as his Marshall plan for the third world. The ambition of such a project is commendable, but the Chancellor&#039;s metaphor highlights another reason for supporting developing nations. The 1948 Marshall plan was an investment in war-torn countries against the perceived threat of the Soviet Union. Today, we must again invest to ensure

<br>&nbsp;<br>
that there is prosperity and economic development throughout the world. Poverty breeds resentment and frustration with the status quo. The best way to address radical discontent is to take away the conditions in which it thrives. Ignorance, despair and alienation can&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be countered with education, health care and opportunity. Government-backed bonds are a real investment for the rest of the world. A more stable global environment would be one of the rewards, but there would also be increased opportunities for trade for British companies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para23"><a name="stpa_193">That view is shared by hon. Members in all parties. I&nbsp;welcome the comment made last week by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed):

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para26"><a name="stpa_196">It is vital that the burden of both multilateral and bilateral debt is removed from heavily indebted poor countries, that progress is made on the reform of monetary institutions and that the promise of the IFF is turned into real commitment from the G8, without which it will lack the capacity to make a real difference. I welcome the Government&#039;s work in this area and urge the Prime Minister to underline this achievement in Perthshire next summer.

I am the group&#039;s secretary, and I just wish that we had a snappier title. When the Jubilee 2000&nbsp;campaign was set up, the whole of civil society&#151;the non-governmental organisations, Churches, trade unions and others&#151;began working with Members of Parliament. Jubilee 2000 was a nice, snappy title, so being the secretary was much easier. However, the words behind the acronym HIPC probably sum up not only the issue, but the difficulties that we all face.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para31"><a name="stpa_201">It is ironic that the Band Aid event is this week, because the very same issue got me involved in politics 20 years ago.

We use a different language here, but Bob puts it right on the record, and there is no shirking our responsibility to sort this out. Just a few weeks ago, he showed us pictures of the situation in north and central Africa, including pictures of pot-bellied children. He said quite pointedly that, in one sense, their problem is not food, but the politics that prevent food or water from getting to them. We live in a world that can feed itself, but we are still unable to achieve that, so it is down to us to put structures in place to ensure that we can.

One way of doing that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is to ensure that the developed world pays for peacekeeping directly or, as in the case of Darfur, through the African Union. However, anyone who saw Hilary Andersson&#039;s &quot;Panorama&quot; report on Monday will understand the dilemmas of a force that is too small trying to deal with an enormous problem. We must address that issue urgently.

<p>
<a name="41116h03_para34"><a name="stpa_204">That brings me to an issue that I want to develop a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little. As secretary of the all-party HIPC group, I&nbsp;recognise that we need a multi-faceted attack. We need the trade justice movement, and many countries, including our own, to increase the aid that they provide.

That is the means that we must all use to make our contribution.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para35"><a name="stpa_205">However, we are talking specifically about the debt part of the campaign, and, as the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire mentioned, the 150 or so NGOs that have come together under the Make Poverty History

in 2005 banner recognise that that is only one part of it. Nevertheless, it is crucial, because the matter has become very technical.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para36"><a name="stpa_206">I recall from 2000 that the campaign set itself a very tight deadline&#151;it was going to disband after 2000. Jubilee 2000 did its campaign work and disbanded, and there was a general sense that we had achieved a great deal. The headlines were good. The $100 billion of debt relief had been announced and it felt as if individually we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had made an enormous contribution. However, part&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the problem is that although the campaign did&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not disappear, because the same people are still&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;campaigning, the mass movement disappeared, thinking that we had achieved a great deal.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para37"><a name="stpa_207">The reality is that for many countries the HIPC initiative has not meant a great deal because of its complexities. Of the $100 billion that is always talked about, I think that only $29 billion has so far been delivered, because of the complexity of getting to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decision point and the completion point. Some $24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion is still to be achieved, which I think will probably happen in the short to medium term, but in the long term we are still left well short of the $100 billion that was offered.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para38"><a name="stpa_208">I must congratulate this Government, as I am sure most hon. Members will, as we and Canada have taken a lead on the issue and the agenda. People such as those who were at Birmingham a few years ago should be referred to at this point. As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said, the G8 used to be a self-congratulatory club of the leading economies in which issues such as this were not even discussed. I hope and understand that, fortunately, it will now be top of the agenda for the duration of the presidency next year. The fact that the issue is up there, that there is a Commission for Africa and that other things are going on shows that we have made progress.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para39"><a name="stpa_209">The reality is that the vast majority of the complexity and the difficulties are caused at World Bank and IMF level. Most bilateral debts with the G7 and G8 countries have been written off, but this is a question of trying to get into the complexity of how the World Bank and IMF operate. It is at that level that we need to work more closely together to ensure that the multilateral debts are written off.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para40"><a name="stpa_210">I am sure that most hon. Members who are present will have visited many countries that have benefited. If&nbsp;not, I am sure that they have seen other programmes. I know from my brief experience in Ethiopia last year that the sustainability is not that wonderful, even when the country has reached decision point. The collapse of coffee and other prices last year and the year before had an enormous impact on local economies. Even though Ethiopia was one of those countries at the forefront of its debt relief, the benefit felt by its ordinary citizens was fairly minimal because of the collapse of coffee prices. That is why, on its own, debt relief is not enough; it must be tied in with the Trade Justice Movement and aid. What we saw in Ethiopia was a clear example of that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para41"><a name="stpa_211">I visited a fair trade coffee grower and the difference in the amount of money that that individual farmer received compared with that received by one who was selling coffee and goods direct to the market was enormous; they were probably receiving about three or four times more. Sometimes we pay exactly the same price, but 10p or 15p 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

more gives an enormous benefit to an individual farmer. That shows that even if we cannot change the world overnight, at least we can make the world better, one cup of coffee at a time. I often say that to people when they feel daunted by the prospects of trying to deal with the HIPC initiative.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para42"><a name="stpa_212">We have good organisations in Loughborough&#151;Christian Aid and others&#151;that work closely together in the constituency. They often have lunches, for example. Sometimes it is difficult to get over the complexity of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decision-making process, but it is possible for individuals to start to make a small difference, one cup of coffee at a time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para43"><a name="stpa_213">A number of organisations have been lobbying quite heavily on the issue, such as Oxfam and others. They produced a paper in October entitled &quot;Fools gold&quot;, which puts the case for 100 per cent. multilateral debt cancellation for the poorest countries. I will briefly raise a number of points from it in the hope that the Minister will respond to them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para44"><a name="stpa_214">As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire will know, there has always been debate on which countries should and should not fit the HIPC definition. We often&nbsp;talk about the 42 countries, but, using different definitions, some feel that there should be slightly fewer and others that there should be slightly more. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the other low-income countries that would need additional resources through debt relief and aid to reach their millennium development goals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para45"><a name="stpa_215">The other point is that debt relief should not be financed through the existing aid budgets. I seek an assurance from the Minister that that is so in the case of the UK and also through the IMF. Debt relief should not be confined to the HIPCs; it should be extended to other countries, where possible.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para46"><a name="stpa_216">As my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) said, it is difficult to get to the decision and completion points in countries where there is conflict, but I hope that we can find other ways to ensure that debt relief, or its equivalent, gets through to the most vulnerable people. Things are particularly bad in war-torn countries or where there is conflict, so we need to find ways of ensuring that it gets through in those places. I&nbsp;am not sure that we have a complete answer on that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para47"><a name="stpa_217">Oxfam also suggests that we need to move things forward in countries with the greatest human development needs. That term also relates to places that suffer from conflict and deprivation.

<p>
<a name="41116h03_para48"><a name="stpa_218">Finally, there must be a fair, transparent and comprehensive international insolvency process. This is an interesting idea. Some proposals that get floated have little support at the beginning, such as the Chancellor&#039;s international finance facility. Support for that, however, is gaining momentum not only in this country&#151;I am glad to hear that the Liberal Democrats are supporting it, and I believe that the official Opposition do, too&#151;but internationally, as 40 or 42 countries have already signed up in principle.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para49"><a name="stpa_219">I asked a question about that recently. I want to know how far those countries have gone towards promising to reach the $100 billion a year that is needed. I also want to

know what time scale we are working towards in getting the IFF up and running. There are already some pilot projects, but at what stage do we say that we have completely achieved our aim and which countries have promised real money rather than letters of intent and good wishes?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para50"><a name="stpa_220">So far, the picture has been mixed. There was a strong sense of purpose among those involved in the non-governmental organisations, the Church groups and civil society who put this matter at the heart of the agenda in 2000. We also congratulate the Government on what they have achieved with international partners to take things forward, but the devil is in the detail with HIPC. Things have not worked as well as they should have because of complexities and difficulties and because of the restrictions that the IMF and the World Bank have put on some programmes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para51"><a name="stpa_221">Uganda is often cited as the best example of debt relief working well. I spoke about this to the Ugandan high commissioner only a couple of weeks ago: where debt relief is directly related to Uganda&#039;s primary school building programme, it is possible to see in human terms what debt relief is all about. It is a great joy to see that, instead of the piles of documents, which each of us has seen, on the complexities of the HIPC arrangements.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para52"><a name="stpa_222">I know that this is a complicated world, but let us try to look at these matters from the point of view of the person receiving the benefit upwards, rather than downwards from the perspective of the bankers, the IMF and the World Bank. We should simplify the process and get aid through by sustainable debt relief in the long term. We should use the momentum that we have to ensure that we make progress on this matter, so that we do not return to it in 20 years and say, &quot;More could be done.&quot; I will not be around then, and I am sure Sir Bob Geldof hopes that he will not have to make another Band Aid record.

<a name="41116h03_para53"><a name="stpa_223">I welcome the Minister&#039;s presence, and I also want to thank another member of the Government for his interest in and commitment to resolving the global debt crisis. I refer to the Chancellor, who has given support to innovative thinking on how to build the political will for large-scale debt forgiveness in the form of the international finance facility. That represents the most sustained engagement of a national Finance Minister globally. That must be welcomed.

<p>
<a name="41116h03_para54"><a name="stpa_224">As my hon. Friend said, the Liberal Democrats support the Government&#039;s efforts on the IFF, among&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other things. We welcome the Chancellor&#039;s announcement&#151;technically it is a re-announcement&#151;that the UK will commit up to &#163;100 million a year to write off its share of the debt owed to the World Bank by up to 30 of the world&#039;s poorest countries.

<p>
<a name="41116h03_para55"><a name="stpa_225">The IFF comes with a health warning, to which I referred in Department for International Development questions last week. I understand that France and possibly Canada are supporters of the initiative, along with a number of other countries that might expect to benefit from the IFF. Unfortunately, as far as I am aware, the world&#039;s main player, the United States, remains opposed. I hope that the Prime Minister had an&nbsp;opportunity to raise the issue during his recent meeting with President Bush, and to encourage the US to express greater support for the initiative. Without the commitment of the US, the IFF will find it difficult to raise the significant additional sums that will be required to ensure that the millennium development goals are met.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para56"><a name="stpa_226">We welcome the momentum that was built up at the October meeting of the IMF, the World Bank and the G7 Finance Ministers in Washington. At the end of that meeting, the Chancellor spoke of a growing consensus around 100 per cent. debt reduction. However, we need to monitor closely the development of that consensus. For example, in the weeks before the meetings to which the Chancellor was referring, the US Government floated for the first time a proposal to cancel 100 per cent. of the debts for up to 42 countries in the HIPC initiative. However, the US proposal envisaged a reduction in aid budgets in order to fund debt cancellation, so it did not include any new resources for poor countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para57"><a name="stpa_227">I am sure that that way of financing debt reduction would not be acceptable to the UK Government. Again, there may have been an opportunity for the Prime Minister to raise the issues with the President, and I&nbsp;hope that the Minister will tell us whether any such discussions took place. Debt cancellation cannot replace aid. In fact, the cancellation of debt must be combined with more and better financial assistance for development so that poor countries can secure a sustainable exit from debt.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para58"><a name="stpa_228">That is just one of the aspects of the debt cancellation agenda that needs to be monitored closely. The nature and shape of how we go about cancelling debt will be critical to our capacity to contribute to alleviating global inequality, so in addition to securing top-line political commitment, we need to ensure that that commitment translates into effective, sustainable and pro-poor policy and practice.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para59"><a name="stpa_229">A number of other features will be critical to effective debt cancellation. First, debt cancellation must be pursued by fair and transparent means. The task of calculating how much debt should be cancelled must no longer be left to creditors concerned mainly with minimising their own costs. Instead, we need a fair and transparent international process to ensure that human needs take priority over debt repayments. Of course, that will be less critical if the international community adopts a policy of 100 per cent. debt cancellation, but even then, we will need to agree the criteria according to which countries will be included in the scheme. The debt sustainability ratio that is currently used is not sufficient, as my hon. Friend pointed out.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para60"><a name="stpa_230">According to the World Bank and IMF, to which the G8 has effectively delegated the operation of the current HIPC initiative, a poor country&#039;s debts are sustainable provided that the ratio of the total debt relative to annual export earnings does not exceed 150 per cent. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 384WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
That is the target for which the bank and the fund aim&nbsp;when assessing how much multilateral debt can be&nbsp;written off, taking into account the bilateral debt cancellation promised by sovereign creditors such as the UK. It is clear, however, that even by that very narrow financial definition, at least 16 of the countries currently in the HIPC initiative will still have spiralling and unsustainable debt burdens after receiving all the relief currently available.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para61"><a name="stpa_231">Most importantly, if even the most basic development targets, such as the internationally agreed 2015 millennium development goals, are to be met, no debt repayments can be sustained, given that poor countries desperately lack the resources that they need to meet those goals. In fact, it would make more sense to link debt to the achievement of the millennium development goals than to the ratio currently used. Furthermore, it will make no sense at all and will not be fair to poor countries, if they are still required after having received all the assistance possible under HIPC to service debts to the rich world at the expense of vital expenditure on basic services such as health and education.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para62"><a name="stpa_232">The second of the two issues associated with debt cancellation that needs to be monitored is conditionality. International institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank must stop asking poor countries to jump through hoops in order to qualify for debt relief. For instance, poor countries should no longer have to privatise basic services as a condition for getting the debt relief that they so desperately need. By&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreeing to cancel their share of multilateral debt and taking a lead on the issue generally, the UK Government have played an important part in breaking the logjam that has prevented international progress on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debt cancellation. The next step is to sustain that commitment and for the UK to convince its global peers to follow suit and ensure that the way in which debt is cancelled is the most effective in tackling poverty and delivering on the millennium development goals. It is a commitment to meeting the goals that should be driving us.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para63"><a name="stpa_233">As we all know, in 2000, the international community committed itself to meeting eight goals by 2015. They ranged from halving extreme poverty and hunger to securing universal primary education and from reducing gender disparities to reversing the spread of AIDS. These are eight crucial goals that provide the framework for our efforts to cancel debt and increase aid, and around which we desperately need to generate an increased sense of urgency and importance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para64"><a name="stpa_234">We should be looking not to 2015, but to 2005, which is a crucial year for the fight against poverty&#151;a year of challenge and opportunity. In September next year, the international community will return to New York to review its progress in meeting the millennium development goals. I hope that the Minister will say how&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he expects the Commission for Africa&#039;s work to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feed into that process and what organisation at the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conference he expects to ensure that any recommendations made by the commission are followed through. At that meeting, we will clearly need to consider whether we are on target for 2015.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para65"><a name="stpa_235">However, 2005 is the first date of importance, because the gender equity target is due for that year. As I have mentioned in other debates, my visit to Ghana has led 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 385WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
me to think that there is no prospect whatever that it will meet the gender equity target. That is true not only of Ghana, as 60 per cent. of developing countries are unlikely to meet that target on present trends, and one has to doubt whether they will be in line to meet it by 2015. That is clearly a bad start, and it is shameful that there has not been a public uprising to respond and to tackle the issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para66"><a name="stpa_236">Primary enrolments are going up in developing countries, but more than 100 million children did not go&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to school this morning. Many hon. Members participated in the event on those matters a couple of months ago. Our education goals require 80 million more primary school places in Africa alone over the coming decade. At the current rate of progress, more than 70 countries will fail to achieve universal primary education by the target date. In sub-Saharan Africa, we will not achieve what we have committed ourselves to achieve by 2015 until 2129 at the earliest. That is a very long way off. At our current rate of progress, as I am sure the Minister knows, we will fail to meet the agreed targets for all the other goals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para67"><a name="stpa_237">Next year&#039;s conference to review the millennium development goals will occur in September, when the UK will preside over two of the world&#039;s most important multilateral forums&#151;the G8 and the European Union. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said, CAP reform must feature significantly in the UK&#039;s presidency of the EU, as that can deliver substantial improvements to quality of life and well-being in developing countries. Next year presents an exceptional series of opportunities for the UK to take the lead in facilitating international action to cancel poor country debt, and to revitalise commitment and action on meeting the MDGs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para68"><a name="stpa_238">Delivering on those goals does not require a wonder cure or a technological breakthrough; it requires political will. The Liberal Democrats believe that the MDGs can be met and that the UK can play a bigger and more effective part in working for a better world. The Government have demonstrated their commitment by advancing solutions to the global debt crisis, but as hon. Members have said, resolving the challenge of developing country debt, important as it is, will not in itself be enough.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para69"><a name="stpa_239">The Liberal Democrats believe that the Government need to use the unparalleled opportunity that they have been granted for international influence in 2005 to secure commitments to more and better development assistance and trade reform. We also have some ideas for UK-led international action, using the G8 and the EU, on HIV/AIDS, arms control, the environment and increasing corporate responsibility. We will return to those issues in the next couple of weeks.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para70"><a name="stpa_240">Decades of effort to tackle global inequality remind us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the interrelatedness of the challenges that the developing world faces. As a result, we need comprehensive approaches that address the problems from a range of angles. Cancelling developing country debt is a crucial part of that comprehensive plan. As a result, the Liberal Democrats will support the Government&#039;s stated efforts to cancel debt and will encourage other players in the international community to do so, too. We will monitor closely the progress and

outcomes of the Government&#039;s efforts. Finally, we will look for the same effort from the Government on the other challenges related to global poverty&#151;now, in 2005, and beyond.

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="41116h03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Alan Duncan  (Rutland and Melton)</b>  (Con): I&nbsp;thank the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) for initiating this debate. It is timely, because 2005 promises to be the year when the poor of the world find out whether the Prime Minister&#039;s bold words are matched by action. In April, the Commission for Africa will publish its report. In July, the UK will host the G8 summit in Scotland and begin its six-month presidency of the European Union. In September, a special UN summit will meet to review progress towards the 2015 millennium development goals. If we are serious about meeting those goals, then at Gleneagles next year Britain must take the lead in pressing for better aid, freer and fairer trade and faster and deeper debt relief.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para71"><a name="stpa_241">Britain possesses a unique ability to facilitate action through a number of international organisations. We are the only country that is a member of the G8, the EU, the Commonwealth and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as well as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a major player in the voting councils of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In the past, we have used that unique position to set the international agenda on development issues. Next year, we have the opportunity again to show global leadership in pressing for action on multilateral debt relief and for freer and fairer trade.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para72"><a name="stpa_242">As the hon. Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) said, July 2005 also marks the 20th anniversary of Live Aid. That astonishing event raised &#163;30 million for famine victims in Ethiopia and demonstrated yet again the remarkable generosity of the British people, but every year since 1985, Ethiopia has sent back to rich countries more than twice that amount in debt repayments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para73"><a name="stpa_243">Every year, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa&#151;the world&#039;s poorest region&#151;spend more than &#163;7 billion on debt repayments. Despite the progress that has been made, many countries are still spending more each year on debt service than on health care and education. Clearly, the current debt relief process needs radical reform. The G8 summit next year provides us with the opportunity to secure an international commitment to achieve that reform. As U2&#039;s Bono has said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;2005 is our chance to go down in history for what we did do, rather than what we didn&#039;t do.&quot;</p>

<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para74"><a name="stpa_244">Britain has an excellent record on debt relief. In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government, the Conservative party cancelled &#163;1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion of debt owed by the world&#039;s poorest countries. It was a Conservative Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, who initiated the first round of bilateral debt relief in 1988, and three years later, John Major led the international community in securing agreement for deeper and more comprehensive debt reduction.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para75"><a name="stpa_245">My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) was a great champion of debt relief long before it became a high-profile public issue. In 1996, he played a key role in establishing the heavily indebted poor countries initiative, which began the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 387WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
process of cancelling debt owed to multilateral institutions. Even the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;There is no doubt that the previous Conservative Government took a strong position on debt relief.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para76"><a name="stpa_246">We are grateful for her recognition of that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para77"><a name="stpa_247">We have continued that record in opposition. We backed Jubilee 2000, which successfully mobilised many&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organisations and individuals, including all the&nbsp;Churches of the United Kingdom, to campaign for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debt relief. Where Labour has built on the previous&nbsp;Conservative Government&#039;s strong record by continuing and, I am happy to say, intensifying debt cancellation, we have been and will remain supportive. We certainly welcome the Chancellor&#039;s decision to cancel the bilateral debts of the poorest countries, but there is still much to be done on debt owed to international institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para78"><a name="stpa_248">The enhanced HIPC initiative has made a good start in delivering multilateral debt relief. By and large, it has succeeded in ensuring that the money that is released is put to good use and does not line the pockets of corrupt dictators and arms dealers. Well managed debt relief has produced a number of success stories. Uganda used the money to double primary school enrolment and invest in a successful HIV/AIDS plan. Mozambique&#039;s debt relief has enabled its Government to immunise 500,000 children, and Benin eliminated school fees in rural areas, allowing thousands of children to attend classes for the first time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para79"><a name="stpa_249">The slow and cumbersome structures of the HIPC initiative do not, however, reflect the urgent need for faster, wider and deeper debt cancellation. Even after getting full relief under the scheme, many countries will still have difficulties in servicing their debts. In the face&nbsp;of a growing HIV/AIDS crisis, we cannot allow red&nbsp;tape and bureaucratic inertia to cost lives. Some much-needed reforms have been made. The two-year extension of the HIPC initiative announced at the 2004&nbsp;Sea Island summit will potentially allow a further 10 eligible countries to benefit from relief. Additional top-up relief will help countries that have been hit by deteriorating terms of trade.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para80"><a name="stpa_250">The debate will turn to whether we should go much&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further and match the 100 per cent. bilateral cancellation already pledged with 100 per cent. multilateral cancellation for the poorest countries. The plan that the Government announced two months ago proposes just such a radical widening of the HIPC initiative. The Government must champion that plan in the strongest of terms. We cannot afford to miss next year&#039;s golden opportunity to generate an international consensus in favour of extending multilateral relief for the poorest countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para81"><a name="stpa_251">Any relief on debts owed to the IMF should be funded, as the Government have suggested, by the sale or revaluation of IMF gold reserves. New funding commitments would be required to secure 100 per cent. cancellation in the case of debt owed to multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank and the African&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development Bank. We are pleased that the Government are pledging to pay our share of the debt service owed to those institutions on behalf of eligible countries. They must now also be forceful in securing similar commitments from the other G8 countries.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 388WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para82"><a name="stpa_252">At the same time as pressing for more relief, we must take the long view, and work towards achieving ongoing debt sustainability for poor countries. We must ensure that no country slips back into heavy indebtedness after receiving relief. We must also ensure that lending is more responsible than it has been in the past. Our Export Credits Guarantee Department has pledged to ensure that its credit is not misspent. Next year, we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must push other countries to make similar commitments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para83"><a name="stpa_253">Next year will be crucial for shaping the path of debt relief for years to come. We also know, however, that it will be only a first step towards achieving the millennium development goals. People of poor countries possess the energy and dynamism to create wealth and work themselves out of poverty, but that potential is stifled by western protectionism in too many cases. Countries that secure good governance, pursue sound macro-economic policies and respect property rights should not be penalised by the protectionist approach of the common agricultural policy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para84"><a name="stpa_254">It is perverse to give poor countries aid and grant them debt relief, but impose restrictions on their produce. Most HIPCs depend on single commodity exports such as gold, copper, cotton, coffee and tobacco. Falling agricultural commodity prices have damaged the ability of almost all HIPCs to earn foreign currency and repay their debt. Reform of international rules to promote free trade and open markets would allow them to increase their proportion of world trade and help them to repay their debts. As well as being good news for British consumers, better access to western markets could be worth tens of billions of pounds for some of the poorest countries. Reform of the CAP could save the British taxpayer up to &#163;3 billion each year. Next year, we should look beyond debt and the G8 meeting. Britain must use its EU presidency to push for a reduction in European tariff barriers, thorough reform of the CAP and a more efficient, poverty-focused European aid budget.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para85"><a name="stpa_255">In Iraq, we have recognised the principle that the victims of murderous dictators who rack up huge debts should not be made to pay for their oppressors&#039; follies. That principle should be extended to the countries of Africa. The sins and mistakes of the past should not be allowed to blight the future of an entire continent. Where stable civilian Governments have replaced military regimes, generous and carefully monitored debt relief should be forthcoming. Where people attempt to work and trade their way out of poverty, they should be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allowed fair access to our markets. While the Governments of other developed nations drag their feet, Britain must push firmly for action.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para86"><a name="stpa_256">The decisions on debt and trade that will be taken next year in the luxurious surroundings of the Gleneagles hotel will affect the lives of millions of the poorest people on the planet.

We know also that roughly 1 billion people do not have consistent access to clean water and do not have the resources either to afford essential medicines that we take for granted, or, as the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) said, to send their children to school. Furthermore, some 6 million people die from AIDS, TB and malaria every year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para88"><a name="stpa_258">Those statistics are appalling, but nothing helps one to understand the impact of those epidemics quite like seeing it on the ground. It was sobering for me to see the project supported by Christian Aid and the South African Council of Churches in the Dukathole township in Germiston, just outside Johannesburg, in which a small group of remarkable women supports orphans and people dying of AIDS and TB, as well as those&#151;often grandmothers&#151;who look after the orphans and make sure that they go to school. Those women do a remarkable job.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para89"><a name="stpa_259">We know that development assistance works. Kenya, for example, has taken the decision to abolish school fees. The UK has provided &#163;10 million to help to pay for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra school places and to provide proper accommodation for the extra 1 million children who now want to come to school to learn to read and write&#151;who want their opportunity to understand the world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para90"><a name="stpa_260">Another instance of development assistance working is the eradication of polio. The number of countries infected with polio has decreased from 125 to six. We are within sight of the fantastic achievement of the eradication of polio. Perhaps that will be achieved as early as the end of 2006, if we can continue not only the development assistance but the targeted effort to eliminate polio&#151;to get the polio vaccine to the most affected areas and continue to bear down on the epidemic.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para91"><a name="stpa_261">I saw for myself, on a visit to India, how the development assistance money for targeting polio is being spent. I pay tribute to the work of the Government of India, but also to Rotary International, which supports that work. I am sure that the House will be pleased to know that three children in a slum in east Delhi were inoculated against polio thanks to my efforts. I am not sure who was most terrified&#151;the children, who screamed all the time while I was trying to administer the inoculations; the supervisors, who were with me; or the mothers. On balance, it was probably the mothers. The work is making a huge difference and we are in sight of the eradication of polio.

Before we take on the presidency of those organisations, the Commission for Africa will report in the spring, while in September the UN millennium declaration review takes place.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para94"><a name="stpa_264">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister created the Commission for Africa, demonstrating his personal commitment to look for solutions to its problems. That commission is bringing together leaders from the developed and developing worlds&#151;Africa and other continents&#151;and from civil society, as well as business representatives and Church leaders. The task of the commission is to try to understand why more progress has not been made in Africa and what can be done to move things forward. The commission intends to bring forward a comprehensive plan for the international community to support African development. Its report will be published early in 2005 and will be presented to the G8 for discussion at the Gleneagles summit in early July.

At the current rate of progress some of those goals will not be met until 2165&#151;150 years too late.

However, only $50 billion is being provided at present. One of the things that the UK has already done to demonstrate leadership on the issue is to give the Department for International Development its largest ever increase in spend&#151;9 per cent. each year over the next three years. If we continue to make progress at that rate, we shall hit the UN&#039;s 0.7 per cent. target by 2013.
</p>






<p><a name="st_21"><a name="41116h03_spnew6"><b> Tom Brake </b> : The UK&#039;s contribution is clearly significant, but it is only a small percentage of the total budget. The Minister may be about to refer to this, but what feedback are we receiving from the Americans on the role that they might be willing to play?

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="41116h03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Thomas </b> : I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for leading me into my next remarks. We need to give credit where it is due and to recognise that the Americans have significantly increased their assistance, especially on AIDS. We must give credit to President Bush, in particular, for his lead in respect of increasing funding to the global fund and for other AIDS-related work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para98"><a name="stpa_268">The other specific point that I want to flag up in the context of the need for more aid, to which the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire alluded, is the international finance facility. It is the most developed idea for raising the additional finance necessary to meet the millennium development goals. He may know that the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation&#151;GAVI&#151;has approached the United Kingdom to explore whether the IFF&#039;s front-loading principles might be applied to GAVI to increase the resources available for child vaccination and immunisation. We are collaborating with the French and the Gates Foundation to take that initiative forward. We hope to launch that mini-IFF in the early part of next year and I hope that it will serve to provide additional political momentum for making the case for a global version of the IFF.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para99"><a name="stpa_269">The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr.&nbsp;Duncan) made particular reference to the need to&nbsp;make progress on trade. That is absolutely right, but one outcome that would show that the international community recognised the serious situation of Africa is securing a positive outcome at the World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December. It is true that, in the past 10 years, despite rapid growth in world trade, Africa&#039;s share of world trade has halved. We accept that more progress needs to be made on this issue. Studies have shown that, if we can achieve an ambitious outcome from the WTO talks, it will produce an annual global benefit of between $250&nbsp;billion and $600 billion, lifting huge numbers of people out of poverty.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para100"><a name="stpa_270">The framework agreement that was reached in August this year offers encouragement that a deal is possible next year. We shall use the opportunities of the G8 and the European Union presidency to make advances and build further political momentum to make the progress that we know is necessary.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para101"><a name="stpa_271">Next year we hope to focus on improving the effectiveness of the aid effort, which can be hampered when donors do not work together in developing countries. We will be focusing on better harmonisation and co-ordination of the international aid effort. A high-level forum in Paris next March will provide another important opportunity to advance the case for and the practice of development assistance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para102"><a name="stpa_272">As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has said, having the G8 presidency gives us the opportunity to renew the international commitment to making progress on two key issues: Africa and climate change. The G8 is required to report progress on Africa against the commitments in the Africa action plan in 2005. We will use that and the Commission for Africa report to identify gaps in international policy and push for future commitments, including actions to boost aid for Africa through debt relief and more resources elsewhere.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para103"><a name="stpa_273">We believe strongly that more needs to be done on debt&#151;I agree with the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire&#151;because we need to ensure that no

&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 392WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
country is hindered by the burden of unsustainable debt, which we know is already experienced by many countries, in respect of making progress towards the millennium development goals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para104"><a name="stpa_274">As a number of hon. Members have said, the Government have been at the forefront of promoting further progress on debt relief. We continue to press for the full financing and implementation of the HIPC initiative, which is delivering real benefits to some of the world&#039;s poorest countries. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton mentioned a number of them, but a further example is perhaps worth bearing in mind&#151;that of Ghana, which, because of the debt relief that it has secured, has been able to allocate more funding for health services, including exempting pregnant women from paying charges, and to generate more investment in schools, roads and water.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para105"><a name="stpa_275">Some $70 billion of debt relief is being provided under the HIPC initiative to some 27 countries, helping to increase social expenditures by some $4 billion since 1999. We want more progress on the HIPC initiative, and I am sure that hon. Members will be pleased to know that it is being extended for two years to allow a further 10 countries, potentially, to benefit from it.
</p>






<p><a name="st_23"><a name="41116h03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Williams </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes the case for extending debt relief, but surely that depends on the success of the IFF. Indeed, the hon. Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) asked how many countries have gone beyond signing up to the IFF by making the financial contributions required to achieve the outcomes.
</p>






<p><a name="st_24"><a name="41116h03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Thomas </b> : The two initiatives are separate but interconnected. We want more progress on debt relief and support for the IFF at the same time, so we continue to argue the case for the two to go hand in hand. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked how many countries have signed up to support the IFF. A considerable number have done so and I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman with the exact details of that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para106"><a name="stpa_276">We want to use the build-up to our presidencies of the G8 and the European Union to get additional countries from the G8, and other rich nations, to sign up to the IFF. That is why the GAVI pilot&#151;the so-called mini-IFF&#151;provides an opportunity to show how the IFF programme would work, operate on the ground and deliver the real, tangible benefits that all parties recognise it could deliver.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para107"><a name="stpa_277">We want to go further on debt relief and we need to ensure that progress is made on multilateral debt relief. The IMF already has the resources to go beyond HIPC and cancel, through better use of its gold reserves, 100&nbsp;per cent. of the debt owed to it by eligible low-income countries. We also want further debt relief from the World Bank and the African Development Bank. That will need to be funded through additional donor resources. We are committed to paying our share&#151;just over 10 per cent.&#151;of the multilateral debt service costs to those banks for those low-income countries that have strong public expenditure management systems in place.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para108"><a name="stpa_278">My hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr.&nbsp;Reed) asked how that additional relief will be funded. The comprehensive spending review, which 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 393WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
included a large increase in aid assistance for DFID, earmarked some of that funding for making progress on debt relief as well as for traditional development assistance. We also agree that debt relief needs to be extended beyond the existing heavily indebted poor countries. The new United Kingdom initiative to which hon. Members alluded will help to pay our share of multilateral debt servicing for all low-income countries with sufficiently strong public expenditure management systems in place. We can then be sure that those resources will be used for poverty reduction.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para109"><a name="stpa_279">My hon. Friend alluded to countries where there is conflict. He was right to say that they present the greatest challenge to making progress on the millennium development goals. We estimate that in countries where the policy environment is most challenging, there are more than 340 million poor people. We are seeking to bring donors together early next year to consider how to make more effective the development assistance that goes to those countries. Given the challenge of not always being able to work through Government assistance, perhaps because of corruption or conflict, we need to consider how we can be more effective in such policy environments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para110"><a name="stpa_280">My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) spoke of the need for more ceasefire monitors, particularly in Sudan. He will be interested to know that the UK has funded African Union ceasefire monitors there. We committed some &#163;2 million to that; we were the first donor to do so. I hope that my hon. Friend will be reassured to hear that an additional 3,000 ceasefire monitors are due to be deployed there shortly.
</p>






<p><a name="st_25"><a name="41116h03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Reed </b> : Clearly, the individuals in those countries that are in conflict, particularly Sudan, are in the worst situation&#151;because of the conflict, because of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 394WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
corruption or even because of an inability to get aid through to them. What further steps does the Minister believe the Government should take, particularly in Sudan? I have received a number of e-mails from constituents on the subject&#151;as must the Minister, in light of the &quot;Panorama&quot; programme&#151;so how much further does he believe the Government can go to bring not only lasting peace, but the protection necessary to allow aid to get through to those who are most severely affected?
</p>






<p><a name="st_26"><a name="41116h03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Thomas </b> : We continue to put pressure on the parties in Sudan for an immediate ceasefire in order to respect the needs of those who have been displaced. We have already provided some &#163;62.5 million of humanitarian relief, and the Prime Minister has committed us to doing more. We also seek to build the capacity of the African Union, so that it can better provide a response in places such as Sudan. Earlier this year, for the first time, it deployed troops under its banner in Burundi, helping to move things forward there.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h03_para111"><a name="stpa_281">I conclude by thanking the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire for this timely debate. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton challenged the Government to do more on international development, debt relief and the IFF. We accept the challenge. We have already shown leadership not only by launching the IFF, but by the substantial increase in assistance in the development budget and the lead that we have given in Europe on the need for more progress on trade. More needs to happen, and we on this side of the House continue to seek opportunities to build the political will and momentum to achieve just that.

<p><a name="st_28"><a name="41116h04_spnew0"><b> Ann Winterton  (Congleton)</b>  (Con): I am delighted to have secured this debate for two reasons: first, because I was prevented from taking part in the recent defence debates because of Standing Committee commitments, and, secondly, because this debate on the future of the infantry precedes tomorrow&#039;s debate on the Scottish regiments.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para0"><a name="stpa_282">I have no doubt that emotions will run high, with the Black Watch at present in the eye of the storm in Iraq. However, the Black Watch is part of the British Army&#151;it is not, as some have described it, part of a Scottish army&#151;and I am sure that the Black Watch itself recognises that what is good for its future is good for all the single battalion regiments threatened with disbandment, merger or forced absorption into larger regiments. We should not be pitting regiment against regiment in the fight for survival. It is also particularly fitting to be discussing these matters just after Remembrance Sunday, when we remember the sacrifice of all our forces who fell in defence of the United Kingdom and to preserve our freedom as a nation state.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para1"><a name="stpa_283">The Cheshire Regiment is the only infantry regiment that, in its long and distinguished history, has remained a discrete shire regiment, apart from the Green Howards, a local regiment that recruits from north Yorkshire and Teesside; I am glad to see my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) in his place. The Cheshires, together with many other regiments, took a terrible pounding during their recent tour of Iraq, just as they did in Bosnia. We should pay tribute to our British forces, which are the finest in the world. They are perhaps not always the best equipped, but they are certainly the best trained, and they are unique in having a regimental system, which ensures loyalty, stability and support, rather like a close-knit family.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para2"><a name="stpa_284">When the Minister announced the future Army establishment figure of about 102,000 on 21 July, he did so in the knowledge that trained strength stood at 104,130, and that the increased target figure had been achieved over the previous three years. The Army Board is therefore recommending a cut in numbers not from trained strength, and the reduction of four shire and local infantry regiments will just involve moving personnel around.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para3"><a name="stpa_285">To make the case that those redundant infantry personnel would move to other sectors of the Army&#151;in particular, to logistics, engineers, intelligence and signals&#151;is nonsense. The Army Board knows full well that infantry soldiers are a very different breed, and are not necessarily best suited to joining those corps. They do not have the appropriate qualifications, and neither are such moves actually necessary, because rapid improvement in recruitment to those corps in the past 18 months has nearly removed the shortfall&#151;and, in the case of the Royal Corps of Signals, has achieved a 2.5&nbsp;per cent. oversupply.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para4"><a name="stpa_286">A year ago, the Minister of State, Ministry of Defence, stated in response to a written parliamentary question that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;there are currently no plans to disband or amalgamate Army infantry battalions&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3 November 2003; Vol.&nbsp;412, c. 433W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 396WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para5"><a name="stpa_287">In March this year, the Army Board met the colonels for the first time. What happened in those four months to reverse the decision not to disband any single battalion regiment? We are told that the reason was the reduction of battalions in Northern Ireland and the ending of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arms plot. The future Army structure has its advantages, but the Army Board is being over-optimistic if it thinks that the present level of overstretch can be overcome and that normality can be brought back to intervals between roles as a result of what it is recommending.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para6"><a name="stpa_288">Training, which is essential and keeps British troops at their very best, still has to be done after operational tours. It is a fact borne out by experience that when regiments have been amalgamated in the past, recruitment has deteriorated. On recruitment, I am awaiting a reply on whether any capping or restriction has taken place. Will the Secretary of State confirm whether the future Army structure relates to or is based on the proposed future rapid effect system formation?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para7"><a name="stpa_289">The recent solution was to use the Territorial Army, from which personnel are disappearing fast; the TA is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now some 12 per cent. under establishment. The Army Board does not appear to appreciate that the TA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comprises, first and foremost, civilian volunteers. Neither they nor their employers will be a position to accept six-month tours of duty stretching to nine months. To state, as the Secretary of State did in a letter to me, that the TA knows what it has signed up to is arrogant. Those who say that TA members get paid should remember that their pay is about 40 per cent. of what a retained fireman receives.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para8"><a name="stpa_290">Why do the cuts proposed by the Army Board fall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entirely on four shire and local regiments? It is inconceivable that the executive committee of the Army Board has advised that three regiments should go out of two divisions. We know the pressure that the Army is under, yet the Army Board has deliberately pitted the Prince of Wales and King&#039;s Divisions against each other as to which will sustain the second cut. It is nothing less than a disgrace that senior command has put those in the front line under such extra pressure.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para9"><a name="stpa_291">The Prince of Wales and King&#039;s Divisions also have 58 per cent. fewer Commonwealth personnel than the Queen&#039;s and Light Divisions. That is one of the criteria listed after recruiting levels. Why, therefore, are reductions not being proposed for the Queen&#039;s and Light Divisions, the Parachute Regiment, which has not been used in a paratroop role since the Suez crisis, or the Guards Division?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para10"><a name="stpa_292">The shire and local regiments are ideal for peacekeeping and reconstruction work. Today&#039;s infantry has to switch rapidly from being an effective fighting force to becoming a policing and social force. The Americans in particular are finding out to their cost that they need such troops, and not just death-or-glory boys or those sitting 20 miles behind a supposed conventional front line surrounded by technology. The whole nation knows that the fight against terrorism and tyranny rests with the infantry, which is 24 per cent. of the trained strength of the Army.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para11"><a name="stpa_293">The Prime Minister has pledged 12,500 troops to the European defence force, and 35 per cent. of them&#151;the equivalent of seven battalions&#151;are to be infantry troops. On the one hand, the Army Board recommends 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 397WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
a cut in a certain sector of the infantry, while on the other, the Prime Minister guarantees a higher-than-ever commitment for that sector. The argument will be that the commitment rests on a case-by-case basis, but can one really see the Prime Minister saying to the European Union, &quot;Sorry chaps, I cannot fulfil my obligations to you&quot;? We can bet that the EU will find some beneficial crisis to bring about EU involvement and that those troops will be called up. Next month, under Operation Althea, the Grenadier Guards will be deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of an EU force.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para12"><a name="stpa_294">The Ministry has made it very clear that those regimental cuts are not down to finance, so perhaps we had better look elsewhere. That is surprising when we see that General Sir Michael Jackson is quoted in today&#039;s paper as saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;I would much prefer increasing the size of the Army but that&#039;s simply not on offer. I can either accept what&#039;s on offer&#151;a reduced size of the Army&#151;or go&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para13"><a name="stpa_295">I have tabled three parliamentary questions on finance, but have not yet received a straight answer. Perhaps that is not surprising in the circumstances. General Jackson also said in an interview with <i>Soldier</i> magazine that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;the intent of the wider defence changes announced last month was to move towards the ability to dominate enemies by the so-called network enabling capabilities.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para14"><a name="stpa_296">That is why four shire and local regiments are to go: manpower is to be replaced by technology that is not even yet available.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para15"><a name="stpa_297">I say to the Secretary of State that there should be no cuts to those regiments until the technology is up, running and of proven capability. If General Jackson thinks that the future rapid effect system will be operational by 2010, I believe that he is much mistaken, as do many others. The recent House of Commons research paper on the defence White Paper &quot;Future Capabilities&quot; clearly points out the disaster areas: the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eurofighter, which was late and over budget; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astute Class submarine; the Nimrod MR4A; and the Brimstone advanced air-launched anti-armour weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither should we overlook the Bowman communications system. What a gamble is being taken by throwing caution to the winds and thinking that technology will be delivered on time and on budget, while getting rid of what we know works.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para16"><a name="stpa_298">Our forces are not conscripts; they are professional soldiers doing a brilliant job, often under terrible pressure. The Army Board, if the Secretary of State would like to listen, should take better care not to push them over the limit. This affects people&#039;s lives and is a very serious matter. However, one can see why General Jackson wants to strengthen the medium section of the Army to comply with the introduction of a rapid reaction force, which means airlift. He is planning a futuristic Army for 20 years down the line, but surely we must learn the lessons of Iraq and Falluja, where technology has played its part, but where street fighting in urban warfare is done by low-tech tanks and infantry. We are no longer fighting conventional wars. The enemy is all around us, dressed in civilian clothes. High technology can of course work in the right situation, but a boy herding goats who has a $20 grenade launcher can take out a multi-million pound piece of high-tech equipment without much difficulty.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 398WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para17"><a name="stpa_299">The final decision rests with the Secretary of State, and the future of the British infantry rides on his shoulders. It is his head and that of the Government as a whole that will be on the block, and not that of the Army Board. We all know that we live in dangerous times and that British security is under continuing threat. The Government should act responsibly and show caution. In no circumstances should they introduce cuts to existing units until the war on terrorism has been won.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para18"><a name="stpa_300">The answer is not to destroy the culture, values, tradition and loyalty of the smaller regiments. Experience has already taught us that larger regiments do not retain the same levels of recruitment. I look forward to meeting the Secretary of State later this afternoon with other colleagues from Cheshire. We will seek to impress on him our conviction that what works and works well should not be destroyed, and that it can never be replaced by unproven future technology.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para19"><a name="stpa_301">I trust that common sense will prevail in the end and that the British infantry will not be emasculated in the way that is proposed.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="41116h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. John Greenway  (Ryedale)</b>  (Con): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton) on securing this debate, and I thank her for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allowing me a few moments to raise the concerns of several Yorkshire Members, including the hon. Member for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty), about the future of our three Yorkshire regiments&#151;the Duke of Wellington&#039;s, the Prince of Wales and the Green Howards, which is one of the oldest regiments in Britain and the one thought to be most at risk in Yorkshire. The Green Howards have recently returned from Afghanistan and served with such distinction that one of their number, Captain Pledger, received a very rare commendation from the commander of the multinational brigade.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para20"><a name="stpa_302">If we are to win the hearts and minds of the local population in Afghanistan and defeat terrorism, that is exactly the kind of peacekeeping work that is so sorely needed, and it is what makes the British Army the envy of the world. The support of the local community is what helps to make the difference. In our service of remembrance at Old Malton priory on Sunday, the standard of the Green Howards Association stood proudly, as it has done for generations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para21"><a name="stpa_303">The Army proposed to cut four single battalion regiments. Thus far, I understand that the Army Board has identified a regiment each from the Prince of Wales Division, the King&#039;s Division and the Scottish Division, but is having difficulty identifying the fourth regiment. The outcry from Scotland, which will be debated here tomorrow, is obviously aimed at preventing any cut in Scotland, yet if the cuts were shared fairly, there would be two cuts in Scotland and only two in England. It would be completely unacceptable for all the cuts to fall on the English divisions. The Scottish regiments do not have a monopoly on regimental history, traditions and local ties, and the manning criteria set by the Army indicate that Scotland would be very fortunate to escape with one cut if the cuts go ahead.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para22"><a name="stpa_304">The King&#039;s Division of northern England regiments has already agreed to accept one cut, as the Secretary of State knows, which is likely to fall west of the Pennines. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 399WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
A second cut against the King&#039;s Division would be grossly disproportionate and very wasteful of highly trained infantrymen, and it would lead to under-manning and redundancies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para23"><a name="stpa_305">The Yorkshire regiments are being very positive and constructive in looking to the future by campaigning for a Yorkshire regiment of three battalions and one Territorial Army battalion. I suggest to the Secretary of State that that could be a real success story. This is a highly dangerous time to be cutting infantry battalions at all. The Northern Ireland peace dividend and the ending of arms plotting will not free up as many battalions as was first thought, given present and future operational commitments to which my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton referred.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para24"><a name="stpa_306">If there are to be cuts, the Army Board should stick with the three cuts that it has identified and forget about the fourth.

<p><a name="st_32"><a name="41116h04_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon) </b> : I thank the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winterton) for introducing this debate on the future of the infantry. I look forward to explaining once&nbsp;again why we are doing what we are doing and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;welcome this opportunity to address some concerns that have been raised about the future size and structure of the Army.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para25"><a name="stpa_307">The reasons behind the need to modernise the Army have been well rehearsed previously. Hon. Members will be familiar with our analysis of the changing strategic environment and the new challenges that it represents. We set those out in our December 2003 White Paper and our July 2004 announcement. It is clear both that no organisation can stand still and that the Army is no different. It must evolve and adapt to future challenges as our world changes. Only by doing so will the Army maintain its ability to tackle whatever task it is faced with and continue to achieve the operational success that is the hallmark of Britain&#039;s armed forces.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para26"><a name="stpa_308">The changes planned for the infantry are part of that evolution. There are two key factors driving our plans. The first is the conclusion by the Army Board that the infantry arms plot no longer represents the best way to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deliver operational capability. The decision to end the arms plot demanded restructuring the infantry to sustain the strength of the regimental system. The second factor is the progress towards lasting peace in Northern Ireland and the consequent flexibility to reassign units committed to supporting the Police Service of Northern Ireland, allowing a reduction in the number of infantry battalions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para27"><a name="stpa_309">That change provided the opportunity to transfer resources to strengthen other parts of the Army and concentrate on those capabilities that can best deliver the effect that we require. The decrease in the support needed by the PSNI led us to conclude that the future requirement for infantry battalions would decrease from 40 to 36. Given that making those reductions 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 400WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
would free up some 2,500 posts, this offered an opportunity to reinvest the posts to deliver the robust and resilient organisation that we need to meet the challenges of the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para28"><a name="stpa_310">Let me make it clear that the driver behind the exercise is not financial. In the last spending review, the Government announced an extra &#163;3.7 billion for defence. The exercise reflects the need to ensure that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Army of the future is properly configured to meet the priorities and challenges of the future, rather than of the past. Some 550 of the posts freed up will be reinvested in the remaining infantry battalions to develop more robust and resilient units. The rest will go towards strengthening high-demand trades that are crucial to a sustainable expeditionary capability, such as intelligence, signallers, engineers, logistics&#151;in other words, those areas under still greater pressure as highlighted by our recent operational experience.
</p>






<p><a name="st_33"><a name="41116h04_spnew2"><b> Patrick Mercer  (Newark)</b>  (Con): The Secretary of State will be aware that I commanded his, mine and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others&#039; local regiment, the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters, when we were a Warrior battalion in Tidworth. We were there for nearly six years, which, at the time, was an unusually long tour. We pretty well negated the effects of the arms plot. My battalion was reinforced by the Cheshire Regiment, the Staffordshire Regiment and regiments across the Prince of Wales Division. I am told that it worked well. We were not a super-regiment; we kept our identity. If it ain&#039;t broke, why fix it?
</p>






<p><a name="st_34"><a name="41116h04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hoon </b> : Because it is not working as we would like. The problem with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s illustration is that trickle posting certain positions in that way puts extra pressure on the battalions from which those people have come. We have experienced that cascading difficulty for some time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para29"><a name="stpa_311">Furthermore, the proposed reform is simply the continuation of changes that have been brought forward by previous Army Boards and Governments. Half the Army was organised on one basis while the other half was organised on an entirely different basis. In a sense, that is unfinished business for the Army and it really is time that it was completed.
</p>






<p><a name="st_35"><a name="41116h04_spnew4"><b> Ann Winterton </b> : The Secretary of State has made a fairly lame excuse. The Government have been in power for seven years and they can do more or less what they like. Frankly, the situation in the world has changed during those seven years and we are now having to deal with terrorism. As I am intervening, will he also confirm whether the future Army structure will be based on the future rapid effect system?
</p>






<p><a name="st_36"><a name="41116h04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon </b> : I shall deal with that matter in due course. I gave way to the hon. Lady on the basis that she was about to address the point I was making. My argument is clear: we cannot continue indefinitely with two different structures for our Army&#151;different structures that previous Governments anticipated would change and failed to carry through. This is the Army finishing that business.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para30"><a name="stpa_312">I want to make progress. I challenge any hon. Member to say that, given the reduction in the commitment to Northern Ireland&#151;which is real&#151;we 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 401WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
should simply put those four saved infantry battalions into the regular order of battle inadequately supported by the enabling trades, rather than look at where the pressures are in the Army today. If Opposition Members really had genuine concern about our armed forces, they would be saying, &quot;Secretary of State, you should be helping those parts of the Army that are most under pressure.&quot; I am not suggesting that infantry battalions are not under pressure, but they are not as much under pressure in the context of tour cycles, tour intervals and leave at home with families as precisely those whom we intend to augment. Unless and until Opposition Members can deal with that issue, all they are doing is making cheap points for the benefit of their local newspapers.
</p>






<p><a name="st_37"><a name="41116h04_spnew6"><b> Mr. Keith Simpson  (Mid-Norfolk)</b>  (Con): Until now, I thought that the Secretary of State had been reasonable. However, most informed members of the defence community have seen a credibility gap in that infantry battalions are being disbanded to free up posts for intelligence logisticians. As a result, members of the Black Watch, whoever they are, will be transferred to be logisticians or signallers. No one doubts the fact that there is a requirement for such people, but as General Jackson said in <i>The Sun</i> today, the problem is that he would like a larger Army. That is his premise.
</p>






<p><a name="st_38"><a name="41116h04_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoon </b> : I shall deal with that issue in due course.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para31"><a name="stpa_313">Bringing to an end the infantry arms plot will ensure that we have far more military capability from our resources. Again, I invite hon. Members to consider the issue carefully. If their complaint is that there is far too much pressure on infantry battalions, what we are doing will relieve that pressure significantly. I shall explain why: for several decades we have moved infantry battalions from role to role and place to place every few years. That action maintained broad experience and variety, but it also hampered the availability of infantry battalions. Times have changed and the Army Board has rightly taken the view that the diminution of our capability through the arms plot is impractical and inefficient.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para32"><a name="stpa_314">Some hon. Members will be familiar with the detail, but let me restate it. Of the 40 battalions in the order of battle, seven or eight are unavailable at any one time because they are moving or re-roling. I have heard no objections from Opposition Members to that. Let me give some recent examples. In March, the highlanders moved to Germany to begin their armoured infantry training, which meant that they were unavailable for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some seven months. In September 2003, the Scots Guards began its conversion and was similarly unavailable for six months. In terms of physical disruption, our local regiment, the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters, to which the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) kindly referred and which is serving in Afghanistan, where I visited it last week, will shortly move from Chester to Hounslow. Neither place is particularly near Worcestershire, Nottinghamshire or Derbyshire, where most of the men were recruited.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 402WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>






<p><a name="st_39"><a name="41116h04_spnew8"><b> Patrick Mercer </b> : I am again grateful to the Secretary of State for allowing me to intervene. None of us, particularly those who have suffered at the hands of the nonsense that is the arms plot in today&#039;s Army, would argue with him. However, the fact remains&#151;I think he is being a little disingenuous&#151;in respect of this being unfinished business. It is not half the infantry that has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been reorganised; it is a third. We went through this&nbsp;process in the 1960s and it failed. The Cheshires, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staffords, the Sherwood Foresters and the Worcestershire Regiment were to be grouped, believe it or not, as the Mercian brigade. The same tired idea is being resurrected. That organisation was known in the Army as &quot;the Mexicans&quot;. I promise him that it is not a good idea to reintroduce it&#151;if it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it.
</p>






<p><a name="st_40"><a name="41116h04_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hoon </b> : I had a long conversation with the commanding officer of the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters last week and I gently reminded him of what happened in 1970, when people from the Sherwood Foresters&#151;perhaps the hon. Gentleman was among them&#151;said that it would be impossible for people from Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Sherwood Foresters ever to work satisfactorily with the Worcestershires. Now, there is a campaign to preserve that merged identity. I find that slightly ironic in the circumstances.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para33"><a name="stpa_315">I want to stress to hon. Members another effect of frequent changes of location. They are massively disruptive to the family life of members of our armed forces. That is such an issue in terms of retention that we have to address it. Because of changes in society, family stability has become much more of an issue. Ending the arms plot will mean that the Army is able to offer much greater stability for soldiers and their families.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para34"><a name="stpa_316">Those significant benefits are powerful arguments for change and they explain why those serving in the Army overwhelmingly welcome our proposals. I recognise that there is a concern about our armed forces on the other side of the House and among all hon. Members who have contributed to the debate. However, that concern must not simply be historic, relating to regimental names and titles. Those who genuinely believe that the arms plot must come to an end have also to follow through the logic of how to achieve that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para35"><a name="stpa_317">The hon. Member for Newark has made one suggestion, and I will reflect on it. However, the reality is that the Army believes that the best way to deal with an end to the arms plot is restructuring of the kind that has been outlined. Therefore it is important&#151;
</p>






<p><a name="st_41"><a name="41116h04_spnew10"><b> Patrick Mercer </b> : What about the Guards?
</p>






<p><a name="st_42"><a name="41116h04_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hoon </b> : We can deal with the Guards in due course, as part of the process. I do not suggest that the logic does not apply equally in that case. In future, battalions will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be fixed by role and largely by location. That will release resources routinely tied up in moving location or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retraining so that they can, instead, be used on operations. As a result, the Army will be more capable and more effective because&#151;to answer one of specific points raised by the hon. Member for Newark&#151;more battalions will be available for operations and because the new structure will provide continuity of expertise in role and greater brigade coherence, which is dissipated by the arms plot.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 403WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para36"><a name="stpa_318">That increase in available battalions is over and above the increases resulting from the reduced commitment to Northern Ireland. We will be better off in terms of operational availability. It will be possible for the career development of officers and senior non-commissioned officers to be much more carefully planned. At the moment, it depends partly on what role a battalion has at any given time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para37"><a name="stpa_319">To make that work, however, individuals will need to move between battalions for career development and increased breadth of experience. In the interests of preserving the regimental system and the value that it brings, we need a future infantry structure based on larger regiments of two or more battalions. I emphasise that that is not a new concept. Nearly half the infantry is already organised in that way and it operates extremely effectively. Multi-battalion regiments will allow individuals to move around for personal development while a sense of regimental identity is also maintained. That way, it will be possible to deliver the advantages of ending the arms plot in terms of operational effectiveness and family stability while preserving the benefits and traditions of our regimental system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para38"><a name="stpa_320">All the divisions of infantry have been tasked to consider how they can best model themselves to take full advantage of ending the arms plot, taking account of the need to reduce by four battalions in total. Their recommendations will be put to the executive committee of the Army Board. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made clear, no decisions have been made, and it is important that the Army is given the opportunity to determine the structure that will best deliver the operational effectiveness we need.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para39"><a name="stpa_321">In due course, the Army Board will make recommendations about the future organisation of the infantry. They will be presented to Ministers for final approval, and I expect to announce the outcome before the Christmas recess.
</p>






<p><a name="st_43"><a name="41116h04_spnew12"><b> Mr. Simpson </b> : I am grateful to the Secretary of State, who is being very generous in giving way. A few minutes

ago, in the context of the reorganisation of the Army, he gave the impression that the restructuring will affect the Household Division. Can he say in what way?
</p>






<p><a name="st_44"><a name="41116h04_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hoon </b> : It is important that there is consistency. Part of the argument that I made to the hon. Member for Newark is that we cannot go on with two different structures. Therefore, we need to look at the implications of this for all elements in the Army. No one will be immune; this applies equally well across the board.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para40"><a name="stpa_322">Given the emphasis that is placed on history, the point needs to be made that very few of our regiments or corps exist today in the same form as they existed in the relatively recent past. Since 1958, 54 infantry regiments have been subject to amalgamation, 21 of them since &quot;Options for Change&quot; was published in 1990. I have mentioned the amalgamation of the Worcestershire Regiment and the Sherwood Foresters. At the time, that was strongly resisted in the east midlands, but it has produced a strong regiment that works extremely effectively, notwithstanding the fact that there are still people in the east midlands who want to return to having a Sherwood Foresters Regiment. Such is the case in many parts of the country, but it is important that we deal with the reality of operations today and the threats we will face in the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h04_para41"><a name="stpa_323">There has been a constant process of change and regeneration in which new organisations have been created that have fostered previous military renown while developing their own traditions and reputations to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engender loyalty and camaraderie. Many of today&#039;s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excellent large infantry regiments are perfect illustrations of that process. I have no doubt that the new structure to be recommended for the infantry will not only seek to retain existing geographical linkages, but in due course enhance them. With soldiers and their families at last having a chance of greater stability, the result can only give even greater identity between regiments and their local communities. Given the support that regiments can depend on, that can only be good for all of us. It is important that Members think about the future.

<a name="time_19">
<a name="41116h05_time0"><h5>4.13 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_46"><a name="41116h05_spnew0"><b> Ian Lucas  (Wrexham)</b>  (Lab): It is a pleasure to speak before you this afternoon, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and to have my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary listening to me. I am also glad to have the opportunity to discuss the important issue of fiscal matters relating to renewable energy.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para0"><a name="stpa_324">The Government have made clear their strong commitment to reducing emissions from carbon fuels. They have made it equally clear that their chosen vehicle for encouraging the development of renewable energy is the renewables obligation. Earlier this year, they announced a review of that obligation, which we are approximately two years into, and set out their terms of reference for the review in a helpful fashion.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para1"><a name="stpa_325">I want to state at the outset that nothing that I say today is intended to challenge the future existence of the renewables obligation, and that the suggestions that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proffer humbly to my hon. Friend are made to encourage an adjustment within the obligation to bring about what I hope will be greater diversity in the means of providing renewable energy in the UK.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para2"><a name="stpa_326">The renewables obligation seeks to ensure that 10 per cent. of our electricity is produced from renewable sources by 2010. It is fair to say that progress is being made. According to the DTI&#039;s digest of UK energy statistics, during the year to 31 March 2004, 3.3 per cent. of UK energy was attributable to renewable sources. However, the target is a challenging one, and the issues are important.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para3"><a name="stpa_327">I attended a meeting in Wrexham with my constituents and Welsh Water, one of the local water companies, to discuss three 100-year record flooding events that had happened in the past five years. Pressing problems have been caused in local communities&#151;problems that accepted science now recognises to be attributable to global warming. Our task to extend renewable energy production is an important answer to the challenges posed by global warming.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para4"><a name="stpa_328">Progress in the UK is overwhelmingly in the sphere of wind power, both offshore and onshore. I welcome that development; I have always been a strong supporter of wind power. There is little doubt, however, that the development of wind as a source of renewable energy increasingly encounters opposition. The Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales has a particularly negative attitude to onshore wind power in particular. Even offshore wind power is causing a great deal of controversy, and there was recently particular difficulty with a proposed wind farm in south Wales. Wind is becoming an increasingly controversial renewable energy source, and the renewables obligation needs to be refined to allow other forms of renewable energy to prosper.
</p>






<p><a name="st_47"><a name="41116h05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): On wind and the possibility of using wind turbines, does my hon. Friend agree that it is important not only that we produce renewables through wind turbines, but that British industry succeeds in providing those turbines? Is he aware that DeWind in my constituency has now pulled out of the wind turbine market because it is unable to secure contracts in the UK and abroad? The 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 406WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
big players are squeezing some of the new companies out. Does he agree that the fiscal measures introduced by the Government need to assist British firms, make use of the growth in renewables and benefit local economies, such as my own in Loughborough?
</p>






<p><a name="st_48"><a name="41116h05_spnew2"><b> Ian Lucas </b> : I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. In fact, he touches on issues that I hope to return to later. It is important that we see the development of renewable energy as an important energy and manufacturing industry for the future. I hope that the company in his constituency will be part of that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para5"><a name="stpa_329">Diversity in renewable energy supply will help the wind industries to which I have referred. If there were slightly fewer applications for wind farms and more applications for the development of renewable energy in other fields, I suspect that the pressure imposed on wind farms, and the opposition to them, some of which is pretty cynical, would be lessened.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para6"><a name="stpa_330">To touch on the remarks that my hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) has just made, the renewable energy industry in the United Kingdom is waiting to happen. It is primed, and companies are willing to enter the renewable energy market. They are simply waiting for the right incentives and indications from the Government. At this stage, it would be helpful for me to make it clear that I was delighted that the Sharp Manufacturing Company of Japan opened its European manufacturing base for photovoltaic cells in Wrexham earlier this year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para7"><a name="stpa_331">Sharp has been in Wrexham for more than 20 years now, and in the past it has been involved in the production of microwave ovens and video recorders. Video recorders are now a passing industry, and it was essential that a new product be brought to Wrexham for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the plant to prosper. The decision to situate photovoltaic cell manufacturing in Wrexham is a testament to the excellent work force in the town, the superb relations with the local trade union, Amicus, and the excellent stewardship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his marvellous team at the Treasury, which includes my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. The decision cannot really have been taken because of the photovoltaic cell market in the UK, because, unfortunately, it is extremely small at the present time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para8"><a name="stpa_332">For Wrexham, the prime market for European PV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cells is Germany. Most of the units that are currently produced in Wrexham are exported there. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100,000 roofs programme in Germany has been a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phenomenal success. Capacity in photovoltaic electricity increased from 40 MW in 1997 to 400 MW by 2003. In 2003, there was 50 per cent. market growth in Germany. It is worth while to examine the instruments used by the Germans in achieving their success. The German Government concentrated on revenue rather than capital support, and I think that that is one of the major distinctions with regard to the approach that is being pursued in Britain. They specified a fixed long-term price for electricity produced from PV cells. The price was higher for photovoltaics than for some other renewable sources, but it brought certainty to the market for PV manufacturers. German Government advisers emphasised in conversations with me that it was the certainty that fuelled the successes of the programme. The necessary private investment was further encouraged by fixed interest, long-term loans for consumers.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 407WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para9"><a name="stpa_333">As I mentioned, the approach to support for photovoltaics in Britain has been quite different. The Government have supported the industry by the use of capital grants and initiatives ranging from the domestic solar PV systems field trial in May 2000 through to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;major photovoltaics demonstration programme. Unfortunately, the effect to date has been limited. As Keith Howarth points out in his useful article &quot;The poor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man of photovoltaics&quot; in the Autumn 2003 edition of <i>Building for a Future,</i> PV in the UK just seems to be too expensive, and it takes 70 years to recover present installation costs. That contrasts markedly with the situation in Germany, where revenue support, combined with cheaper installation costs, gives payback within 17 years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para10"><a name="stpa_334">How can we achieve greater diversity in our renewables supply? I have seen the terms of reference of the review of the renewables obligation, and I have noted that, despite the fact that the obligation is itself an instrument that interferes with the operation of the free market, there is a marked reluctance to interfere further with the renewables market. Both fixed price tariffs and feed-in mechanisms are rejected. I am pleased, however, that the Government have recognised in the terms of reference the importance of developing longer-term technologies and have left the door open on providing revenue support for them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para11"><a name="stpa_335">To date, I do not think that we in the UK have recognised the potential that exists for industry here in the renewables field. In north Wales, we are at the forefront of those developments. The North Hoyle wind project off the Rhyl coast is already producing energy, and phase two of the project will introduce a step change in the scale of production. St. Asaph business park has the largest single solar cell power source in the UK and Sharp in Wrexham is expanding rapidly. Last week, I was delighted that a call from the company for 60 extra employees by Christmas appeared on the front page of my local newspaper; its solar cell production is increasing so rapidly that it is taking on that number of jobs in the local economy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para12"><a name="stpa_336">At present, the demand comes from abroad. We have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much to learn from the German experience. Even with the current difficulties in the German economy, 3,000 people are employed in the German photovoltaic manufacturing industry. The potential in the UK is huge. The Deputy Prime Minister has announced his intention to build a large number of new homes in the south-east. For example, up to 170,000 homes are to be built in the Milton Keynes and south midlands area in the coming few years. In my constituency, there is increasing pressure for new housing in the public, housing association and private sectors.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para13"><a name="stpa_337">Let us imagine for a moment what would happen if PV cells became as standard as double glazing. First, a new form of renewable energy would have become a significant player in the UK. Secondly, householders could supply their own energy to the grid, easing problems of security of supply. Thirdly, a manufacturing industry with thousands of high-quality jobs could be&nbsp;created.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para14"><a name="stpa_338">In Wrexham, we have experienced just an indication of what can be achieved by new investment from abroad in a market that is developing. The company has decided to enter the European market and is expanding rapidly, in both Germany and Spain, because of the action that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 408WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
has been taken by the Governments in those areas. I&nbsp;urge the Treasury to consider the types of incentives that have been provided in those countries. There is a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirst for new manufacturing industry in my constituency, and I think that that could be responded to by developing the industry in question.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para15"><a name="stpa_339">I am sure that a way can be found, compatible with the renewables obligation, to encourage a more diverse renewables base in the UK. I know that the Renewable Power Association will forward its ideas when the review is considered. It is fortunate that a Treasury Minister is responding to the debate, because the Treasury will play an important role in decisions about the development of renewable energy in the years to come.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para16"><a name="stpa_340">The 2010 target is a very challenging one. All parties recognise that that is the case, and much work needs to be done in the coming five years. The prize could be to tackle our renewable energy problems, approach solutions to our climate change challenges and create a new manufacturing industry. That is a prize that is well worth striving for.

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="41116h05_spmin0"><b>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury  (John Healey) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) on securing the debate. I have known him since he was elected to the House, and he has always been articulate on the challenges of global warming, as his speech made clear. I have also seen how strong an advocate he is of the interests of his constituency and the companies there. I may return to the points that he made about the developments at Sharp PV.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para17"><a name="stpa_341">My hon. Friend made it clear that his principal concern is for a greater diversity of sources of renewable energy in the UK. He set out a clear and practical long-term vision of PV cells being as commonplace as double glazing. The context of the debate is important. The policy developments and reviews that he mentioned are taking place in the context of the energy White Paper that the Government published in February 2003. Underlying everything that we are doing and may consider doing are the four principal objectives that were set out in that White Paper.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para18"><a name="stpa_342">The four goals of our overarching energy policy are, first, to set ourselves on a path to cutting the UK&#039;s carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050; secondly, to maintain, at the same time, the reliability of our energy supplies; thirdly, to promote competitive markets in the UK and beyond&#151;which perhaps distinguishes us from Germany&#151;and thereby to help to raise the sustainable energy growth rate and improve the UK economy&#039;s productivity; and, fourthly, to ensure that every home is adequately and affordably heated.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para19"><a name="stpa_343">In general terms, the effective way for the UK to achieve those goals is to conserve our existing energy resources and use them better. My hon. Friend has argued persuasively for improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of alternative energy sources such as renewables; those have been identified as important ways of doing that. That is why the Government have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set targets for energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy.

<br>

<p>
<a name="41116h05_para20"><a name="stpa_344">The energy White Paper reiterated the aim that we set out first in January 2000 for renewables to supply 10 per cent. of UK electricity by 2010, subject, of course, to those costs proving acceptable to the consumer. Our aspiration is to double the renewables share of electricity by 2020 from that 2010 target. We have introduced a comprehensive set of measures to pursue those targets and secure those general energy policy aims.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para21"><a name="stpa_345">Although my hon. Friend&#039;s debate is about fiscal measures, they are only one part of the strategy. It seems from his speech that he is more interested in non-fiscal measures, particularly the renewables obligation. Fiscal measures that we have taken include the introduction of the climate change levy, with exemptions for renewable generation; the introduction of reduced rates of VAT, which benefit renewable sources such as ground-source heat pumps and micro-CHP systems; backing biofuels through the fiscal system; and the introduction of the world&#039;s first emissions-trading scheme.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para22"><a name="stpa_346">If we look beyond all the fiscal measures, however, we can see that we have also taken several steps to promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. Principal among those for renewables is the renewables obligation. However, I think that my hon. Friend is aware that, alongside that obligation, the Government are funding further research and development, as set out in the spending review published by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in July.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para23"><a name="stpa_347">The renewables obligation is the main non-fiscal instrument by which we are encouraging renewable energy. It requires all licensed electricity suppliers to supply a specific proportion of their electricity from certified renewable sources. As my hon. Friend knows, that obligation increases steadily from 3 per cent. of sales in 2002&#150;03 to 10.4 per cent. in 2010&#150;11. Late last&nbsp;year, that obligation was extended to 15.4 per cent. by 2015&#150;16 to give potential investors, whom he is concerned should be encouraged, greater certainty with which to plan returns in respect of business investments of the sort that we want to encourage them to make over the next few years. With the climate change exemption, those two mechanisms are expected to provide about &#163;1&nbsp;billion of support to renewable energy by 2010.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para24"><a name="stpa_348">Early indications are that the renewables obligation is working well, with investor confidence growing. In 2003, 2.2 per cent. of electricity was supplied by sources that are eligible under the renewables obligation. We expect that by 2010, wind source will provide 7 to 8 per cent. of electricity, half of which will be from onshore sources with the rest coming from large-scale hydro and landfill gases.
</p>






<p><a name="st_50"><a name="41116h05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Reed </b> : Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>






<p><a name="st_51"><a name="41116h05_spnew4"><b> John Healey </b> : I was about to come to a powerful point that my hon. Friend made in an intervention about his keenness for British business to win a share in the growing and increasingly important market in green technologies and green generation. I will ensure that my colleagues in the DTI are aware of his point, as I know that it forms part of their concerns.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para25"><a name="stpa_349">My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham is right to say that we will shortly begin a review of the renewables obligation. In the original White Paper, we committed 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 410WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
ourselves to reviewing it in 2005&#150;06 and to taking account of the carbon prices anticipated under the new EU emissions trading scheme, as well as the emerging costs of renewable technologies. The DTI, not the Treasury, is leading the review and aims to complete it by December 2005, with a view, potentially, to introducing any changes to the obligation around the beginning of April 2006.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para26"><a name="stpa_350">A central consideration of the review will be to ensure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the delivery of the 2010 target, while maximising value for money for consumers. My hon. Friend rightly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said that the terms of reference were published on 4 November, following the publication of draft terms of reference in the summer.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para27"><a name="stpa_351">From the 90-odd submissions that were received by the DTI when it published the draft terms of reference, it was clear that there was strong support for a limited review on how to improve the effectiveness of the renewables obligation while avoiding changes to the main operating principles of the scheme. The final terms of reference reflect that. The key areas for the review to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;examine are the effectiveness of the renewables obligation since it began in April 2002; all aspects of the working arrangements for the renewables obligation; the potential impact of the EU emissions trading scheme on carbon; the prices and future cost competitiveness of renewable technologies; and the extent of the obligation beyond 2015&#150;16&#151;the longer term that my hon. Friend is concerned about.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para28"><a name="stpa_352">I shall ensure that my hon. Friend&#039;s points are brought to the attention of DTI Ministers as part of the consultation. They and I look forward to receiving the submission from the Renewable Power Association, which he mentioned. I am sure that that will contribute to the consultation.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para29"><a name="stpa_353">It is clear that there is widespread support in the renewables industry for a technology-neutral renewables obligation that rewards low-cost technologies, coupled with wider support for the longer-term technologies. In&nbsp;the Chancellor&#039;s spending review settlement in July, he allocated to the DTI &#163;60 million in each year up to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2007&#150;08 to deliver projects identified under the renewables innovation review, bringing to over &#163;500&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million the support between 2002 and 2008 for longer-term renewable technologies.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para30"><a name="stpa_354">In addition, &#163;20 million has been allocated in each year of the spending review for 2004 onwards for future energy research and development. That will allow the DTI to fund fuel cells, cleaner fossil fuels, carbon dioxide capture and storage, and hydrogen research. The money has gone into the DTI technology strategy fund.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para31"><a name="stpa_355">Turning to solar and photovoltaics, in 2001 the Government made a commitment to embark on a major initiative with the industry and others to achieve a UK solar photovoltaic cell programme, in line with those of our major competitors. That was the start of the Government&#039;s provision of significant funding for photovoltaics. The initiative consists of three separate programmes&#151;domestic and large-scale field trials, to which &#163;10 million has been committed; a major photovoltaics demonstration programme, for which the commitment was increased in September to &#163;31 million; and support for PV research and development, through the DTI and the Engineering and Physical Sciences 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Research Council. The additional &#163;6 million that was added to the major PV demonstration programme in September will allow the DTI to run the programme for a further year, until March 2006. That will support the market until decisions on the future funding of PV are taken.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para32"><a name="stpa_356">In that context, my hon. Friend mentioned Sharp. I&nbsp;was aware that Sharp had been in Wrexham for at least two decades, but I was delighted to learn that it had, within the past year, chosen Wrexham as the base for its European PV manufacture. It is new to the UK market in that field, but not to the UK. As he said, it is likely to sell much of what it manufactures in the PV field to Germany rather than to the UK domestic market, which is still in its infancy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para33"><a name="stpa_357">On the major PV demonstration programme that I&nbsp;mentioned, Sharp is already involved. It is aware of that programme and my hon. Friend might like to know that it is involved both in stream 1&#151;the small scheme for householder applications in which, I think, 57 of the householders who successfully applied used Sharp to supply their installations&#151;and in the larger community building schemes of stream 2. Its contribution to that programme is second only to that of BP Solar.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para34"><a name="stpa_358">Although photovoltaics is unlikely to make a significant contribution to the target of 10 per cent. of our UK electricity being provided from renewable sources by 2010&#151;we may argue about the contribution that the technology might make towards our 2020 targets&#151;it is clear that its potential contribution to UK 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2004 : Column 412WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
electricity supplies in the long term will be significant. It also has the potential to make a significant contribution to our exports.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para35"><a name="stpa_359">The Government are considering the next steps for photovoltaics funding. In that respect, the debate is rather timely. The Government, and principally the DTI, are considering those questions in the context of the spending review settlement and the renewables innovation review. That review proposes a technology-blind capital grants programme, under which renewable features are integrated in the fabric of buildings alongside energy efficiency technologies. Support for building-integrated PV would be an important part of such a programme.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41116h05_para36"><a name="stpa_360">The Government first set out their climate change policies in 2000. The programme made provision for the review to commence in 2004. That review has now started. Since the publication of the first climate change programme, Government policy on tackling the climate change challenge has moved on substantially. The review of the climate change programme provides an opportunity to examine all our policy measures and to value the most cost-effective ways of meeting our climate change objectives. It will be an opportunity also to ensure that our domestic actions are in line with, and in many cases in advance of, what is being achieved internationally&#151;
