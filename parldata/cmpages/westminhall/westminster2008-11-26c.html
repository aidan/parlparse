 I am pleased that we are having this debate because the issue of temporary housing affects many of my constituents. Almost every time I hold an advice surgery and see people with housing problems, someone who lives in temporary accommodation will attend. The problem has been and still is huge, particularly in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para1"><a name="08112642000011">The housing statistics show that, by the end of 2006-07, 87,000 households were living in temporary accommodation. By March this year, that figure had fallen to 77,000, which is certainly an improvement. In some ways, we are in a much better situation than we were a few years ago, when many of the people concerned would have been in bed and breakfasts, rather than in flats or houses. We have virtually got rid of the use of bed and breakfasts—I think that about 5 per cent. of people in temporary accommodation now live in them.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing this important debate to the House. As we approach Christmas, homelessness and temporary accommodation is a serious matter, particularly for families with children. During the past 10 years, things have definitely improved and I congratulate the Government on their efforts in trying to deal with the problem, but there is still too much use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation, which is, in some ways, used by my council to threaten and cajole people. Bed-and-breakfast accommodation is often particularly unsuitable for people with young families because it is sometimes rat infested or damp. That type of accommodation must be stamped out completely.</p>

 I agree. The figure is down to 5 per cent., which is good, but I know that some local authorities still use bed-and-breakfast accommodation. My local authority does not and has not for some time, and I am pleased about that because it has made a positive difference.</p>

 I assume that the hon. Gentleman is talking about the number of people in temporary accommodation, not those in bed and breakfast. There is no doubt that there has been an increase. I understand why local authorities feel the need to use temporary accommodation and there is no question but that, in some cases, people in temporary accommodation—whether a house or a flat—live in far better conditions than  <br></br>

those in which people in similar situations lived some time ago. However, there is still a problem. The majority of people in temporary accommodation probably live in London and only a small proportion of those—less than 25 per cent.—stay in that temporary accommodation for under six months, while about 40 per cent. stay in temporary accommodation for two years or more.</p>

 As an occasional critic of my Government’s housing policy and their attitude to local authorities, I feel that it is important to start on a positive note. The target to halve the use of temporary accommodation by 2010 was set in 2004 and has been achieved in a number of regions, particularly my region of the east midlands. However, there is still an issue in relation to those in bed and breakfast and, indeed, hostel accommodation. The majority of people in hostel accommodation are ready to move into something permanent, if only it existed.</p>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="08112642000017"><a name="81126h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="08112642000547"><b>Mr. Gerrard:</b>
 I accept that point. Many local authorities are moving towards that target, but there are still serious problems in London and doubts about whether we can meet it. My hon. Friend made a point about hostels, but the figure of 87,000 households in temporary accommodation masks the true situation because it does not include the people whom local authorities do not accept as priority homeless and whom they do not take on. Those are generally young, single people, and they can end up in some of the worst situations and in hostels. I shall return to that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08112642000018">Clearly, we will not solve this problem without doing something about the supply side and increasing the supply of affordable rented housing through registered social landlords. I know that the Government are now making welcome moves in that direction and are considering what can be done to increase supply, but obviously that will not happen in the short term. I do not want to focus too much on the issue of new build, although that matter is obviously critical, but there is the question of the 50 per cent. target, how we can attain it and what we can do in the meantime to make conditions and costs more bearable for people who are in temporary accommodation and likely to be so for some time.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend aware that in London the 50 per cent. affordability target appears to have been virtually abandoned by the Mayor in favour of borough-wide negotiations? In any event, only a third of those properties would be available for rent; the rest would, in effect, be unaffordable for people with desperate housing need because the costs are simply too high.</p>

 I am aware of that, because it is an enormous problem for London. I am sure that it will be impossible for most London boroughs to solve their housing problems on their own. We need London-wide solutions, but we seem to be moving away from that. The consequences for people in temporary accommodation— particularly those who are in it for long periods—are fairly obvious.</p>

are not even moved within the borough that they come from; they are moved to another borough, miles away from family and friends. Just last week, I saw someone who has been put in temporary accommodation in Walthamstow by Hammersmith and Fulham council. That is not his first temporary place. Before that, he had been in temporary accommodation in Edmonton, although his family and friends live in Hammersmith and Fulham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08112642000022">Such movement creates problems in getting children into schools and moving them from one school to another. When people are constantly being moved from one place to another, there are also consequences for them when they try to find and keep work. Some pilot schemes have been run to try to deal with that issue. Waltham Forest was one of the boroughs that ran the working future pilot, which considered what could be done to help to get people in temporary accommodation into work. I would be interested to know whether the Minister has assessed how those pilots worked and whether we might be able to extend them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08112642000023">A further issue for many people who are put into temporary accommodation relates to the conditions in which they live. Again, I frequently see people who live in temporary accommodation and who have been put into the most appalling places. I sometimes wonder what checks are carried out before some of those properties are used. Last week, I saw a case in which someone had moved into a flat that had no hot water or heating, and within a week the bathroom ceiling had collapsed and there were rats in the property. Through public money—housing benefit—we are paying more than £300 a week to keep someone in such accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08112642000024">Another case I have recently seen involved someone who was put in temporary accommodation that, again, cost more than £300 a week. The place was a tip and was more or less unfit for human habitation. The person concerned, who was a pensioner, ended up moving out and sleeping on a camp-bed in her daughter’s kitchen because she simply could not bear to stay in that place any longer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08112642000025">One issue that I would like us to examine is what we can do to try to ensure that the condition of properties used for temporary accommodation is decent, because frequently it is not.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the issue of the condition of accommodation. I represent two communities: an island community, Canvey Island, and a mainland community, and the division is about 50:50. Islanders are islanders. Sometimes the local council will threaten islanders with bed-and-breakfast accommodation that is out of borough, totally unsuitable and in very poor condition if they do not accept a place that they are offered on the mainland, which is completely outwith their community, friends, schools and so on. People are threatened and cajoled. They are told that if they do not accept the place, they will have to go into a bed and breakfast. That is intolerable in this day and age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08112642000028">An issue that I have touched on and want to return to is costs, because the rents for many properties that people are put into temporarily are unaffordable. Again, I recently dealt with someone who was moved out of a council property, for very good reasons; it was not her fault. She had been paying £84 a week rent in the council flat, but she was put into temporary accommodation outside the borough and the rent was £360 a week. For her, that was completely unaffordable. She is working, but obviously the housing benefit is not sufficient to make up the gap and she is considering whether to give up work, because otherwise she will be unable to afford to stay in the place. Time and again, we are paying out very large amounts in housing benefit—public money—for very poor-quality accommodation.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Does he agree that the perversity of the financial situation is underlined by the fact that, often, more is being paid out to house people in awful conditions than it would have cost to build social housing of a decent standard for people to live in, and in some cases the properties in unsatisfactory condition are council properties that were sold off?</p>

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="08112642000030"><a name="81126h0001.htm_spnew12"><a name="08112642000553"><b>Mr. Gerrard:</b>
 I absolutely agree. We need to get to grips with the financing and how we are spending so much public money on temporary accommodation.</p>

 On that important point, research by the Supporting People programme shows that the cost of providing 50,000 bed spaces for single homeless people per year is about £250 million. That is £5,000 per bed space, which makes our right hon. Friend’s point even more vivid and undeniable.</p>

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="08112642000032"><a name="81126h0001.htm_spnew14"><a name="08112642000555"><b>Mr. Gerrard:</b>
 I take that point. There have been questions about what the subsidy levels should be for housing benefit where local authorities are leasing properties, and some reductions have been made. The London councils in particular are concerned that that might happen again and make it difficult for them to lease. One consequence of the pressure on the London boroughs has been competition between them to find properties in what they regard as the cheapest areas, so now people are frequently housed temporarily outside their borough of origin. If one looks at the statistics, it is obvious that certain boroughs make a practice of that and very significant numbers of the families they accept as homeless end up in temporary accommodation in another borough. That leads to some of the problems that I mentioned earlier, of security, work and schools. Moving people around in that way often leads also to problems in ensuring that they receive the council tax benefit and other benefits to which they are entitled. Such competition between the London boroughs is very unhealthy. I understood that there were agreements between the boroughs to try to avoid too much of that shopping around, but they do not seem to be working at the moment.</p>

almost do block lettings, apparently with very little pre-inspection or aftercare when people are moved into those properties?</p>

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="08112642000034"><a name="81126h0001.htm_spnew16"><a name="08112642000557"><b>Mr. Gerrard:</b>
 I think that is the case with certain boroughs. Not with all but certainly with some boroughs, there are those sorts of problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08112642000035">Much of what I have said about what happens to people who are placed in temporary accommodation by local authorities does not apply to single people because, in general, single people will not be accepted as priority homeless, so they end up in an even worse situation. They are forced into hostels or night shelters. Sometimes they have to rely on the charity of friends or relatives. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) mentioned, 50,000-plus single homeless people have ended up in hostels. Some of them are helped by the Supporting People programme, which certainly makes a difference, but not all the people in hostels will end up being helped by that programme. For some of the people in hostels, what should be a short-term, temporary measure turns into a long-term problem because there is simply nowhere for them to move on to easily from the hostel. Again, if they are in a hostel where the rents are high and they are reliant on housing benefit, it is extremely difficult for them to get out of that place and get into their own property and into work. In addition, the conditions can be extremely poor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08112642000036">I shall refer to an example from my constituency. Recently, I have been dealing with some of the tenants of a hostel called Lea Bridge house, which is owned by a registered social landlord, Chiltern Hundreds Charitable Housing Association, and managed through Paradigm Housing, an organisation in its group. It is being run as a commercial hostel, is not using the Supporting People programme and is charging market rents, although I think that the rents being charged are significantly more than market rents. What seems rather strange—I am still trying to have it clarified—is that although I am told that it is being run as a commercial hostel and market rents are being charged, the organisation appears to be treated as a registered social landlord for housing benefit purposes, so those inflated rents are paid for through housing benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08112642000037">There are people living in that place—temporary accommodation—paying £130 a week altogether in rent and service charges. What they get for that is a tiny room, and in the room is a single bed, a small table, one chair and perhaps a small fridge. That is it—that is the total amount of furniture in the room. Everything else is shared. There are shared washing facilities, shared toilets and shared kitchens—by the way, there are both men and women in the hostel—and most of that £130 a week is paid through housing benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08112642000038">What disturbs me even more is what happens when people who find themselves in that situation try to challenge the rent. Two of the tenants in the hostel went to rent assessment committees. In one case, the committee said that it believed that the rent increase that had been imposed was invalid and it could not adjudicate on it. In the other case, the committee decided that it could adjudicate; it found that the rent should not be £130 a week but £75 a week, and the rent was reduced. No one else’s rent was reduced. The consequence was that eviction proceedings were started against both tenants. In one case the eviction has already happened; in the other, it is  <br></br>

<meta name="Date" content="26 Nov 2008"/>
<notus-date day="26" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>26 Nov 2008 : Column 242WH</b><br></br>
still proceeding. Under section 21 of the Housing Act 1988, no reason has to be given for eviction because they are assured shorthold tenancies, and it is virtually impossible for tenants to defend themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08112642000039">That is the sort of situation that results in people ending up in hostels. Their rent is far more than I believe the justifiable market rent should be, and they are living in poor conditions. When they try to do something about it—if they challenge the rent and go to the rent assessment committee—the consequence is eviction; but they have virtually no protection against eviction because of the nature of the tenancy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08112642000040">When I questioned the housing association about its policy of eviction, it said:</p>
<a name="81126h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08112642000479"><ul><p class="tabletext">“We do not have a policy of evicting tenants who challenge the Rent Increase Notices sent to them”—</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08112642000041">that sounds fairly straightforward. However, it continued,</p>
<a name="81126h0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08112642000480"><ul><p class="tabletext">“but financially we cannot afford to house tenants who are paying £75 a week. Unless tenants pay a commercial rent which is acceptable to the Association, we have no option but to replace those tenants with others who are willing to do so.”</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08112642000042">If that is not an eviction policy, I do not know what else it could be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08112642000043">It concerns me that a registered social landlord can take that sort of attitude to vulnerable people living in a hostel. I appreciate that the Minister will not know the details of the case, but it is not the sort of thing that we should expect from a registered social landlord, even if things are being run as a commercial operation. I know of other hostels where conditions are probably worse and where rents are higher. Those are the sort of situations in which single homeless people find themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="81126h0001.htm_para18"><a name="08112642000044">We are right to want to build more decent, quality family housing and to help stop families having to go into temporary accommodation, but we should not forget single homeless people. They are faced with the sort of hostel that I have described—and often far worse. None of these problems will be solved without the supply side being addressed with new build and doing more to bring empty properties into use, and in London doing it on a city-wide basis, as local authorities cannot solve the problem only within their own boundaries.</p>

 I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. One area of supply that he has not yet mentioned is the Government purchasing blocks of flats that are unsellable because of the credit crunch and the current economic situation. I know that the Government have put quite a bit of money towards such a scheme; indeed, we discussed it in this Chamber only last week. However, I encourage them to go even further and provide more money so that local authorities, housing associations and social landlords can take that stock off the market. It will help the housing market and the economy generally, and it will certainly help homeless people.</p>

 I would certainly like to see that done. I recall that 30 years ago, when I chaired a local authority housing committee, we used to buy properties on the open market. In one instance, we bought a complete estate that had been built by a private developer who was having trouble selling the properties. It did not distort the housing market in the area, and it made a significant contribution to our being able to re-house people in decent property. I have never seen a problem with local authorities doing that.</p>

I hope that they will look at what can be done to improve the standards and conditions in which people have to live, and to ensure that if people have to live in temporary accommodation—we must accept that will happen for some time to come in London, however well we do against our targets—they can live in decent places at a reasonable cost to them and to the public purse, through what we pay out in benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para0"><a name="08112642000125">In a Westminster Hall debate a couple of weeks ago, I pressed the Minister for Housing as to when the Government will pronounce on that review. There was a suggestion that it would be before the end of the year. I take it that that will not now be the case and I urge the Minister who is here today to tell us when the review might take place.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman therefore support rent controls for the private sector and capping rents in hostels?</p>

 No, but what is important is that we have a system of housing benefit that needs to be scaleable. It is absolutely wrong that somebody who is working may lose money each week. That situation is preventing people from getting into work and keeping on housing benefit people who do not want or need to be on it. That is at the heart of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para1"><a name="08112642000128">On rent levels, the real issue, of course, is the lack of supply of housing. Rents reflect the housing available and if the Government have failed to build as much affordable housing in every single one of the last 10 years as was built in any of the years prior to that, we have ended up in this situation, where the lack of suitable housing creates a real problem. That is the situation we find ourselves in.</p>

 Is not the logic of the hon. Gentleman’s position, therefore, that he would cap housing benefit and thus reduce the availability of housing for people in desperate housing need, making the situation much worse?</p>

<p><a name="st_39"><a name="08112642000132"><a name="81126h0004.htm_spnew5"><a name="08112642000579"><b>Grant Shapps:</b>
 No. People would be much better off if they could get out to work and earn more than the housing benefit. The problem is that housing benefit is too rigid in terms of its step; we need more of a sliding scale. I will be interested to hear when the Minister intends to report on that issue. The Government have conceded that there is a problem in this area. Several Labour Members are looking at me as if I am making this up, but it has been conceded by the Government. I understand that there is a review under way and I look forward to hearing its conclusion.</p>

 On the question of housing supply, which the hon. Gentleman has been stressing, does he therefore agree with those of us who want higher housing numbers to be provided for in the south-east plan, or does he agree with those authorities, predominantly Conservative, that have argued for lower supply?</p>

 I do not want to get too far off the subject. The simple facts are that, on average, 145,000 homes have been built each year under this Government, compared with 175,000 under the previous Government, meaning that over 10 years about a third of a million fewer homes have been built. If those homes had been built and were in play and in the marketplace, it is reasonable to expect that rents would be lower.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para2"><a name="08112642000135">That situation is what we need to get back to, but we cannot do it through top-down targets; we need to do it through bottom-up incentives. That is a fundamental argument at the heart of this debate and every other debate on housing that takes place here in Westminster Hall. Until the Government recognise that they cannot force the targets down on unsuspecting communities without giving them something in return—those communities need to be provided with a carrot or an incentive to build new homes—we will continue in the mess that we find ourselves in today. Labour Members are happy to complain about that mess, but they will not recognise the source or the real reasons behind the catastrophic situation in relation to temporary housing, homelessness and, indeed, the cost of housing overall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para3"><a name="08112642000136">I will end soon because I want to hear the Minister’s response, not least how he will build more homes than the Government have managed to do in the last few years. Before I finish, however, I want to ask a number of questions. First, there was an announcement of £750 million—I think that was the figure—in the pre-Budget report the other day. However, there was no description of how that money would be spent, how it would be brought forward and how it would encourage the creation of more housing. I assume that that money has already been allocated in the budget of the Homes and Communities Agency, so perhaps the Minister will take a minute to explain how that money will ease the housing crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para4"><a name="08112642000137">Given that we know that there has been less affordable housing built every year in the last 10 years and that the market is likely to crash this year and next, perhaps the Minister will also tell us his estimates of housing numbers in the affordable sector for this year and next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para5"><a name="08112642000138">I was interested in the comments by some hon. Members about secure tenure. There now seems to be a tradition of new Housing Ministers coming in about every three months and making some fairly outrageous statements to some newspaper, only to row back from them a few days later. We remember that the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)—now Minister for Europe and predecessor of the current Minister for Housing—came in and immediately made statements about throwing people who do not work out of their homes, without realising that the local authority would have to house those families if they were in priority need. Will the Minister explain whether that policy is on or off the table?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para6"><a name="08112642000139">Finally, on security of tenure, will the Minister say whether that is an idea put forward by the Minister for Housing, or is it simply an idea from a think-tank?</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. Earlier this year, you ably steered the Housing and Regeneration Bill Committee, in which many of the issues that we have discussed today were initially raised. I am grateful to you for presiding over an excellent debate, albeit a sombre one—as befits the subject. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) on securing the debate and on the excellent way in which he advanced his argument, and I congratulate other hon.

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para7"><a name="08112642000141">Tackling homelessness and reducing fear about housing, as well as housing policy in general, are at the heart of what the Government want to do—they are at the top of our domestic priorities. We have achieved a lot in recent years by making substantial and sustained cuts in the worst form of homelessness; namely, rough sleeping. Hon. Members will be aware that I was able to announce last week our new rough sleeping strategy, which states our ambition to end rough sleeping once and for all by 2012. That target will be incredibly challenging and difficult to achieve, but if we have focus and determination, and if we work in partnership with local authorities and the voluntary sector, we will achieve it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para8"><a name="08112642000142">We have also ended the long-term reliance on bed- and-breakfast accommodation for families, and we are well on the way to ending it for 16 and 17-year-olds. I was pleased that hon. Members from both sides of the House acknowledged the great advances that we have made on that in the past decade. There have been reductions of more than 50 per cent. in new cases of statutory homelessness since 2004. Subsequently, numbers in temporary accommodation have fallen by 26 per cent. In 2008, the number has fallen by 11 per cent., from 87,120 to 77,510. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) said that in his region—the east midlands—the target to reduce the number of households living in temporary accommodation by 50 per cent. by 2010 has already been achieved. It has also already been achieved in the south-east and north-east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para9"><a name="08112642000143">There is a lot to be proud of on temporary accommodation, but I do not want to be complacent. There is an awful lot left to be done. We are committed to reducing, as much as possible, reliance on temporary accommodation, but I am under no illusion, given the current economic circumstances, about the challenges we face. The main task for the Government is ensuring that we minimise, as far as possible, the number of people who are forced to lose their home through repossession or other means. I was taken with what the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) said about that. It is important: people are frightened that they will lose their homes, and the Government are determined to do all it takes to ensure that they do not. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para10"><a name="08112642000144">The hon. Lady will be aware of the announcements in Monday’s pre-Budget report. The Government will help to protect people who are at risk of repossession by driving through support for vulnerable households via the mortgage rescue scheme, providing direct support for some individuals through support for the mortgage interest regime, and ensuring that we have fair treatment by lenders, with lenders absolutely committed to not initiating repossession proceedings within at least three months of an account going into arrears. We are committed to working with lenders to create sustainable solutions to help borrowers to stay in their homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para11"><a name="08112642000145">My hon. Friend the Member for Regent’s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) mentioned something that disturbed and concerned me. She talked about a family who were renting in the private rented sector losing their home through no fault of their own, because the landlord had failed to pay the mortgage. I will work on that problem to see what can be done. I am worried that vulnerable households—through no fault of their own—may be at risk of losing their homes because landlords have not paid. I am keen to work on that problem and to put something solid in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para12"><a name="08112642000146">Because of the lack of certainty about the future and the disruption caused by frequent moves, which has been made all too clear in the debate, we need to do much more. About 87 per cent.—92 per cent. of families with children—are now living in self-contained temporary accommodation, with their own front door and cooking and washing facilities. However, as has been made clear to me this morning, they are not settled homes, because people do not feel at all stable or secure in them. That is why we are retaining the target to halve the number of households in temporary accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para13"><a name="08112642000147">The point about cleanliness and standards in temporary accommodation was also well made in the debate. I met Professor Suzanne Fitzpatrick from the university of York earlier this year, who presented me with the key findings of research into the causes and impacts of statutory homelessness for families and 16 and 17-year-olds in England. It is the first nationally representative survey of families and children who have been homeless for more than 10 years, and the first such survey of 16 and 17-year-olds. The findings are incredibly interesting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para14"><a name="08112642000148">As hon. Members would expect, the research shows greater incidences of problems with physical conditions in self-contained temporary accommodation compared with settled housing. However, interestingly, there seems to be no substantial difference between self-contained temporary accommodation and settled housing in respect of the state of repair or the levels of cleanliness when families first arrive. As hon. Members would expect, the research shows that although the homelessness system is working well, families and children have an improved quality of life once they are in settled housing. That underlines the importance of pressing forward on meeting the temporary accommodation target.</p>

<p><a name="st_43"><a name="08112642000149"><a name="81126h0004.htm_spnew8"><a name="08112642000583"><b>Ms Buck:</b>
 Will the Minister comment on the departmental code of practice on out-of-borough placements? We are talking about settled accommodation, but being settled a long way from the community in which one has schools, employment, family and friends is an important issue. There is a code of practice, and it should be enforced.</p>

<p><a name="st_44"><a name="08112642000150"><a name="81126h0004.htm_spnew9"><a name="08112642000584"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 I was going to mention that later, but as we are on the subject, there is an inter-borough agreement on the issue. It is worrying. I know that my hon. Friend has had meetings on the matter with the previous housing Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint). In early December, I will  <br></br>

meet officials of Westminster city council and I will raise that key issue along with other things that arose from a previous meeting, especially the problem of overcrowding. The matter is important. I am instructing my officials to work closely with London councils to encourage all boroughs to abide fully by the agreement. I agree that more can be done, and if I have time later in my speech I will mention the wider prospect of supply and its importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para15"><a name="08112642000151">Key to achieving the target is prevention. We need to ensure that we do not have a reactive, ad hoc approach to producing temporary accommodation to solve the problem. Intervening at the trigger points when people might become homeless, and fully involving friends, family and the wider community to stop people reaching crisis point, is absolutely crucial. We have achieved our successes by encouraging and providing significant investment in homelessness prevention. Approximately a third of local authorities have already met the 2010 target. They have strengthened their efforts, and provide prevention services such as rent deposit schemes, mediation to help resolve family and relationship breakdowns or problems between tenants and landlords, and debt counselling. Last year, 201 local authorities operated rent deposit schemes and a further 45 were planning to put such a scheme in place. That proves that private rented accommodation is an effective housing option for preventing homelessness and providing a means of settled accommodation, when it is what the household wants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para16"><a name="08112642000152">Many hon. Members mentioned the housing benefit regime, which is crucial, and my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow asked a question about it last Tuesday in the House. Everyone is aware that local authorities must administer the local housing allowance, which was introduced in April 2008, in accordance with regulations. Local authorities can, and in the vast majority of cases do, take responsible decisions about providing housing for families in their area. However, as was said time and again in the debate, perverse disincentives ensure that people who are reliant on housing benefit do not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para17"><a name="08112642000153">Questions were asked about whether the taxpayer gets value for money from the housing benefit regime. That is why there has been housing benefit reform—to ensure that we can provide value for money and improve standards. Officials in the Departments for Communities and Local Government and for Work and Pensions and others are working closely together on developing proposals to reform the way in which housing benefit subsidy is calculated and paid to local authorities for people in temporary accommodation.</p>

I stress the word “community” because the school is at the centre of the community in the area. Croxteth is a post-war housing estate that adjoins the pre-war housing estate of Norris Green. It is a large chunk of north-east Liverpool. I was brought up in Norris Green myself, and I can tell the Minister that 181 pupils at Croxteth comprehensive school come from Norris Green.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="81126h0004.htm_para19"><a name="08112642000156">Croxteth is among the 24 most deprived wards in the country. Its notoriety—it is unfortunate that I have to use that word—came to the fore with the murder of young Rhys Jones a year or so ago. It is not an area of great violence, but it has its social problems, which put it among the top 25 most deprived wards. In 1986, during the Thatcher years, unemployment there was no less than 95 per cent. among young people aged between 16 and 25. The area certainly cannot be regarded as affluent. It has been through a traumatic period recently, but one thing about the people of Croxteth is that there is community spirit, and they have kept together in the face of all the difficulties and problems that have beset them.</p>

However, I have come to the Chamber armed with a copy of his Department’s guide to local authorities and governing bodies, “Closing a Maintained Mainstream School”. I shall refer to certain sections of it. For example, it mentions the need for diversity in an area, stating at paragraph 5:</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way as he is being interesting and, some might argue, provocative. In the context of what he has just said, does he think that schools should have an ethos and values? If he thinks that an ethos is valuable in a school, and that religious foundations are useful in a school, should there be any moral background to that ethos?</p>

 I agree that schools should be given more freedom to set their own ethos, but within that freedom there should, therefore, be freedom to say, “In our school, we don’t believe that sex education is desirable. We think that it should be left to parents.” Then parents would, perhaps, be able to choose to send their children to a school with such an ethos. If the Minister is arguing that we should leave it to schools to set their own ethos I would be happy with that, but with it must come the freedom for schools to say that they do not want to teach sex education.</p>

 I apologise if I gave the impression that every teacher agrees with me. I was trying to make the opposite point, which is that not every teacher agrees with the idea that sex education is a good thing. The position that is often portrayed is that all parents and teachers think that this is a universally good thing. My point is that some people disagree. I take it from the hon.

For example, the earliest figures I have show that in 1994 there were 7,795 teenage pregnancies among girls under 16. In 2006, the last year for which I have figures, there were 7,800 teenage pregnancies in that age group, which is almost exactly the same number—it has not reduced in the slightest—and it has been even higher in the intervening years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="81126h0006.htm_para8"><a name="08112642000223">The number of pregnancies among under-19s was 85,000 in 1994 and in 2004, the last year for which I have information, it was 101,000. The problem is getting worse. In England and Wales, the number of abortions for under-16s in 1994 was 3,900, and in 2006 it was 4,700; for under-19s in 1994 it was 29,600 and in 2006 it was 40,500. Surely, if sex education was such a great success, the situation would have improved as there was more and more of it.</p>

 That could be the case, but I suggest that it is not. The hon. Lady’s intervention was typical of a politician. I am being distracted, but it is a worthwhile distraction.

politicians is that they must be seen to be doing something whenever a problem arrives on their desk. I long for the day when a Minister says, “This is nothing to do with us. It is for other people to sort out, or for the people concerned to sort out.” I am sure that the Minister will not indulge me with that response today. The second ingredient is that their proposals should not offend anyone. The hon. Lady has fallen into the typical politician’s trap of wanting to do something and not wanting to offend anyone. Sex education is a perfect example, because it looks as if we are doing something, and it does not offend anyone to suggest that we should have more of it.</p>

Clearly, it is not helping. It may not be as universal as she would like, but given that there is more sex education now, one would expect the figures to show an improvement.</p>

I understand that the Government want to roll out more relationship education rather than just the bare facts of reproduction.</p>

 I certainly take my hon.

We keep tinkering with it and changing it, but the situation keeps getting worse. Everyone must have their own line in the sand for concluding that it is not working. I would like to know where every hon.

Since 1997, the incidence of chlamydia has risen from 72 cases per 100,000 of population to 166 cases per 100,000 in 2004. During the same period, the incidence of gonorrhoea has risen from 22 to 37 cases per 100,000 of population, and for syphilis it has risen from 0.27 to 3.81 per 100,000 of population. The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in the UK is getting worse, although the figure for syphilis is better than in Holland, which is always held up as a paragon of virtue by those who are obsessed with sex education.

The people who have had the most sex education are suffering most from sexually transmitted diseases, which strikes me as hardly a great triumph for sex education in schools.</p>

Will he refer to the evidence that shows a direct correlation between the increase in sex education in schools and the increase in the statistics that he gave? It seems to me that many other factors could be equally or more to blame, particularly the increased sexualisation of our popular culture and what we see on television. Is there any evidence that sex education is the problem, rather than a solution?</p>

 The hon. Lady makes a fair point; she is right to say that other factors are important, but my contention is that sex education is making no impression, so perhaps other factors should be brought into play. During the first 20 minutes of this debate, we seem to have gone from saying that sex education is good and will help the situation to saying that things might be even worse if we did not have sex education, which is rather startling backtracking in such a short period. I am pleased that I seem to be making progress with my argument that sex education is not good and only prevents things from becoming even worse. That is a novel position for the governing party to take.</p>

In this country, the average age at which people first have sex has fallen, which indicates that sex education is not a great triumph. Of all the OECD nations, we have the second highest number of young people living in single parent families, whereas the Netherlands is 14th and Italy is the lowest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="81126h0006.htm_para13"><a name="08112642000236">Of all OECD nations, the UK has much the highest percentage of 15-year-olds who report having had sexual intercourse. The percentage of 15-year-olds who used a condom during their last sexual intercourse is much lower in the UK than in virtually every other OECD nation. I have no idea what people are being taught in sex education, but on every possible indicator of what they may be taught this country is failing badly, not just by itself, but in comparison with every other country.</p>

That is hardly a great advert for sex education in the UK, and things seem to be getting worse. I concede that even at that point we could say that sex education is failing only in the UK, but that it is a good thing, although we do it badly, and that other countries do it far better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="81126h0006.htm_para15"><a name="08112642000238">Holland is always held up as the great shining example of sex education being a triumph, because the argument is that Holland has lots of sex education at a very young age, and the level of teenage pregnancies is very low. That is absolutely true. However, the proponents of sex education never mention that Italy has almost no sex education in its schools yet it has low levels of teenage and unwanted pregnancies. Rather than just cherry-picking the figures that we want to sustain our arguments, it would be more useful to consider what Italy and Holland are doing because both countries clearly do things right in a way that we do not. Sex education is not a triumph in relation to Italy and Holland because although one country has lots of it, the other has hardly any.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="81126h0006.htm_para16"><a name="08112642000239">I have tried to consider some of the things that Italy and Holland have in common, and it strikes me that other things in the argument are more important. For example, family structure is much tighter and divorce rates are much lower in Holland and Italy than in the UK. Dutch children are five times less likely to live in a family headed by a lone parent than in this country. The OECD looked at the percentage of families that share a meal together several times a week and the percentage of children who benefit from just talking to their parents several times a week. The percentage of 15-year-olds who eat at least one meal a day with their parents is only 65 in the United Kingdom, but the figures are 90 per cent. in Holland and 94 per cent. in Italy. The UNICEF report on the well-being of children ranks the Netherlands as the best place for children to grow up. Italy comes seventh in that report, after all the other Scandinavian countries. The UK ranks as the worst place to grow up. Other factors, such as the things Italy and Holland have in common, seem to be far more important than sex education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="81126h0006.htm_para17"><a name="08112642000240">Something that Italy and Holland have in common but that we do not share with them is their benefit structure and the amount of money they pay single parents. It may not surprise people to hear that we are far more generous than Italy or Holland in our support for single parents. If we really want to tackle the issue of teenage and unwanted pregnancies it would be far better—although it may be tougher and more uncomfortable, which is why politicians shy away from the matter—to consider the implications of our tax and benefit system. Too often that system rewards people for living on their own and puts teenage mothers at the top of housing allocation lists. It strikes me as perverse that through the housing allocation and benefits that we pay, we reward behaviour that we are trying to discourage. Surely, the tax and benefit system ought to reflect the fact that we try to discourage certain behaviour.</p>
