<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;[<i>Mr. McNulty.</i>]
</p>



<a name="50315h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>


<p><a name="50315h01_spnew0"><b> Jim Knight  (South Dorset)</b>  (Lab): I welcome the opportunity to debate the future of trust ports. I am grateful for the interest shown by my hon. Friends the Members for Harwich (Mr. Henderson), for Dover (Mr. Prosser) and for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell) and by    those who represent other port constituencies. Unfortunately, others cannot be here, including my hon. Friend the Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger) and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mrs. Brooke). Many hon. Members who noted the subject of today&#039;s debate but who were not too well versed on trust ports wondered what was of such great interest. I shall therefore start by sketching out briefly what the debate is about.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para0">Five years ago, in 2000, the Office for National Statistics ruled that trust ports with a turnover above a threshold of &#163;6.6 million, or those with a majority of members appointed by the Government, should be regarded as public bodies and subject to public sector borrowing requirements. Uncertainty over borrowing created various problems for those ports, as a result of which harbour revision orders were issued last year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para1">Those orders would have resolved the matter but for objections, made most notably by the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)&#151;I am pleased to see him in his place&#151;and the Major Ports Group. Those objections were raised in order to leave open the option to privatise those ports. Worries about privatisation were reinforced last week by the official Opposition&#039;s announcement that they would certainly want to privatise Dover in order to release money for road schemes.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Christopher Chope  (Christchurch)</b>  (Con): The hon. Gentleman mentioned the years 2000 and 2004 and spoke of uncertainty. Can he tell us what was done between those two years to try to remove that uncertainty? He has rather condensed that.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew2"><b> Jim Knight </b> : I would like to go back beyond 2000, as I sketch out how we arrived at the present situation under the Ports Act 1991, the governing legislation in respect of trust ports.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para2">The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question is that the ruling of the Office for National Statistics was initially resisted by the Department for Transport; there was some negotiation as to whether the ruling was correct, but it has been accepted. It took a little time, but the harbour revision orders of 2004 were the outcome of those negotiations; the aim was to resolve the situation and provide some certainty. The uncertainty over the future of ports has certainly resulted in some difficulties. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 2WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Most recently, the delay of a &#163;6.6 million investment caused problems for the port of Poole, but I gather through conversations this morning that that difficulty might be resolved for now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para3">It is worth saying what a trust port is. It is a convenient shorthand term used to describe ports that are not owned and run by a company, a local authority or a nationalised industry. Many have operated for a long time. Poole&#039;s trust port was formed in 1895&#151;this is pertinent to our debate&#151;when port users rebelled against the neglect and profiteering of the private owners of the port; care of the port was entrusted to commissioners who were charged under an Act of Parliament to conserve, regulate and improve the port and harbour of Poole.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para4">That status quo continued happily until the 1980s, when the then Conservative Government were pursuing their dogmatic desire to privatise. In 1988, the Secretary of State of the day, Paul Channon, expressed his disappointment that ports had not yet been privatised and declared all ports as candidates for privatisation. His frustration that ports did not want to privatise led to the Ports Act, which gave him the power to force privatisation on ports and allowed the Exchequer to take 50 per cent. of the proceeds. That love&#151;that dogmatic desire&#151;for privatisation is alive and well in the Opposition today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para5">Happily, the general election in 1997 ended that particular episode, but the decision of the Office for National Statistics in 2000 decreed that trust ports should be classified as public sector corporations, reopening the debate. The way in which such ports are classified means that London, Dover, Shoreham, Tyne, Harwich, Milford Haven and Poole all have their borrowings set against the public sector borrowing requirement, which, in turn, restricts their freedom. They all want to return to the status quo that they enjoyed before the debate on this issue began.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para6">Others would like the ports to be privatised, but the chairmen and chief executives, including those at Dover, oppose privatisation. Unfortunately, the power to impose it on them still remains, although the harbour revision orders sought to remove it. This is only a guess, and it will be interesting to hear the comments of the hon. Member for Christchurch, but the Conservative party appears to be pursuing this issue to plug the &#163;35 billion hole in its public finance plans. I put it to Conservative Members that if they cannot persuade authorities to privatise, they should not impose privatisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para7">I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would make it clear whether he agrees with or opposes privatisation. I say that particularly in respect of Poole, because I represent 75 per cent. of the harbour area. If he wants to state his intent clearly, it would be helpful if he withdrew his formal objection to the Poole harbour revision order. On 3 November 2004, he wrote to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The effect of the Harbour Revision Order would be to deprive the taxpayer of resources and will undermine the will of Parliament clearly expressed in the Ports Act 1991.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 3WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para8">I do not deny that the will of Parliament, as expressed in 1991, was clearly in favour of privatisation; happily, the composition of Parliament has changed since then, and the will of this Parliament would be somewhat different. However, the key phrase in the letter is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;to deprive the taxpayer of resources&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para9">The letter, which is specifically about the proposed Poole harbour revision No. 2 order, is the clearest indication that we have of the official Opposition&#039;s desire to privatise Poole harbour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para10">That would be a disaster for Poole. The harbour area extends across 10,000 acres of an exceptional environment. I am pleased to see the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) in his place, and I am sure that he would vouch for the fact that it is one of the south coast&#039;s jewels. Poole is one of the world&#039;s largest natural harbours, and its extensive waters provide what the website calls
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;a magnificent haven for recreational sailing and water sports&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para11">It is home to all manner of leisure craft and to a fishing fleet of about 100 vessels. Walkers, bird-watchers, sailors and fishermen all enjoy the wonders of Poole harbour, an area that I am privileged to represent so much of.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para12">For more than 100 years, the Poole harbour commissioners have been entrusted with conserving, regulating and improving that environment. They bring together stakeholders such as Poole borough council, Purbeck district council and Dorset county council. In addition to those statutory bodies, English Nature, the Southern Sea Fisheries Committee, the Environment Agency, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the harbour yacht clubs all have a strong and close working relationship with the commissioners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para13">This morning, I met the chairman of the Poole harbour commissioners, Captain Malcolm Shakesby, who also happens to be a Conservative county councillor. I asked him whether he opposed privatisation, and he was very clear that he does not allow party labels to get in the way of his good judgment. His judgment is that privatisation would be bad for Poole because stakeholders would not have the same voice or the surpluses currently generated by the commercial port, which takes up just 60 acres of the 10,000 acres of the harbour area. Those surpluses are reinvested in looking after the interests of all the stakeholders who sit round the table when the commissioners meet. In Poole. People&#039;s real fear of privatisation is that the surpluses will go to shareholders and that we will return to the days when a few rich traders and the corporation of Poole owned the port in the 19th century and before, and there was profiteering and neglect of the harbour. It is in order to preserve the harbour and its environment and to protect the interests of all its users that I strongly oppose its privatisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para14">The commissioners&#039; objective is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;to maintain the balance in the harbour between commercial, recreational and environmental interests, at the same time maintaining a sustainable and commercially viable medium-sized trust port.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para15">That is a commendable objective for the commissioners to pursue. Realistically, a private company cannot balance those interests in the same way.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 4WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para16">Several Members want to speak, and although I secured the debate, I want to hear voices from all over the country who are concerned about the issue. As I said, I am strongly opposed to imposing privatisation on trust ports. It is good to see Members from all parties in the Chamber, and I invite them to make a clear statement of their intent. Are they for or against the port&#039;s privatisation? For the sake of my constituents who are concerned about the port and the harbour of Poole, I ask the hon. Member for Christchurch to be very clear about whether he is in favour of, or against, its privatisation.
</p>



<a name="50315h01_time1"><h5>9.41 am</h5>


<p><a name="50315h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Robert Syms  (Poole)</b>  (Con): First, I congratulate the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight) on securing the debate. The House does not discuss enough such issues as our ports in general and trust ports in particular. It is to the great credit of the hon. Gentleman that he has raised such an important issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para17">The issue of trust ports affects several Members of Parliament and their constituencies, including, as the hon. Gentleman said, Poole. Poole is a good example of a trust port. It is well managed and successful, and the quality of the people who run it is very good. It is generally popular because all its stakeholders in the greater area of Poole have their say. It is a traditional British compromise in that it brings together various interests, so it works.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para18">The hon. Gentleman became upset when he talked about privatisation, but I do not see that on the agenda for Poole, simply because there is no local demand for it. Since 1895, which is about 110 years ago, the Conservative party has been in office for two thirds of that time, and was in office with a substantial majority for 18 years&#151;a very long time&#151;under Mrs. T. If we had been dedicated to privatising the port, and if there was any time when the port was, to use the hon. Gentleman&#039;s phrase, at risk of privatisation, it would have happened then.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para19">My predecessor, John Ward, talked to most of the local stakeholders in the port and took the view that trust status was an appropriate solution for Poole, which is why the trust has remained and has kept being successful.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew4"><b> Jim Knight </b> : Will the hon. Gentleman clarify whether he would support or oppose the privatisation of the port if the question was put?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Syms </b> : The issue is whether I support the trust status of the port, and I do. If, in 20 years, the commissioners believed that a different relationship or organisation was necessary, one would have to consider that. At the moment, however, and for the foreseeable future&#151;and, I suspect, for the next 110 years&#151;Poole will remain a trust port because it works well. We are the second largest port in the south-west, and are very successful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para20">As the hon. Member for South Dorset pointed out, there is a good balance between the commercial activities of the port, which is profitable, although it is always a struggle to keep ferry companies interested in coming in&#151;a vital component of the port&#039;s success&#151;and its recreational and environmental activities. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 5WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Indeed, the port&#039;s profitability is used to manage the harbour, to ensure that it is properly dredged and that the sites of special scientific interest are protected. Poole is well known for its leisure activities, such as sailing and yachting. They depend on the success of the port.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Gwyn Prosser  (Dover)</b>  (Lab): I am listening to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s arguments with great interest. He is painting a rosy picture of the future of Poole as a trust port. That could be extended to all the other trust ports. On that basis, would he support moves to remove Poole from the 1991 orders that provide the Secretary of State with redress to privatise it?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Syms </b> : That is a different issue. As the hon. Member for South Dorset said, the Office for National Statistics has changed the way in which these ports are considered. The Government have some form in the way in which they finance some of their public corporations. Network Rail is a perfect example. It has about &#163;10 billion of debt, which the Government have kept off the public balance sheet. With my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope), I think that it is legitimate to consider how we determine and count the amount of money that is used by various public corporations. That is a legitimate area for some political argument and no doubt that will be resolved in due course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para21">Returning to trust ports, Poole is certainly a successful port. The Government have not done us any great favours over the years. The road network into Poole is not particularly good. In the roads programme under the Conservative Government, there were proposals to build a bridge over Holes bay to the A350 and to build a link road to the A31, which were cancelled. Fortunately, through the hard work of the harbour commissioners and the borough, we managed to persuade the Government to put a scheme back into the local transport plan, with the support of our neighbours in Bournemouth and Dorset county council. It has been a little delayed because the Government were pushing for a private finance initiative, which was not appropriate. However, the prospects for Poole are pretty good and getting the second bridge in place should help the port.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para22">If I were to make a plea, the greatest difference to be made to the port of Poole would be by focusing on improving the road network so that people could easily get out of the port. When I run into friends and individuals who have used the ferry port, it is noticeable that quite a lot of them have got lost coming out of Poole. I therefore think that, if we are to maintain Poole as a successful port, when we are in Government we will have to consider very seriously how to improve transport links.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para23">As I have said, Poole is a successful port. There is a legitimate area of disagreement over the harbour revision orders and the question of money and finance. I know that that will irritate some local people in Poole, who are getting caught up in a political argument, but I hope that that can be resolved. On trust ports, we have to consider each example and decide whether they are fit for purpose. In the previous Parliament, the Government made reforms to corporate governance. Poole has always done extremely well in terms of how it has run its affairs. It has been open and transparent. I 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 6WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
know that some trust ports were run in rather bizarre and undemocratic ways and that there were necessary reforms. However, we must all examine the trust ports in our constituencies to assess appropriateness and fitness for purpose in terms of what is being provided.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para24">I am happy with how Poole is run. I understand that we are a few months from a general election, and it is easy to make various allegations across the Chamber. I am sure that my party is as capable of doing that as your party&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. I have no party when I am in the Chair.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Syms </b> : My apologies, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para25">I understand that the forthcoming election has added a little fizz. However, since the article in the <i>Daily Echo</i> the other week, which contained allegations made by the hon. Member for South Dorset and which quoted my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch, I have not had a single phone call or letter one way or the other. I think that that is because people support the status quo and would be surprised if that changed.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew10"><b> Jim Knight </b> : To clarify, in respect of any speculation that this issue might be related to the election, I would be delighted if, as a result of today&#039;s debate, there were clarification from all parties in the Chamber that we all agree that the current status of the trust port of Poole should continue, and that the objection from the official Opposition should be withdrawn. Then we can carry on with any campaigning that we want to pursue on the subjects that we choose, such as the successful economy, the health service and schools, and leave this issue to one side.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Syms </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes his own point.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Chope </b> : My hon. Friend referred to the article in the <i>Daily Echo</i> on 10 March. Does he recall that in that article the hon. Member for South Dorset was quoted as saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Objecting to this order is holding up &#163;6 million of investment&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para26">Today, just a few days later, he admitted that that is not the impact of the order. Has my hon. Friend taken note of that disparity?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Syms </b> : I always listen carefully to what the hon. Member for South Dorset says, as he is my parliamentary neighbour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para27">I would like to return to the general view that Poole trust port is a successful port; long may it remain so. It has broad support and I am sure that my party will support its current status. There is a knotty issue in relation to the harbour revision orders and money. If what the hon. Gentleman has said is true, I hope that it will not hold up any investment plans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para28">Clearly, there have been changes to ferry traffic across the channel. There are concerns that other ports may poach our business and one always has to think of the future, which is why we need a deeper channel to enable a wider range of ships to come into the harbour. Ferry traffic, or any sort of traffic in the harbour, is the basic seed corn that provides money for the port, from which all other things flow. I am pleased that the hon. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 7WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Gentleman has initiated the debate. I am happy that other hon. Members should be able to talk, glowingly or otherwise, about ports in their constituencies.
</p>



<a name="50315h01_time2"><h5>9.52 am</h5>


<p><a name="50315h01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Alan Campbell  (Tynemouth)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate, and I begin by commending my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight) for raising this important subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para29">I intend to speak glowingly about my local port. I shall spend my time commenting on the port of Tyne, the future of which is of great concern to my constituents, some of whom are employed by the Port of Tyne authority, river users in general and the whole region, whether we are talking about commercial interests, leisure interests or environmental interests.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para30">The port of Tyne is one of more than 100 trust ports, and one of the largest. It was affected by the decision of the Office for National Statistics to reclassify ports as corporations, and therefore applied for a harbour revision order to keep its trust port status. That order was not challenged by anyone locally, but was challenged by the official Opposition and by the Major Ports Group, and that may yet lead to a public inquiry, which in turn may lead to the sort of uncertainty that my hon. Friend spoke about earlier.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para31">The debate has been moved on to some extent by the announcement last week by the Conservative party that&#151;in the unlikely event that it returns to office&#151;it plans to privatise the port of Dover, and that it will consider other ports. We await the comments of the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) to learn whether it has missed Poole off that list, or whether that has come as a surprise to the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms).
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Prosser </b> : Is my hon. Friend aware that when the Tory shadow Secretary of State came to Dover and made his announcement, without the courtesy of notice, he said that he would consider these matters on a port-by-port basis? It might be Dover today, but it will be Poole and Tyneside tomorrow.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Campbell </b> : Indeed. None of that surprises me, and it helps me to make my next point. In 1995, the then Conservative Secretary of State for Transport planned to privatise three ports: Ipswich, which was privatised, Dover and Tyne. Dover and Tyne were saved only because of the 1997 general election and, as my hon. Friend has clearly indicated, that not only puts his port in the picture, but the port of Tyne as well. That is a cause of deep concern to port users and stakeholders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para32">In Transport questions last week, the hon. Member for Christchurch described privatised ports as &quot;thriving&quot;. That is interesting, because it is exactly the same word that has been used again and again to describe the port of Tyne. It is thriving because profits increased by 49 per cent. last year. Turnover is &#163;27 million and rising. That allows investment on an unprecedented scale&#151;&#163;72 million in the last decade and &#163;10 million in the past year. The Port of Tyne authority now employs 430 people directly, of whom 80 have been employed in the past 12 months. It plans to employ more people.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 8WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para33">One NorthEast, the regional development agency, has assessed that as many as 10,000 jobs depend on activity in the area covered by the Port of Tyne authority. The port deals with 3 million tonnes of cargo. The number of cruise ships entering the Tyne is doubling year on year. The number of passengers, most of whom are going to northern Europe and Scandinavia, has grown to almost 1 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para34">One of the most significant developments of the port is as a car terminal. The port allows the export of about 400,000 Nissan vehicles from the nearby factory in Washington and the import of 60,000 Volkswagen into the country. That makes the port of Tyne the ninth largest car terminal in the world. Having made that happen is a great commendation of the Port of Tyne authority. As a throwaway point, it is interesting that a port that made its name on the export of coal is&#151;sad to say&#151;importing coal. That is a sign of the times. It means that income is generated that allows investment in new and upgraded deep-river berths and in the transport infrastructure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para35">So, the port is a success story. That is a credit to the way in which the port is managed. It is a credit also to the work force and a credit to the decision not to go down the route of privatisation that the Government made when they came into office in 1997. I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Minister for two assurances. The first is that the uncertainty that resulted from the ONS   reclassification will not be used as an excuse to introduce privatisation by the back door and that the Government&#039;s position on privatisation has not changed. The second is that, if the objections remain in place and we go to a potentially lengthy public inquiry, the Government and, in particular, the Treasury will make it absolutely clear that none of the investment plans will be held back during the period of uncertainty.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew17"><b> Jim Knight </b> : It will be useful for me to clarify the inconsistency between what was reported in the <i>Daily Echo</i> and what I said today. My understanding is that, as a result of representations that have been made by Labour Members, the Treasury has&#151;at least in the case of Poole&#151;given an assurance that will allow the borrowing necessary for its &#163;6 million dredging programme to go ahead.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Campbell </b> : I am delighted to hear that, because we need reassurance, particularly if we are entering a new period of uncertainty for trust ports, including the port of Tyne. There is a strong sense that the port of Tyne is improving, that it is, to use the phrase of the hon. Member for Poole, &quot;fit for purpose&quot; and that, therefore, privatisation, particularly if imposed by a future Government, would be a retrograde step. I am certain that it would be regarded as a retrograde step by fishermen in my constituency, who struggle to make a living, if light dues suddenly increased. It would be a retrograde step for shipbuilders and ship repairers if they had to pay more for dredging. It would be a retrograde step also if ferries, cargo ships and cruise ships had to pay more for pilotage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para36">So, we are left with the question of whether that concern is justified or is simply a result of the imminence of a general election. I think that it is justified, because the objection put forward by the UK Major Ports Group and by the official Opposition&#151;that trust status 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 9WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
gives an advantage over privatised ports&#151;sends out a clear message about what would happen to charges and to the assets of those ports should they fall into entirely private hands. The concern is also justified, considering that shareholders would expect a return on their investment. The short-term thinking that could come into play would be intensely damaging to an industry that relies on long-term investment and judgments about the future. The concern is further justified, considering what could well happen not only to levels of employment, which I am pleased to say are increasing at the port of Tyne, but pay and conditions.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Chope </b> : Would the hon. Gentleman like to comment on the undoubted success of Tees port as a privatised port?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Campbell </b> : I am not making the point that privatised ports may not be successful; the point that I am trying to make to the hon. Gentleman is that the port of Tyne is successful. We should judge the port on its growing success. If one considers it in terms of income, employment and investment, it is a success. The phrase that has been used by people employed by the port is, &quot;If it is not broke, why fix it?&quot; A policy that may well be imposed for ideological reasons, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset has alluded, will not do anything other than damage the long-term future of the port of Tyne.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para37">The Port of Tyne authority owns 580 acres, and along the banks of the river Tyne we have seen not only impressive new housing developments, but the loss of land that ought to be retained for industrial and commercial use. It has been turned over to housing, and in many ways that restricts what adjoining commercial land can be used for. In a rush to privatisation, I would not want to see a land sale of large proportions that jeopardised the long-term future of the port and the people who depend upon it. Long-term investment is important&#151;not the short-termism that could well come in through the back door with privatisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para38">My constituents will be listening with great interest to what my hon. Friend the Minister says when he replies to this important debate, but they will be listening with even greater interest to the reply from the official Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Christchurch.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para39">The port of Tyne was set up in 1850&#151;two years before the borough of Tynemouth was set up. I do not want to make a party political point, but for most of the time the borough was under the control of the Conservative party, because it seemed that the major parties had an agreement about the need for politics to be pragmatic. They did not have a problem with local governance, nor public provision sitting alongside private provision. Unfortunately, if we have a proposal that means privatisation for ideological reasons, it tells us something about how the Conservative party has arrived at its current position.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para40">The port of Tyne had to survive the push for privatisation in the 1990s. When this Government came to power, they subjected trust ports to a root-and-branch review, and ensured the highest standards of government and accountability. The port not only met those standards, but it is now held up as a model for

other ports. It would therefore be beyond comprehension to myself and many of my constituents if the port and the jobs connected to it were to be put at risk by privatisation for its own purpose.

<a name="50315h01_time3"><h5>10.4 am</h5>


<p><a name="50315h01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Gwyn Prosser  (Dover)</b>  (Lab): At the outset I should declare some interests. As well as being a former merchant navy officer, I spent the last 12 years of my sea-going career sailing in and out of the grand port of Dover under the white cliffs. It is the busiest ferry port in the world, and certainly the busiest premier port in the UK. It is an area for which I have great affection and to which I have a great connection, having lived in it for more than 25 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para41">I know a little bit about Dover harbour board, including its successes and some of its weaknesses. I know about the people who use the port to run the ships, sail on the ferries, cross as passengers or run the port. The port is our largest employer bar none, and the port-related industries stretch far and wide. We rehearsed all those arguments during the long and exhaustive channel tunnel debates that took place in this very Room when it was the Grand Committee Room.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para42">Let us come back to the present. My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight) accurately set the scene in respect of harbour revision orders. The matter is not being discussed in the back room of the Dog and Duck, people have not been knocking on our surgery doors about it, and it takes quite some time to explain it. My hon. Friend&#039;s explanation was succinct.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para43">My summary is that the harbour revision orders are seen as a method that has been agreed between the Government and the trust ports sector of avoiding the negative impacts of reclassification on trust ports and of minimising the damage that reclassification would have on their present good governance, which emerged mainly from work done by the Labour Government between 1997 and 2001 and the publication, &quot;Modernising Trust Ports&#151;a Guide to Good Governance&quot;. To put the matter into context, one of the main conclusions of the review was that trust port status was a highly effective system of port management that successfully combined commercial and statutory objectives, and that trust status offered an accountable and open system of port management whose financial and strategic independence should be protected. We are here today to protect that good governance and not to look for solutions to a problem that clearly does not exist.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para44">The report went on to state that reclassification would result in the need for financial reporting to the Department, that it would bring trust ports into the scope of Government public borrowing limits, that it would require scrutiny and approval of port borrowing requirements and that it would possibly even require the return of an annual dividend to the Government. It would be interesting to explore that possibility, especially as the would-be Conservative Government would cut &#163;35 billion out of the general public spending budget and take &#163;2 billion or &#163;3 billion out of transport, which is what we are discussing today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para45">Frankly, no one would have been particularly surprised&#151;I would not have been&#151;if the harbour revision orders had gone through without any

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
objection, debate or rebellion in the streets. The only reason that that did not happen was because politics raised its ugly head. The objections about the port in my constituency&#151;I believe that this is common to all the other trust ports&#151;came from the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and also, in my neck of the woods, from the Conservative leader of Dover district council and the Conservative regeneration spokesman at Kent county council, although those two people have allowed wiser counsel to prevail and have withdrawn their objections to the orders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para46">The objections were lodged so close to a possible general election that I thought and suggested to colleagues that they offered an ideal campaigning opportunity for the Labour party to link them with the spectre of an incoming Conservative Government&#151;moreover, a Government who would privatise and sell off all the trust ports to the highest bidder. I recoiled from that, because I questioned whether my wise and worldly constituents would swallow such a mouthful. They saw what happened in 1995, 1996 and 1997, when the Tories tried to sell the port of Dover.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para47">While I was still pondering whether we could make that link and take on board that great campaign, events intervened and the Conservative shadow Secretary of State&#151;God bless him&#151;came to my constituency and announced to us all that the port of Dover would be privatised and that all the money would be ploughed back into the local community. The Conservatives would build new railways, roads and huge car parks in the middle of Kent, and all the transport problems would dissolve because of changes at the port. He also said that a dividend would be paid to the port to give it some capital growth. How they would do all that is another question, but perhaps one for another debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para48">We do not have to consult the crystal ball, however, to discover whether the Conservatives would put money back into the local community after selling a public asset. All we have to do is read the record. Their very first privatisation was of Sealink. I declare another interest: I was a chief engineer with Sealink when it was sold, as though from beneath our feet, almost a pilot scheme. Sealink was a Dover-based company, although we had vessels all around the coast. Not a penny piece of the proceeds from that privatisation came down to Dover or to any of the ferry ports. Sealink was sold for a song to an American gentleman who cut conditions and crews, and sacked half the work force. That is the nature of privatisations under the Tories, including any future privatisations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para49">That was the first privatisation, so let us consider the last privatisation, of British Rail&#151;at least I think that it was the last. We have rehearsed time and time again what a huge botch-up that was. Indeed, we are still struggling and paying taxpayers&#039; money to correct the difficulties and injustices caused by that privatisation. In east Kent, where I live, Connex has been taken back into Network Rail, which is a publicly-owned company, to redress the balance and get things, shall we say, back on the rails again. Again, what did we see in that privatisation? We saw loss of jobs and futures for many people. That is the reality of privatisation.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 12WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para50">My hon. Friends the Members for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell) and for South Dorset talked about the 1997 election intervening on the Conservatives&#039; plans to sell trust ports. However, it was not only the 1997 election that intervened, but the good people of Dover and the trade unions. I should like to remind people of the marvellous campaign that was fought then. I anticipate that a similar campaign will be fought this time, although we shall have to concentrate it all into the next eight or nine weeks, or between now and whenever the general election comes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para51">At that time, we enjoyed the support of the Dover Harbour Board. The chairman and the directors of the board said what they say now: that privatisation of the port of Dover would not be in the interest of the port&#151;or, they added then, the community. The Dover Harbour Board has always worked well in parallel with the local community, although the two, of course, argue&#151;it is almost second nature for people to complain about the council, the Government or, in this case, the harbour board. However, in the background the community knows that Dover Harbour Board is the biggest employer in Dover bar none and wants it to stay that way. Although the new management has launched efficiency drives, it is trusted to manage the port not only commercially, but fairly and equitably.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para52">In 1995, we enjoyed the support of the local community, with petitions in the street. I cannot remember how many thousands of people queued to oppose the privatisation&#151;after all, they had not been consulted one iota. The change was being imposed on them and delivered from on high, which was just not the way to do things. Our objections enjoyed the support of Dover district council, Kent county council and the town council. Notably, we had the support of the mayor, Councillor Jimmy Hood, my good friend and comrade, who was also then the Speaker of the Cinque Ports. The Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports was the late Queen Mother, and even she thought it appropriate to write to us with words of encouragement in our struggle against privatisation. That is how high the campaign went.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para53">Not to put people in any order or category, Dame Vera Lynn turned out for us in Parliament square, to sing &quot;There&#039;ll be white cliffs over&quot;&#151;no, sorry, to sing &quot;(There&#039;ll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs Of Dover&quot;. I hope that <i>Hansard</i> gets that quotation right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para54">The issue is not something that will be discussed between, perhaps, an incoming Conservative Government, a few transport officials and the port of Dover; rather, it is a massive community concern, which people feel strongly about. People are resistant to change, but it is not just that; as well as feeling that, at the very least, it is better the devil they know, at another level they know that the port of Dover has worked alongside the community since the 1600s, and they do not want that situation upset.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para55">Who would buy the port of Dover? Who showed an interest back in 1995? First, the ferry companies, which had initially resisted the sale, started to ask what it would cost and what they would get out of it&#151;what would be the advantages? As soon as the private ferry companies showed an interest, the port of Dover smelled a rat. Did it want one private operator to run the busiest ferry port in the world, one that Calais totally relied upon? Of course it did not. Therefore, the port of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 13WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Calais became the main interested party. In the port of Dover, there is already a French company, SITA, collecting the refuse and sweeping the streets. It is one thing for the French&#151;some of my best friends come from the other side of the channel&#151;to sweep the streets of Dover; it is another for them to own and run the busiest ferry port in the world. That is why local people were so concerned, and why the campaign reached such great heights. That is what happened in 1995, and it could well happen again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para56">In our local newspapers, people are recalling those dark days, remembering the great campaign that was fought and taking a stand against any movement towards privatisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para57">Lastly, I look back again at 1995, and at the vested interests. Given their experience of mergers, reconstructions and privatisations, the trade unions in Dover, not unexpectedly, lined up in opposition, along with the local Labour party and my local campaign. They included what is now the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, the GMB, the Public and Commercial Services Union and every union that had any connection with the disparate activities that go on in a busy port such as Dover. I have not sounded them all out, but in the past 24 hours I have spoken to all the trade unions at local and regional level, and they are looking forward to the campaign. At last we have what amounts to a recruitment sergeant for the Labour party in Dover. It will be interesting to hear what the hon. Member for Christchurch has to say. If the speeches that we have heard so far in this small gathering are anything to go by, the word isolation enters one&#039;s consciousness.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew22"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. Before I call the next speaker, let me remind hon. Members that I allow a great deal of discretion in debates such as this. However, we are discussing the future of the trust ports. I accept that history has a bearing, but I hope that emphasis will be placed upon the future.
</p>



<a name="50315h01_time4"><h5>10.18 am</h5>


<p><a name="50315h01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Ivan Henderson  (Harwich)</b>  (Lab): I shall talk about my trust port, Harwich Haven Authority. I have worked with it for a number of years, not only as an MP but as a parish councillor, and I know what an excellent job that port authority does for the shipping industry, for the protection of the environment, and for the regulation and safety of the area. We should all be aware that UK ports are responsible for 95 per cent. of the UK trade that goes through them&#151;that is a big contributor to the economy of the United Kingdom. Any proposal that might destabilise the economy, or the shipping industry, should be closely scrutinised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para58">We in Harwich are a bit puzzled by the objection made by the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope). Harwich Haven Authority is responsible solely for pilotage and conservancy and it gets its charges from that. It does not own the port, or any port; it is responsible only for the harbour and for stakeholders within its area. It provides services for shipping using the commercial ports of Felixstowe, Ipswich, Harwich International, Harwich Navyard and Mistley, and boarding and landing services for the rivers Thames, Medway, Blackwater, Colne and Crouch. It does not own any parts of any port, but is purely there for the safety of pilotage and use of the area.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 14WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para59">We cannot understand why the Conservatives would want to privatise this trust port. The Opposition are the only people who object to the harbour revision order for the Harwich Haven Authority trust port. The UK major ports industry has not objected to the port&#039;s applying for that order. We find it interesting that the Tories have an interest in Harwich Haven.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew24"><b> Jim Knight </b> : My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. The hon. Member for Christchurch is the only objector to the harbour revision order for Harwich. All the others have received an objection from the UK Major Ports Group, including Milford Haven, which the hon. Member for Christchurch has inexplicably not objected to. It almost looks as if he has made a mistake and objected to the wrong one.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew25"><b> Mr. Henderson </b> : I agree with my hon. Friend. The puzzle goes even further, because the trust port takes no money from the public purse. It raises all its charges on pilotage, conservancy and commercial shipping, so it is not a burden on the public finances of this country. Every penny of the money raised from commercial shipping goes back into enabling the trust port to fulfil its responsibilities, including environmental protection.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para60">The authority is also responsible to its stakeholders. The chief executive&#039;s team is represented on all the major stakeholder groups&#151;liaison groups, leisure users&#039; committees, the Stour and Orwell estuary management group and the Haven ports and pilotage committee. Its big interest is supporting its stakeholders. We saw the rush to find funding from the Tories over the years when they privatised the infrastructure of the railways, and we saw the decay of that infrastructure because the money went purely to shareholders and not where it should have been going&#151;into safety. My fear is that we will go down the same road&#151;or shipping lane&#151;if ports such as Harwich Haven Authority are privatised. The shareholders would be more interested in what they might get in their pockets than in port emergency plans or environmental aspects of the running of the harbour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para61">Harwich Haven Authority owns only pilots, some piers, oil spill vessels and various other things such as offices. It does not gain any commercial benefits that could possibly go to a privatised company, but only the rights to the estuaries that it serves. It makes sure that those estuaries are served safely and are environmentally protected for the future. The fishermen and leisure craft that use the port work closely with the Harwich Haven Authority. I do not believe that a private commercial operator would want even to discuss the benefits to those users rather than the interests of its shareholders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para62">I ask the hon. Member for Christchurch to consider his objection to the Harwich Haven Authority trust port and to withdraw it. Harwich Haven Authority can then get on with doing the job that it has done so well over many years and provide a good service not only for commercial shipping but for the fishermen and leisure craft in my area, so that they can get on with the job that they are good at. There is no other objection, and no public borrowing requirement. Harwich Haven Authority is a non-profit making organisation and any

&nbsp;<br>

profits that it does make go back into the infrastructure. I ask him to withdraw his objection so that it can apply for the harbour revision order and get on with the job.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew26"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : The Minister would like up to a quarter of an hour to reply to the debate, so if the Opposition spokesmen can divide the time that remains between them, I am sure that will be a happy situation.

<p><a name="50315h01_spnew27"><b> Richard Younger-Ross  (Teignbridge)</b>  (LD): I shall keep my comments fairly brief. I congratulate the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight) on securing the debate. He has today represented the best interest of his constituents&#151;as he always does&#151;in bringing this matter forward. He has highlighted concerns that many of us have about the future of the trust ports&#151;and certainly about their future should the Conservative party ever return to power, not, thankfully, that that is very likely at the moment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para63">The hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Prosser) referred to the Cinq ports. We all, of course, remember from our school history that those were at one time important for the future of England. However, the Cinq ports are still important to Britain. They are important to our imports and it is important to ensure that they are well managed and properly run.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para64">I mention those ports because I think that the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) sees himself, given all the objections that he raised, as the hon. Member for the Cinq ports. The only trouble is that he does not spell the term as we would; he spells it &quot;sink&quot;, because, clearly, his policies would entail the sinking of the trust ports, which are important to the future of shipping in this country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para65">I have the honour to represent a port, the port of Teignmouth&#151;not Tynemouth, although the two are often confused and mispronounced. We will not go into the pronunciation of Devon terms. The port has just had two harbour revision orders. One was made at the request of the Government. It was necessary to re-establish the management of the harbour commission to make it more accountable to the local public.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para66">The Government moves have been much appreciated, because south Devon now has a consultative body for Teignmouth, on which all the other people who have an interest are represented, so that they can put their views to the harbour commissioners. That is a way forward and shows the trust ports that it is not necessary to go down the privatisation route to get the best out of something. It can be done by involving local people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para67">That does not mean that everyone in Teignmouth, Shaldon and the surrounding villages is 100 per cent. ecstatic with everything that the harbour commission wants to do. I wish that it were so. Having listened to other hon. Members I am glad that everyone is so happy with their harbour commissioners and what they do. That is not necessarily so in Teignmouth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para68">At least the advantage of harbour commissioners is that they are local people with an interest in the local area, not shareholders in London, or, as was alluded to

earlier, a foreign company. We can disagree with them and what they say and do. I am the honorary president of the Teignmouth fisherman and waterman association and there are times when that body has arguments with the harbour commissioners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para69">Even amid those arguments&#151;and I speak to those on both sides&#151;there is an understanding that all involved are seeking the best for the town. I seriously question the future of ports if they are to be privatised. I do not see the need to seek private ownership for Dover or other trust ports. The debate is important in providing an opportunity to set that out clearly in the run-up to a general election.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para70">I hope, given what has been said, that what would happen under Labour representation would be similar to what would happen under Liberal Democrat representation, although in the past the Labour party has sought to privatise some sectors, wrongly, in my party&#039;s view. I hope that the Minister will, in the 15   minutes that he will have for his response, state clearly that the future of the ports is safe and that the Labour party will not allow, but will resist and campaign against, the privatisation proposed by the Conservative party.

There have been desperate sideswipes against fictional Conservative policies on public expenditure, but I remind everybody that we are not only committed to matching the spending plans of the Government on transport, but want to go further and encourage the recycling of under-utilised public sector assets into transport infrastructure replacement and regeneration.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Dover, it will be recalled, was one of the few large ports left unprivatised by the last Conservative government, which has been able to point to the undoubted success of many of the trust ports it moved into the private sector during the years before 1997.&quot;</p>

<a name="50315h01_para72">That is why the leader of Dover district council, who expects to be the next Member of Parliament for Dover&#151;as I expect him to be&#151;has so much support for our proposals on the port of Dover. That is because we propose that the money raised from the enormous number of assets that would be released if the port were sold could be used to improve transport infrastructure in and around the port. Even the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Prosser) would recognise that that is vital. Indeed, I understand that it has been recognised, because the hon. Gentleman has tried to seek assurances from Ministers that they will do that work, which has not been started in eight years of Labour Government, without the need to offer the port the chance of a sale.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para73">As for the future of the A20 and the desperate need to improve that road, the hon. Gentleman has been given some assurance by the transport Minister that he could put in a bid to the regional assembly to try to get it prioritised. If I may say so, that is a recipe for further delay and uncertainty. The people of Dover need quick decisions in order to make dramatic improvements to the infrastructure in and around the port of Dover. That is why so much support is being given to the proposals announced by my hon. Friend last week under the heading &quot;A Better Future for Dover and Deal&quot;.

<a name="50315h01_para74">I find it perplexing that at a meeting in Dover on 28   February of the Port Users Group&#151;incidentally, that was the first meeting of that group since the previous March; it is another cause for concern that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
there is almost one year between meetings, and port users feel that they are not being consulted or involved by the Dover Harbour Board in the port&#039;s affairs&#151;a statement was made to the effect that a public inquiry would be held into the harbour revision orders. In the sixth item of business in the minutes of the meeting, it was said that a national public inquiry in June would address the objections made by the UK Major Ports Group and myself to the harbour revision orders for all the major trust ports.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para75">That is the only firm indication that I have received that the Government wish to proceed to a public inquiry. I would welcome an inquiry, but the letter that I received from the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), dated 15 February, in response to a parliamentary question about the Dover harbour revision order, referred to the public inquiry in the following terms:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The applications for the orders have now all been advertised, and objections have been made in respect of all the ports. Where there is an objection to an application for an order which is not withdrawn there must by law be a public inquiry. Unless these could be combined, this might lead to seven inquiries given that there are objections lodged against each Order.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Even if the inquiries might be combined the issues raised by yourself and the UK Major Ports Group are fundamentally points of principle of the type not normally the subject of such inquiries. There must be some doubt on how an inquiry would help resolve matters and thereby justify the costs of setting up and participating in it.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para76">That statement is totally inconsistent, one might think, from what was announced at the meeting of the Dover Harbour Board users&#039; group on 28 February.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para77">One of the grounds for objecting to the Government&#039;s fiddling with the definition of trust ports is that it is a means of trying to circumvent section 10 of the Ports Act 1991. Our view is that if the Government wish to amend or repeal section 10, they should do so by means of primary legislation. They have chosen not to do that in their eight years in office, and if they want to change their policy, they should not try to do so by encouraging the ports in an underhand way to submit harbour revision orders, which could result in a fraud being committed against the national taxpayer. Whether the ports like it or not, the Office for National Statistics defines them as public corporations. In that respect, they are like the Post Office, which must make a return on capital. The Government&#039;s policy, however, is that these bodies should not make a return on capital, despite their being public corporations.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Mr.   Tony McNulty) </b> : I ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect on his use of the word &quot;fraud&quot;. Changing the composition of the board, and the decision to privatise, are by agreement with the ONS. It is certainly not fraud, and I seriously ask him to reflect on his comment and to withdraw it.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew39"><b> Mr. Chope </b> : I am talking about what I would describe as the potential for fraud. At the moment, the national taxpayer has a possible interest in the value of the ports if they are sold voluntarily. I have sought assurance in parliamentary questions that it would be the Government&#039;s policy to revert half the proceeds to the national taxpayer in the event of the harbour revision

orders being put into effect and the ports making a voluntary privatisational sale. I have not yet had a clear and unequivocal statement from the Minister. Perhaps he will give such a statement today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para78">The Minister should also understand, which I am sure he does, that for as long as these ports are public corporations, they should be making a return on capital to the Department for Transport, which is strapped for cash under this Government. That would give the Department more income. I do not understand why the Department does not expect the ports to provide a return on capital.

</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew41"><b> Mr. Chope </b> : I will not give way again because time is very limited. When the Conservative party is in Government, we will continue our policy and keep existing legislation. We will invite proposals and allow ports to become private sector ports if they so wish. I cite the example of Dover, where the local people, to whom the port should be accountable, clearly believe that the port is not performing to its full potential.

</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew44"><b> Mr. Prosser </b> : I hope so too, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Is it customary for a Front-Bench spokesman to focus his speech so closely on another Member&#039;s constituency and to talk so intimately about the issues that affect that Member and his constituency, and not have the courtesy and good grace to give way after he said that he would do so?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew45"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : It is, of course, up to the speaker who has the Floor to decide whether or not to give way. The hon. Gentleman is quite right that the shadow spokesman had said that he would give way, but it is not a matter for the Chair if the Member chooses not to do so.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew46"><b> Mr. Chope </b> : I had already given way to the hon. Member for Harwich. I am trying, in the space of about 15 minutes, to address arguments that have been advanced on several ports.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew47"><b> Mr. Ivan Henderson </b> : On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Surely if the hon. Gentleman is saying that the money should now go to the Department for Transport, he should say what that would mean?

a return on capital and is given privileges without corresponding responsibilities, can compete unfairly against ports already in the private sector. That is the major issue raised by the UK Major Ports Group. It has not yet been answered by the Government, but it may be dealt with in the public inquiries.
</p>



<a name="50315h01_time7"><h5>10.45 am</h5>


<p><a name="50315h01_spmin1"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Mr. Tony McNulty) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight) on securing this debate on the important topic of the future of trust ports, the specifics of future investment plans and the various harbour revision orders. He and our hon. Friends have set out eloquently the benefits that their ports bring to their constituents and the importance of maintaining those activities. We have heard about how the investment programmes, including the infrastructure investment at the port of Tyne, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell) referred, and the important channel dredging at Poole, to quote but two examples, are potentially at risk if we do not progress the harbour orders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para79">It is clear that others see trust ports not as assets for the community, but as potential assets for their friends to plunder. The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) said&#151;entirely uncharacteristically&#151;that the Government had form on fiddling figures, and by implication he deprecated the role and independence of the Office for National Statistics. I am sure that he will reflect on that and write to the ONS accordingly. The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) of course has form on traducing every public body under the sun, so we expect it from him, but we cannot have grown-up and mature Members calling into question the integrity of independent bodies simply to pray in aid rather convoluted political positions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para80">To be fair to the hon. Member for Poole, I have no idea about where he stands in substance on the particular issues, because his was a confused contribution. I think he said that he would like to see Poole remain a trust port for 110 years if the commissioners want it to. That is fine; I understand that much. When I asked for his opinion on the position of his hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch on the order, as the order will disapply privatisation so that he can obtain the future he wants, he waffled and offered no equivocal point either way. I am sure that that will be reflected on back at the ranch.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para81">I am grateful in part for the element of clarity offered by the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross), because it goes slightly further than an inquiry from a member of the merchant fleet who simply sought in all honesty from another Liberal Democrat Member their position on a range of merchant navy issues. The response that he received from the Member was that he had discussed with the party&#039;s policy department&#151;it has a policy department&#151;the various merchant navy issues, but that since there was a lack of up-to-date policy, there was no real detailed information to send to him. The hon. Member for Teignbridge has at least added substance to that. According to the letter, his party needs to debate that area, but it is dependent on local parties putting forward relevant motions. On merchant navy issues, the Member concerned suspects that some people involved with the merchant navy should raise them.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 21WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para82">My hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Prosser) must exhort some of his colleagues in the merchant fleet to pop along to a Liberal Democrat conference, because that is the only way that they will ever hear Liberal Democrat policy on merchant navy ports or any other issue to do with the merchant fleet. The hon. Member for Teignbridge went further than that, and I am enormously grateful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para83">These are the issues of substance. In 2001&#151;rather than 2000, to correct gently my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset&#151;the ONS in its wisdom decided that trust ports are public sector corporations. There has been ongoing discussion about that, because we do not agree with it. The essential point made by the ONS is that the ports are public sector corporations, because through my Department or local governance we control appointments to the board, and through the application of the compulsory privatisation order we control their destiny and future. In discussion with ONS, we have arrived at a position where, if the public sector membership of a board is in the minority and the application of compulsory privatisation is disapplied, it will no longer be a public sector corporation. Everyone knows that we have sought to do that through harbour revision orders, which are an entirely appropriate legislative form, by the way. The notion of those bypassing Parliament is not a sustainable charge; they are not irrevocable orders. Harbour revision orders and the future of the ports can be considered by any Government subsequently. They simply show what is in front of us at the moment.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew50"><b> Jim Knight </b> : If the harbour revision orders were to go through, would they prevent what I understood the hon. Member for Christchurch to mean&#151;although it is difficult, because he would not take an intervention&#151;when he said that if trust ports were to continue, a Conservative Government would raid them for cash for the Exchequer because they want to even things out with private operators and get a return on capital?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew51"><b> Mr. McNulty </b> : Essentially, subsequent to the ONS definition, we revert to the status quo, which, overwhelmingly, is what is desired by those who have spoken. There has to be a statutory public inquiry if the objections prevail. The letter the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), sent to the hon. Member for Christchurch does not contradict that in any way. My hon. Friend made his points precisely to exhort the hon. Gentleman and others to withdraw their objections.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para84">We have heard how farcical it is that there is even an objection in the context of Harwich. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman will offer Milford Haven as the way forward. Perhaps he just missed that port and made a minor mistake, or perhaps there is something magical about Milford Haven that means it has not attracted the hon. Gentleman&#039;s attention. If the objections prevail, there will have to a public inquiry. That, of course, leads to a degree of uncertainty and time, when we would far rather the ports got on with what they want to get on with.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para85">It is not a question of fiddling or the Government having form in the readjustment of figures, but simply a clash between the ONS defining things in one way, and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 22WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
our disagreement with that. The other point that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State made was this: we feel that these are points of substantial principle that are not normally dealt with at a public inquiry, given that ONS told us what would happen if we go one way in terms of composition and disapplying the privatisation element. A public inquiry usually concerns the detail and substance of the way forward in relation to a trust board.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para86">In truth, my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth started to move in the right direction in revealing what really lies behind the position of the hon. Member for Christchurch on Dover. I do not doubt that that will be the position on all trust ports. It must be. Why else would the hon. Gentleman object to the disapplication of privatisation compulsion in the cases of the other ports we are considering in relation to harbour revision orders?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew52"><b> Mr. Ivan Henderson </b> : The other point that the hon. Member for Christchurch made concerned ensuring that more money was available for the Department for Transport from the port authorities. I say to him that the only way it could do that is by cutting back on investment. If it cut back on investment, the ports would not be deepening channels in order to take the largest ships, which would drive those ships to other European ports. If they did not do that they would have to increase the commercial charges on that shipping. The hon. Gentleman should be straight about his party&#039;s policy in what he says today.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew53"><b> Mr. McNulty </b> : The hon. Member for Christchurch got more and more confused and he sounded more and more&#151;if this is offensive, it is meant to be&#151;like a Liberal Democrat, spending the proverbial penny of taxation last time round. Listening to the hon. Gentleman, proceeds from Dover were going to do everything but build a bridge between Dover and Calais, while at the same time they would keep investment going into the port. We have heard time after time from assorted Opposition Members how any surplus should be reinvested. The dredging at Poole happened only because of that investment and because of what borrowing can accrue subsequent to that reinvestment and that record of reinvestment. Unless we hear otherwise&#151;I am not encouraging anyone to go to Dorset to annoy my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset&#151;every port is up for grabs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para87">As I suggested, my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth got to the heart of the issue. The trust port on the port of Tyne has some nice waterfront land, in addition to the 10,000 acres surrounding the trust port in Poole of my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset. Surely that is where Conservative Members will come looking for privatisation. They will not do that to improve the trust ports, or substantially to improve the contribution that the ports make to the assorted communities, which we heard about at length, but to take away the ports and not reinvest the money. If it were otherwise, why are they considering that? Why are assorted Conservative policies being developed in that way?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew54"><b> Richard Younger-Ross </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew55"><b> Mr. McNulty </b> : No, I will not.

&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 23WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para88">Substantial areas of the James report have not yet been seen publicly. Perhaps it says that the Conservatives will privatise all of the trust ports. I do not know. However, let us talk about the harbour revision orders and the wider context of transport finance.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew56"><b> Jim Knight </b> : Will my hon. Friend the Minister clarify that he remains committed to opposing the privatisation of Poole? The hon. Member for Christchurch failed to do that.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew57"><b> Mr. McNulty </b> : We have said clearly that, with the harbour revision orders, we are trying to get back to the status quo where the Government and the trust ports can work together and be confident about the future. We seek to work with trust ports to disapply compulsory privatisations, and seek to recalibrate the balance of public sector figures on the board, so that we can return to the status quo that prevailed before. I say that with certainty. We have no intention of inhibiting investment plans should things go to public inquiries. It is not our role or intention to interfere with or inhibit those investment plans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para89">What I cannot do is give the House an assurance that those investment plans are safe or secure in the event&#151;God help us&#151;of a Conservative Government. Given what the hon. Member for Christchurch said about Dover and his actions in putting up objections to the disapplying of compulsory privatisation, I cannot give any such assurance. It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman did not either.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h01_para90">The Conservatives are supposedly going to match our transport plans. They cannot, by their own lights, do that. They are planning at least &#163;2 billion worth of cuts a la the famous James report. Of that, &#163;800 million or &#163;900 million is already being dealt with through efficiencies, so there is a hole of &#163;900 million straight away. The hon. Member for Christchurch and his colleagues are travelling throughout the country. Every time they are in a hole on transport, they promise something. We have clocked them at about &#163;3.5 billion worth of promises beyond what the transport party is doing. Throw in the &#163;900 million hole and, before the hon. Gentleman has done anything, there is a black hole of nearly &#163;5 billion in transport commitments, let alone anything else.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew58"><b> Mr. Chope </b> : Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h01_spnew59"><b> Mr. McNulty </b> : It is fifty-eight minutes past the hour, so of course I will not. In transport and every other area, nothing that a Conservative spokesperson says on finance can be trusted one iota unless the party comes clean on every aspect of every area of transport spend. Conservative promises are worthless on paper, but if one wants a promise on a road, a bridge or anything else in the coming weeks, ask a Tory spokesman to come. They will promise the earth, the moon and the stars, but they will do absolutely nothing for the future of the trust ports. Trust ports have worked so well. Under a continuing Labour Government, trust ports will continue to work and to contribute to their communities well into the future.

<a name="50315h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Public Transport (Leigh)</h3>

<a name="50315h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>


<p><a name="50315h02_spnew0"><b> Andy Burnham  (Leigh)</b>  (Lab): It is a welcome, if somewhat rare, pleasure to have the chance to focus the attention of the House on the needs of my constituency and, in particular, its appalling public transport provision. I note that the Minister has already been present for one debate and I feel somewhat guilty about detaining him further&#151;he may consider it a kind of detention. He is welcome to write out 100 times, &quot;I must do more for public transport in Leigh,&quot; but I will leave that up to him.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para0">Now is perhaps not the best time in the parliamentary cycle to highlight areas of failure, but as the growing debate about transport priorities in the north-west has gone live, I have felt increasing frustration about the raw deal that my constituents are getting. It cannot be allowed to continue. Last year, a major transport scheme in my constituency, the Leigh-Salford-Manchester guided busway, was one of a number of schemes placed on hold pending a review of transport priorities by the North West regional assembly. In the region, that was seen as a consequence of ongoing negotiations about the Metrolink scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para1">Metrolink does not affect my constituency directly, but I have supported colleagues in the call to get it back on track because I recognise its huge strategic importance to the economic regeneration of our city region. Of course, all the towns in Greater Manchester, Leigh included, have a stake in the continuing success story of city centre Manchester. That is why it is right that my constituents should contribute to Metrolink via their council tax. However, there is a real danger that Greater Manchester&#039;s transport needs will become defined by Metrolink. If the lobbying campaign pays off and the scheme goes ahead&#151;as I have said, I hope that it does&#151;transport officials may feel that Manchester has had its lot and should not come knocking for some time. I hope that the Minister understands and appreciates how unfair we would feel that was.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para2">The Greater Manchester passenger transport authority has long recognised that links west from Manchester are poor and that there is no immediate prospect of the towns along the East Lancashire road leading to Leigh benefiting from Metrolink. For precisely that reason, the &#163;26 million guided busway was long in the planning to compensate Leigh for not being part of Metrolink, not phase 3 but phase 2. The guided busway was expected to be fully operational by this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para3">I sought this debate because I believe that Leigh&#039;s transport needs are becoming lost in the debate about Metrolink. It would seem that the guided busway has been thrown back into the pot of medium to low-priority public transport schemes in the north-west, even though it was given provisional planning and funding approval by the Department for Transport a couple of years ago. There are many things in its favour. It is an innovative use of bus transport, which seems to fit well with current priorities in the Department, and it would cut congestion on one of the north-west&#039;s main arterial routes, the East Lancashire road, which is a severe and growing problem.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 25WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para4">I know the Minister well and I appreciate that he may be subject to more constituency special pleading than most Ministers, but, if he will allow me, I would like to issue something of a challenge to him&#151;he is not normally one to back down from a challenge. I ask him to see whether he can find a town similar in size to Leigh, with a population of roughly 43,000 people, in a metropolitan borough, which has poorer public transport provision than we do. I hope that he will take me up on that challenge, because I genuinely do not believe that he can find such a town. My constituents are getting the rawest deal of any in the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para5">There are some facts to back up the rhetoric. First, Leigh is the largest town in the country without a rail station. In addition, there is no tram station. We do not benefit from Metrolink, as I have said. Buses are the only option. Secondly, as I will show in the course of my remarks, new research from the House of Commons Library shows that, for public transport, Leigh is by a long margin the worst-served town in Greater Manchester.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para6">I understand the need to balance priorities and to focus scarce public transport resources on areas of strategic transport importance, but it is not as though Leigh is a backwater. We are located at the crossroads of the north-west, halfway between Liverpool and Manchester, and we are flanked on one side by the M6, with the East Lancashire road to the south. We are a matter of miles from overdeveloped Warrington. I do not say that to antagonise my Warrington colleagues, but the town has experienced significant development in the past 20 years, and Leigh is well placed to take up some of the extra development that the north-west is experiencing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para7">Public transport resources should go towards easing congestion on strategic routes, but they should also pick out the areas of greatest social deprivation. Leigh provides a perfect case study of the importance of quality transport links in preserving a town&#039;s economic, social and cultural well-being and of what happens when those links are lost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para8">In the &#039;50s and &#039;60s&#151;perhaps you will remember this, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;Leigh was a thriving industrial town, with high employment in coal mining, the textile industry and engineering of many kinds; big employers such as BICC and David Brown Tractors were based there. However, the 1963 White Paper &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot; dealt the town a savage blow whose proportions could not have been imagined at the time. As a result of the Beeching cuts, railway lines passing through Leigh were closed, and all the town&#039;s stations were lost. Since then, the area has suffered huge social and economic decline. The Beeching cuts were the catalyst for the loss of thousands of jobs in traditional industries and at major public facilities such as our accident and emergency department.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para9">That act of savagery towards Leigh by Howard Macmillan&#039;s Conservative Government was compounded by Margaret Thatcher&#151;our town was left cut off and isolated when the worst of the Thatcher Government&#039;s cuts took effect. Following the large job losses that came with the closure of the coal mines and other heavy industries, people were simply unable to find alternative employment; indeed, they really would have had to get on their bikes to do so, because no other transport was available. A double whammy was landed on our town.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 26WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para10">The combination of the lack of transport and the loss of employment knocked the stuffing out of Leigh, and the lack of quality transport links has held back our recovery ever since. We are now beginning to see signs of that recovery&#151;the Wigan borough has its lowest unemployment rate for a generation&#151;but the travel-to-work survey in the 2000 census shows that public transport has played little or no part in that. People&#039;s only option is to use buses, which simply cannot be relied on to get them to work on time in the main areas of employment: Manchester, Warrington and Bolton.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para11">I should say at this point that in Jim Stones Coaches, Leigh has the best local bus operator in the whole of Greater Manchester, if not the north-west. Jim and his team have provided a first-class service since deregulation and they are thoroughly committed to serving the people of the town. I do not know where we would be without the service that they have provided.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para12">To return to the main issue, however, the 2000 census shows that Leigh residents must rely on cars far more than the residents of any of the other 16 towns in Greater Manchester, with all the extra costs that that puts on people in low to medium-paid work. Only 7.9   per cent. of people aged between 16 and 74 in employment in Leigh use public transport to get to work, which is an appallingly low figure. If the Minister doubted my rhetoric earlier, that figure tells its own story about the quality of public transport in Leigh. Those cars jam the East Lancashire road, the M62 and the A49 junction at Winwick every morning.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para13">As I said, I have independent verification of my argument from the House of Commons Library. I commissioned from it a survey of public transport provision in the 16 biggest towns of Greater Manchester. It confirmed what many people knew: Leigh is the only town without an overground train station or a Metrolink tram service. To add insult to injury, even I was shocked to find that Leigh came bottom in the list of towns ranked according to quality of bus links to central Manchester, with only three frequent services. The Library report states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It is clear that Leigh&#039;s bus services do not make up for its lack of tram and train services. Leigh has the smallest number of frequent public transport services with the city centre on each mode&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para14">The report concludes that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;it is difficult to argue against the assertion that the public transport service between Manchester and Leigh is poorer than with any other similar sized town&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para15">With the exception of Atherleigh way, opened in the mid-1980s and funded by the old Greater Manchester council, Leigh has not had any major transport investment since Beeching did his damage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para16">The Minister will probably be pleased that I am coming to the end of what he may regard as a long whinge, but I make no apology for it. What I have said needs to be said, and the voice of my constituents needs to be heard, because the current state of affairs is not acceptable. In conclusion then, what am I asking from the Minister and from transport officials, both in our region and in Whitehall? Longer term, Leigh needs access to rail or tram services to the east and west&#151;to Liverpool and to Manchester. We are strategically well located, on the main crossroads between the two great towns of the north-west. In the interim, however, I hope that my hon. Friend will consider a number of specific requests.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 27WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para17">First, I hope that my hon. Friend and his officials will reflect on what I have said and let me know whether they think Leigh is fairly served. I would appreciate a response to the challenge of finding an equivalent-sized town that is more poorly served by transport. As an aside, I also ask the North West regional assembly, which has been instructed by the Department to review transport priorities in the region, to consider what I have said as a contribution to its consultation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para18">Secondly, I hope that the Minister will clear up the outstanding planning issues affecting the Leigh guided busway as soon as possible, or at least give a commitment to do so. The problem is holding things up, and resolving a number of what I understand to be minor issues would help us to make progress. The Minister may recall that the Secretary of State gave the scheme planning approval in principle some time ago, pending work on other issues, which required further evidence. I am afraid that there is a blight on Leigh and our area in the north-west in that we have, it seems, a large number of great-crested newts, which hold back human progress in the area. I hope that the Minister can say that the issues surrounding the protection of the newts have been satisfactorily dealt with.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para19">Thirdly, there is a genuinely unanswerable case for the Department, working with the Greater Manchester passenger transport executive, to find an immediate funding solution for the busway. Given that provisional funding approval has already given and that it was part of the deal for Metrolink phase 2, it is not fair that the busway is now pitched back into the pot with the other schemes in the north-west competing for funding. The busway had already been picked out as a priority for progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para20">Fourthly, I hope that the Minister will take an urgent look at our proposal for a rail station in the former mining village of Golborne. My right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) and I are utterly convinced that a rail station there would be a well used feature of strategic importance in the region. Such a station would be our best hope of bringing a rail service to the Leigh and Lowton areas in the not-too-distant future. However, we have experienced great frustration in getting the component parts of the rail industry to engage positively with the case that we have made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para21">Such a station would be right on the edge of a major sporting facility, Haydock race course, which attracts thousand of visitors every year&#151;I know, because my house is literally next door and they queue up at the end of my drive. I do not call for a station there because of my nimby considerations. The place in question is nestled in the corner between the M6 and the East Lancs road, and there is a huge sporting facility on our doorstep, so it would make great sense to have a station there. Will the Minister see whether he can get more positive engagement from transport officials on that issue?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para22">Ironically, Merseytravel has shown more interest in the Golborne station proposal. It will soon launch a Golborne rail link bus service between the potential site at Golborne and Newton-le-Willows station in Merseyside, in the hope of building a market for rail 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 28WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
travel in the Golborne area. Merseytravel deserves help and encouragement from other parties, not least the GMPTE, to approach the proposal with a will to make it succeed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para23">As I acknowledged, my speech has been something of a whinge, but I ask hon. Members to imagine sitting where I am and having to talk about public transport in Leigh; I would be laughed out of court if I claimed there had been all kinds of positive progress. The situation is not good enough and it needs to improve. I am raising the stakes today and saying that for the next few years I will keep on banging the drum until there have been real improvements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para24">Until my constituents have real alternatives to the car to enable them to get to their place of work I shall fight tooth and nail any proposal for a congestion charge in Greater Manchester.
</p>



<a name="50315h02_time1"><h5>11.16 am</h5>


<p><a name="50315h02_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Mr. Tony McNulty) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) on securing the debate. When he puts his comments so eloquently and passionately, to reflect what he sees as the reality in his constituency, I do not see it as a whinge-fest. I see it as the duty of a committed constituency MP.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para25">I can answer part of my hon. Friend&#039;s query about whether there are people in a worse position by comparing Leigh, with its population of 43,000, with Corby, which has a population of some 50,000 and does not have a railway station. I will leave to one side the rest of the question. The Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Phil Hope), has let me know a few times in recent years that Corby is probably the largest town with no station.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para26">I agree with the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh about the geography of Leigh and Wigan metropolitan borough council, by which Leigh is covered. I accept his points about the town&#039;s being on the western fringe of Greater Manchester. As to Metrolink, broadly speaking, everyone certainly accepted that it would be a long time before Metrolink or trams came to either Bolton or Wigan on the western side of the conurbation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para27">One of the key ways in which we shall deal with public transport is through investment&#151;sustained investment. Over the next three years we shall invest about &#163;870   million in the north-west. That is a major investment. The investment that we are allocating to each region will, it is to be hoped, reflect their economic and environmental objectives. By the bye, over the past three years local authorities in the north-west received more investment than those in any other region, through the local plan process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para28">In December we announced funding of more than &#163;620 million over the next three years for north-west local authorities. Of the &#163;225 million allocated for 2005&#150;06, &#163;92 million was for Greater Manchester, including about &#163;43 million for small-scale integrated transport schemes of less than &#163;5 million, for transport improvements to ease congestion, increase safety and create a better environment. Wigan council, the local authority responsible for my hon. Friend&#039;s area, was given an allocation of &#163;4.109 million.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 29WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para29">As I said, Manchester recognises that Metrolink is perhaps not as inextricably linked to all transport spend throughout the authority&#039;s area as my hon. Friend suggests, but I understand why he said what he did. The Department has helped Wigan to invest a total of &#163;4.1 million in schemes funded from the Greater Manchester transport infrastructure fund. That fund was set aside by the Government and Greater Manchester in recognition of the fact that Bolton and Wigan would wait a long time for links to be provided by Metrolink. My hon. Friend will know that in February the Department agreed to provide &#163;3.5 million for the fund in 2005&#150;06 and a further &#163;3.5 million in 2006&#150;07. We shall discuss with the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority, which will match that funding, how the money should be spent in Bolton and Wigan. I know that they will not get the large-scale investments that my hon. Friend thinks are needed for Leigh and the borough of Wigan to secure more public transport, but the sums are, in part, recognition of the fact that Metrolink will not come soon to Bolton or the borough of Wigan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para30">My hon. Friend needs to recognise that there have been some advances, albeit limited in his terms. In 2003&#150;04, Greater Manchester spent nearly &#163;6 million on bus priority schemes and &#163;1.6 million on bus infrastructure schemes, implementing both the south-east Manchester multi-modal study quality bus corridor and the Leigh-Bolton QBC. Apparently I went on the A6 QBC on one of my recent visits to Manchester. I am trying to remember when and in what context, but I cannot. The Leigh-Bolton QBC was completed in 2003 at a cost of some &#163;4.8 million, and has increased passenger reach by 16 per cent., earning time savings of between 10 and 13 per cent.&#151;typically six to nine minutes&#151;and the corridor has brought improved facilities and environmental improvements to Atherton town centre.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para31">My hon. Friend will know of the night bus initiative that connects Manchester city centre to Leigh. Many of those late night journeys are now being run on a commercial basis. Some 1,700 passengers a week use the night bus. He will know, too, of the yellow school bus scheme, in which Wigan has participated, which has introduced American-style yellow school buses to serve Standish high school, among others. I understand that there are plans to purchase additional buses to serve St.   Mary&#039;s Roman Catholic high school in the constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para32">I know that the biggest disappointment for my hon. Friend is the Leigh guided busway. That was one of the major schemes submitted as part of this year&#039;s local transport annual performance round. The proposal by Greater Manchester passenger transport executive to build a new guided busway between Leigh and Ellenbrook is the subject of a planning application to the Secretary of State for an order under the Transport and Works Act 1992. The order, if made, will give GMPTE the statutory powers that it requires to implement the scheme, entirely separately, as my hon. Friend suggests, from the funding process. My hon. Friend is aware that the Department had to defer consideration of that application until GMPTE had provided some important additional information on the environmental impact of the scheme, in particular more detailed survey work on the great-crested newt, which is a protected species.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 30WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para33">Last October, GMPTE provided a substantial amount of further information, which, as part of the planning process, had to be sent to other interested parties for comment. The process of exchanging written representations on the new information concluded last month. Because the case is still awaiting statutory determination, I am unable to discuss its merits, as my hon. Friend will appreciate. However, I can assure him that every effort will be made to bring the matter to a conclusion as soon as possible. I hope to be able to make a decision once all the evidence presented for and against the proposals has been carefully considered, all the necessary work has been done by GMPTE on the great-crested newt and other elements, and all the exchange and representation between assorted parties as part of that process has taken place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para34">The report is now, in its entirety, with the Department for Transport, and I shall ensure that, having weighed the evidence carefully, we make a decision at the earliest possible opportunity. The other half of the equation, as my hon. Friend suggests, is the funding of the scheme.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h02_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that commitment. As I understand it, the information was submitted some time ago. He probably does not know the date of any Dissolution of this place any more than I do, but I hope that I can prevail on him to say that it would make sense to make the decision sooner, rather than later, given that there may be some interruption.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. McNulty </b> : Given that it is a statutory, or quasi-statutory, process, I cannot give any fixed assurances about a timetable. Suffice it to say that when I go back to the Department, I will try informally to elicit what stage we are at and when we can anticipate a decision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para35">Although I will bear in mind my hon. Friend&#039;s points about alacrity, I have no idea about Prorogation, Dissolution or anything else. I will not promise to do or not do something in light of a date about which I, my hon. Friend and even the enlightened Deputy Speaker know nothing except what we read in the papers and idly speculate about with colleagues over cups of tea.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para36">My hon. Friend will know that as part of the spending review 2004, and bearing in mind the Government&#039;s desire for greater regional involvement in privatisation, we have had to review the relative priority of major local transport schemes. I would not say as abruptly as my hon. Friend that the Leigh guided busway has been lost in the fog and smoke of the debates about Metrolink, but clearly as we move to greater regional devolution there will be finite pots of funding for each region. Perhaps there will be some additional strategic elements but, as ever, politics is the language of priorities, whether decisions are made regionally or at the centre. I unpick my hon. Friend&#039;s argument a little bit, none the less I understand the points that he made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para37">Difficult decisions have had to be made about the priorities of investment proposals. Let me make it very clear: we certainly recognise the merits of the Leigh guided busway scheme. That is precisely why it was given provisional approval in the first place. There is no question about the merits of the project, but since then the cost of the total quality bus contract scheme has gone up significantly, with Government contributions increasing by &#163;17 million to &#163;42.3 million. Given the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 31WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
other funding pressures in the north-west, it has not been possible to prioritise the scheme for funding in the current spending review period. That decision can, and should, be regularly revisited. The scheme has not been cancelled and we will consider it again in light of advice on priorities received from the region.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para38">It is important to say that in the three-year spending review and the last local transport plan settlement, an image was formed&#151;I understand why&#151;that if projects were not set running this year, they would somehow be put to the back of the queue, with no consideration until post 2008 and the next round of the comprehensive spending review. That is not accurate, as there will be any amount of to-ing and fro-ing, slippages and other changes in the regional pot and the projects that have been prioritised as we look at the world in 2005. It is incumbent on us and the region to review the regional prioritisation list on a year-by-year basis, even within the curtilage of the three-year spending programme. That is not to say in any coded way, &quot;The money&#039;s there, don&#039;t worry about it&quot;, but things are not as stark as has often been suggested since the 1 December regionally focused settlement. They are not as stark as my saying, &quot;Leigh guided busway has no chance until the next spending review.&quot; The position is far more fluid than that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h02_para39">I accept much of what my hon. Friend says about Leigh and Wigan borough council being a poorer relation in transport provision for Greater Manchester. I accept his point about the peculiarities of Leigh and Wigan, given that they are on the western periphery of Greater Manchester and sit almost squashed between Merseyside, Warrington and Manchester&#151;the crossroads to everywhere but with contacts to nowhere. I accept those points broadly, and I will look further into the points that he raises.

<a name="50315h03_head0"><h3 align=center>Analogue Television Switch-off</h3>

<a name="50315h03_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50315h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Steve Webb  (Northavon)</b>  (LD): I wanted to secure a debate on something about which I know nothing, for a change, and I thought that I would start by lowering expectations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para0">I am concerned about the welfare of pensioners and their pensions, which is how I became interested in this subject. I got to thinking about how there are many pensioners, particularly the older ones and those who are housebound, whose televisions are a very important part of their lives. In a few years, their telly will not work, and they might have to find the money to sort out the problem. Switching off the analogue signal might cause considerable distress if it is not handled well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para1">I started to become more parochial about the issue when I discovered that we in the west of England are not the first round of guinea pigs, but are in year two of Ofcom&#039;s four to five-year planned roll-out of the switch-off or switchover&#151;call it what you will&#151;from analogue to digital. My first move is to make a special plea on behalf of the west of England. I should say that not only do I not know anything about this subject, but I do not know my party&#039;s policy on it, either, so I have been doing some free thinking.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Don Foster  (Bath)</b>  (LD): Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : No. I have come up with one or two ideas that I have not come across in any of the literature on the subject, so I thought that I would float them now, as this is the time in the electoral cycle for free thinking and radical ideas, and see where we go from there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para2">Let me start with a special plea for the west of England. The latest regional figures for those who have digital television and those who have not suggest that the south-west, which incorporates the west of England, where I live and which I represent, as does my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), had the lowest take-up of digital television. That was true a year or so ago, and I imagine that that pattern has not changed greatly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para3">I understand that technical considerations have dictated the sequence of analogue switch-off, or digital switch-on, to some extent, but I wonder how that could have been modified to reflect the fact that switching off the analogue signal in part of the country where digital take-up is low is more of an upheaval and causes more of a problem than it would in an area in which most people already have digital television.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para4">Does the Minister plan to modify the sequence of switching off the analogue signal and moving to digital, or does he plan to advise Ofcom that there should be a modification of the sequence, so that parts of the country in which digital is more widespread would switch off the analogue signal first, giving the rest of us in the west a chance to catch up, which I imagine would be a less painful experience for everyone?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 33WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para5">What about the position of pensioners and, more generally, people who are isolated? Ofcom&#039;s document, &quot;Driving Digital Switchover&quot;, states that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the transitional cost of conversion&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para6">in other words, buying a set-top box, and sorting out the aerial or the VCR&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;may remain a significant barrier for some households and risks excluding them from TV after switchover.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para7">That is my concern. I would be interested to hear the Government&#039;s response.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para8">The consumer expert group states in the executive summary of its report to, I presume, the Minister, in October 2004:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Although these issues are now well-known and well-understood, the Government&#039;s existing policy does not ensure that they are addressed as part of the switchover timetable.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para9">In a sense, this is four years too early for the west, but in another sense we need to get moving now, and any indications that the Minister can give of how he plans to tackle these obvious problems would be appreciated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para10">What is the nature of the problem for elderly and isolated people? As I say, television might be an integral part of their lives. They might have no real interest in CBeebies or other digital channels, and might be perfectly happy with what they have. They want to know why they will have to pay what will, by then, be &#163;20 or &#163;30 for a set-top box, and get someone to fix the aerial and sort out the VCR, if they have one&#151;charges for which might run into several hundred pounds. Although it is difficult to get reliable estimates of how many people would need, say, a rooftop aerial, I know from first-hand experience that when my family went digital not so long ago, we had to have a man up on the roof because our aerial was not good enough. With the basic state pension at &#163;80 a week, the cost of a box, a VCR and an aerial could amount to two or three weeks&#039; pension in a bad case, and perhaps even more. I would therefore be interested to hear from the Minister how far the Government have got in their thinking.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para11">Some of the documents that I have read refer to the groups covered by the free TV licence, and the suggestion is that the over-75s and the registered blind might be the main group. Are those the parameters that the Minister is considering? Clearly, that would cover a lot of the people I am concerned about, but there are other vulnerable groups, as the Minister will well know.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para12">In its November 2004 report, the independent consumer panel came up with a couple of suggestions, as I am sure the Minister is well aware. The panel suggested a couple of schemes to ease the switchover to digital, and they would cost between &#163;250 million and &#163;400 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para13">This, I guess, is where I do my radical free thinking, although it might be boring and hackneyed for all I know; however, I have never read anything along these lines before. Obviously, the spectrum freed up by the switch-off of the analogue signal is of some value, although I have no idea what the figure is. One can speculate about it, and my hon. Friend the Member for Bath may share it with us if he should catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Clearly, it would be helpful to have the Government&#039;s latest thinking on the valuation of that spectrum and some indication of whether the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 34WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
first claim on it might not go to the very people who have, effectively, suffered to make it available. If the elderly and the vulnerable cannot go on watching their old telly without spending some money, and the Government benefit to the tune of, perhaps, billions of pounds, the first claim should go to those who made that possible. If people have to pay, and the Government take all the proceeds, it will almost be taxation by the back door.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Don Foster  (Bath)</b>  (LD): Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend out of his misery. He will no doubt not be surprised to hear that there are huge variations in the estimates, but the most recent estimate is that about &#163;460 million per annum could be achieved.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : I am grateful, as ever, to my hon. Friend. That suggests that the schemes proposed by the independent consumer panel would swallow a substantial proportion of that money in the first year, so it would be helpful to get the Minister&#039;s thoughts on that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para14">The second set of issues relates to people making buying decisions about equipment now. I am still struck by the fact that the vast bulk of television equipment that people are buying is non-digital. Some of those who understand these things far better than I do have suggested to me that people should not do that and that it is not necessarily such a bright idea, because the digital technology will evolve. I am open to that suggestion, but I wonder how many people are buying cheap sets from the bottom end of the market, which will become obsolete unless they pay almost as much as they did for the telly to get them sorted out. The Government now have a sticker system to give people a bit of a clue when they buy a telly, but I still think that awareness out there is very low.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew5"><b> Brian White  (Milton Keynes, North-East)</b>  (Lab): One problem with the wider debate is that people have talked about digital televisions, rather than digital access to homes. It is not the television that causes the problem, but the access mechanism. If the hon. Gentleman were to focus on that, we might resolve a number of the problems that he is highlighting.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : I accept that distinction. However, householders who buy a cheap portable television to be used in a teenager&#039;s bedroom are buying equipment that, as it stands, will not receive a digital input. Then, a few years down the line, because they had not really caught on to it, they will have to go back to the shop to buy a box, or to get the set connected to a box elsewhere in the house. Consumers need to be made aware of such things now, so that they can make a more informed choice. I am aware, as a consumer, that I do not begin to understand it, and I have some interest in the subject. I wonder how many people will be similarly affected.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para15">I have seen estimates&#151;perhaps the Minister can clarify the matter&#151;that as many as 2 million set-top boxes will be of no use when the new regime comes in, but I am not sure exactly why. That raises questions about the decisions that people are making now and how informed they are, and about how much warning they will get and whether the Government&#039;s publicity is being regionally focused.

<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 35WH</b>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para16">I turn to some of the other issues. My constituency is not particularly rural, but because of the contours of the land parts of it cannot currently receive a digital signal. I understand that about 25 per cent. of Great Britain cannot do so. Again, I hope that the Minister will explain a little more about the transition process, as people from Thornbury and Charfield in my constituency have written letters to me, angry because they are having to pay for the BBC&#039;s digital output but cannot receive it. I understand that the digital signal cannot be boosted until the analogue signal is out of the way, so I could write back to them saying that things will be fine once the analogue signal has gone&#151;but we cannot guarantee it. I know that I can visit a Freeview website and enter my postcode to get information on that, but I wonder how certain it will be. In other words, what will be the sequence of events for my constituents in Thornbury, who cannot receive digital? Will they buy a box once they know that BBC 2 and the other channels are to be switched off, not knowing for sure until D-day whether it was worth buying? It is possible that some will buy the equipment&#151;they will have been told that the chances are that it will be fine&#151;who, when the moment comes, will be among the 0.5 per cent. or whatever percentage it is who still cannot receive a digital signal after the change.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew7"><b> Mr. John Whittingdale  (Maldon and East Chelmsford)</b>  (Con): The hon. Gentleman says that a proportion of his constituents cannot get digital, but that is not true. They may not be able to get a digital terrestrial television signal, but they can receive a satellite transmission. Although they may not wish to subscribe and pay a monthly fee, it is possible to get Freesat&#151;although one has to look rather hard to discover how to go about getting it. Digital is available now.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : Indeed. It is one of those occasions when one uses language loosely because one is not used to the field of expertise. As the hon. Gentleman said, people could take up the satellite option&#151;it costs in the region of &#163;150 to install&#151;but under existing planning regulations, people in some parts of my constituency would not be allowed to erect a dish. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point; people have a choice, but they have decided not to exercise it, and will thus be at a disadvantage when compared with those who can get digital terrestrial television.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para17">Clearly a number of groups are affected. I have already mentioned the elderly, people with poor English and those with particular disabilities. The work done on the position of disabled people and other vulnerable people by the Ofcom consumer panel is fascinating and thorough. I am used to a social security system in which one takes fairly large categories of people and passports benefits to the entire group. The most interesting conclusion of the consumer panel is that such a blanket approach is not the way forward. Instead, it talks of a more community-based, bottom-up approach, using local organisations. Although I have much philosophical sympathy for that sort of approach, there is always a danger of its being piecemeal and patchy, with people being missed out.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 36WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para18">Again, I would be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s thoughts. Should we have a blanket approach for the over-75s, with local initiatives to pick up other vulnerable groups? What does he have in mind? The digital take-up is very poor among the over-75s. The 2003 figures show that only 16 per cent. of them had taken it up. More significant is its poor take-up among low-income households. I had assumed that the converse might be true. I assumed, for instance, that lone parents needed television, perhaps to keep the children quiet. Indeed, it is an integral part of life for many lone-parent families. I therefore imagined that digital would have a high penetration among low-income families, but the statistical evidence is to the contrary, showing that poorer households tend not to have taken up digital.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para19">I want to mention a couple of other bits and pieces that concern me. I see that a number of hon. Members are in the Chamber, because it is an important issue for us all. Clearly, multiple-dwelling units, and the implications for people living in those, whether public sector or private sector&#151;I strongly suspect that the latter will be more of a problem&#151;present an issue for consideration. We can, in a sense, probably sort out the public authorities with a bit of kick up the backside, but getting private landlords to sort things out might be more difficult. I should be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s thoughts on that.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bill O&#039;Brien  (Normanton)</b>  (Lab): Has the hon. Gentleman seen the briefing from Astra GB, which states that a substantial number of local authorities and social landlords will not allow a dish on their dwellings? The hon. Gentleman made a point about receiving the changeover via disk, but that will be denied to the relevant tenants unless there is a change in the planning procedures and the attitudes of some social landlords. Does the hon. Gentleman perceive any such change in the process, along the way?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. My officials have just passed me a note, which enables me to tell hon. Members that so far only 14 per cent. of local authorities&#151;but that is one in seven&#151;and nearly one in three registered social landlords do not allow their tenants to install satellites. I suspect that we can deal with the public sector, but we need to get on with that, because such things will take a long time. Many local authorities may ask, &quot;Is this a top priority for us this year? We will put it back a year.&quot; Their tenants will be at a disadvantage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para20">I want to do a further bit of special pleading. The documents that I have read focus on the first television in the household. I understand that, but I think that they dismiss slightly too glibly the point about the second or third telly, in the teenager&#039;s bedroom, with a portable aerial; if the Government are to obtain political consensus, and the electorate&#039;s acceptance, for the change, they need to reach out to a much larger group of people who may already have digital on the main television but will still see it as a serious inconvenience and be resistant to it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para21">I gather that work on televisions with portable aerials and so on is continuing, but my political sense leads me not to dismiss that aspect of the matter by saying, &quot;Well, frankly, who cares? If they have two televisions they are 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 37WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
probably well enough off and that does not really matter.&quot; If we are trying to overcome resistance on the matter&#151;and I suspect that the Secretary of State, or her successor, whoever that will be, will have to do that&#151;we shall need to deal with that issue, to avoid some of the obstacles that might arise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para22">My priority is the elderly, the vulnerable and the isolated. According to a horrific statistic in research funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, one in nine people aged over 65 see family or neighbours less than once a month. Someone living in such isolation is not likely to have a friendly son-in-law who will say, &quot;You plug this in here, and sort out that.&quot; There will be no substitute for people going into people&#039;s houses in significant numbers and just sorting things out. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that that is what is planned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para23">I think that this debate will run and run, but I wanted to put down a marker; to clarify whether there will be a resolution of the problems of the parts of my constituency and my hon. Friends&#039; constituencies that do not at present have digital or terrestrial digital; and to ask about the present low digital penetration in the west of England, and why that is in the earlier batch, when that makes life more difficult; but primarily to ask about isolated, elderly and vulnerable people and to seek assurances that they do not have anything to worry about and that the Government plan to tackle those important problems.
</p>



<a name="50315h03_time1"><h5>2.19 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50315h03_spnew11"><b> Brian White  (Milton Keynes, North-East)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr.   Webb) on raising this important subject and coming at it from a different angle, which does not repeat the tired old arguments that we have heard before. I had intended only to contribute to the debate in an intervention about a constituency issue, but in the light of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments I shall make a few more remarks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para24">My constituency problem is that the cable provider there, NTL, has an analogue cable and refuses to switch to digital cable, thereby denying my constituents access to digital television. NTL inherited that from British Telecom, but a range of my constituents will not be able to switch to digital except&#151;as the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) says, and as I have done&#151;by using satellite digital. That is our only option. We cannot use Freeview because the Sandy Heath transmitter does not reach us, so our only option is satellite. How are we to stop the monopolistic practice that denies my constituents their switchover to digital if NTL, which has a monopoly in the area, will not provide a switchover to digital and the Government&#039;s policy is about competition between platforms&#151;although I would argue that it needs to be within platforms as well?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Whittingdale </b> : Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in Westminster, where I am&#151;no doubt many hon. Members have this experience&#151;NTL has taken over the old Westminster cable franchise, which does not offer television at all? Every week, I receive fliers through my letter-box inviting me to subscribe to NTL&#039;s cable 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 38WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
television services, only to be told when I try to do so that I cannot, and that there is no prospect of my being able to do so in the near future.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew13"><b> Brian White </b> : When the previous Conservative Government brought cable television into this country, the sweetener was the use of telephones, which took telephone customers away from British Telecom. Cable TV was not the money-spinner; that was the telephones. That did not apply to the two cable networks that remained with BT&#151;Westminster and Milton Keynes&#151;because BT was not going to nick phones from itself. Therefore, there was no incentive in those two areas for the cable companies to invest. That is part of the problem that I have identified through my constituents. It goes back to the way in which the Conservative Government set up cable companies as monopolies in local areas, and it is a fundamental problem. If one believes in competition, one should not create local monopolies. I am not surprised that the Conservative Government did that, but I shall leave the issue aside for now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para25">That was the history, and the hon. Gentleman is right that there is a similar problem in Westminster. So how do we move forward if the cable company will not do so? To be fair to NTL, it had a financial problem, but even so, how are we to achieve digital switchover? That is an issue for the Government. I ask in relation to the cable company, but the principle could apply to others as well: if it refuses, will we force it?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para26">Consider the history of ONdigital, and the collapse of ITV&#039;s digital service. One of the assumptions that was made was that the aerial problem was manageable. It is not. Many aerials in the country need a massive upgrade. The technology boost to the signal has improved matters, as has the restriction on the number of channels on Freeview, but there is still a fundamental problem with the quality of the aerials and how we are to ensure that cowboys do not move into the market and cause more problems. The real issue for the Department is how it will regulate the switchover. I know that that has been identified in the programmes, but it is a key issue that should be highlighted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para27">There are new technologies. For example, in Finland, Nokia is experimenting with TV on mobiles. When we talk about digital TV, we tend to talk about the television box. That causes a lot of the problems, which is why I have said that we should be talking about digital access. Then wireless networks within the home to cover the remaining televisions, whether via the computer or via the analogue television, would not matter as long as the digital access point was correctly installed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para28">There is a problem in the United States, where the regulatory authority is mandating certain television companies in relation to the way in which the televisions are designed and manufactured. I hope that the Minister will avoid the type of problem that the film industry has forced on American TV with the copying restrictions on high-definition digital TV.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para29">Astra has been referred to. One of the items in its letter was covenants. In my city, every new home that was built had a covenant that did not allow an aerial. It now turns out that that covenant is unenforceable. Anybody who has challenged it can get away with things, because English Partnerships and the Government cannot legally enforce the covenant that prevents satellite aerials. So, there is hope for some of my constituents yet.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 39WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para30">It is also interesting to note the way in which television viewing is changing. Children are watching less TV and using broadband and other technologies more. One of the dangers is that, when we set out on the programme of digital switchover, the patterns of TV usage were completely different from today&#039;s. The changing nature of TV watching needs to be brought into the plan more. That change will accelerate in the coming years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para31">Why did colour TV come in so quickly and so well? It was because of Radio Rentals. People rented their TV and could get the upgrades without worrying about having to spend money on the TV. It was part of the rental contract. Where are the rentals for broadband and digital TV? It is a market that an entrepreneur could step into and fill. We need to recognise why things worked well in the past, because we could apply that to the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para32">There is also an issue about the speed of change and technological developments. The UK is ahead of the game on the issue and has a good news story to tell. The digital plan that the Department and Ofcom have put forward identifies most of the problems and identifies ways forward. Issues such as the one that the hon. Member for Northavon raised, of pensioners, need to be addressed. They can be addressed. There is time to do so. He is right that we will get there if we start planning now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para33">The Government programme is right, but there is one small danger, which is that if Ofcom and the Government disagree, Ofcom, as an independent regulator, has the power to ignore Government policy. That is an important point, which the Department needs to bear in mind. Overall, we are ahead of the game and what is happening in Europe.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Don Foster </b> : I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way just before he ends his speech. I do not want to introduce a sour note into the debate, but he said clearly that he thought the plans of both Ofcom and the Government were, largely, to be welcomed. What does he think the Government&#039;s plans are? One of my real concerns is a lack of leadership from the Government on the issue. They seem to be being driven largely by Ofcom, the BBC and others and do not seem to have a clear line themselves.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew15"><b> Brian White </b> : Given that we set Ofcom up to deal with such matters, I think it is perfectly reasonable to rely on its expertise. The purpose of Ofcom was to deal with convergence. We have spent a large amount of time in this Parliament talking about issues of convergence, for example introducing the Ofcom Bill and the Communications Bill. Much of the discussion of those Bills was about how to achieve digital switch-off. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford and I had a few battles in Committee, a large number of which were about this issue. When setting up Ofcom, one of the key objectives was to give it the task to achieve that. The Government should be criticised for setting up a body such as Ofcom, telling it to get on with it and then not doing the job themselves.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para34">The Department has given an overall strategic direction by setting the dates for digital switchover, which was the key task that many of us were pushing it 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 40WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to do. It is the right way forward for Ofcom to be considering those detailed issues. I am sure that we will debate the issue again and again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para35">In summary, there are a number of issues. I fear that the speed of change in this area is not being recognised. If we do not recognise the speed of change of technology, the way in which people are viewing TV and the way in which the industry is changing but instead think in the old ways, we will suffer from the problems that have been identified. We need to recognise the speed of change.
</p>



<a name="50315h03_time2"><h5>2.29 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50315h03_spnew16"><b> Mr. Alan Reid  (Argyll and Bute)</b>  (LD): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) on securing the debate. It is on a subject that I, like him, am coming to for the first time and that, clearly, will be of enormous importance to all our constituents in a few years. In my area, Scottish Television is not due for conversion until 2009. That is two years after the guinea pigs in the borders. However, because of the vast empty spaces in the constituency, plenty of problems still arise in the highlands that do not arise in other parts of the    country. For example, large swathes of the constituency&#151;I suspect more than half of the population of Argyll and Bute&#151;cannot receive Freeview via their set-top boxes at the moment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para36">One of the Government&#039;s guidelines says that, before switchover can happen, digital television should be affordable for the vast majority of households. The Government have defined the indicator of affordability as being 95 per cent. of households having access to digital equipment before switchover is completed. I went to the Ofcom presentation and I was quite concerned about some of the things that we learned there. I shall be quoting from Ofcom&#039;s report to the Secretary of State, &quot;Driving Digital Switchover&quot;. Its projection suggests that penetration rates of digital are unlikely to rise above 85 per cent. without a decision being taken to implement the switchover.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para37">Ofcom reports that a &quot;substantial&quot; number of households will need to convert their primary TV to be compatible with digital signals and &quot;many more&quot; households&#151;so that is many more than &quot;substantial&quot;&#151;will need to convert secondary TVs and video recorders if they want to continue using them. Ofcom goes on to report that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Some disruption will be inevitable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para38">However, I am concerned that the disruption, particularly in scattered rural areas, could be much more than &quot;substantial&quot;. Ofcom accepts that a small proportion of existing rooftop aerials and many more existing portable aerials will be unlikely to be able to receive an acceptable digital terrestrial signal. Ofcom&#039;s plan appears to rest on the assumption that areas that cannot currently receive Freeview but can receive the four main channels on analogue will be able to receive the digital signal once the analogue signal has been switched off because there will no longer be interference from the analogue signal. However, as my hon. Friend pointed out, we cannot test that assumption in advance; we can only hope that it will be correct.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para39">The first step in Ofcom&#039;s plan, as was outlined at the presentation, is to switch off the analogue signal for one channel, which would probably be BBC2. Presumably, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 41WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
there will be an advertising campaign in advance of the switch-off to advise people that they will need to buy set-top boxes to receive the digital signal, but the obvious problem is that people who buy such boxes living in areas where Freeview cannot be received at the moment will not be able to check that they work until the switchover happens.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para40">We are expecting, through the advertising campaign, people to buy equipment that they do not need at the moment, but which they will need at some time in the future. On the appointed day, BBC2 screens will go blank throughout that region. If I were working in a TV shop, I would expect a flood of calls that day; perhaps we should all be rushing out to buy shares in TV repair businesses. There will be a flood of calls from two groups of people: those who missed all the adverts, did not buy set-top boxes and suddenly find that for no apparent reason BBC2&#039;s signal has disappeared; and those who prepared in advance but find that for some reason the untested equipment does not work.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew17"><b> Brian White </b> : There will be a third group, which is the technophobes who do not have a seven-year-old kid to do it for them.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew18"><b> Mr. Reid </b> : That is an interesting point.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para41">The failure of equipment to work is likely to be greatest in those scattered rural areas that cannot currently receive Freeview because the equipment cannot be tested in advance. For those in many parts of my constituency, the nearest TV engineer will be 20 or 30 miles away. With a flood of calls all happening at once, it will be a big problem for TV engineers to travel around sorting out those problems. The situation could be even worse for people who live on small islands, where perhaps there is no one who is familiar with the new technology.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para42">The next and final phase, after the phase in which only one analogue signal is switched off, will involve switching off the analogue signals for the other three terrestrial channels. That will clearly lead to a further flood of calls to the TV engineers. I hope that the Minister, in his summing up, can reassure us that the Government do have solutions to the problems that I anticipate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para43">On affordability, the Government&#039;s affordability test is that 95 per cent. of households will have access to digital equipment before the switchover is completed, but Ofcom reports that that target will not be met without a timetable being set. Therefore, there is the problem that the Government might have to commit themselves to the switchover before they know whether their target will be met and then hope that it will. As I have outlined, we will not know whether digital equipment will work in many areas until after the switchover, so we do not know how many people who can ill afford it will be forced to pay a lot of money for a TV engineer to come out and get their digital boxes or aerials fixed in order to pick up new signals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para44">I hope that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon suggested, the Government will use some of the money that they will make from selling off the spectrum to assist people on low incomes with the cost of carrying out conversions. If they want the switchover to be affordable for people, they must give us cast-iron 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 42WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
assurances that affordable set-top boxes will be available to people and that they will be able to pick up the digital signal in all the parts of the country that can presently receive the four main channels in analogue form.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para45">Those are the concerns. I am not an expert on the subject, but I certainly hope that, when he sums up, the Minister will be able to respond to them with assurances.
</p>



<a name="50315h03_time3"><h5>2.37 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50315h03_spnew19"><b> Mr. Michael Moore  (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</b>  (LD): At the risk of being the third one in a row, I have to say that I am another Liberal Democrat who is not an expert on this subject, but I am sure that the whole House is waiting in anticipation for my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), who will put us all right if he should catch your eye during the winding-up speeches, Mr. Deputy Speaker. That may be the triumph of hope over experience, but I am willing to go with it today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para46">My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr.   Webb) has raised an important issue. As hon. Members have shown, it is beginning to be an issue in our constituencies and it will become much more of an issue in the years ahead. My part of the world is the south of Scotland and I would make the bold claim&#151;although I am confident about it&#151;that I probably represent the most beautiful constituency in the whole country<i>. [Interruption.] </i>Perhaps Macclesfield is one small exception. The important point is that, in many places, the source of that beauty is the topography&#151;the hills and the valleys. For all that, read that those are difficult technical circumstances in which to supply television and other broadcast signals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para47">One local worthy recently highlighted to me that it took more than 40 years to get 90 per cent. analogue coverage for our part of the world, yet it is proposed that, somewhere between now and 2008, we will move exclusively to digital and complete the switchover in the first tranche of regions. That seems extremely ambitious, not least when important villages such as Clovenfords in the heart of my constituency currently barely receive the analogue signals for existing terrestrial channels, and when the issue of Channel 5 still dogs many of the communities across all the towns in the region. So, there has been some surprise that the Border Television region has been selected to be in the first group of regions that will transfer over. I do not want that to be interpreted as a denigration of the technical prowess of the people at Border Television or the many other engineers up and down the country who will tackle this matter, but having spoken to different people in Border Television and elsewhere, I remain concerned that there is a lot of doubt about the technical feasibility of the switchover on such an ambitious time scale. Let no one get the wrong signal from me&#151;if Members will pardon the pun. I am not suggesting that anybody in my constituency does not want digital television services. Those of us who have the good fortune to be able to get Freeview or satellite television and the like appreciate that it is a major breakthrough. As the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Brian White) said, it is something of which Britain can rightly be proud, and we all want it as soon as possible. However, it must be introduced in a manageable and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 43WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
sensible time frame, and, as my hon. Friends have remarked, we must take account of some key issues&#151;not least affordability.
</p>

<a name="50315h03_para48">I have been in correspondence about that subject on behalf of different constituents over the past year or so with Lord McIntosh in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. I am grateful to him for the detailed way in which he has sought to answer those letters and tackle the concerns of my constituents. In response to a recent inquiry, he confirmed that analogue will be maintained until digital

<p class="tabletext">&quot;are satisfied that the interests of consumers, especially the most vulnerable, are well protected&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para50">My hon. Friends have already highlighted those issues in the guidelines and other correspondence, and I applaud the Government&#039;s intention; but I have yet to see or hear the detailed definitions of &quot;affordable&quot;, &quot;the vast majority&quot; or &quot;the most vulnerable&quot; that will assure me that important sections of my local community are not left out. Affordability affects not only one television. The days are long gone when households might have only the one piece of equipment to be affected by such a change. It is not simply about changing the black and white telly in the corner over to colour, or getting one with teletext; in many households every room has a television, with VCRs or DVD players attached. Even now pieces of equipment are being sold that are not digital-compatible. For many who do not have a seven-year-old child, a neighbour or friend who can assist, switchover will be a big burden.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para51">Many people are doubtful. They do not have to be technophobes; they just have to be a tiny bit sceptical about the process, given the fiasco that we endured during the Channel 5 switchover. If that is any indication of what the process will be like in the future, people are right to be worried.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para52">Separately, I am concerned about people&#039;s ability to choose between different digital platforms. The experts present&#151;we have already eliminated four or five people from that description&#151;have highlighted that there are a number of platforms out there. Beyond Sky Television, and Freeview where one can get it, most people are unaware of any other options. They do not recognise the prospect of other serious options coming on stream in an affordable and accessible way soon. Many fear that only Sky will be available to them because they are not in an area that enjoys Freeview. They also remain doubtful about the boosted Freeview signal allowing them to receive those services in the future.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew20"><b> Mr. Russell Brown  (Dumfries)</b>  (Lab): I do apologise; I have actually moved down the Room to get a better reception.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para53">The hon. Gentleman and I share the Border Television area, and there is a contentious issue for those who seek to turn to Freeview to get the digital signal. On our side of the border, people want to see BBC Scotland. If they invest in the equipment and pick up a signal from 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 44WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Cumbria, for example, they will not get BBC Scotland. People will be investing without realising the reception that they will get, or the service that will be delivered.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew21"><b> Mr. Moore </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, not least because we are talking about an area in which Border Television, the ITV provider, has managed to split its signal, so that on the Scottish side of the border we can enjoy Scottish news opt-outs and different programmes from the south of the border. It would be a strange and backward step for people north of the border to be denied access to the Scottish version of the BBC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para54">I understand that in future people will able to dial up and plug into whichever variation of the BBC they wish to have, through the Freesat alternative. However, many will object to having to have a satellite dish installed in the first place, while there will be others who are not yet aware of the opportunity. The Government and other agencies, such as the BBC and Ofcom, still have a lot of ground to cover in getting awareness of that choice fixed in people&#039;s minds. There is serious anxiety that the reality of the digital switchover, particularly in its accelerated state, will mean that people will have no choice and will have to go for Sky or, in limited areas, Freeview.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para55">Digital television is a major breakthrough, as other hon. Members have said. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East pointed that it affects not only television, but the whole range of digital services, which are exciting and for which the Government deserve credit on pushing forward. However, I am concerned that we run the risk of falling flat on our face if certain issues that have been raised today are not tackled quickly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para56">It is proposed that we in the Borders will switch over to digital exclusively in three years&#039; time. Very few people in south-east Scotland now believe that that will be possible. Whether because of the feasibility or affordability, or because of the choice that they have been given, people believe that there are still serious questions to answer and they will take a lot of persuading. I hope that the Minister will give some of the assurances that we seek and ensure that the Government heed our warnings as they plan the roll-out over the next few years.

<a name="50315h03_time4"><h5>2.47 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50315h03_spnew22"><b> Mr. Don Foster  (Bath)</b>  (LD): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) on introducing a debate on an important issue, about which many people still have many concerns. Before I turn to his remarks and to the contributions that other hon. Members made, however, I refer to the comment by my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) about what a major breakthrough digital is. None of us should forget how significant it is. Put simply, digital is better. The picture, the sound and the add-ons are better than with analogue, and there are huge benefits with the electronic programme guides and interactive services. Digital is an exciting development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para57">The title of the debate refers to television, but let us remember that, along with America, we are definitely leading the way on the wider move to digital, including 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 45WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
digital radio. We should be proud of that and acknowledge the benefits. I hope that none of us is suggesting that we do not wish to move forward as quickly as possible, so that as many people as possible can benefit from the new technology.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para58">My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon began by saying that he knew little about the topic and did not even know what his party&#039;s policy on it was. I assure him that his party&#151;our party&#151;is enthusiastic about the digital switchover. We believe that it offers enormous benefits and that a lot of good work has been done on it. However, our biggest concern is that there has been a lack of political will and political leadership to help us to move forward.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew23"><b> Brian White </b> : The hon. Gentleman has just acknowledged that Britain leads the world in digital activities and technology, so how can he say that there has been no political leadership from the Government?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew24"><b> Mr. Foster </b> : I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the question. If he will bear with me, I will give him a detailed, precise answer. I acknowledge that the question is fair.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para59">My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon raised a number of concerns, and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response to them. I will touch on some of the issues that he raised about the timetable. He talked about the region that we both live in being low on digital take-up so far, but high on the list for switch-off. He rightly raised concerns that have been picked up by others about the need to provide help to various disadvantaged groups such as the isolated, the elderly and the vulnerable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para60">My hon. Friend pointed out that we should not get too excited about how far the digital take-up revolution has spread. We all know that when the Government and others talk about take-up of about 60 per cent.&#151;the figures vary&#151;that refers largely only to the first and main television set in the home and does not take into account the second or third, or even in some cases the fourth or fifth. He touched on other issues, to which I will return, about houses in multiple occupation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para61">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Brian White) made some important points in a useful speech. I was amused by his exchange with the hon. Member for Chelmsford and East Maldon&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew25"><b> Mr. Whittingdale </b> : I am afraid that East Maldon would be very small. It is Maldon and East Chelmsford.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew26"><b> Mr. Foster </b> : I am grateful. I should know it by now, and I apologise to the hon. Gentleman and to his constituents for my failure to get it right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para62">The exchange was interesting. The hon. Gentleman referred to his problem getting a television service from NTL. NTL could provide him with a television service. I have it, it is an analogue service and frankly&#151;I will get into trouble with NTL for saying this&#151;it is not worth having. However, it is available and he could have it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para63">The hon. Gentleman pointed out how bizarre it was that various advertising leaflets streamed through his door advertising a service that he cannot get. No doubt, like me, he receives a large number of advertisements from Sky advertising what it can deliver but failing to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 46WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
take into account that, because of my local authority, Westminster, and because I am in a property of multiple occupation, we are not allowed to have a Sky satellite dish to receive Sky&#039;s services. A lot of firms waste a lot of money putting literature through doors, adding to the confusion. We need to return to the issue of how confused many people are.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para64">The hon. Gentleman was right to draw our attention to the number of alternatives that are increasingly becoming available as platforms for the delivery of digital offerings. He referred in particular to broadband. Many of us have had briefings on that and know that within two or three years the speed is likely to be such that we will be able easily to get live streaming TV through our computers.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew27"><b> Brian White </b> : It can be done now.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew28"><b> Mr. Foster </b> : It can be done now, but it is not that effective. It raises additional issues about the licence fee for people who might decide not to have television sets but to rely on their computers. Perhaps that is another issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para65">There is also the possibility, which we are beginning to see trialled already, of receiving TV through mobile phones. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East is right to say that we have to take account of some of the new developments in the switchover. However, I fundamentally disagree with him&#151;this comes back to   his question&#151;about Government leadership. He implied that, because we have got on with digital and are to some extent leading the way, that brings great credit to the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para66">I remind the hon. Gentleman that, in the royal television lecture in 1999, the right hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, told us that it would be possible to achieve switchover by 2010. That date has now been dropped because, I argue, we have not seen leadership from Government. We have seen a number of other bodies, particularly Ofcom and the BBC, at work in that area. However, there has been real confusion in the Government&#039;s mind about how things will go forward. I asked the Government in September 2004 why Ofcom was offering new licences with the 2012 date in them and whether it had pre-empted anything that the Government might say. <i>The Independent </i>reported the Department&#039;s response, saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The DCMS said Ms Jowell referred to 2012 in a speech she gave in the Commons in July.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para67">That implied that she had given a date in July, so I checked precisely what she said in her statement to the House:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;While the broadcasters have not reached a full consensus on the optimum timetable, some&#151;including the BBC&#151;have suggested that 2012 may be the most appropriate date for the completion of switchover.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons</i>, 22 July 2004; Vol. 424, c. 82WS.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para68">That is hardly a ringing endorsement from the Secretary of State of the idea that 2012 is Government policy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para69">Indeed, much more recently, on the day the Secretary of State announced the Green Paper on BBC charter renewal, it was clearly stated that she was giving major responsibility for building digital Britain to the BBC. It 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 47WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
appeared to me, at least, that she was asking the BBC to write a blank cheque. There was no clarity about the level of responsibility that the BBC would take or about how much licence fee payers&#039; money it was expected to spend.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew29"><b> Brian White </b> : The hon. Gentleman will obviously remember the ITV Digital disaster, which was based on some crazy decisions by its board. He will also remember the rescue of digital carried out by the BBC, which should be praised for what it has done to promote digital through its services. At one point, it was easy to think that the whole thing would go down the pan, and the BBC deserves credit for rescuing digital from the disaster at ITV.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew30"><b> Mr. Foster </b> : The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and there is no doubt that the BBC will, and should, continue to play an important role. Indeed, its technological developments have been important not only for the corporation and its programmes, but for a number of public service and commercial broadcasters, and we would all do well to recognise that. It is fine to require the BBC to play a leading role, and I have no problem with that, but I do have a problem when neither the parameters for that responsibility nor the financial envelope within which the BBC is expected to operate are clearly laid down.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para70">Several issues have been raised. My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) rightly expressed concern about the potential for people in his constituency to lose out. He and other colleagues mentioned the confusion in the minds of many people. He said, tellingly, that there will presumably be an advertising campaign. I say to the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East that, with such a large number of people currently buying new television sets and new equipment, we need much greater clarity about what they should be looking for. My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon talked about stickers on the telly, and that is a move in the right direction, but there is huge confusion in people&#039;s minds when they buy a digital television set about whether it will deliver.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew31"><b> Brian White </b> : Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew32"><b> Mr. Foster </b> : I will in a second. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that we should be talking about the input, and before he intervened&#151;he can happily do so again&#151;I was about to say that he was 100 per cent. right. Unfortunately, a large number of those who have been buying digital television sets simply have not got that message and have been buying things that may not be helpful to them for quite some time. I think he agrees that I have covered the point.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para71">My hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale raised a number of concerns about technical feasibility in his area, although he was in no way knocking the skills of the people there, and he rightly pointed that out. He asked whether it would be possible to resolve the technical problems under the very tight and, as he put it, challenging timetable for his area. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute, he took up the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 48WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
for Northavon about affordability. Several such issues have been raised in reports, not least the Ofcom consumer panel&#039;s November 2004 report, which states that there is an urgent need to consider who the disadvantaged groups will be who might lose out and what support they will need. The panel drew particular, but not exclusive, attention to the over-75s.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para72">Although the overall envelope of financial help might be in the region of &#163;250 million to &#163;400 million to provide such people with support, it is worth reflecting that the panel estimates that the cost of providing such support to those aged 75 and over will be between &#163;134 million and &#163;270 million. Of course, others will have to be considered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para73">There are concerns about whether we are driving forward enthusiasm for take-up and dealing with the technophobes without 7-year-old children, as the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East put it. I assume, from the way in which he said that, that he does not put himself in that category, so if he wants to pop around to my flat afterwards to tune my video in, I would be grateful; I have been trying to get it right for two months.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para74">My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon raised a particularly important issue, which was picked up by others: houses in multiple occupation. The question of what options are available has already been asked. An option for some is to get Freeview, but it is not available to people who do not have access to Channel Five, such as many of my constituents in Bath, so that is not an option.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para75">The second option is Freesat, which costs money&#151;&#163;150, give or take. That is an option for many, but not for those who live in private property covered by planning legislation that does not allow a satellite dish. Those who rent property from a registered social landlord or a local authority are completely stuck unless the landlord or authority has got their act together and done something about the situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para76">It is important that we acknowledge those issues. Above all, I want the Government to give clearer leadership and to announce their preferred date, rather than the one to which everybody else says that they should agree.
</p>



<a name="50315h03_time5"><h5>3.2 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50315h03_spnew33"><b> Mr. John Whittingdale  (Maldon and East Chelmsford)</b>  (Con): I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) on securing the debate. He was honest enough to say that he did not know much about this subject when he first examined it. However, that is the same for the vast majority of the population. One of the problems is that few people know anything about it, yet the timetable set by the Government is coming up fast. Analogue switch-off may start in just three years, yet little has been done to prepare for it, and there are number of problems attached to it, which have been mentioned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para77">I have considerable concerns about analogue switch-off and what it will involve, but I am an enthusiast of digital television. I have been a Sky satellite subscriber for many years, and now subscribe to Sky Plus, which is an extraordinary technology. For anybody who acquires Sky Plus, or a PVR&#151;personal video recorder&#151;life is never quite the same again, because of the extra choice that it 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 49WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
provides: hundreds of channels; the possibility to interact; and in the long term, the possibility of high-definition television, which has not yet arrived in this country but could represent a whole new dimension.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para78">I am also a Freeview box owner, principally because I have been unable to obtain the television service from my cable provider. Therefore, I am aware of the limitations on Freeview. Even though I live in central London I cannot get Channel 5 on Freeview because, I am told, it is on a lower multiplex.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para79">To complete the picture, I am the enthusiastic owner of two digital radio sets. Nobody has yet mentioned digital radio. It, too, represents a technological development that is beginning to take off, and it raises questions to which I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s response. Do the Government plan, eventually, to turn off the analogue radio signal?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para80">Having set the picture and, I hope, made it clear that I am in no way averse to the technology, I recognise that many people do not necessarily want more choice. They are content with their analogue service, and are at best alarmed by and at worse positively opposed to the suggestion that that service will cease and that they will be compelled to move over to digital take-up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para81">I suspect that when the idea was first mooted, its attraction for the Government was financial. I remember that, four or five years ago, in the heady days after the 3G auction, this was regarded as a pot of gold that would be available to the Treasury and might well pay for half the public spending programme. At that time, there was real enthusiasm for pushing ahead as fast as possible. I do not think that that is any longer the case. Indeed, there is considerable dispute about the net benefit that will accrue to the economy as a result of switchover. The Government have given us a figure of between &#163;1.5 billion and &#163;2 billion, but the consumer group that reported to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport cast considerable doubt on that figure. It pointed out that the cost was measured only in terms of those viewers who currently do not have access to digital TV and will, therefore, incur costs in making the necessary changes, including acquiring set-top boxes, whereas the benefit was measured in the overall bonus to the economy from the whole population acquiring digital television. It was not comparing like with like.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para82">On top of that, there is considerable doubt as to whether the Government&#039;s estimate takes full account of all the costs involved. For instance, they have said that the net penalty cost of forced conversion is &#163;25. However, it is not yet possible to obtain a box for &#163;25, and considerable extra costs might be involved. For that reason, the consumer group concluded that the cost-benefit analysis greatly underestimates the penalty costs for consumers of switchover by underestimating the costs and overestimating the benefits. It went on to say that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the methodology appears to be flawed and it ignores many consumer costs&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para83">and it recommended that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;a parallel consumer cost benefit analysis should be developed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para84">That is urgently needed. If we are to take this huge step, we need at least to be convinced that the benefits outweigh the costs.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 50WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para85">I have a number of other concerns. First, as I said, the Government have completely failed to persuade those who are aware of their policy that it is a desirable policy. A survey for the Department of Trade and Industry of 4,000 viewers found that more than 70 per cent. are angry about switch-off and suspicious of the Government&#039;s motives. More than 3 million householders said that they would refuse to buy digital equipment and half of them said that they would maintain their defiance even if they had to give up TV completely. So there is a huge amount to do if people are to be persuaded that it is a good idea. To do that, we must have answers to a lot of the questions that have been asked. At the moment, we have digital penetration of about 55 per cent. The Government originally said that it was unthinkable to go ahead until digital penetration had reached 95 per cent. It then became apparent that we could not get up to 95 per cent. unless we switched off the analogue signal in order to convert the transmitters to digital terrestrial television. However, that requires the leap of faith that has been referred to. It means that viewers will have to have set-top boxes sitting on their televisions ready for the time when the off-switch is pulled, in the confidence and belief that they will, on pressing a button, have access to DTT.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para86">However, this is not just a matter of set-top boxes. There are a host of other problems. The Government&#039;s figure of 55 per cent. digital penetration is encouraging and undoubtedly that figure is growing, but as has been mentioned, that 55 per cent. refers to the main household television set. As I have said, my main household television set is digital, but I have three more, which are analogue. I do not think that I am all that unusual in that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para87">Therefore, the vast majority of those households that are already classified as digital households will incur significant extra costs in converting their other television sets to receive digital transmission. In some cases it may not even be possible. Of my three extra sets, two have portable aerials on the top; it does not seem likely at the moment that it will be possible to convert them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para88">There will be a significant extra cost and possibly a significant loss of consumer benefit when switch-off happens. People may well have to incur substantial extra expenditure to continue to receive television on all the sets on which they currently receive it. It is not, therefore, all that surprising that people are unconvinced that they should incur a cost simply to continue to receive what they now receive without paying.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para89">It is estimated that about one in three households need to change aerials and downleads. Around one in five television sets is portable or uses a portable aerial, and reference has also been made to the problem of people who live in multiple-dwelling units. Astra has put forward a good case on why an integrated system with a mast to allow DTT reception, a dish to allow satellite reception and a digital audio broadcasting aerial to allow digital radio reception is desirable. However, in many cases that is not possible at the moment. That, too, needs to be dealt with if we are to maintain the position, and the Government&#039;s declared objective, of allowing everyone who currently receives analogue television to receive digital television when switch-off happens.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 51WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para90">Affordability has also been mentioned. Some work has been done to suggest that those on the lowest incomes are likely to incur the greatest costs. Recommendations have been made about the necessity of offering a financial package. The Ofcom consumer panel has produced a useful report, to which the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) referred, about the potential size of the necessary package of financial assistance, which, in total, as he said, may amount to between &#163;250 million and &#163;400 million. That is another cost that must be compared with the potential benefit that we are told will accrue as a result of switch-off.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para91">Much more information needs to be given to consumers. The stickers with little ticks on them, which are being placed on television sets, somehow suggest that the Government are telling people that it is a good idea to buy an integrated digital TV set. However, many people, as the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Brian White) suggested, do not think that it is a good idea to buy an integrated digital TV, because that means locking oneself into the present technology and, if it advances, having to buy a whole new television set rather than a new box. The Government need to consider whether they are offering people the right advice.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew34"><b> Mr. Don Foster </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman agree&#151;I am sure that he has done his research and talked to people&#151;that, bizarrely, buying a new integrated digital set is often also more expensive than buying the kit separately?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew35"><b> Mr. Whittingdale </b> : That is probably the result of the fact that at the moment demand for integrated sets is relatively low, but it is certainly true. Therefore it is difficult to see any reason why someone should want to buy an integrated set.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para92">There have been many references to the fact that we lead the world in the take-up of digital television. That is true. Of those who can principally claim credit for that&#151;there are two, and they do not include the present Government&#151;the first is Rupert Murdoch, who launched satellite and then digital satellite in this country, and the second is the previous Conservative Government. I recall serving on the Committee that considered the 1996 Broadcasting Bill, which ushered in digital terrestrial television. That television, it is fair to say, had some teething problems. Nevertheless, the previous Conservative Government were the ones who paved the way for it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para93">Ofcom has announced a timetable, which will start very shortly. In last week&#039;s Green Paper, the Government placed considerable responsibility on the BBC, yet all the questions that have been asked in this debate have not been properly addressed. Analogue switch-off is classified as a brave decision for a Minister to take. It is desirable that we get there eventually, but I have considerable doubts about the timetable that we are following and whether it is sensible to compel consumers to switch to digital terrestrial television when they might not want to do so. We need to consider the issues much more carefully, but the Government have not provided answers to the many questions that have been asked.

<a name="50315h03_time6"><h5>3.16 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50315h03_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Sport and Tourism  (Mr. Richard Caborn) </b> : I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) on securing the debate and on his work as vice-chairman of the all-party group on poverty. As he said, that work was one of the major reasons why he secured the debate today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para94">I do not know the origins of digital television, but we would all agree that digital switchover will bring significant benefits to the wider economy of the United Kingdom as well as to consumers, from both the extension in coverage of digital terrestrial television and the considerable number of new services that will use the freed-up spectrum that it will offer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para95">Since 2001, the Government&#039;s objective has been to work with public service and other broadcasters, industry and consumers to develop a collective strategy for digital television, which includes ensuring that all households have access to affordable digital television services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para96">The prices of set-top boxes and integrated digital televisions have fallen to the level at which switchover is affordable for the vast majority of households. Although take-up is healthy&#151;at the last count, it was about 55 per cent., according to Ofcom figures&#151;it cannot be left to the market alone if we are to achieve switchover.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para97">The Ofcom report, &quot;Driving Digital Switchover&quot;, expresses a belief that the digital take-up rate will approach 80 per cent. by 2012 and will rise very slowly afterwards. The vast majority of viewers will need only a source of good information to help them through the switchover. I take on board the comment made by many hon. Members that we must convince them that switchover is right. We are, however, fully aware that some people will need much more information. They may need help to understand what they have to do to install their boxes and check their aerials, and help to understand how to use their new equipment, and we acknowledge that a few might also need financial assistance, as the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said. I will talk about that shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para98">The Government are committed to ensuring that everyone who can currently receive the main public service broadcasting channels&#151;BBC 1, BBC 2, ITV, Channel 4, S4C, Channel 5 and teletext&#151;in analogue form will be able to receive them on digital systems on switchover. That is the object of the exercise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para99">Ofcom has indicated that switchover could be completed in 2012, and has published an indicative regional order to that effect. A final decision on switchover will need to take account of the impact on everyone, not least on the most vulnerable consumers.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew36"><b> Mr. Don Foster </b> : The Minister is absolutely right to say that the Government need to decide, among other things, the precise date of the switchover. He will know that I, and I suspect others, have received a letter from the chief executive of Ofcom who says quite categorically:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We will, by late Spring/early Summer be at the point where operational decisions and political decisions must come together&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para100">for various reasons.
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;In short, a decision crunch point is approaching when a political decision&#151;either to go ahead with switchover or to postpone it indefinitely&#151;needs to be taken.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 53WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para101">May we have an assurance that the Government will make that decision and announce it by the deadline of late spring or early summer?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew37"><b> Mr. Caborn </b> : That is our intention. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree with something that the debate has shown clearly. As he said, we can go for dates, but if we are not reassured that we will deliver a service to everyone, including the vulnerable, it would be a mistake to start giving out dates. The first question that must be asked is, &quot;Can we deliver the service?&quot; We as a Government must be sure that we can give clear political leadership. The issue is not just about dates, which are important but just one part of the debate. We must be reassured that the technology is in place and that we can deliver.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para102">This afternoon, I want to try to lay out how we believe that we can deliver the technology to the people that the debate has been about and central to&#151;vulnerable people. Once we are reassured on that point, I will be much more assured about giving dates. That is also the case as far as the Secretary of State is concerned. Ofcom and the BBC do not have the responsibilities that Government have to deliver the service to all sectors of society. That is a political decision of the Government. It is one that we will make when we believe that we have all the information. We think that that is important. What has been useful about the debate is that it has brought that into political focus.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para103">At the heart of the Government&#039;s plan is the key role that the BBC will play in switchover. We agree with the BBC&#039;s view, expressed in &quot;Building Public Value&quot;, that it should have a lead role in the switchover. We will ask the BBC to help establish and manage the organisation that will co-ordinate the implementation of switchover. We will also ask it to take a lead role in public information campaigns, telling consumers what will happen and when and what consumers need to do. That has been clearly emphasised in the debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para104">We know from reports from Generics, the consumer expert group, and Ofcom that some people will need considerable help at switchover. We therefore agree with the consumer expert group and Ofcom&#039;s independent consumer panel that the vulnerable consumer should be assisted throughout that stage of the switchover. We will also ask the BBC to help establish and fund schemes for the most vulnerable consumers. We are not able to announce details of who will get help at this stage, but we continue to work with the charities that deal with vulnerable households and will set out our proposals in conjunction with the BBC. So, there will be a wide consultation in the area. Details will be set out at the time of an announcement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para105">Whatever we do, we must ensure that the public have an awareness and understanding of switchover. Broadcasters, and the supply chain to them, will hold the primary responsibility for ensuring that everyone gets all the information that they need about the switchover process. However, the Government will continue to take responsibility for communicating their switchover policy. In November 2004, the Government launched a public awareness campaign that aims to use the mainstream media to educate the media and the public about switchover.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para106">The switchover logo has been referred to, the development of which is a crucial part of the support. The logo indicates digital-ready products and services 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 54WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
and reliable information about switchover. So far, 20 manufacturers and more than 200 retailers, representing more than 2,300 retail outlets, and a number of aerial installers, as well as Top Up TV, have signed up to the use of that logo. We are making progress. Information leaflets are readily available at all major stores, including Dixons and Comet. We are also working with charities on plans to ensure that everyone, including those who are hard to reach, get the right information and support. We are working with shadow SwitchCo, the switchover organisation that is being set up by broadcasters and the supply chain to ensure that communication and marketing plans reflect the needs of consumers. We understand that it plans a proactive information campaign at both the national and the regional level. There is surely no clearer message to focus people&#039;s minds than the Government&#039;s announcement that confirms the timetable of that switchover.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para107">As I mentioned, the Government will confirm the timetable once all remaining issues are resolved and we are satisfied that the interests of consumers&#151;especially, I repeat, the most vulnerable consumers&#151;are protected. One of those interests is the precise coverage requirements. That comprises the number of transmitters to be converted, modes and power combinations. On 9 February, Ofcom published a consultation paper setting out options on how best to deliver substantially the same coverage with digital terrestrial as with analogue transmission. That includes details of the benefits of particular options for availability and trade-offs that would be needed. It has invited responses by 21 March.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para108">Ofcom also published a technical briefing paper on 9 February setting out the proposed regional order for switchover by 2012 as part of its wider spectrum management responsibilities. The order in which the regions will be switched off is based on technical criteria that have been agreed between broadcasters, multiplex operators and Ofcom. The specific dates of the process remain, of course, a matter for Government. The switchover process involves a number of different parties with different interests. For switchover to be successful, there needs to be in place an organisation to manage the process and see it through, hopefully, to a successful completion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para109">Both the BBC&#039;s and Ofcom&#039;s reports into switchover supported the idea of a SwitchCo organisation to take forward the switchover project. SwitchCo has been set up as the primary body charged with ensuring the successful achievement of switchover in the United Kingdom. It will need to build constructive relationships with the industry to educate consumers on the benefits of switchover, and allow regions plenty of time to prepare. The structure of the new organisation is being developed and will involve public service broadcasters, multiplex operators and representatives from the supply chain.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew38"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : I am very grateful to the Minister for giving way as I know that he has only a couple more minutes. However, could he clarify the specific point about people who cannot currently receive digital terrestrial? Will they be expected to buy digital equipment in the hope that on the day that the plug is pulled, it will all be fine? What will happen if it is not?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 55WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="50315h03_spnew39"><b> Mr. Caborn </b> : They are issues that have to be worked through. I want to answer some of the specific questions that have been asked if I have time, but I should like to conclude.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para110">The Government are committed to switchover: the question is not &quot;whether&quot; but &quot;when&quot;. Switchover is in the UK&#039;s interests, and everybody agrees with that. The Conservative Opposition can smirk about that, and giggle and laugh, but we are genuinely trying to manage the system responsibly. We are at the leading edge of technology in this country and intend to stay there. In that position, some difficult questions have to be resolved, but we shall try to do that in the most common-sense and transparent way possible. Giggling from a sedentary position does not help.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para111">The cost-benefit analysis published on 10 February showed the quantifiable benefits of switchover to be around &#163;1.1 billion. Ofcom figures for digital television penetration were estimated to have reached 55 per cent. of UK households. Based on Freeview projections and Sky&#039;s figures, that is almost certain to top 60 per cent. of households. However, only 73 per cent. of UK households can access digital terrestrial television services. That figure cannot be increased before switchover, but the analogue switch-off should be seen as not a switch-off, but a switch-over.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para112">I shall quickly respond to some of the specific questions that were asked. In the south-west, take-up is low because digital terrestrial coverage is limited. We need the switchover to happen before we can remedy that. Lack of Freeview is a major issue during the charter review, and will continue to be considered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para113">We accept that flats will be a challenge. We are working with the industry and the Chartered Institute of Housing on guidance for the housing sector, and I hope that we can resolve some of the questions that have been raised on the matter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para114">We are looking at the Ofcom plan for voluntary help, and we shall announce who will receive voluntary help and what help they will receive. On the spectrum valuation, that will be released only in 2012 when switchover is complete. Spectrum release can be used only for broadcasting. That may change but we have made cautious assumptions about future worth; we do not think that it is possible to fund switchover costs from the future proceeds.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h03_para115">On covenants, Astra has raised the matter and we have asked it to give us further evidence but we are still not convinced that there is a real problem in that area. On aerials, we have found that in the technical trials that have been done in Wales, the aerials stand up quite well. Switchover signals will be within the aerial groups and at a higher power. Some people will need to upgrade, but much fewer than some of the figures that have been quoted in the media. We believe that on NTL issues, switchover will create competition: all those who receive analogue will get digital at switchover. We hope that Freesat will emerge so that people will have a choice other than Sky as a free-to-view satellite option.

<a name="50315h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Police (Greater Manchester)</h3>

<a name="50315h04_time0"><h5>2.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50315h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Graham Brady  (Altrincham and Sale, West)</b>  (Con): I am grateful for the opportunity to raise a subject that is of great significance and concern to my constituents. I am delighted to see the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart), in her place. I understand that the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety, the hon. Member for Salford (Ms Blears), cannot take part as she is a Member for a Greater Manchester constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para0">It is one of the ironies for the Greater Manchester police that the preponderance of local MPs who have held ministerial office in the Home Department apparently does not help us in communicating the realities of the policing situation in Greater Manchester to the Government. Until recently, we had the right hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston (Beverley Hughes). We now have the hon. Member for Salford and the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), and until recently the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) was the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Home Secretary. When the chips are down, Ministers appear determined to ignore the real problems that we face in Manchester.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para1">I realise, of course, that Greater Manchester&#039;s problems are not unique. Yesterday, the chief constable of Nottinghamshire, Steve Green, was reportedly blaming the Home Office&#039;s culture of targets and form-filling for his force&#039;s inability to keep up with serious crime. He told the <i>Daily Mail</i> that he could not simply switch more police to murder investigations because if he cut the number of officers doing clerical work he would lose money from the Home Office&#039;s crime fighting fund.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para2">Incidentally, I note from the Bassetlaw <i>Crusader</i>, a newspaper that I read every week, that Mr. Jonathan Shepherd, our excellent parliamentary candidate in Bassetlaw, has highlighted the 740 additional police officers that a Conservative Government would put in place in Nottinghamshire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para3">Closer to home, Peter Aaronson, one of my local superintendents, spoke last week about a &quot;frightening&quot; rise in the number of guns on the streets of south Manchester. After 16 shootings during the course of one month, he was quoted in the <i>Manchester Evening News</i> as saying,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I&#039;ve never seen anything like it&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para4">Yesterday, in response to the chief constable of Nottinghamshire, the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety said that the Government are committed to reducing red tape for the police. She stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We have already increased the number of civilian workers and announced plans to create the equivalent of 12,000 more police officers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para5">I am sure that the Under-Secretary will offer similar statistics today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para6">My purpose today is to try to persuade Ministers to confront the yawning chasm that is opening up between their words and the daily experience of those who have 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 57WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to make our police services work. Indeed, a few weeks ago the Greater Manchester police authority wrote to the Home Secretary saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Put bluntly, we are facing reducing the number of operational police officers and making support staff redundant in the light of the unusual and unfortunate circumstances facing the Force and Authority.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para7">The letter set out some of the major reasons for that difficulty.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Mitchell  (Sutton Coldfield)</b>  (Con): Is it not the case that, as a result of the Government&#039;s&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b>  (Sir Nicholas Winterton): Order. I am afraid that an Opposition Front-Bench spokesman is not allowed to intervene in an Adjournment debate. Such debates are a private matter between the Back-Bench Member and the Minister. I have to rule the hon. Gentleman out of order: he cannot intervene.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Brady </b> : Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am sorry that I cannot give way to my hon. Friend. I am sure that his intervention would have been excellent.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew4"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : The hon. Gentleman could have intervened from the Back Bench, but he cannot do so from the Front Bench.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Brady </b> : That is extremely helpful to all hon. Members. <i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew6"><b> Mr. Mitchell </b> : Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brady </b> : I am delighted to give way.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mitchell </b> : I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Is not the burden of the point that he is making on behalf of his constituents that, intended or not, as a result of the Government&#039;s policies his force may have to reduce front-line policing? By contrast, following the election manifesto commitment for an increase of 40,000 police officers across the country over eight years, the Conservative party is committed to ensuring that that force has at least 2,200 more police.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew9"><b> Mr. Brady </b> : My hon. Friend demonstrates huge versatility in making that absolutely core point. The experience of my constituents under the Labour Government is that front-line policing may be cut, whereas they know that it would be increased considerably across Greater Manchester under a Conservative Government. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point so clearly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para8">As the police authority has pointed out, the major reasons for its funding shortfall are increases in the costs of employment, the fact that Greater Manchester is hit harder than most other forces by increased pension costs, increases in the costs that it has to bear for private finance initiative projects that now have to be funded by the force and a variety of other exceptional factors. The police authority&#039;s concern was repeated by the chief constable, Mike Todd, who stated in the <i>Manchester Evening News</i> on 18 February:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I am extremely disappointed about the likely outcome of the budget settlement. It is bad for GMP, bad for policing and bad for the people of Greater Manchester.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 58WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">This will be the second year running that we have had a poor budget settlement, and it will not even be possible to continue what we have been doing this year.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">We have worked extremely hard to improve the performance of GMP&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para9">He concluded by stating:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;This will now be put in jeopardy.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para10">That was the chief constable making the point in his own words.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para11">The <i>Manchester Evening News</i> rightly picked up on the issue in its editorial and clearly made the point that the present Government&#039;s election pledges were being called into question by the local policing situation. As it happened, the editorial was adjacent to an article by Andrew Grimes with the excellent headline, &quot;Is it time to put Tony out to grass?&quot; I am sure that it made interesting reading, and it was an appropriate juxtaposition in the context of broken election pledges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para12">Mr. Todd warned that Greater Manchester police may have to make redundancies for the first time in their 30-year history. In response to comments from Home Office Ministers, he said that it would be naive to imagine that redundancies in support staff would not impact on front-line policing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para13">On 19 February, the <i>Manchester Evening News</i> reported that the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety had said that she expected Mr. Todd to get on with the job and put more bobbies on the beat. That is all very well. We would be delighted to have the chief constable get on with the job, and we all want more bobbies on the beat, and I am sure that the chief constable wants that as well, but he cannot do those things, given the resources and the situation that he is faced with as a result of Government policies and what the Home Office is doing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para14">My constituents, who worry about crime and particularly the frightening levels of violent crime and gun use, are faced with a war of words between the chief constable and the Minister with responsibility for policing. The Minister says that everything is fine. The chief constable says that the force faces cuts in front-line policing. I mean no offence when I say that I am more inclined to believe the man who is charged with delivering policing in Greater Manchester, and I believe that the people of Greater Manchester know who to believe as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para15">The evidence is already mounting. Greater Manchester police recruitment, which was previously 100 officers a month, was cut to 30 officers a month, and there is a complete freeze on recruitment this month. The cuts in the Centrex training budget have forced Greater Manchester police to take on more of the cost of training their own officers. I welcome community support officers as long as they are an additional resource and are not used to replace fully trained front-line police officers, but the community support officers already in place are now being funded from the Greater Manchester police budget, not directly from the Home Office. The Home Office wants more community support officers, but long-term funding will come from existing budgets, which will put yet more pressure on the budget for fully trained police officers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para16">Far from reducing the red tape, the new stop-and-search requirements and the changes to the national recording of crime are increasing the burden of form-
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 59WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
filling and bureaucracy. Even with cuts in recruitment, a &#163;500,000 cut in street crime overtime and the withdrawal of funding for local crime-fighting initiatives, GMP still face a significant shortfall. That comes at a time when there are unparalleled challenges in dealing with violent crime and when Greater Manchester police have a regional and national role in fighting terrorism.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para17">The Minister knows that the Opposition understand the importance of policing. That is why the Conservative party has pledged to recruit 40,000 more police officers, more than 2,200 of which would be in Greater Manchester. That is something that has been taken up by my Conservative colleagues who, after a resounding victory in June&#151;on which I know the Minister will want to congratulate them&#151;are running Trafford metropolitan borough council. The council will hold its own debate on the crisis of police resources in Greater Manchester and I am sure that, as a result, it will want to press Ministers to resolve matters in a way that avoids cuts in front-line policing in Greater Manchester. My colleagues Councillor Alex Williams and Councillor Stephen Ogden are playing a significant role in that, as is Mr. Damian Hinds, who is the prospective parliamentary candidate for Stretford and Urmston.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para18">The Minister, in her reply, must accept that it is not good enough just to tell my constituents and Greater Manchester police that they have never had it so good. We constantly hear statistics, whether on funding or the number of officers, and receive endless good-news press releases from the Home Office, but the reality that is being experienced on the ground&#151;the reality that we heard about yesterday from the chief constable in Nottinghamshire and that has been expressed by my chief constable in Greater Manchester&#151;is very different.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para19">I hope that when the Minister replies she will accept that there is a real problem that could lead to cuts in front-line policing. Most importantly, I hope that she will set out, in clear, measurable terms, how the Home Office proposes to reduce the burdens of cost and bureaucracy and to ensure that Greater Manchester police continue to have the resources that they need to protect my constituents. We do not want to hear that everything is fine because we know that it is not. What we want to hear from her is some real reassurance that cuts in front-line policing in Greater Manchester can be stopped and that the security and safety of my constituents can be guaranteed.

<a name="50315h04_time1"><h5>3.43 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50315h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) on securing the debate on police resources in Manchester. I know that police resources have been the subject of much local debate over the past month. This is a useful opportunity to set the record straight and show the extent of Government support for, and investment in, local policing. The Government are committed to providing the resources that the police need to do their work effectively and to fulfil their commitments.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 60WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para20">Since 2000&#150;01, expenditure on policing supported by Government grants across England and Wales has increased by 39 per cent. or &#163;3 billion. That is not the picture that the hon. Gentleman was painting. Crime has fallen by 30 per cent. since 1997, using the British crime survey figures, which are universally accepted as the most accurate. Overall levels of crime fell by 11 per cent. in the year to September 2004. The risk of becoming a victim of crime is at its lowest since the British crime survey records began.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew10"><b> Mr. Andrew Mitchell </b> : The hon. Lady said that the British crime survey is the most authoritatively accepted measure of crime. Will she accept that that simply is not the case? The survey does not include many aspects of violent crime, nor does it include murders or the fastest growing areas of crime, including juvenile crime. Surely she should look at recorded crime. Does she not agree with the leader of her party, who, when in opposition, made it clear that he was interested not in the crime survey but in actual recorded crimes?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew11"><b> Fiona Mactaggart </b> : Of course we should look at recorded crime, and although we cannot get a long-term series of figures because of the changes in recorded crime, one of the things that those figures do is show where we need to make our effort in dealing with crime; one of those areas is violent crime, which is why we are focusing on it. The common experience of crime is most accurately shown by the British crime survey, which surveys victims of crime. If we are to put the victim at the heart of our criminal justice system, which is what we should be doing, we should use figures that accurately capture the experience of the victim.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para21">I am pleased that the Opposition did not seek to divide the House on the police funding settlement for 2005&#150;06, because it was a good one. It was, indeed, better than predicted by many, including people in Greater Manchester. Within that settlement, Greater Manchester police got &#163;412.5 million in general grants, which is an increase of 4.9 per cent., or &#163;19.3 million, on the previous year, including an extra &#163;800,000 from the amending report, which makes for an overall increase of 5.1 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para22">That is substantially higher than the 3.75 per cent. funding floor increase guaranteed for all police authorities, and it is above the police pay increase of 3 per cent. and non-pay inflation of about 2.6 per cent. In addition, there is over &#163;32 million in specific grants for targeted funding and a further &#163;10.9 million in capital provision. Of the &#163;32 million in specific grants, more than half is from the crime fighting fund specifically to help to maintain record police officer numbers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para23">The situation is significantly better for Greater Manchester police than it was during the previous year when their grant was a broadly standard rate increase in common with other police authorities. Some claim that 5.1 per cent. is insufficient, but I am confident that it is a favourable outcome for Greater Manchester police.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para24">The budget set by the police authority of &#163;493.9 million for 2005&#150;06 is an increase of &#163;25 million or 5.3 per cent. We have provided the necessary resources to enable police authorities to produce an increase in activity to sustain the increased police 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 61WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
numbers that we have advanced, and to deliver the improvements in policing. We have also asked the police service to make efficient use of its resources by making value-for-money improvements of over &#163;1 billion&#151;about 3 per cent. per year starting in 2005&#150;06.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para25">The police service has a good record of achieving efficiency gains in recent years, and collaborative procurement is one of the key themes of the tripartite police efficiency strategy. I congratulate Greater Manchester police on saving over &#163;600,000 from regional collaboration on the purchase of body armour. It is through such initiatives that further resources can be released for front-line policing efforts. Releasing officers to the front line is an important element in the police efficiency strategy, and GMP have carried out a best value review which will help to identify opportunities for such redeployment in the force.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew12"><b> Mr. Brady </b> : I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, and for acknowledging the excellent work that has already been done by Greater Manchester police in achieving the efficiency savings that have been asked of them; they are doing far more to that end. She is now talking about the importance of getting more police officers out on the beat and out of administrative support functions. Surely she has heard what the chief constable said: he has to do the reverse. Because he may have to make support staff redundant, police officers will be going off the beat, back into the offices, not fighting crime where they are meant to be. Has she not heard that point?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew13"><b> Fiona Mactaggart </b> : I do not predict that that will happen. If we consider the number of police that are available to the chief constable, we see that have sustained that number through the use of the crime fighting fund. Indeed, that was an important part of our strategy to ensure that there will be police on the street.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para26">I can see that the hon. Gentleman is asking who should be trusted. It is a sensible question, because he has referred to his party&#039;s commitment to put 2,200 more police on the streets. I cannot yet square that with its commitment to make cuts, as that commitment would cost around &#163;90 million a year. However, let us leave that aside and not poke holes in the Conservatives&#039; fantasy figures; instead, let us consider the record.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para27">Let us consider the Conservative party manifesto in 1992. It said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We are continuing to increase police numbers. There will be 1,000 extra police officers this year.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para28">I looked at the figures for police officers in that year: there were 7,061. I looked at the figures for 1993: there were 7,060. The 1,000 extra police officers that were promised turned into one fewer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para29">Let us take a more recent figure, as the hon. Gentleman seemed to want to do when I referred to the 1992 manifesto. Let us consider the words of his former Prime Minister, John Major, on 13 October 1995:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;So, Chief Constables, begin to plan&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para30">This was his offer to chief constables, such as the chief constable of Greater Manchester. He continued:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Because in the overall arithmetic of this year&#039;s public expenditure settlement we have found the resources over the next three years to put, not 500 but an extra 5,000 police officers on the beat.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 62WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para31">Again, I looked at the figures. John Major did not stay in power for the following three years, but nevertheless the Budgets set then were operated by the Labour party&#151;to our cost, frankly&#151;in government. In 1995, there were 7,037 police officers; in 1996, 6,938. Did the number go up the following year, which, as I am using the March figures, was also fully under a Conservative Government? We should remember that we were promised an extra 5,000 officers over three years. In 1997, the figure was 6,922. The following year, under the Labour Government, the numbers began to creep up, and there were 6,949 officers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para32">Who is to be trusted? The hon. Gentleman&#039;s party has a consistent&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew14"><b> Mr. Brady </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew15"><b> Fiona Mactaggart </b> : When I have finished this sentence. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s party has a consistent record of making promises and not only not achieving them but doing the precise opposite.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew16"><b> Mr. Brady </b> : I am sure that my constituents and others will be fascinated at the Minister&#039;s trip down memory lane, whether it is accurate or not. They will also recall that following 1997 police numbers have not risen inexorably, although recently there has been an increase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para33">Surely the crucial point is what is happening now and the mismatch between what Ministers say, what they promise and what happens in services for all our constituents. We are clearly seeing a stark difference between what the chief constable finds in operational terms and what Ministers say he should find. My question was about whether people should trust Home Office Ministers today or the chief constable who actually has to do the job. I hope that the Minister is not suggesting that Mike Todd cannot be trusted when he says that he may have to make cuts.
</p>




<p><a name="50315h04_spnew17"><b> Fiona Mactaggart </b> : No, I did not say that and I do not believe that Mike Todd will have to make cuts, although I do believe that there will be a challenge&#151;that is the point, is it not? We have discovered that one reason why, in the early years of a Labour Government, our commitments did not immediately translate into front-line police numbers was that we did not establish a clear mechanism to guarantee that the extra investment would turn into extra officers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para34">That is precisely why we made the crime fighting fund work as it does and why it gives the power to ensure that the resources translate directly into officers. The crime fighting fund pays for 643 recruits and is making a real difference in Greater Manchester, which has also enjoyed an increase in police support staff of 662 since March 1997. Even though there has been a 39 per cent. increase in police budgets since the election, there will challenges for front-line police officers. However, we have sought to give them the tools to meet the challenges effectively.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para35">The hon. Gentleman referred to the important example of gun crime and bureaucracy. The biggest increase in gun crime is with replica guns, a significant problem that must be tackled. We have given the police an unbureaucratic and effective tool for dealing with 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 63WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
gun crime, by including in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 an arrestable offence of carrying an imitation firearm in public without a reasonable excuse. In addition, we have introduced a minimum five-year sentence for possession of an illegal firearm. Both measures have given the police effective tools to help them to deal with gun crime.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para36">The hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out that the most powerful way we have helped the police force to deal with red tape is through video identity parades. If one talks to police officers, they will all say that they spend hugely less time nowadays managing identification parades, because of the video identification parade electronic recording scheme, known as VIPER.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para37">The hon. Gentleman referred to stop and search, and yes, some additional bureaucracy is involved in counting the incidence of that. That is because if stop and search is to be an effective policing tool, it must enjoy the confidence of all our communities. We have asked police officers to record stop and search in order to make it the effective policing tool that it is when it does enjoy that confidence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para38">I was in Reading today, visiting someone in whose shop a crime had been committed, and talking about his experience as a witness and how the police responded to him. As I was there, I walked past two police officers patrolling that side street in Reading. Knowing the area well, I must confess that I was struck by that example, because five years ago those officers would not have been there. We have more police on our streets than at any time. Of course there are challenges to the management of the police, but we have more than 8,000 police officers in Manchester, backed up by additional community support officers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h04_para39">The extra resources that we have given to Manchester are not, and never will be, enough for the individual officer to say that he can deliver the perfect police force. However, that officer has had a substantial increase in resources, which, along with the resourcefulness that he and his team can show, will enable him to continue to ensure that there are more police officers on the streets of Manchester and that they continue to increase the effectiveness with which they police the community that they serve.

<a name="50315h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Medway Queen</h3>

<a name="50315h05_time0"><h5>4 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50315h05_spnew0"><b> Jonathan Shaw  (Chatham and Aylesford)</b>  (Lab): In every constituency there are many examples of great people and great buildings. In my town great people have built great ships, including, in 1765, Nelson&#039;s flagship, HMS Victory. It follows that we in Medway are passionate about our maritime history, and that is what this debate is about&#151;our maritime history. It is about a unique ship that took working people on excursions and holidays, saved 7,000 men from the Nazis, and would now be lost to the nation if it were not for another great set of people, the Medway Queen Preservation Society. Our ambition is to see the Medway Queen restored, so that she can once again sail the River Medway in all her glory.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para0">I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister and his Department value our ships. Following consultations, our noble Friend Lord McIntosh recently announced the intention to set up a national historic ships unit that will advise the Government on policies and priorities and coordinate with those directly engaged in the preservation of ships to promote public interest in our maritime history&#151;laudable aims that we all support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para1">One important response to the consultation was the desire for the unit to engage fully with small craft and not to become preoccupied with the preservation of large ships. I hope that my right hon. Friend will be able to comment on that issue, or write to me if he is unable to comment today. I expect that he will tell the Chamber that there are thousands of ships and many worthy causes, and that there will simply never be sufficient funds to restore all of them. He will rightly say that there must be a better way of co-ordinating policy, so that grant-giving bodies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund are better informed when considering applications. That is right, but part of the thinking behind policy must be about the uniqueness and history of the craft, and, as the Government have rightly said, the consideration of the public interest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para2">I am fully aware that my right hon. Friend does not have a chequebook in his pocket today, and nor will he have one tomorrow. Making grants is the job of independent bodies, but they will be informed by Government policy, and in securing this debate that is what I seek to influence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para3">The Medway Queen is a paddle-steamer. She was built in 1924, in Troon on the banks of the Clyde, for the New Medway Steam Packet Company as part of their Queen Line fleet. She was a fine vessel and a model example of Scotland&#039;s shipbuilding at its best. I say that because we in Chatham know a thing or two about shipbuilding. Her passenger load was 800 with a top speed of 15 knots. Today, she is the only surviving paddler of her type. The Medway Queen has survived, and that is remarkable given the number of attempts there have been to blow her up, scrap her or sink her. However, despite her remarkable record of survival, given her current state, she cannot survive for much longer without financial support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para4">The Medway Queen was one of many pleasure steamers operating at the time. The ship&#039;s regular route was from Medway to Southend. From Chatham she called at Sheerness and Herne bay before reaching her 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 65WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
destination on the Essex coast. She also sailed up and down the Thames, to Clacton. That was her life for 15 years from the day on which she was commissioned, apart from occasional repair at the Acorn shipyard, where the finest and most skilled boilermakers in the land attended to her needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para5">After war broke out in 1939, the Medway Queen carried children who were being evacuated from Kent to East Anglia. She joined the Royal Navy as a minesweeper, serving for the duration of the war in the 10th minesweeping flotilla in the English channel. She was now HMS Medway Queen. In 1940, like many small ships, Medway Queen took part in the evacuation of our troops from Dunkirk. She distinguished herself by rescuing 7,000 men. On her seventh trip across the channel, she was badly damaged and reported lost. However, as has become her hallmark, she survived. During those seven trips she gained four awards for gallantry, having shot down three enemy aircraft. She became known as the heroine of Dunkirk&#151;a paddle-steamer shot down enemy aircraft; a paddle-steamer saved 7,000 men.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para6">After the war, the Medway Queen returned to her commercial service on the River Medway. In the 1960s our access to cars and changes in holidays meant that paddle-steamers were becoming redundant. Many were broken up, and the Medway Queen was sold for scrap. There was a public outcry and, once again, she survived. She became a maritime clubhouse on the Isle of Wight. However, by the 1980s the Medway Queen was unused and deserted and once again the breaker&#039;s yard beckoned. Yet in 1984 a group from Kent brought her back to Chatham dockyard, intending to restore her. Sadly this group was unable to carry through its intention and she sank, lying abandoned in the River Medway&#151;a seemingly tragic end to a wonderful ship that had once graced the same river but was now filled with tonnes of mud. In 1985, the Medway Queen Preservation Society was formed and became the owner of the ship. It spent the next two years removing the mud and patching the hull so that she might be refloated. A full and professional maritime survey was carried out and the results were promising. She was refloated and moved to her present site at Damhead Creek in the estuary of the River Medway. That is the potted history of this unique craft.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para7">It is 20 years since the preservation society started its huge project. The setbacks along the way have included the ship sinking, the visitor centre, including irreplaceable archive material, being destroyed by vandals just last year, and two rejections from the lottery, the last one being particularly painful. Despite all that, the preservation society has continued because of the huge public support for the project. Everybody in Medway knows somebody who has a story about the Medway Queen. She is held in great affection.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para8">It is important for me to pay tribute to the members of the GMB union. With their help, a new funnel was built in 2002 by young apprentices from the Appledore shipyard in Devon. The lads used parts of the original funnel and riveted them to the new one. Most recently, the unveiling of the new paddle took place with the help of south-east Co-op. Those are just two examples of public interest being aroused, and young people being involved in maritime skills, thanks to the Medway Queen.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 66WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para9">As I said earlier, last year&#039;s lottery rejection was painful. The society was bidding for &#163;6 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund in order that the hull could be restored to its original riveted specification. A cheaper option of plating the hull was advised against, so the MQPS produced a professional business plan that cost tens of thousands of pounds. It did that because that was what the HLF appeared to be recommending.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para10">I know that there is not enough money for every project. However, when people give their time and effort, not to mention raising funds&#151;which is hard work, as we all know&#151;they should be given clear guidance from the lottery as to what is expected. If necessary, they should also be given help. Otherwise, the criticism of the lottery that it is accessible only to well connected and professional types will continue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para11">It appears that all is not lost, continuing the theme of the Medway Queen&#039;s survival. Shortly after the rejection, Mr. Stephen Johnson, a director from the lottery, said on a local radio station that the lottery was keen to assist the Medway Queen. There have been meetings, a grant has been applied for and the society will work up a cheaper option for the hull, namely a plated one. That was referred to earlier but was rejected. The society has not been discouraged, has made the application and is waiting to hear. The application is for a project management scheme to provide the detail on whether plating the hull can be achieved; it will still cost in the region of &#163;2  million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para12">The society has been told by the south-east Heritage Lottery Fund that it will be given every assistance in applying for the grant. I hope that that is the case, because the Medway Queen&#039;s restoration will be a project for all people. Older hands from the skilled group of retired craftsmen who attend to the ship every Thursday will be able to show younger hands skills that we need to preserve, not just for this ship but many others in our nation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para13">I conclude with an extract from J.B. Priestley&#039;s &quot;Excursion to Hell&quot;:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;But now&#151;look&#151;this little steamer, like all her brave and battered sisters, is immortal. She&#039;ll go sailing down the years in the epic of Dunkirk. And yet our great-grandchildren, when they learn how we began this war by snatching glory out of defeat, may also learn how the little holiday steamers made an excursion to hell and came back glorious.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para14">The Heritage Lottery Fund said that the Medway Queen was not of sufficient historical importance to warrant a grant last time. Well, the ship helped to shape the nation&#039;s history. At Dunkirk, 7,000 souls were saved, so let us save the Medway Queen.
</p>



<a name="50315h05_time1"><h5>4.12 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50315h05_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Sport and Tourism  (Mr. Richard Caborn) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw) on securing this important debate. After hearing his contribution, if I had the cheque book in my pocket, I would sign one for him straight away. He spoke passionately about a subject that I know is close to his heart, and it is important that the Chamber hears such messages coming from a constituency. I hope that the advice that is given can be heeded, not just in Government but in other quarters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para15">As my hon. Friend said, the Medway Queen had a particularly distinguished record in evacuating British troops from the beaches of Dunkirk in 1940. It is 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>15 Mar 2005 : Column 67WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
appropriate that we are recalling that now in 2005, when we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war. The Medway Queen saved some 7,000 men not only from the beaches but from the sea, thanks to the courage and tenacity of her crew. I know that some of the men saved still remember vividly, and often recall, how they were rescued.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para16">After the war the Medway Queen settled into the less adventurous but important role of a pleasure steamer. Sadly, the great ship had the indignity of hitting an underwater obstruction and sinking in the River Medina in the early 1970s. She was tied up at Chatham where her decline and neglect have been sad to witness. I pay tribute to the Medway Queen Preservation Society, which my hon. Friend has congratulated, which was formed to save the ship and secure her future. The society&#039;s devotion and commitment and that of the ship&#039;s owner, the New Medway Steam Packet Company, bring the story of the proud ship right up to date. Thanks to the work of volunteers, the Medway Queen is now at least afloat in a safe berth in Damhead Creek at Kingsnorth in Kent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para17">I appreciate that the owners and the preservation society face a huge task in restoring the ship to full working order; there is no doubt about that. I confirm to my hon. Friend that the Government do not provide direct funding support for the acquisition, movement or conservation of historic ships, other than by providing grant-in-aid to museums that we sponsor which have vessels of historic significance in their collections.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para18">However, we are committed to delivering a national policy on ship preservation which preserves the best of our maritime heritage. In February, we announced the creation of a national historic ships unit. That unit will, for the first time, formally advise the Secretary of State and the Heritage Lottery Fund on historic ships, their funding needs and their investment priorities. We expect the unit to be up and running by April 2006. Capital funding for historic ships projects will continue to be dealt with by the HLF and other public or private grant-giving bodies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50315h05_para19">In July 2004, as my hon. Friend recalled, the HLF considered a major grant application from the New Medway Steam Packet Co. for &#163;6.7 million towards full restoration of the paddle-steamer. The HLF&#039;s trustees recognised the heritage importance of the Medway Queen and the role that she played in British history during the Dunkirk evacuations. They also praised the enthusiasm and commitment of the company and its members. However, the trustees felt that the high cost of restoring the ship, and the level of rebuilding necessary, would not represent value for money in terms of heritage and the long-term viability of the ship.

HLF also felt that a couple of their key criteria for    awarding grants&#151;sufficient public access and opportunities for learning&#151;had not been demonstrated.

<a name="50315h05_para20">In August 2004, Heritage Lottery Fund staff met representatives of the New Medway Steam Packet Co. to explore whether there might be scope for a more modest project, funded by the HLF, that would play a part in securing the ship&#039;s long-term survival. As a result of their discussions, the company has identified an alternative approach, which could provide a renewed hull and, potentially, a new weather deck. Completion of that work could secure the ship in the medium term and provide the company with a platform for further fundraising to complete the full restoration over time.

<p>
<a name="50315h05_para21">Heritage Lottery Fund staff have continued to provide advice on developing the project, resulting in a recent application to the fund for a project planning grant of &#163;31,500 to enable the New Medway Steam Packet Co. to complete detailed survey work, a conservation and management plan for the ship and other technical approvals needed to underpin the restoration of the ship. The HLF received the application on 21 February and, subject to a full assessment of the proposals, a decision should be made in three months. As my hon. Friend recognised, some progress is being made and the way forward is now clearly identified.

<a name="50315h05_para22">The Heritage Lottery Fund will remain the principal source of funding for historic ships. Its trustees make decisions independently of the Government; it is not open to Ministers to intervene or seek in any way to influence its decisions. The HLF has a role to play and it is engaging in that role enthusiastically, giving advice to the New Medway Steam Packet Co. The company&#039;s relationship with the HLF does not guarantee funding, because there are always so many competing bids for the available funds. However, we hope that the new national historic ships unit will provide an authoritative source of advice for the HLF and for those engaged in the preservation of our maritime heritage. My hon. Friend clearly outlined how that has impacted on our nation over the years.

<a name="50315h05_para23">I congratulate my hon. Friend again on his support and commitment to this project. He represents an historic constituency that is famous throughout the world for its history and record of shipbuilding. In this 60th anniversary year of the ending of the second world war, I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving us the opportunity to discuss the future of one of the ships that played such a distinguished and magnificent role in that war.
