 This is my first debate in this or any other place where you have been in the Chair, Dr. McCrea. It is very nice to see you, particularly given the good news that has come out of the Province of late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para2"><a name="070510111000008">I shall provide some background to the debate. Members know that the dates on the report and the Government&#146;s response are somewhat dated: we published the report on 25 July 2006, and the response came in October. We made one or two observations, and we wanted to consider the subject, because back then, there was a general debate about independent sector treatment centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para3"><a name="070510111000009">One issue that we seized on quickly was the separation of elective from emergency procedures. We found out that clinicians had advocated separation since the 1990s. In 2002, the Government announced the creation of a series of NHS treatment centres to make systematic the approach to elective treatment, and later that year, the Department of Health decided to commission a number of independent treatment centres to handle NHS patients who required relatively straightforward or diagnostic procedures. I shall describe later what we found out about that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para4"><a name="070510111000010">The Committee set out to discover the purpose of ISTCs. During the course of our inquiry, the rationale behind their creation varied in emphasis, but the stated purposes were fivefold:</p>
<a name="70510h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="070510111000298"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Increasing elective capacity available to the NHS in order to reduce waiting lists and times; Reducing the spot purchase price in the private sector; Increasing patient choice within the NHS; Encouraging best practice and innovation; Stimulating reform within the NHS through competition.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para5"><a name="070510111000011">We were surprised and dismayed at the Government&#146;s poorly defined goals for the ISTC programme, and their rationale changed during the course of our inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para6"><a name="070510111000012">One of the most significant findings was an alarming absence of evidence, which consisted of two different problems: first, the Government refused on the ground of commercial confidentiality to give the Committee the information that they had collected on ISTCs, so although it was being collected, it was difficult for us to make a judgment about it; and secondly, there was a failure to collect proper data to assess the effectiveness of ISTCs. We found that both supporters and opponents of ISTCs were making claims that were not backed up by evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para7"><a name="070510111000013">We concluded that treatment centres are a good idea. Separating elective and emergency procedures reduces the length of stay, helps reduce waiting lists and times and improves hospital organisations. We visited the centre to which my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) sometimes sends his patients, and it was a real eye-opener&#151;first, to the situation inside the national health service. The centre is an NHS institution, brand new and effectively part of a brand new private finance initiative hospital. Our visit showed us the precise benefits of separation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para8"><a name="070510111000014">One of our first and prime witnesses was the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, Bernard Ribeiro. In evidence, he explained to us that he could remember going to work as a surgeon expecting a list of seven patients in any one day, and that one day, when he was on his third patient, an accident happened on a local road. Everything was commandeered for the emergency, as we all accept, because an emergency is exactly that&#151;an emergency. However, three or four of his patients did not have their operation that day, because elective and emergency surgery facilities were located together, in the same hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para9"><a name="070510111000015">Why separation has not been the pattern throughout the lifetime of the NHS, I do not know. As somebody who thought he knew a bit about the NHS, it strikes me as obvious. Time and again, people have gone into hospital for elective surgery and had it postponed or delayed. Over the years and on a number of occasions, the issue of delays has been raised in the media and in debates in the House, but there have not been any systematic arrangements in the NHS to do what has been done in Dartford and other places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para10"><a name="070510111000016">We concluded in the report that</p>
<a name="70510h0001.htm_brev1"><a name="070510111000299"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;ISTCs have had a significant effect on spot purchase prices&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para11"><a name="070510111000017">they have fallen substantially&#151;</p>
<a name="70510h0001.htm_brev2"><a name="070510111000300"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;and increased patient choice, offering more locations and earlier treatment.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para12"><a name="070510111000018">If someone had visited my constituency five years ago for a knee or hip operation, they would have been given a long wait for surgery. The Committee did not find that out; it is my own comment on the issue. Some consultants, however, would have offered patients surgery nearby, in an independent hospital in Sheffield, and within a few weeks, providing that the patient was prepared to pay the surgeon a few thousand pounds. That choice is rarely discussed, and it has now gone. It is not offered to my constituents anymore, and I am very pleased about that. They are offered surgery in NHS hospitals and in a neighbouring constituency&#146;s ISTC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para13"><a name="070510111000019">We concluded that ISTCs have demonstrated good practice and pioneered some innovative techniques. However, good practice and innovation can also be found in NHS treatment centres and elsewhere, so there is not any convincing evidence that NHS facilities are systematically adopting techniques that ISTCs have introduced. We were told that ISTCs would spread best practice, but we did not see any evidence of it. However, with the non-collection of evidence, we could not make real comparisons between the independent sector and the NHS. It was always going to be difficult. </p>

<a name="70510h0001.htm_brev3"><a name="070510111000301"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;ISTCs have not made a major direct contribution to increasing capacity&#148;</p>

<meta name="Date" content="10 May 2007">

<notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2007 : Column 141WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para15"><a name="070510111000021">in the NHS. They represent a very small percentage of the overall capacity. I could not understand why ISTCs were not introduced in areas with high waiting lists, particularly when they were created to reduce elective surgery waiting times and lists. We tried to find out the reason behind elective surgery ISTCs. Was it the need to reduce waiting lists and to see patients quicker? Sadly, we could not find out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para16"><a name="070510111000022">The threat of competition from ISTCs may have had an effect on the NHS, but again, we have only anecdotal evidence to support that assertion. The Government have failed to collect the data to allow them to quantify the changes. In my own view, owing to the political sensitivity of rolling out the independent sector in that way, it is amazing that systematic data collection was not undertaken so that direct comparisons could have been made between ISTCs and the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para17"><a name="070510111000023">The Committee also found two significant areas in which the ISTCs were problematic. They proved to be poorly integrated with the NHS, partly because of the policy of additionality, under which they cannot employ staff who have recently worked in the NHS. In a sense, that was to protect the national health service, so that a situation did not arise where clinicians were moving into the independent sector and we wereunable to provide the service in the NHS. We therefore understand that point, too, although we did notthink that there had been enough integration, even early.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para18"><a name="070510111000024">We visited one establishment, which was not an ISTC, but a BUPA-run centre at Redwood in Surrey. We saw NHS staff and BUPA staff working alongside one another, to the general good of patients there, without any of the animosity that everybody predicated would arise if the independent and national health service sectors were mixed. There are clear lessons to be learnt from such examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para19"><a name="070510111000025">We also heard from some witnesses that standards of care were poor in ISTCs, although those claims were not supported by quantifiable evidence. The Committee concluded that there were substantial failings in data collection; and one could not say that the claims were true, based on what people had said about the failings in standards. One of the national organisations representing surgeons actually told us that there were high levels of complications in ISTCs, because people were having elective surgery, but then having to get back into the NHS pretty quickly because the treatment had notbeen up to standard. Although that had been said by some eminent people and on websites, we found no evidence for it whatever. However, the ground shifted a little when those witnesses were challenged, because they moved from complications on to the issue of quality.</p>

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="070510111000026"><a name="70510h0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="070510111000359"><b>Dr. Andrew Murrison (Westbury) (Con):</b>
 The right hon. Gentleman said that there had been insufficient data gathering in and around ISTCs. He also said that there was no evidence that the complication rate in ISTCs was worse than in comparable hospitals, but how does he tie the two together? If the data are not being collected, surely we cannot infer that the complication rate is higher or lower, either among ISTCs or between ISTCs and the mainstream NHS.</p>

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="070510111000027"><a name="70510h0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="070510111000360"><b>Mr. Barron:</b>
 On the face of it, I would agree with the hon. Gentleman. Some clinicians were clearly drawing those conclusions without the evidence for them, and we were quite critical of that, because the evidence was not there. However, the simple answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is that we asked other organisations, such as the General Medical Council, of which I am a lay member. When the GMC came before us as a witness, we asked whether anything in its fitness to practise proceedings showed that the independent sector was receiving more complaints about its professional attitude than the rest of the national health service. The simple answer was that there was nothing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para20"><a name="070510111000028">We looked where we could to make that judgment, and the simple answer is that, no, we cannot make that allegation. We were trying to make sense of the allegations that were made to us that, again, could only have been anecdotal and which are still around. I have no doubt that, like me, the hon. Gentleman will have received letters this week from the British Orthopaedic Association, which is still looking round, hoping at some stage to prove the allegations to us, although we have still not seen any of the evidence that we asked it for in July 2006. We criticised the association, in as much as the allegations that were being made were unsubstantiated. My personal view is that those allegations should be substantiated or withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="070510111000029"><a name="70510h0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="070510111000361"><b>Dr. Howard Stoate (Dartford) (Lab):</b>
 Just to echo that point, we did seek evidence for the allegations being made that there was a higher complication rate or a lower quality rate, but nobody was able to produce any. My right hon. Friend is quite right: we found no evidence, because none was presented to us, although the anecdotes continued to fly in all directions.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="070510111000030"><a name="70510h0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="070510111000362"><b>Mr. Barron:</b>
 And still do. None the less, we tried to get the evidence, although only through adverse results of fitness to practise proceedings by the regulatory bodies for doctors, which would have known, as they cover all doctors on the register, not just those in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="070510111000031"><a name="70510h0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="070510111000363"><b>Mr. Gordon Prentice (Pendle) (Lab):</b>
 Is it notsimply scandalous that we are pressing ahead with the second wave of ISTCs, even though the Healthcare Commission has had to postpone its report, which was due in the spring, until the summer, because it cannot get a handle on the data, which either are not available or are not being collected?</p>

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="070510111000032"><a name="70510h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="070510111000364"><b>Mr. Barron:</b>
 I stand by what we said in the report, and would therefore concur with my hon. Friend. Later, I will briefly mention the Government&#146;s response, which touched on the Healthcare Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para21"><a name="070510111000033">One of the most contentious parts of the ISTC programme was the use of take or pay contracts. They meant that the NHS had to pay independent providers for a set volume of work, whether or not it was carried out. The Government defended those contracts by saying that they were necessary to encourage the private sector to participate in the programme, although they also caused considerable disquiet among NHS providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para22"><a name="070510111000034">On the day we went down to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford, we visited a day treatment centre. It was early afternoon when we  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 May 2007">

<notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2007 : Column 143WH</b><br>
arrived and the centre was very quiet, running at about 50 per cent. of its capacity. Many reasons were given&#151;most of them anecdotal&#151;for why that centre and others were not as active as they should be. One reason was that the referral patterns were not as active as they should be, because some people did not want to refer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para23"><a name="070510111000035">I came across anecdotal evidence for that when I visited the ISTC in my area, in north Derbyshire, a couple of miles from my constituency. The guy who was the NHS-ISTC link there told me that the biggest problem was getting health professionals with contracts with the NHS to refer people there. I met two constituents when I was there, completely unplanned, and asked them, &#147;How did you know?&#148; &#147;Word of mouth from people who&#146;ve been in as patients,&#148; they said. &#147;So it wasn&#146;t your doctor, then?&#148; I asked. &#147;No, it wasn&#146;t,&#148; they replied, although they were quite happy with the treatment that they were receiving. That was a big issue for the Committee, although I do not know how big an issue it is today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para24"><a name="070510111000036">We concluded that although the decision to create the ISTC programme had not necessarily been a bad one and had brought several benefits, it had not been supported by evidence and was&#151;to quote the phrase used in the report&#151;a leap in the dark. I have heard that phrase on many occasions in the media since, but I have to tell my hon. Friend the Minister that that was the case. We often smile about the decision making&#151;or the lack of it&#151;in the NHS without good evidence, but it was clear that the original decision was driven by other things, not by any evidence at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para25"><a name="070510111000037">The Government response, which was published in October 2006, accepted some of the Committee&#146;s criticisms and said that there would be a series of improvements. One of those, which my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) has mentioned, was that the Healthcare Commission was asked to carry out a detailed comparison of the standards of care in ISTCs and those in the NHS. However, it is now many months down the road and we are still not there yet. That is disappointing. However, sooner than rush, and jump to conclusions, which people have been doing for a number of years&#151;albeit anecdotal, rather than real conclusions&#151;I hope that when that piece of work comes out, we will be able to go into what has been happening in detail and see what the real comparisons are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para26"><a name="070510111000038">Phase 2 of the ISTC programme would make provision for the training of doctors and other clinical staff a contractual requirement, which, in a sense, was a weakness. We could have had the additionality rule, whereby phase 1s were able to set up, but without poaching people from the NHS. It was right to ensure that phase 1s did not do that, because it would have weakened the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para27"><a name="070510111000039">On the other hand, there was a question whether we could have had surgeons in there, training. The volume of elective surgery done in ISTCs, undisturbed by anything else in the establishment&#151;there are no A and E departments to disturb the elective surgery list&#151;creates the ideal opportunity to obtain experience. My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford described it as an ideal time for young surgeons to practise on people. I would not have put it quite like that, but training with such a volume of surgery, on lists that are not complicated, would be much more predictable than training in a district general  <br>

hospital as an A and E tag-on, which might also disturb the list of the day. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will talk about phases 2s and whether that training is now taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para28"><a name="070510111000040">New ISTCs would also be better integrated with the local NHS, by requiring integration to be part of the planning process and allowing NHS staff to work in ISTCs during their non-contracted hours. Again, we felt that that would be a step towards breaking down the barrier that had been set up by the additionality rule, under which a person could not work in the NHS and also cross over to work in an ISTC. Does my hon. Friend the Minister have any experience of that to share with us?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para29"><a name="070510111000041">The Government committed to spending &#163;550 million a year on the ISTC programme. We were uncomfortable with that pledge because without doing the real work, one could not say whether that was driven by clinical need. As we said in the report:</p>
<a name="70510h0001.htm_brev4"><a name="070510111000302"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The decision to maintain the commitment to spend&#163;550 million per year despite changing circumstances has not been explained, and seems to sit uncomfortably with the Secretary of State&#146;s admission that &#145;in other [areas] it has become clear that the level of capacity required by the local NHS does not justify new ISTC schemes&#146;.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para30"><a name="070510111000042">At the time of the inquiry, for the first time that I had known, all the national health service institutions in my own area of south Yorkshire were united in their opposition to phase 2 in the area, so it did not go ahead. However, the Secretary of State told us that the money would still be spent. It was extraordinary for the Government to say that although they would not be going ahead with certain parts of phase 2, they would still spend the same amount of money that they were going to spend anyway. I do not know whether that has changed in the many months that separate us from the evidence that we took at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="70510h0001.htm_para31"><a name="070510111000043">I am looking forward to hearing my hon. Friend the Minister explain the Government&#146;s current plans and whether the commitment to &#163;550 million still stands even though a substantial number of phase 2s have not taken place. Obviously, the collection of data must also be significantly improved. I hope that the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report will show how well things are going, although I am not sure when we will get it. My hon. Friend the Member for Pendle said that we would get it in&#151;</p>

 I congratulate my colleagues on producing yet another splendid report. However, I do not congratulate the Government on their response, which was late and less than robust in dealing with the 25 recommendations. The Minister was a splendid member of the Health Committee. He made a unique contribution to our report on obesity, so he knows only too well how important our work is and how worth while it is for the Government to read our report carefully and respond to it positively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para2"><a name="070510111000055">To follow on from the Committee Chairman, the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), I should say that we heard some robust evidence. However, I can certainly recall one or two occasions when the evidence was less than robust and extremely disappointing. I completely absolve from that Mr. Bernard Ribeiro, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, to whom the Committee Chairman has referred. When I was Member of Parliament for Basildon, Mr. Ribeiro led the local teaching faculty. His evidence was impressive.</p>

Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) has mentioned the absence of the third party, but the two main parties have a real interest in considering the twists and turns of the issue. I should not forget the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), an independent Member of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para5"><a name="070510111000058">When measuring the success of the ISTCs, it is important that we remember the objectives of involving the private sector in the health service, about which the Government now seem enthusiastic. One objective is to increase the elective capacity available to the NHS to reduce waiting lists and times. The Opposition have a real interest in how that happens in practice. Other objectives include reducing spot purchase prices in the private sector, increasing patient choice within the NHS&#151;how that works out in practice has yet to be proved&#151;and encouraging best practice and innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para6"><a name="070510111000059">However, it is also important that we focus on the impact that ISTCs will have on local hospitals andthe NHS in general. One or two of the Members in the Chamber who are not on the Health Committee will hope to catch your eye and reflect on how the issues work out in practice, Dr. McCrea. I have recently received representations from the hospital in my constituency about the commissioning of an ISTC in Essex; the contracts are expected to be finalised at any time. I say to the Minister that I genuinely welcome the involvement of the private sector in the health service, and I was encouraged by our Committee&#146;s finding that the ISTCs have gone some way to meeting their objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para7"><a name="070510111000060">However, although I agree with the principle of involving to some measure the private sector in the health service, I object to the centrist slant put on the implementation by the Government. I intend to list the concerns that have been raised about ISTCs and the fact that the Government&#146;s response to the Health Committee document does not adequately address the matters at stake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para8"><a name="070510111000061">I say again that there is no point in the Health Committee spending great time producing reports if the Government seem not to take the findings too seriously or are less than robust in their response. I am delighted that we have been given the opportunity to have a debate, and I welcome that. However, I hope that the debate will be ongoing and that the Government will take our recommendations a little more seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para9"><a name="070510111000062">First, let me deal with waiting lists and times. Since the introduction of ISTCs, waiting lists have dropped. There is no doubt about that, so I congratulate the Government. However, it is disappointing that we are unsure about how far waiting lists have dropped. It is extraordinary, too. The NHS has changed in response to the ISTCs, or because of additional NHS funding, and the intense focus on waiting list targets over that period has had an adverse effect on clinical priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para10"><a name="070510111000063">The Health Committee was surprised that no attempt was made to assess the effect that competition from ISTCs would have on the NHS. It is extraordinary that no such attempt was made. The absence of conclusive information has prevented the Health Committee from making observations in a number of areas. Did that merely happen, or have our objectives been obstructed in some way? I do not know, but that is certainlyone of the main criticisms that I want to level at the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para11"><a name="070510111000064">Secondly, let me deal with the aim to reduce spot purchase prices. I welcome the Health Committee&#146;s conclusion that ISTCs have successfully reduced the purchase price as intended. We certainly welcome that. I was pleased to learn that as well as reducing the spot purchase prices in the private sector, ISTCs have a more general impact on charges in the private sector. That is excellent. The Health Committee was told by Robin Smith, chief executive of Mendip primary care trust, that fees for some operations had fallen by as much as 50 per cent. as a result of the ISTCs. That is splendid. The Committee also heard that the NHS is no longer as reliant on spot purchasing as it once was, and that is excellent news.</p>

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="070510111000065"><a name="70510h0002.htm_spnew3"><a name="070510111000370"><b>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</b>
 Before the hon. Gentleman moves off that point, the Government told us in their response to the report that the private sector is paid a premium of 11.2 per cent. more than NHS organisations to carry out exactly the same clinical procedure. When the Committee discussed those matters, did it think that that was fair?</p>

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="070510111000066"><a name="70510h0002.htm_spnew4"><a name="070510111000371"><b>Mr. Amess:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman has helpfully fired a missile right at the point that I was trying to make. The Minister will have heard the point, and I hope that he will address it when he responds. The hon. Gentleman should be reassured that during our inquiry those points were made in public, and it is right that the Minister should deal with the fairness of the &#147;competition element&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para12"><a name="070510111000067">Assessing the extent to which ISTCs have facilitated patient choice, a central objective of the programme, is not straightforward. ISTCs enable some patients to received treatment earlier than they might through the NHS, and they are also given a choice of location at which to be treated. The Committee reported:</p>
<a name="70510h0002.htm_brev0"><a name="070510111000306"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;ISTCs have for the present increased choice, offering more locations and earlier treatments.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para13"><a name="070510111000068">However, those choices are limited. For example, if the existence of ISTCs in the long run leads to the closure of NHS facilities, as we heard, patients will once again have limited choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para14"><a name="070510111000069">More worrying is that patients cannot make informed choices on where they receive treatment. We were given evidence to that effect in one sitting. There is a gulf in the information that relates to the clinical quality of treatments in ISTCs. The lack of centrally held information, such as that on complication rates and other measures of clinical quality, seems to have prevented patients and the Health Committee from drawing conclusions about the standard of care offered by ISTCs. We pressed the witnesses on that point, and we got nowhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para15"><a name="070510111000070">I was pleased to learn that the Department of Health recognises the need for information on clinical quality to be available to patients, and that it is looking at ways in which it can meet that challenge.

clinical outcome relevant to patient choice. I am not looking for a conspiracy, but that is all likely to happen when we adjourn for the summer recess and we will not be able to hold the Executive to account until the autumn. However, I want to flag up to the Minister that we are aware of those dates, which are important in the context of the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para17"><a name="070510111000072">Central to the aims of the programme is that ISTCs encourage best practice and innovation. The Health Committee found that:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para18"><a name="070510111000073">although it also reflected:</p>
<a name="70510h0002.htm_brev3"><a name="070510111000309"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;ISTCs are not necessarily more efficient than NHS Treatment Centres&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para19"><a name="070510111000074">Furthermore, it reported:</p>
<a name="70510h0002.htm_brev4"><a name="070510111000310"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Department claims that ISTCs drive the adoption of good practice and innovation in the NHS, but we received no convincing evidence which proved that NHS facilities were adopting in any systematic way techniques pioneered in ISTCs.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para20"><a name="070510111000075">We received no evidence at all about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para21"><a name="070510111000076">I appreciate the Government&#146;s response that ISTCs are in their early stages and cannot be expected to be more efficient than NHS treatment centres. The Committee accepts that. I agree with the Department of Health that ISTCs offer an excellent opportunity to draw together best practice from a wide variety of sources, in particular when the NHS and ISTCs are more integrated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para22"><a name="070510111000077">On the subject of best practice, I was particularly alarmed by the questions that were raised about the quality of staff employed in ISTCs. It has been argued that ISTCs are too reliant on overseas staff, and we heard evidence about that. As a result of the European legislation, the regulation of foreign-trained European economic area clinicians, who make up the majority of doctors in ISTCs, is not as rigorous as it should be. The evidence showed the problems that patients encounter with foreign doctors, which include language barriers since language tests cannot be imposed on doctors from the EEA. It is fundamental, in a situation that can be frightening and stressful for many, that patients can communicate effectively with the staff who will care for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para23"><a name="070510111000078">The Health Committee recommended that ISTC clinical appointments for overseas doctors should incorporate a standardised, independent assessment system based on competency. What thought has the Minister given to that critical recommendation? It does not seem to have been properly addressed in the Government&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para24"><a name="070510111000079">Finally, I want to mention my local hospital in Southend. One of the most important aspects of the ISTC programme is its impact on the NHS. Again, it is most frustrating that no attempt has been made systematically to assess and quantify the possible effects. John Gilham, chief executive of Southend university hospital&#151;he is an old boy of the school that I attended, St. Bonaventure&#146;s grammar school, and so the House will understand that I hold him in high esteem&#151;has brought some concerns to my attention about value for money. Mr. Gilham is concerned that as the ISTCs increase their overall capacity in Essex, possibly above initial assumptions, and if other trusts actively compete along with Southend hospital for  <br>

service choice, there is a greater probability that ISTC capacity will be underutilised. He has pointed out that underutilisation of capacity in the ISTCs will be underwritten&#151;I think that that may have been the concern of the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice). That would result in underwritten payments being made to the ISTC for no activity, with a financial cost throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para25"><a name="070510111000080">On the other hand, if the ISTC was successful in attracting activity, Southend and other acute trusts in Essex would need to reduce capacity further, with a consequent loss of income. That would increase the proportionate costs of existing overheads, which does not seem particularly fair. In some cases, hospitals will be limited in their ability to reduce overheads, which would in turn limit the opportunities for investment in improving core local health care facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para26"><a name="070510111000081">Southend university hospital does a splendid job, and it too is concerned about which specialities the ISTC would take responsibility for. The hospital could be required to provide more by way of emergency services than by way of a balanced mix of elective and emergency services, and that could have adverse affects on hospital funding. Local residents would be concerned about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para27"><a name="070510111000082">I understand that, in worst-case scenarios, local hospitals could even be forced to close. In February, Southend university hospital estimated that the financial impact of an Essex ISTC would be something in the region of &#163;7 million, which is a huge figure. The ISTC programme has repercussions for a number of local hospitals, and I have outlined pressing financial concerns regarding the costs of the programme for local hospitals and for the nation as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para28"><a name="070510111000083">Lack of information has marred the success of the ISTC programme, particularly with regard to patient choice. I was disappointed that the Department of Health seems to have hindered the Health Committee's inquiries by misrepresenting situations, withholding information and producing confusing figures. The Health Committee is non-partisan, but it is perhaps slightly easier for me to be robust on that point. Iam particularly concerned that the Department is withholding information regarding the significant effects that ISTCs could have on the finances of NHS hospitals. Why is the Department concealing such information, when hospital closures could result?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para29"><a name="070510111000084">Although I am confident that there is a bright future for private sector involvement in health care, I am currently frustrated that we cannot see the tangible benefits of the programme.</p>

 I rise not as a Committee member but as the representative of a constituency that has an independent sector treatment centre. The centre is run by Capio UK, which is a Swedish company. Let me say from the outset that I am not unsympathetic to the concept of using independent centres to treat NHS patients; it is hardly an innovation&#151;the NHS has commissioned waiting-list initiative cases from private providers for many years. There has perhaps been a policy move, however, in that the centres have institutionalised the practice of NHS patients being treated in private units at NHS expense by providing dedicated units for that purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="70510h0002.htm_para30"><a name="070510111000088">I spoke to Capio before the centre opened, when the concept was still at the design stage, and I visited the centre in the week of opening on 3 February 2006. It has 24 beds, six of which are in individual rooms, with nine in double rooms. It provides a mix of elective treatments in orthopaedic and general surgery, and has five consultation and examination rooms for out-patients, together with an in-house laboratory, and X-ray and ultrasound facilities. All of the patients come under the care of consultants from the York Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which provides reassurance about standards and helps to ensure satisfactory integration between the services provided at the centre and those provided through the trust. However, that drives a coach and horses through the concept of contestability. If the purpose of setting up independently owned, run and managed treatment centres to operate in competition with NHS trusts is to determine whether a different pattern of management or different ways of working can produce either better quality of care or more cost-effective care, that is unlikely to occur if the same doctors provide the same range of treatments in both places.</p>

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="070510111000089"><a name="70510h0002.htm_spnew8"><a name="070510111000375"><b>Dr. Stoate:</b>
 Does not it also drive a coach and horses through the idea of additionality? If the same consultants work in the independent sector and in the NHS trust, does not that undermine the very principle that the Government had in mind in the first place&#151;that independent sector treatment centres should use staff who are additional to the NHS staff, rather than staff who are already in the NHS with the result that centres could be accused of having poached them from services that might have been provided to the NHS?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a valid point, and I hope that the Minister will respond both to that and to the points that I have made. The most generous thing that can be said is that the Government haveput their toes in the water and have tested different policy responses to determine whether they improve standards of care or throughput or cost-effectiveness. The York experiment is one such experiment and it would be interesting to know the results of it with respect to quality of care and treatment costs. I shall address that further in a moment, but on the face of it  <br>

 I have not asked Capio that question, and it has not volunteered the answer, but my righthon. Friend makes an important point. I remember,12 or 14 years ago, when I was a member of the Select Committee on Health, picking up in the United States a publication called the Washington health <i>Checkbook</i>&#151;which is a pun in American, because they do not know how to spell the type of cheque that one writes to one&#146;s bank. It compared performance, hospital by hospital and consultant by consultant, of hospitals in Washington DC, northern Virginia and Maryland. It included interesting information about post-operative infection rates and re-admissions&#151;or perhaps it was mortality&#151;30 and90 days after discharge. It also included information about which consultants and hospitals were chosen by health professionals seeking treatment. That may be an important indicator of informed opinion about the quality of the care likely to be received from a hospital or consultant. I should welcome publication of such information in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="70510h0003.htm_para1"><a name="070510111000095">The Capio centre in York has attracted mixed reactions locally. One constituent came to my surgery to complain that he was offered treatment there&#151;at a private centre rather than an NHS trust. Concern has been expressed to me by the local medical committee and by consultants at York hospital that the centre is failing to treat as many patients as it is contracted to treat. The point was reinforced by a letter that a constituent who is a retired nurse sent to me recently. She said:</p>

York primary care trust has one of the worst, if not the worst, deficit of any PCT in the country, at about&#163;30 million. The York Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has been commissioned in the current year, 2007-08, to treat fewer patients than it did in 2006-07, as part of the PCT&#146;s effort to reduce the deficit. As a consequence of that reduced level of commissioning, the hospital is reducing staff by not filling vacant posts, and it is closing beds. Some of those beds are being closed because of a substantial increase in the capacity of the day surgery unit at York hospital, but I suspect that some are also being closed because 25 additional beds have been provided for elective surgery at the Clifton Capio centre. The question that comes to my mind is whether the provision of the Capio centre is a good use of resources by the local PCT. That is what prompted my questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="70510h0003.htm_para4"><a name="070510111000098">I tabled three questions on 11 January, and they were answered a couple of weeks later on 25 January. I asked, first,</p>

I thought about that for some time and on 2 March I wrote to Sir John Bourn, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to explain that I was dissatisfied with the Department&#146;s failure to answer my questions about NHS treatment paid for with NHS cash for NHS patients in my constituency.

Nor did the reply allow me to make any assessment of whether the cost of providing those treatments in the independent treatment centre is more or less, per case, than the cost of treating patients in the local NHS hospital. When a local primary care trust is deeply in deficit and cutting services to patients because of a shortage of money,it matters enormously to me, as the Member of Parliament, and to people locally, to know that their money is being well spent. That is why comparative information is so important. I tabled further questions to my hon. Friend quite recently to ask for that comparative information. He has not yet replied, and I hope that before he does so he will feed in his reflections on the debate and be able to provide me and Parliament with the information that we need to make comparisons.</p>

They are primarily about the quality of care; the relative cost-effectiveness of the independent centre and the service provided by the same doctors at the York Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and whether the creation of the independent centre has increased capacity and therefore the number of patients being treated in York.</p>

Trust was worried about its waiting lists and commissioned Weston Area NHS Trust to carry out a number of its routine orthopaedic procedures. It discovered that nine out of 147 knee replacements carried out by Weston required revision in the first year. That was absolutely appalling and about six times the expected revision rate. The criticism was not that it was an ISTC&#151;it was an NHS centre&#151;but that it was distant from the originators of the referrals. There was no communication between the centres, and different surgeons carried out the pre-operative assessment, the operation and the follow-up. Those problems seem to have led to much less accountability and problems with a distant service provided in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="70510h0003.htm_para22"><a name="070510111000117">Then I came across an earlier report in the &#147;Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons&#148; of 2005. It reviewed a relatively small number of patients who had been sent from the NHS in Exeter to the NHS in London for hip replacements. It found that over a period much longer than a year, the rate requiring revision was 12 out of27 hip replacements, 44 per cent., compared with about 4.9 per cent. of those done in Exeter at the same time. As in the Cardiff example, the differences in outcome were because of patient selection, implant selection, the absence of follow-up and the absence of audit and accountability. The report implied that whenever an operation is done distantly from the originating hospital and consultant, there are specific problems to consider. The success or lack of it thus appears to relate to the distance from the originating unit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="70510h0003.htm_para23"><a name="070510111000118">That brings me straight on to the problems of integration and additionality. If there is integration between the referral point and the point where the operation will be carried out, whether NHS or independent, there will be communication, and the same doctors will do the pre-op, the post-op and the operation. One could hope that things would be much more satisfactory altogether. On integration, the Government&#146;s response states in paragraph 19:</p>

 Surely, if the work is part of the job plan and is therefore part of the NHS work load, how can capacity be increased and NHS waiting times and lists reduced? My understanding is that those were the main rationales for ISTCs in the first place.</p>

 Capacity could be increased because there are occasions when theatre lists are not used completely because of a shortage of beds in NHS hospitals.

I was interestedin the Select Committee Chairman&#146;s comments that there will be none in Yorkshire, and I wonder whether there is a geographical split.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para0"><a name="070510111000134">That is quite a warning. There may be some hope, in that the Government are showing themselves a little more amenable to arguments against allowing that to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para1"><a name="070510111000135">It was proposed that clinical assessment, treatment and support services would hand vast chunks of work to the private sector, particularly in the north-west, in just six specialties&#151;orthopaedics, rheumatology, general surgery, ear nose and throat, gynae, and urology. However, there has been active opposition and cogent arguments from patients and professional groups. To my absolute amazement&#151;I hope that the Minister will not be quite so surprised&#151;those arguments have been listened to. Rheumatology has been removed from the list because the eight-week target can be met without it. In Health questions a couple of weeks ago, it emerged that Chorley hospital is being allowed to provide CATS services within the NHS and without going to private providers. If Chorley can do it, why cannot everyone else? What is special about Chorley? There is also something called ICATS, which I always thought stood for independent CATS. However, it does not; it stands for integrated CATS, which means that the service is integrated with the NHS. That is happening in Oldham, which shows that the NHS can do it, if it is allowed to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para2"><a name="070510111000136">Paragraph 50 of the Government response states:</p>
<a name="70510h0004.htm_brev1"><a name="070510111000329"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;ISTCs will only be introduced in health economies in which the SHA supports the case for them, and is committed to managing the capacity and financial consequences of ISTC implementation, particularly any impacts on existing NHS providers of elective care.&#148;</p>

Paragraph 56 of the Government response explains some of the extra costs borne by private providers and hence why they are more expensive. That is surely a reason for concentrating on the NHS; if it is cheaper why the dickens do we not just concentrate on it? The National Audit Office has been mentioned already, and paragraph 58 of the Government response says that the NAO is considering an investigation. I would be grateful to know if that is so because that is how we would find  <br>

 Not surprisingly, the Committee&#146;s report concluded that there are major benefits to separating elective and emergency care in treatment centres. The Committee realised that when we travelled in and around Kent and toured various treatment centres. What impressed me most was the NHS treatment centre at Dartford, which is entirely separate from the acute hospital although it is right next door. That centre delivered all the benefits of ISTCs, but without poor integration into the NHS, without the financial guarantees&#151;the so called take or pay element&#151;and without concerns about its potential adverse impact on existing NHS facilities. What worries me about the ISTC programme is not that ISTCs deliver poorer standards of care&#151;we found no hard, quantifiable evidence that that was the case&#151;but that the whole area of ISTCs seems to be an evidence-free policy zone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para9"><a name="070510111000146">Let me discuss each of the five objectives of the ISTC programme that we identified in the report. The first was to increase the elective capacity available in the NHS to reduce waiting lists. Waiting lists have come down dramatically and, for most procedures, waiting lists that were a problem in 1997 are no longer an issue. As the number of procedures performed by the ISTCs is such a tiny fraction of the total capacity of the NHS, it is unlikely that the credit for hugely reduced waiting lists can be attributed to ISTCs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para10"><a name="070510111000147">The second objective was to reduce the spot purchase price in the private sector. Before ISTCs, the NHS used the private sector on an ad hoc basis, and therefore it was inevitable that buying extra capacity would be expensive. That has changed and we have heard that fees for some operations have fallen by as much as50 per cent., which is because of ISTCs. However, because NHS waiting lists were massively reduced, the  <br>

private sector was under pressure to reduce its prices and seek partnership deals with the NHS, and we witnessed that when we toured some of the treatment centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para11"><a name="070510111000148">Thirdly, ISTCs were expected to encourage best practice and innovation. Being new and not constrained by existing practices, ISTCs have innovated&#151;particularly by improving their administrative processes and clinical management. However, that is hardly surprising, given that they deal with a regular and consistent case mix involving elective surgery only. Such innovations are not unique to the private sector. Indeed, the Department&#146;s own report in January 2005 was positive about the productivity and innovation in NHS treatment centres. Examples of good practice and efficiency exist in both ISTCs and NHS treatment centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para12"><a name="070510111000149">It is more difficult to establish the effect of ISTCs practice on the NHS as a whole. ISTCs were expected to stimulate reform in the NHS through competition. However, the Committee was not given sufficient evidence to assess whether ISTCs have spread best practice. It does not appear that NHS facilities have systematically adopted techniques pioneered by ISTCs. That is not to say that involvement of the private sector has not had a positive effect on some aspects of the national health service and the way that it does things. It is surprising that there has not been an innovative effect on the whole of the rest of the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para13"><a name="070510111000150">From my local experience, I am concerned about how ISTCs have been set up and are operating. In fact, I have had similar experiences to those of my hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley). My local ISTC in Burton treated its first patient inJuly 2006. The contract will run for five years until July 2011. It is run by the US health care provider Nations Healthcare on a take or pay contract, which means that the company is guaranteed the full contract value paid monthly, regardless of whether it treats patients or not. That means that the entire financial risk is met by the primary care trusts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para14"><a name="070510111000151">Over 12 months, North Staffordshire PCT&#146;s activities are supposed to comprise of 745 day care procedures and 612 ophthalmology outpatient attendances. However, few patients from north Staffordshire would choose to travel to Burton. At best, that would mean a journey of one and a quarter hours, possible even two hours. People would not necessarily choose to do that because it is a very difficult journey, and so nothing like the numbers contracted are being treated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para15"><a name="070510111000152">Nations Healthcare recognised that at the outset and paid for taxis, but that is no longer the case. Patients, therefore, have to get themselves to their first outpatient appointment, then they have to get themselves there for the procedure, and then for any subsequent follow-ups. Like the Select Committee, I was unable to unearth the exact figures for the contract and how much actually is being delivered. However, one of my Stoke-on-Trent colleagues, my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher), told me that he had heard that over six months it had treated just 59 patients from the Stoke On Trent PCT. That is costing&#151;wait for this!&#151;about &#163;2 million a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para16"><a name="070510111000153">On that basis, North Staffordshire PCT must be losing at least &#163;500,000 a year on the contract. That cannot be justified. As my hon. Friend the Member for City of York said, that is particularly the case when the  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 May 2007">

<notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2007 : Column 160WH</b><br>
PCT is carrying a &#163;4.1 million deficit. If that is not the case, and those figures are completely off the wall, I would like to hear from Nations Healthcare what the true figures are. If such rumours are circulating within the health economy of north and east Staffordshire, they need to be refuted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para17"><a name="070510111000154">Anecdotally, I know that the Burton treatment centre is working well below capacity. Despite that, the contract management board, which is supposed to manage the centre, has had to raise numerous concerns about the performance of the treatment centre&#151;in particular, breaches of waiting list targets, which is absolutely ridiculous given that the centre is working at such low capacity. Why can it not meet its waiting list targets if it is working at very low capacity? Not surprisingly, several management staff have been suspended. However, with a guaranteed income, Nations Healthcare has no incentive to get its act together because the treatment centre&#146;s services are not even loaded on to the directory of services. Even if general practitioners wanted to, or their patients chose to, patients could not be referred electronically to the Burton centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para18"><a name="070510111000155">A further problem has been Nations Healthcare&#146;s failure to contact patients waiting to transfer from the waiting list of the University hospital of North Staffordshire. It failed to contact them with appointment times so, not surprisingly, patients who had been persuaded to go to Burton have gone back on the waiting list of the University hospital of North Staffordshire. The problem is that none of that affects Nations Healthcare&#146;s pocket. It just ends up ripping of PCTs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para19"><a name="070510111000156">In response to the Select Committee&#146;s concern about the take or pay contracts, the Government, in its response, said that where there is underutilisation, the Department works co-operatively with the PCTs and the treatment centre to move activity to a later stage in the life of the contract. Presumably that means that the contract will continue past the five years for which currently it can run.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para20"><a name="070510111000157">I understand that something like that might be happening in Burton where some of the underused capacity is being carried forward into 2007-08, but that will not necessarily address the reluctance of patients from north Staffordshire to go to Burton. Perhaps, as the Government suggested in their response, case mix changes could be looked at. For instance, I am sure that if audiology was on offer, those destined to wait years for a digital hearing aid would be only too happy to travel to Burton for earlier treatment. Is that being considered? And if not, why not? It would certainly deliver added value locally.</p>

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="070510111000158"><a name="70510h0004.htm_spnew3"><a name="070510111000385"><b>Dr. Stoate:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree with me that there is a perverse incentive for companies on a take or pay contract, because the fewer operations that they carry out, the lower their costs, and therefore the larger their profit? The incentive is to underperform. Is that not part of the problem? It is one of the reasons that they do not seem to be trying too hard to bring patient numbers up to where they should be.</p>

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="070510111000159"><a name="70510h0004.htm_spnew4"><a name="070510111000386"><b>Charlotte Atkins:</b>
 Absolutely. They are not willing even to contact patients on another hospital waiting list or to overcome the travel problem by providing taxis. But why should they? There is no incentive. My hon. Friend is absolutely right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para21"><a name="070510111000160">One way in which to make the take or pay contracts deliver something approaching value for money is to extend the length of the contract to take up unused activity. However, that will not help if patients do not want to travel. That problem can be resolved onlyif Burton provides services generally unavailable elsewhere in the health economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para22"><a name="070510111000161">The treatment centre is adding some capacity to publicly funded health care. But after all that was the original objective of ISTCs, and one with which I have no problem. Obviously, it makes sense. Clearly, they have a role. However, over the last 10 years, the health service has changed vastly; it has even changed vastly since the programme was established. I cannot understand why if everything else is up for change, the programme cannot be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para23"><a name="070510111000162">PCT&#146;s deficits are being increased as a result of being locked into treatment centre contracts that will not deliver to local people. Surely, the Government will not commit themselves to another &#163;550 million a year fora second wave of ISTCs without addressing those changed circumstances. Already, waiting lists are down massively, so why are we looking at a second phase. Clearly, circumstances have changed significantly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para24"><a name="070510111000163">The Department tells us that before an ISTC is agreed, there is a robust&#151;its word&#151;process to ensure that there is local support and a capacity need for each elective ISTC. From stories I hear, that does not appear to have happened in Staffordshire. It was more like the Shropshire and Staffordshire strategic health authority presenting it as a done deal&#151;a fait accompli. That was the very same strategic health authority that tried to force a Staffordshire-wide primary care trust on us. Ministers intervened then and gave us the local primary care trust for which I campaigned over nine months. I am very grateful to Ministers for doing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para25"><a name="070510111000164">I urge the Minister to intervene on the Burton treatment centre to ensure that it pays its way and delivers something approaching value for money; to ensure delivery of a service that people want, either by changing the case mix or ensuring that that purpose-built facility delivers; to ensure that PCTs do not have to spend thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of pounds for a service that it is not getting, and to ensure that it deals effectively with patients and that it does not just sit back and expect GPs to transport patients&#151;it cannot even be bothered to ensure that its services can be contracted electronically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para26"><a name="070510111000165">I know that the Burton centre has been open for less than a year, but I do not believe that an NHS facility would be allowed to fail as conclusively as that treatment centre. I therefore hope that the Minister will urgently talk to the treatment centre and to the strategic health authority to find out what is going on. It is not fair to expect primary care trusts to deliver on their deficits, to plan and to ensure that they cut back on their over-expenditure when they are having to drain money away to a centre that is not delivering for local people in my constituency.</p>

securing the debate, which has proven to be extremely informative. Hon. Members have raised extraordinarily interesting points, which I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will deal with in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para27"><a name="070510111000167">My right hon. Friend has set out the terms of reference under which independent sector treatment centres were set up, and we have listened to hon. Members mentioning some of the pros and cons of those issues. I would like to keep things even simpler than that. In my view, the mark of whether the ISTC programme is a success or not is, first, does it improve patient care and, secondly, does it do so at a reasonable cost?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para28"><a name="070510111000168">To answer that question, I would like to go back a few years. I have been in the health service for many years and I can think back to many times when waiting lists were far worse than they are now. Not too long ago, it was not unusual to wait two to three years for a hip replacement. The wait for someone with a hernia was not much different. Similarly, for many orthopaedic procedures, there were very long waiting waits and very poor provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para29"><a name="070510111000169">The NHS at that time was simply not modernising as it needed to do. Outmoded treatments were still being offered by some centres. Not every centre was offering the most up-to-date surgical techniques. There were reasons for that. One reason was that some surgeons simply were not trained to the high level that we would expect. In other areas, they did not have access to the equipment that they needed for more modern surgical techniques, because the hospital simply did not see those as a major issue. Often, there was underutilisation of capacity: there were empty beds and surgeons were sitting around unable to operate because theatre capacity was not sufficient. Poor capacity in intensive care units meant that operations had to be postponed because there was not the staff, the equipment or the facilities to ensure safe operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para30"><a name="070510111000170">We have heard this afternoon that it was very common at one time for operations to be cancelled at the very last minute&#151;sometimes when the patient had already been sedated&#151;because an emergency had come in. At other times, people received a phone call the previous day to say, &#147;I&#146;m sorry. Your bed&#146;s been taken by an emergency. Come back next week and we might be able to help you then.&#148; That was all too often, and all too depressingly, the case. People would have put a lot of time and effort into planning for their operation. They would have talked to their family; they would have talked to their children. Their husbands or partners would have taken time off work. They would have made arrangements for their children to be cared for. They would do all that only to find the day before that the operation was cancelled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="70510h0004.htm_para31"><a name="070510111000171">I have always been an advocate of complete separation of acute treatment and elective treatment and having them in completely different sectors. I am very pleased that the Government have responded to the many calls made by me and others for separation of acute and elective surgery in particular, so that those operations simply would not be cancelled any more, because the elective centre would have in effect ring-fenced staff, ring-fenced facilities and ring-fenced theatres. That is extremely good news.</p>

any of the things that I have mentioned. Surgeons could have been trained in the latest techniques; hospitals could have chosen to buy the latest equipment; operating theatres could have been upgraded in line with best practice; and capacity issues could have been addressed by individual hospitals and trusts as and when they chose. However, that was not happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para1"><a name="070510111000173">For all the problems with independent treatment centres, they have acted as an enormous spur or atleast as a driver to try to bring all centres up to thebest standard. We have heard from colleagues this afternoon that many NHS centres have achieved that. The question is: would they have achieved it if we had not been having a debate over the past 10 years on whether we increase capacity by using the independent sector. My view is that, although the overall effect of independent treatment centres has been quite small in terms of numbers, they have raised the debate to a level to which it was not previously being raised, which in itself has been a driver for best practice improvements in other parts of the sector. Therefore, the programme should be welcomed at least as an extremely useful debating point and a very useful springboard for improving practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para2"><a name="070510111000174">There is no question but that the establishment of ISTCs was driven by a wish to reduce surgical waiting lists and to improve cost-efficiency in the NHS, which in itself should be laudable. The centres have indeed offered more patient choice. Where they exist, patients and doctors have an extra choice over and above the existing system. Many ISTCs have been able to introduce best practice and have been successful in introducing a range of innovative working practices. They have, therefore, been able to improve patient care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para3"><a name="070510111000175">I have done some research on the issue and had a look around the country to see what has been achieved in various centres. I shall mention just a few examples. In some areas, mobile solutions have been provided whereby the provider supplies clinical services from mobile units set up on agreed sites, particularly to improve access in remote areas. There has been the construction of new facilities designed around the clinical flow of patients and thus improving productivity. That is a brand new concept for designing services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para4"><a name="070510111000176">There has been improved process design, to improve the patient&#146;s experience by increasing throughput without compromising patient safety or clinical quality. Mobile ophthalmology units, for example, are capable of dealing with 20 to 23 cases a day due to streamlined processes facilitating efficient use of theatre space and resources. Extraneous administrative processes have often been put online, so that surgery is not delayed and can commence at the start of the working day. Some centres have stocked a smaller range of prostheses, allowing theatre staff to become more proficient and more productive in the use of a more limited range of prosthetic devices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para5"><a name="070510111000177">Some centres have used local anaesthetics instead of general anaesthetics for primary joint replacements, thereby reducing the anaesthetic risk and the average length of stay to five days from the eight days previously experienced in the NHS. Some centres have introduced blood conservancy and recycling measures that reduce the need for transfusions. That is an important issue as well. However, none of those issues  <br>

is exclusive to those centres. All those things could have been achieved elsewhere, but the fact is that in too many cases they have not been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para6"><a name="070510111000178">That said, it is important not to over-emphasise the impact that ISTCs have had. The British Medical Association, for example, contends that</p>
<a name="70510h0005.htm_brev0"><a name="070510111000333"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the participation in research, teaching, and peer-reviewed activity that is vital for innovation in healthcare is not ideally suited to the working environments found within most, if not all, ISTCs. The employment of overseas clinical teams often on short-term, rotating contracts in ISTCs is one example of such a possible shortcoming.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para7"><a name="070510111000179">It is also clear to me that ISTCs are not necessarily more efficient than NHS treatment centres. I was very proud that the Health Committee chose to visit my local unit in Dartford&#151;the Woodland centre&#151;which has been extremely efficient. Indeed, many colleagues have referred to its very good practice and the very streamlined approach that it has taken, integrating the NHS treatment centre into the mainstream hospital, thereby getting many of the benefits and very few of the disadvantages of the system. In fact, that centre has achieved a theatre utilisation rate of 90 per cent., which by any standard can be considered very high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para8"><a name="070510111000180">Similarly, the Nuffield orthopaedic centre in Oxford, where care pathways were written with primary care involvement, has been successful in achieving a reduction in the length of stay from 12 days to just five days. In Goole, the average length of stay in orthopaedics has been reduced from 12 to about six days, thanks to improved pre-operative assessment techniques.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para9"><a name="070510111000181">It seems that innovation in most ISTCs is largely a matter of better processes and clinical management, rather than revolutionary surgical techniques. It is probable that it has been driven by the regular and consistent case mix, and stems from the elective surgery only status of all treatment centres, rather than the independent sector&#146;s involvement in the treatment centre programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para10"><a name="070510111000182">A number of written submissions to the inquiry also made the point that some specialties and operations may be more suited to the ISTC system than others. Cataract surgery, for example, is a relatively simple patient pathway and is well suited to the system. A general practitioner or an optician can make the diagnosis and the patient is then referred to an ophthalmologist. A relatively straightforward operation is performed and the patient can often be discharged with no follow-up at all, apart from perhaps a visit to their local GP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para11"><a name="070510111000183">However, many other surgical procedures are not so straightforward. A patient with rheumatoid arthritis, for example, who requires joint replacement surgery may have poor bone density, other medical conditions, a complicated drug regime and mobility problems, and therefore probably is not a suitable case for the type of procedure that I have described. They may need far more follow-up and rehabilitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para12"><a name="070510111000184">Whilst ISTCs might be ideal models for simple, one-stop surgery, they do not work so well with complex conditions that require continuing care. Many NHS hospitals and departments have developed multi-disciplinary teams to manage the rehabilitation of post-operative and other patients, who may be seen for several weeks after their discharge. As ISTCs do not provide multi-disciplinary teams, they cannot and do not provide such a complete care package, and therefore do not have to bear the  <br>

financial consequences of aftercare, which the NHS often has to pick up. Concerns have also been raised about the tendency of some ISTCs to cherry-pick patients, and to leave the more difficult cases that require significant amounts of post-operative care to the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para13"><a name="070510111000185">There is also an issue with training, which has been mentioned. In giving ISTCs that are run by non-NHS staff responsibility for carrying out a large number of procedures in key specialties, we might be making it more difficult for junior doctors to gain the requisite amount of experience in those areas. I know that the Government have looked into that, and I am keen to hear what the Minister has to say on it. The fact remains that if we are to train the next generation of surgeons to the very high standards that we require so that they are able to provide a good service, they must gain a lot of experience with routine patients as well as more complex cases. Many of my colleagues who work in general surgery are worried that if all the routine, relatively straightforward cases are sent to the independent sectors, leaving only the complex and rare cases behind, that does not leave a good training base to provide all-round, well-trained surgeons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para14"><a name="070510111000186">Some of those problems are not only expensive, but can slow down patient care, and are inconsistent with the Government&#146;s stated aim of moving more care out specialist secondary services and into primary care services. People have raised with me their concerns that many of the procedures that are carried out in ISTCs could be performed by trained GPs in their surgeries, such as the removal of certain cysts, minor skin procedures, endoscopies, colposcopies and so on. Indeed, many such procedures are already being provided by specialist, trained GPs. If we steer many of those patients to ISTCs, we will maintain high costs and will risk flying in the face of Government policy to transfer muchmore of that kind of care back into the primary care sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para15"><a name="070510111000187">In conclusion, I think that there is a role for ISTCs in the NHS as additional providers of services, but they need to be carefully managed. We should use best practice in those services to direct and drive care and modernisation within the NHS, to act as a focus for improved efficiency and to show hospitals across the NHS what can be achieved. They can be a useful pilot to show how they can be a genuinely useful addition to NHS capacity that improves the patient experience at a cost that really is affordable. However, we need to recognise the lack of transparency in some of these issues&#151;many hon. Members have mentioned that. Provided that ISTCs do not undermine the NHS&#146;s existing work, they can and should be seen as a useful addition to what we currently offer.</p>

 I congratulate the Chairman and members of the Health Committee on producing the report, which is excellent and very fair.

I hope that the Minister is going to say something about those.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para16"><a name="070510111000189">It is a mark of the times in which we live that the campaign group &#147;Keep Our NHS Public&#148; has accused Ministers of acting ideologically because of their apparent preference for supporting the independent sector in health care. I certainly would not accuse Ministers of being ideological in that respect, but I shall ask the Minister to account for many of the elements of ISTCs that were highlighted by the Select Committee. What matters for us is what works. Like Ministers, I hope, we have no particular ideological hang-ups about public, private and not-for-profit. Surely what matters&#151;I hope that we can all agree on this&#151;is what delivers outcomes for patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para17"><a name="070510111000190">The report focused very well on issues such as choice, quality, cost-effectiveness and innovation. We, too, need to focus on them, as well as on supplementary areas such as training, about which we have rightly heard today. We need to focus on the impact that ISTCs might have on those areas, and on the extent to which those issues might have been overlooked by Ministers in their pursuit of ISTCs. There is clearly a case to answer, because some of those elements have been recognised and addressed as part of phase 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para18"><a name="070510111000191">I know that this matter is of great interest to the Labour party and has caused quite a lot of unhappiness. It divided the party conference and caused some problems for the Health Secretary at that time. Helpful as ever, my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) offered some words to the Health Secretary back in September. He said that she</p>
<a name="70510h0005.htm_brev1"><a name="070510111000334"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;would not have this problem if she had listened to our advice and created genuine competition, not preferential competition, which means that independent treatment centres currently carry out 73 per cent. of work, but are paid for 100 per cent. This is why hospitals are closing down wards.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para19"><a name="070510111000192">The Department of Health has analysed the possible effects of independent sector treatment centres on district general hospitals, but has refused to be entirely candid about the results of that analysis. That is a great pity. We have heard about our ability to hold the Government to account, which we do largely through Select Committees. If the Department of Health feels unable to share that kind of information, that degrades our ability, as parliamentarians, to call the Government to account and is a serious matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para20"><a name="070510111000193">We need to know why the Committee and the House have been denied that information. That is particularly important at this point, because district general hospitals are facing something of a pincer movement. They are facing threats from ISTCs and from the move towards tertiary centres. We have had the Boyle and Alberti reports recently, and the idea that trauma should be centralised and that some accident and emergency departments should, perhaps, be downsized. Those factors have serious implications for the concept of district general hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para21"><a name="070510111000194">Ministers are right to say that nothing should stand still and that a model that was created in the 1960s needs to be updated. However, we need to celebrate what is best in our health service and we must also remember that district general hospitals provide a whole range of things in addition to direct patient outputs. We have talked about training and I hope that the Minister will talk about it a little more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para22"><a name="070510111000195">Tomorrow, I am going to visit the Gloucestershire Royal hospital, where I worked briefly before I was elected. No doubt, the hospital will want to discuss what phase 2 will mean for it. There seems to be some confusion out there in the provider arm of the national health service about what independent sector treatment centres there are going to be and when contracts are going to be signed off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para23"><a name="070510111000196">It is also important to recognise that it is not only large district general hospitals that are affected by ISTCs. The hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) mentioned primary care, and rightly so. Community hospitals will also be affected. I know, to my cost, that a very valuable cataract service at Westbury community hospital has ceased to exist; of course, those sorts of services are threatened when ISTCs appear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para24"><a name="070510111000197">One of the selling points of ISTCs was the idea of innovation: that ISTCs were going to innovate and bring new things to health services. There is nothing particularly new about stand-alone centres of these sorts. I recall a hospital called Black Notley near Braintree, which closed down in 1998. It had provided services for local communities, particularly cold orthopaedic surgeries, since 1904. We can sign up to the concept that cold and non-acute cases might usefully be separated from emergency cases if cold cases are consistently being delayed or de-prioritised. We must also recognise that there need not necessarily be an ISTC model delivering services. Other hon. Members have discussed how that problem, which affects the cold, elective part of the health care service when it is faced with the priority of emergencies&#151;of course, priorities come with emergencies&#151;can be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para25"><a name="070510111000198">I am also less than convinced, as I believe the Committee was, by the idea that ISTCs brought innovations to the health service. Interestingly, Professor Karol Sikora was talking about cancer treatment on this morning&#146;s &#147;Today&#148; programme, and parallels do exist because his concern is not that the NHS is not good at innovation and research, but simply that it is not terribly good at rolling out its results. I have seen no evidence&#151;&#151;neither, clearly, has the Committee&#151;&#151;for suggesting that ISTCs, rather than the wider service, have been the crucible for innovation. The problem has been that the wider service has perhaps not rolled out innovations in quite the way that we might have hoped; in a sense, they have been reinvented in a number of ISTCs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para26"><a name="070510111000199">One or two hon. Members mentioned the avoidance of cancellations. I support measures that will avoid the awful situation where people are phoned on the morning of their operation and told, &#147;Don&#146;t come in, because we are full. We have emergencies and we simply cannot accommodate you.&#148; Such situations are not always due to emergency surgery, because they can occur for a range of other reasons. Recently, wards have unfortunately had to be closed because of infections. I do not discern any difference in the pace of that cancellation rate. The rate remains, and these situations are deeply distressing, particularly for patients who have worked themselves up for operations. I am thinking of elderly patients and those requiring hip replacement surgery. Often such people have starved themselves overnight only to be told not to come in, sometimes on a serial basis. I commend Ministers to examine measures that might avoid that happening. This issue is important and cancellations are still occurring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para27"><a name="070510111000200">The case mix on pages 12 and 13 of the report shows that ISTCs are not necessarily doing the sort of stuff that is likely to be subject to cancellation. Orthopaedics are clearly in the frame, because where an emergency requires theatre time, cold cases&#151;orthopaedic cases and elective cases&#151;will be cancelled, but ISTCs are doing a range of other things: ophthalmology; dermatology; ear, nose and throat&#151;ENT; rheumatology; and endoscopies. Such things require different practitioners from those who might be involved in emergency cases, different facilities and different operating theatres. It is unlikely that ISTCs, certainly as currently configured, will make a big impact on avoiding hospital operation cancellations. I wish that they would, but I simply do not see it happening, given the case mix displayed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para28"><a name="070510111000201">Training is vital and topical. Ministers have to deal with the debacle of modernising medical careers and the medical training application system&#151;MTAS. There is a real problem in the training of junior doctors. Phase 1 ISTCs did not do training in any meaningful and systematic way. To be fair, the Government response appears to have recognised that and at least says that they will ensure that training is a part of phase 2, but the Minister needs to give us more detail. What does he mean by training? Who will be trained? To what standard will they be trained? Will those doing the training be competent? Will they be in a position to train juniors in the kind of competency-based way that we expect these days?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para29"><a name="070510111000202">It is bizarre that additionality means that NHS juniors will not be trained because we are effectively importing overseas doctors under the additionality rule. That is odd indeed. I hope that as part of phase 2 and the contracts which we believe are up for signing shortly, Ministers will ensure that additional training capacity is created. We were told recently in the House that it would be, in order to sort out some of the shortfall that we expect shortly and the medical unemployment that seems likely. This seems to be an opportunity, and I should be interested to hear from the Minister what he has done with independent sector providers to ensure that capacity for training within ISTCs has been upgraded to fulfil the Health Secretary&#146;s promise that additional places will be created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="70510h0005.htm_para30"><a name="070510111000203">There appears to be an element of job loss within the service. I recently received a note from a consultant at the Royal United hospital in Bath on the impact of ISTCs on his institution. It starts extremely well, saying:</p>

It is no surprise that job-losses are felt necessary by our trust&#146;s management. One contributing factor is the so-called Treatment Centre...nearby in Shepton Mallet...which is treating straightforward patients for routine ops at an inflated tariff and leaving the more complex cases as well as sorting out their errors, to the local NHS.&#148;</p>

The British Orthopaedic Association, which is vilified directly and indirectly in the report and the Government response, says that at least 30 trained surgeons with certificates of completion of training are unable to get jobs and cannot work in ISTCs because of the rules on additionality. The Minister says that phase 2 will involve a relaxation of the additionality rule, which must be welcome. Apparently, there is a list of shortage professions whose members will not be admitted to work in ISTCs but everybody else, by implication, will be. But of course, shortages mean many things and one cannot simply identify a shortage profession. Is that list speciality-sensitive? Is it geographically defined? Is it grade-specific?</p>

They are not all the same, and fitting a Charnley or an Exeter requires surgeons to have done a course for them and the team to be familiar with the kit.

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para9"><a name="070510111000220">The right hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that there is no evidence. The evidence is what I want the Department of Health to acquire. That is what it should have done, then the Minister could have provided the evidence and said whether it refuted any allegations that there are problems with ISTCs. We cannot ignore such remarks from the front line, and if we do, we do so at our great peril and with complacency, which is not what our constituents expect&#151;mine certainly do not expect that of me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para10"><a name="070510111000221">Although the Liberal Democrats&#146; absence has freed up a bit of time for us, the hour is late and I am sure we all want to get away in good time. My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) made an important point about language proficiency. The international English language testing system does not apply to European economic area doctors, but does to those from outside the EEA. The Committee rightly pointed out that that is inconsistent. It is not acceptable for Ministers to say that it is up to the employing trust to ensure that people are proficient in the English language. The issue is safety-critical, and if we do not require proficiency to be demonstrated by Polish surgeons, but require that from surgeons from India or Pakistan, who in my experience have excellent English of course, what on earth is the point of having the test at all?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para11"><a name="070510111000222">Last month, the Prime Minister delivered what we assume will be his last major speech on health care to the King&#146;s Fund. The fund&#146;s chief executive pointed out that the success of the reforms will be measured by their sustainability. The Prime Minister did not disagree, and I should be interested to know whether the Minister agrees or disagrees with that assertion. For example, how sustainable does he believe independent sector treatment centres will be, particularly phase 2?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para12"><a name="070510111000223">The Committee heard that of the 31 schemes proposed under phase 2, seven will not go ahead. I should be interested to know from the Minister why that is, and why the strategic health authorities that are responsible for the seven schemes will, nevertheless, be obliged to make independent provision by other means? We seem to be going back to Sir Nigel Crisp&#146;s assertion at the beginning of last year that 10 per cent. of deliverables should be forthcoming from the independent sector.</p>

I have a copy of the list in front of me, but it needs updating, because the Nuffield group&#146;s project for the west midlands has apparently been cancelled. The Nuffield group has pulled out, citing costs and delays, although we understand today that the BUPA contract for the north-west has been signed off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para24"><a name="070510111000236">If I may, I shall begin with a point about perspective. There is often a great deal of hot air vented and ink spilled on the subject, but it is important to remember that by the end of the decade under the current ISTC programme, about 5 per cent. of NHS elective activity will be carried out in the independent sector. We must place the issue in perspective and consider the huge range of work that goes on in our national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para25"><a name="070510111000237">On another point of context, last year &#163;216 million was spent on procedures through centrally arranged procurements, compared with the &#163;80 billion-plus that was spent in the national health service. I am not trying to minimise the issues that we are here to discuss, but it is an important point of context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para26"><a name="070510111000238">I am disappointed that my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) has not stayed for the close of this important debate, although I was pleased that he was present earlier. If he had stayed, I should have asked him and others who question the value of the ISTC programme, and more broadly, the Government&#146;s work over the past 10 years on reducing waiting times and lists, to consider the individual patient benefit of such work. Too often, we quote the statistics, but there are many examples of lives that have been changed and improved as a result of the action that has been taken. The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) said that today is a day when we look back over the past10 years, so perhaps he will not mind if I do so, as Ministers are accustomed to do, with a few figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para27"><a name="070510111000239">In the first quarter of 1997, 284,000 patients were waiting more than six months for in-patient treatment. My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate), who spoke with incredible knowledge about the subject, was absolutely right: such waits were commonplace at the time. If we think about the human cost of that statistic that we throw out, it is enormous. Today,350 patients are waiting more than six months. In 1997, more than 30,000 people were waiting more than12 months, and today, no one is waiting longer than12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para28"><a name="070510111000240">I would have said to my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle that opponents of the ISTC programme rarely ask how many patients in the past were forced to go private. We would never have known about such spend in the private sector, because patients had to fork out for it out of their own pockets. We all know that that is what happened to many people. They were left in such a position when NHS waiting lists were that length, and they were forced to dig into their own pockets&#151;their own savings&#151;to obtain their operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para29"><a name="070510111000241">I shall argue that, because of the changed relationship between the NHS and the private sector, in which the two work together for the benefit of not only the NHS but its patients, fewer and fewer people now face that reality. Waiting lists continue to come down, and Government Members should be extremely proud of that fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para30"><a name="070510111000242">We have achieved a good measure of agreement today about the principles. My hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley), who asked some very pointed questions about the ISTC programme, began by saying that he did not disagree with the principles, and that was largely the spirit of today&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para31"><a name="070510111000243">I shall refresh Members&#146; memories about the reasons behind the programme. The Department of Health conducted national capacity planning exercises with strategic health authorities in 2002 and 2004. Through those exercises, SHAs estimated the additional capacity in elective treatment and diagnostics that was required to meet key public service agreement waiting times targets, and they identified how much of that capacity would need to be sourced from the independent sector. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para32"><a name="070510111000244">The capacity planning outcomes provided the basis for the first wave of national procurements of elective and diagnostics capacity from the independent sector. The procurement process was designed to allow the independent sector to work within local health care economies to provide solutions that met local requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para33"><a name="070510111000245">The specific aims, as the hon. Member for Southend, West said, were to help to provide the capacity needed to deliver swift access to the system for NHS patients, thus reducing waiting lists and times; to support the implementation of patient choice; to stimulate innovative models of service delivery and drive up productivity; to bring down the cost to the NHSof spot purchasing; and to introduce choice and contestability between providers of health care services for NHS patients in order to drive improvement in quality and efficiency throughout all providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para34"><a name="070510111000246">The first independent sector treatment centre opened in October 2003, and 23 ISTCs are now delivering services to NHS patients. At the end of February, ISTCs had provided more than 110,000 elective procedures for NHS patients, and independent sector contracts had delivered more than 280,000 diagnostic tests. There was additional procurement on top of the ISTC programme, so altogether, centrally procured independent sector schemes have delivered well over 500,000 procedures, diagnostic tests and episodes of care for NHS patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para35"><a name="070510111000247">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) asked me to provide him with an update. The figure stood at 300,000 in October 2006 when the Government responded to the Committee&#146;s report. It is a measure of how much more the independent sector has contributed in that time. Utilisation of the wave 1 ISTC contracts is high and rising&#151;at 92 per cent. in February 2007. Cumulatively, that represents 85 per cent. overall to March 2007, as has been mentioned. Patient satisfaction is also high, and was measured to be 97 per cent. across wave1 schemes in March 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para36"><a name="070510111000248">Colleagues have made some extremely high-quality points and I now want to go into the detail of those. My right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley, the Chairman of the Committee, spoke about whether there was any evidence of capacity planning and whether the programme had been thought through sufficiently. I assure him that the figures across the wave 1 schemes show high utilisation rates, as ISTCs bed down in their local health care economies. In some cases the utilisation rate is higher than the figures that I have just given, and in one or two cases it is almost100 per cent. That suggests to me that the exercise conducted by the Department has shown that that capacity both was needed and is being used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para37"><a name="070510111000249">I understand entirely the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) made. The experience from other parts of the country&#151;I include Greater Manchester in that, and the surgical centre in Trafford, which was one of the  <br>

early schemes and serves my constituency&#151;is that questions will be asked in the early days of any ISTC, as the local health economy gets used to working witha new provider in the locality. However, as time progresses those issues are addressed and there is better integration between the NHS locally and the ISTC. The figure that I have for utilisation of the ISTC to which my hon. Friend referred is 75 per cent. for April and May this year, showing some progress from the figures that she quoted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para38"><a name="070510111000250">My right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley referred to training and the quality of the data. I shall come to those issues in the meat of my remarks. He also asked about the size of phase 2, which I shall address, too. However, I want first to address the issue of value for money, which a number of hon. Members raised, including my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle in an intervention. It is important to remember that the NHS has always procured services from the independent sector. The difference now is that we are doing so rationally, within clear regulatory and financial frameworks, for the benefit of all of us who use the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="70510h0006.htm_para39"><a name="070510111000251">Historically, the NHS used the private sector to provide extra capacity, but on an ad hoc, spot purchase basis, often paying more than 40 per cent. above the cost of the same procedure as performed by itself. As the Committee&#146;s report rightly noted:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para0"><a name="070510111000252">As a Department, we would point to further evidence to back up that point. As Laing and Buisson, which provides independent analysis of the UK health care sector, noted in its 2005-06 report:</p>
<a name="70510h0007.htm_brev1"><a name="070510111000344"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The emergence of a new raft of ISTC providers able to quote at, or fairly close to, NHS reference costs made it clear that the days of NHS spot purchasing from the &#145;incumbents&#146; at 30-40 per cent. over reference costs were over, and that they would have to reduce costs and prices if they wished to be involved in a significant way in servicing the NHS market&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para1"><a name="070510111000253">For wave 1 schemes, the average cost above the equivalent NHS cost is 11.2 per cent., a figure with which hon. Members present will be familiar. The picture is developing, so I cannot give exact figures today, but we expect costs in wave 2 schemes to be below that, and in some cases significantly so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para2"><a name="070510111000254">My hon. Friend the Member for Pendle asked why that situation should be tolerated, and my hon. Friend the Member for City of York made a similar point. Self-evidently, there is a pretty straightforward comparison in those figures between the spot purchase costs and the costs being paid through the ISTC contract. Two further points are relevant. Additional capacity has been established, on a permanent basis and for the benefit of the NHS and its patients, which the NHS could not have made available as quickly as the ISTC programme did. There needs to be an element of certainty in that funding, which is why the contracts were constructed as they were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para3"><a name="070510111000255">My hon. Friend the Member for Pendle asked how that could be justified. In bringing in that extra capacity, it is important that we accept that the private sector faced additional costs, which other NHS providers would not have faced, by virtue of the conditions imposed on it in the procurement process.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 May 2007">

<notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2007 : Column 176WH</b><br>
For instance, the additionality clauses, to ensure that the capacity was genuinely new for the NHS, brought overseas recruitment costs and other processes that were more costly than if the capacity had simply been switched from one place in the UK to another. I could give other detailed reasons for those costs; for instance, new buildings had to be established. There were good reasons why the contracts needed to reflect the costs being incurred by the private sector in bringing extra new capacity to the NHS. That is the justification that we would give.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para4"><a name="070510111000256">In the long term, we are working towards ensuring that where the capacity goes is not centrally dictated. It will be patients who choose where they wish to be treated, and there will indeed be a level playing field in terms of how providers will be paid for using that capacity. In the current period, the initial stages of those contracts provide support so that the services can become established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para5"><a name="070510111000257">By systemising the process of buying independent sector services through bulk procurement, the ISTC programme has significantly cut the cost of doing business with the independent sector. Our aim is to move towards a level playing field, with all providers operating at NHS tariff or NHS equivalent costs, and being compared solely on quality and access, and that predominantly by patients. That is important as we move towards a free choice environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para6"><a name="070510111000258">Colleagues have asked about the second phase of procurement. I can report that it is progressing well and that the first providers from phase 2 are now delivering services. The Department has today agreed another phase 2 scheme, to which the hon. Member for Westbury referred, which will provide around 6,000 procedures a year in Cheshire and Merseyside, bringing more choice and accessibility in health services and further reducing waiting times. In total, phase 2 is expected to deliver up to 250,000 elective procedures and up to 1.5 million diagnostic assessments a year, and to create an independent sector extended choice network, contributing significantly towards meeting the 18-week target. The majority of services are expected to commence in 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para7"><a name="070510111000259">The hon. Gentleman asked about the shape of phase 2 schemes, as did my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley. The estimate is the figure that I have just given. The discussions with the independent sector are progressing and it is impossible to say now what the precise outcome will be. The call from the Committee and others has been for the contracts not to be simply imposed on local health economies and for there to be a process of dialogue and consultation at the local level, to ensure that the contracts are a good fit with capacity requirements. That is indeed the process that is under way in different parts of the country.</p>

 Why has the delay been so appallingly bad that the Nuffield group has pulled out of the west midlands mobile surgery scheme? That seems very serious, and it might put off other private sector partners. What is the Minister&#146;s justification for the situation?</p>

<p><a name="st_39"><a name="070510111000261"><a name="70510h0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="070510111000395"><b>Andy Burnham:</b>

<notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2007 : Column 177WH</b><br>
parties have worked together to reach a successful conclusion. Despite everyone&#146;s best efforts, it has not proved possible to finalise contracts. It was Nuffield&#146;s decision to withdraw its bid formally; it has decided not to pursue the opportunity any longer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para8"><a name="070510111000262">In every case, a contract between two parties is involved. Today, the hon. Gentleman has called on the Government to listen to the health service and the professionals in taking forward what are often complicated procurements. He is right to say that it is also important for me to be mindful of the costs and uncertainty that that can impose on those seeking to provide the services. We seek to get that balance right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para9"><a name="070510111000263">I point the hon. Gentleman to the Cheshire and Merseyside scheme, which was formally approved by the Treasury in recent weeks; other schemes in other parts of the country have also been approved, and we have worked to make that possible. We hear the call to consult and listen, as the hon. Member for Wyre Forest asked me to, but at the same time we want to move forward and, when we can, conclude the contract on the schemes. We are trying to get the balance right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para10"><a name="070510111000264">Many colleagues have talked about integration with the NHS. We continue to work in partnership with the local NHS to provide solutions that reflect and meet local needs. We have made a number of changes to ensure that phase 2 schemes can best be integrated with the local NHS. For example, the relaxation of additionality rules for the phase 2 ISTCs will bring about greater professional integration as clinical staff of whom there is not considered to be a shortage will have the opportunity to work in both local hospitals and ISTCs. That was a key request of the Committee, and I hope that the hon. Member for Southend, West is assured that there has been progress on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para11"><a name="070510111000265">Furthermore, all NHS employees will be able to work in ISTCs during their non-contracted hours. That will ensure that opportunities are available in ISTCs while skills for other parts of NHS services continue to be conserved. I hope that the hon. Member for Wyre Forest will welcome those moves. I know that he has long questioned the Government on the need for the additionality clauses. I hope he understands why they were important in phase 1 schemes, which were principally about the capacity on the ground to deliver on key targets such as the 18-week target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para12"><a name="070510111000266">It would have been self-defeating if capacity had simply been moved from one part of the British health care system to another. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will welcome the movement that there is now to relax those measures and provide more opportunities for British-based clinicians and staff to work in the ISTC sector.</p>

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="070510111000267"><a name="70510h0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="070510111000396"><b>Dr. Taylor:</b>
 I certainly welcome that relaxation. However, it still bothers me that the rules are not being relaxed enough for consultant orthopaedic specialists. As we heard from the hon. Member for Westbury(Dr. Murrison), there are likely to be unemployed trained NHS orthopaedic surgeons.</p>

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="070510111000268"><a name="70510h0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="070510111000397"><b>Andy Burnham:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman raises an important point, and of course we keep such matters under review. He is right to say that the relaxation does not extend to  <br>

shortage professions and specialties&#151;for obvious reasons; if it did, we would go back to the wave 1 problems that I described. Orthopaedic surgeons are not on the current phase 2 list of shortage professions, which should address the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para13"><a name="070510111000269">The specialties covered by the list include pathology, audiology, cardiology, sleep and respiratory physiology, categories of radiologists and radiography, neurophysiology, cardiac physiology and anaesthetics. The list, which is kept under review, is on the NHS employers&#146; website. I am sure that that would interest the hon. Gentleman, whom I also call my hon. Friend. He should be assured that the list is kept under review. Obviously, the changing nature of the UK labour market and the emerging training situation are relevant, and I hope that they will inform further consideration of the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para14"><a name="070510111000270">The hon. Member for Westbury asked whether the list was grade-specific or based on geography. The list is based on a sample survey of 25 trusts across the country. However, it is neither geography-specific nor grade-specific, except in the case of nurses; only senior nursing grades are on the shortage lists. As I said, the list is kept under review by the Department&#146;s work force team.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para15"><a name="070510111000271">I deal now with training, an important issue mentioned by many hon. Members today. We welcomed the Committee&#146;s support for the approach to training for phase 2 schemes. We recognise that the training of NHS staff within ISTCs is particularly important, and have taken action to ensure that local training of junior doctors is not compromised. In the second phase of ISTCs, all schemes will have activity available to postgraduate deans and higher education institutes for training purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para16"><a name="070510111000272">Independent providers will be expected to appoint directors of postgraduate training to work with the postgraduate medical education and training board and local deaneries to oversee training provision within ISTCs across a range of clinical professions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para17"><a name="070510111000273">Whether training takes place in an ISTC facility rather than the NHS will, of course, remain a decision for the postgraduate medical education and training board and deans who are responsible for the commissioning of training. Nevertheless, I hope that the move will be welcomed. NHS training in an ISTC setting will be directed and overseen, as it is now, in NHS settings. The higher education institutions, the royal colleges and the other bodies involved in facilitating and overseeing NHS training will retain their existing roles. In the longer term, it is intended that relationships be developed locally so that professional development occurs seamlessly across the local health economy partners, to the overall benefit of patient care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para18"><a name="070510111000274">Concerns about quality have been raised today, but I assure Members that patient safety is paramount in ISTCs, as in the NHS. I was pleased to note that the Committee commented on the alarmist tone of someof the criticisms of clinical standards in ISTCs. Efforts continue to be made to undermine confidence onthat issue, and they are not in the public interest.ISTC providers are contractually obliged to deliver clinically safe, high-quality care along agreed patient care pathways. ISTCs are monitored against 26 key performance indicators to ensure that quality services are delivered, including clinical quality, patient experience and productivity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para19"><a name="070510111000275">All ISTCs are regulated under statute by the Healthcare Commission and are further inspected on an ongoing basis. All surgeons working in ISTCs must be registered on the General Medical Council&#146;s specialist register before they perform surgery. As many hon. Members have mentioned, the chief medical officer has asked the Healthcare Commission to review the quality of care provided by ISTCs, and we look forward to receiving its report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para20"><a name="070510111000276">To update Members I should say that currently we expect to receive the report at the end of June. The delay is due to the fact that the commission wishes to use the most up-to-date data from ISTCs. To be honest, the problems have been with the IT system in drawing down the data required; I assure Members that they have not been due to any delays in information being provided by ISTCs. The report is due soon, and it will make an important contribution and ensure public confidence. The Committee rightly focused public attention on the matter, but I am confident that when the report is published it will further improve public confidence, although I am also sure that there will be issues to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para21"><a name="070510111000277">In the course of the debate, questions were raised about the evidence on whether ISTCs had improved innovation within the national health service and brought innovative practice to the UK. Let me give a specific example from the ISTC programme. At Shepton Mallet ISTC, the patient can see an orthopaedic surgeon, have diagnostic tests and book an operating slot all in one day, a process that would typically have taken months and at least three appointments in the past. That example has now been copied by Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, where managers say that the ISTC made their clinicians sit up and take notice. As a result, they too have established one-stop out-patient clinics for orthopaedic patients, reorganised the way in which they use their consultants&#146; time and slashed waiting lists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para22"><a name="070510111000278">Those new approaches have helped Somerset primary care trust and Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust radically to reduce waiting times, so much so that Yeovil is one of the trusts aiming to achieve the 18-week target from GP referral to operation by the end of the year, a year ahead of schedule. The introduction of the ISTC in Shepton Mallet has also driven down prices in the local private provider market. We believe that that is a concrete example of the ISTC programme having the desired effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para23"><a name="070510111000279">The hon. Member for Westbury raised a view from another side of the local health economy. I refer him to an article that appeared in the <i>Health Service Journal</i> on 29 March, by a consultant called Andy Mullins who concluded a quite robust defence of ISTCs with a telling point:</p>
<a name="70510h0007.htm_brev2"><a name="070510111000345"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The overall message is that independent sector involvement in the NHS is not threatening to the existing service unless it refuses to change. If the service responds and learns the efficiency and quality of the services will improve&#151;as we as a nation will still be able to afford them in the coming decades.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para24"><a name="070510111000280">That is a telling point from inside the NHS and a good endorsement of the ISTC programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para25"><a name="070510111000281">I want to do justice to some of the other points raised by hon. Members, but I realise that time is running out. First, I want to pick up on the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for City of York.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 May 2007">

<notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2007 : Column 180WH</b><br>
I understand his strength of feeling, particularly because of the pressures on his local economy. However, to refer back to the figures for NHS spot purchasing, his local health economy, like every other, is not only expected to meet but will meet the 18-week target by the end of next year. The level of activity commissioned has to be consistent. In the process of scrutinising the local delivery plans for his strategic health authority, the Department is considering that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para26"><a name="070510111000282">I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s frustration, but the Department has to get value for money across the country in conducting procurement exercises. That is why individual data that relate to any particular contract are not placed in the public domain. That would limit the Department&#146;s ability to get maximum value for money when conducting future procurement exercises.</p>

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="070510111000283"><a name="70510h0007.htm_spnew4"><a name="070510111000398"><b>Hugh Bayley:</b>
 Will the Minister explain why his ability to get value for money would be limited if we knew what the various centres cost?</p>

 If the figures for any one contract were placed in the public domain, that would limit the Department&#146;s ability openly to secure further contracts. It would create a yardstick against which further contract prices would be pitched. It is important to say that that was a wave 1 contract, which was conducted at a time when different considerations applied in terms of getting the service established and recognising the costs of establishing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para27"><a name="070510111000285">I will reconsider the issue. I understand that it is different for my hon. Friend and I am not seeking to be awkward and pull down the shutters. In a health economy under pressure where decisions are made about relative priorities, it is important that to help him to do his job as a Member of Parliament we provide as much information as we can. However, I hope that I have explained why the precise figures that he has asked for have not been given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para28"><a name="070510111000286">I want quickly to touch on a couple of points, but also to leave my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley a few minutes to close the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands raised questions about Burton ISTC, which I hope that we can address. She also raised questions about Stoke PCT and the value for money that it secures. In situations where an ISTC might be underutilised, I intend to work closely with the local health economy to ensure that measures are put in place to build up utilisation rates so that the full value of a contract can be realised over its lifetime, even though take-up may be slow at the beginning. We can do that. Evidence from elsewhere in the country supports the view that that is what happens over the lifetime of a contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="70510h0007.htm_para30"><a name="070510111000290">The ISTC programme has changed the nature of the relationship between the NHS and the private sector. No longer is the private sector trading off the back of what might be called the inadequacies of the NHS by telling people that they have no option but to go private. There is a better relationship that works for both parties and we combine efforts for the benefit of NHS patients and the country overall by providing a cost-effective health care system.</p>
